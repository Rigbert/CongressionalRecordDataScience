 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a heroic American, SPC Daryl Davis, a fellow Iowan originally from Spencer, IA. A member of the 144th Transportation Company of the Florida Army National Guard, Specialist Davis was killed November 29, 2004 when his Humvee was involved in an accident traveling between military camps in Iraq. Specialist Davis was serving as a gunner when the accident occurred. Daryl Davis graduated from Spencer High school and enlisted in the Iowa National Guard at age 17 before transferring to Florida earlier this year. Specialist Davis is survived by his mother and father, Dana Davis and Richard Rosado, as well as two brothers. I know that he will be deeply missed by his family and friends. My thoughts and prayers are with them.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate and my fellow Americans to join me in remembering Specialist Davis and the enormous sacrifice he made for his country. Many people thought very highly of Specialist Davis and he will always be remembered for his willingness to serve others. The United States owes its continued prosperity to Specialist Davis and others like him who are willing to advance our ideals at great personal cost. Daryl Davis will be remembered as a great patriot and it is fitting that we honor him today.                       Marine Sergeant Nick Nolte
