 President, today marks the publication date of a remarkable compilation of letters from a remarkable man, imprisoned Chinese political dissident Wei Jingsheng. His book, ``The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings,'' should be required reading for anyone who takes for granted the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Wei is currently serving 14 years for the crime of advocating democracy in a country where freedom of speech does not extend to criticism of government authorities.  An electrician by training, Wei lacks the formal education of some other famous 20th century champions of democracy and civil rights--Vaclav Havel, Andrei Sakharov, or Martin Luther King--but whatever he may lack in sophistication, he more than makes up for with his blunt eloquence.  Just days before the Chinese crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, Wei offered some candid advice for China's top leaders from his prison cell, urging them to ``take great strides to implement a democratic government as quickly as possible.'' A great tragedy might have been avoided if Beijing's gerontocracy had heeded Wei's call.  Wei was first imprisoned from 1979 to 1993 on charges of ``counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement,'' the result of his participation in the Democracy Wall Movement. During this brief flowering of officially authorized political dissent in China, Wei had the nerve to argue that China's modernization goals could not be met without democratic reform. For this affront, he was severely punished.  In 1993, on the eve of the International Olympic Committee's decision about whether to award the 2000 Olympics to Beijing, China briefly released Wei in an effort to strengthen its Olympic bid. On April 1, 1994, just days after meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, John Shattuck, Wei was detained once more.  He was subsequently sentenced to 14 years for trying to ``overthrow the Chinese Government.'' The actions cited as proof of Wei's ``counter-revolutionary'' intent included publishing articles critical of the government and raising funds for the victims of political persecution in China.  Wei has spent most of his last 18 years in solitary confinement, enduring a variety of physical and psychological hardships. He is now widely reported to be in very poor health, suffering from heart and back ailments that require urgent medical attention. Attention he is currently denied.  Today, I join with my colleagues to urge the Chinese Government to take all necessary steps to release Wei Jingsheng from prison on humanitarian grounds. Chinese authorities should ensure that Wei immediately receives the medical care he requires. Wei's imprisonment comes as a result of his peaceful advocacy of democracy and basic human rights. His words warrant our admiration, not a death sentence.                          ____________________
