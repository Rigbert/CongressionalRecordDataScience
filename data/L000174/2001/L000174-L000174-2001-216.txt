President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes. He did unbelievable work in this committee to pass out a money-laundering bill--a very complex and difficult subject. He did it unanimously, I believe, in a committee that probably has as diverse a membership--that is an understatement--as one might find. I compliment him and thank him for his kind words.  I reserve the remainder of my time. I see the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee here, who wishes to give his opening statement.
