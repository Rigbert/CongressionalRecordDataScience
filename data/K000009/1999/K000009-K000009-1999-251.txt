Speaker, I wish to extend my profoundest condolences to the Sisters of St. Francis and all of the friends of our dear, beloved Sr. Damien, upon her passing from this life into the next. Sister Mary Damien was a treasured friend and gifted educator in Toledo, Ohio. She was an absolute inspiration, a master craftswoman of teaching, a singularly focused and dedicated educator.  To watch Sr. Damien practice her craft was pure joy. She knew every trick to command the attention of students and to grade them on an infinite variety of skills she hoped they would come to master. I recall, as an adult, visiting her class at Central Catholic High School with a former classmate from Little Flower Grade School, which was attended when Sister Damien was our teacher and principal. As we observed her work with her Geometry students, we remembered and reveled in the moment. She was unrivaled in her trade.  She kept a black notebook on her desk, with the name of each student in it. As the months of the school year went by, there appeared thousands of crosshatches aside each student's name, indicating that student's performance on technical material as well as other measures of performance. Those notebooks were as detailed as the program for the Mars launch. She graded students for everything--from participation to effort to appearance. Though one could never be certain what all the categories were, every student knew there was always room for improvement. I can still hear her teaching students how to spell commonly misspelled words, and remember the distinction she drew between ``pupil'' and ``student'' as she tried to get young minds to grow. She had a unique ability to challenge her students to exercise ``the gray matter between the ears'' even as she never stopped using hers. She embodied a living metaphor for lifelong learning.  Sr. Damien always wore her habit, a most pious Sister of St. Francis. She never pushed religion, but she lived her vows every day. Her holiness and piety moved with her. I must also offer public gratitude to her for her abiding kindness to our family, through good times and those that were difficult. She was always there for us, and I am sure, for countless others. She lived for others, and it was a double joy to know her as we, her students, became adults and shared the wonderful gift of a lifespan together.  Sister Mary Damien was a stern task master, yet beloved by all of her students. We consider ourselves many times blessed to have known her and been helped to grow through her tutelage. What she selflessly gave to all of us--literally thousands of students who were fortunate to sit at her knee--is priceless. Her contributions to others will live through the people she helped to advance educationally and spiritually. What a legacy she has left as she served Christ and our Blessed Mother as a Sister of St. Francis.                          ____________________
