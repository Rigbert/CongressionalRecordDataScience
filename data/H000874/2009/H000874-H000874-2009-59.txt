There were public there, as a matter of fact. If the gentleman's contention is somehow this was walled off or there were people who were prohibiting people from being there in attendance at the rollout of America's health care bill, I was there. I saw nobody turned away. I saw nobody precluded from attending.  If the gentleman's contention is that every time he has a press conference he calls me up or somebody else up and says, By the way, I'm having a press conference, if you want to come by, come by, I will check my phone records and my e-mail and any other messages that I have, but the gentleman and I both know that doesn't happen.  We have been considering this bill for some period of time. I will go into that a little later. But I think the gentleman's contention that somehow he or any other Republican was precluded from being on the site at the foot of the Capitol steps is incorrect, and I reject it.
