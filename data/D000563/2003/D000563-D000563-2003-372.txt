Hon. Richard Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in support of raising      fuel economy standards. I am the President of ``Z'' Frank      Chevrolet. I've sold well over 1,000,000 vehicles. My family      has been selling and leasing cars and trucks in Chicago since      1936. Before entering the family business in 1976, I      graduated from George Washington University and then the      University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. I have      been a Chevrolet dealer since 1982 and since then have also      held franchises from Oldsmobile, Hyundai, Mazda, Subaru and      Volkswagen.       I know the car business, and I know that car companies can,      and must, do better for the sake of our country.       I call on you to support the three CAFE related amendments      that are expected to be offered--the Durbin amendment, the      Kerry/McCain amendment and the Feinstein/Snowe amendment.       I support these amendments because I know that cars, SUVs      and other light trucks consume 8 million barrels of oil every      day and account for 20 percent of U.S. global warming      emissions. At a time when energy security is a national      priority, raising fuel economy standards will cut the      country's dangerous dependence on oil, curb global warming,      and save consumers money at the gas pump. Raising fuel      economy standards is the best way to manage our energy future      and encourage automakers to implement technologies that      already exist.       How do I know that the auto companies can make vehicles      that go further on a gallon of gas? Because they're already      doing it with a small number of vehicles!       Existing fuel-saving technologies like more efficient      engines, smarter transmissions, and sleeker aerodynamics are      being put in some vehicles, but they could be in all. Already      this year, we have seen a host of announcements showing that      all kinds of vehicles can get better fuel economy using      existing technology. For instance:       General Motors announced that it will be putting      Displacement on Demand technology in 100,000 Chevy      Trailblazers and GMC Envoys, helping improve the fuel economy      of these large SUVs. Continuously Variable Transmissions are      also gaining in popularity.       Hybrid-electric drivetrains are also becoming available in      a range of vehicles. At this year's Detroit Auto Show, Ford,      General Motors, and Toyota all announced that they will have      hybrid gasoline-electric SUVs on the road within two years      that will get close to 40 miles per gallon.       Toyota already has a hybrid gasoline-electric car on the      road, the Prius, and plans on having SUVs and more hybrid      cars as well. The Chevrolet Malibu will have a hybrid version      by 2005.       J.D. Power and Associates has forecasted that sales of      hybrid-electric vehicles will reach 500,000 within five      years.       It is not easy for me to be at odds with the manufacturer I      represent. Selling Chevrolets has been very financially      beneficial for me and my family. But the fact is, they can      and must do better. They can build cars, trucks and SUVs that      are safe, affordable, and exciting to drive, while still      going further on a gallon of gas. It's in the best interest      of our country to raise the fuel economy standards of our      cars and light trucks. Please feel free to share this letter      with others. I hope it helps.           Sincerely,                                                 Charles E. Frank,                                 President, ``Z'' Frank Chevrolet.
