Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Lowey for the time, and I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen on his maiden voyage--not his first voyage, but his first as chair of the full committee--and the members of our fine subcommittee, and especially the staff.  I want to thank Chairman Simpson for his fine leadership and value the hard work that he put into this bill and his congeniality throughout the process.  I also want to thank our staff on both sides of the aisle for the many hours of hard work and dedication: Taunja Berquam on our side, Donna Shahbaz for the majority, and TJ Lowdermilk on my own staff.  I appreciate that the chairman has allowed robust funding to the Corps of Engineers, which translates into real jobs from coast to coast.                              {time}  1530  I also am pleased that this bill restores the more than $900 million that the administration proposed to cut from the science account and provides reasonable funding for energy-saving weatherization in both cold and hot climates across our Nation.  Unfortunately, the artificially low allocation has forced the chairman to make deep cuts to some of the mostimportant programs in the bill, most notably the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy.  Too many here in Washington have been fooled by the rhetoric that poses a false choice between the environment and the economy. But, today, 288,000 Americans work in auto industry supply chain jobs manufacturing the parts that make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. In addition, 360,000 people work in the solar industry. The single fastest growing job in America is wind turbine technician. An investment in clean energy is an investment in American jobs and our future.  The response of this bill?  An 83 percent cut from the Vehicle Technologies Office--now that is a backwards move;  A 60 percent cut to the Advanced Manufacturing Office--and this Member is unwilling to see that turn to the Chinese;  A 57 percent cut to solar energy--one of the fastest growing job sectors in our country;  A 65 percent cut to wind energy; and  ARPA-E, the most complex new energy technologies, zero; the program is eliminated.  These cuts cede the future to offshore competitors who are hacking into our intellectual property and the bank accounts of firms involved in these industries hundreds of times a month trying to coopt their energy technology that American taxpayers have helped to develop.  In an era where Wall Street chases short-term quarterly profits and ever-improving earnings reports, we owe it to our constituents and to our progeny to play the long game--making investments that may take decades to pay off, but they will. The longtime horizon in large initial capital investments of the energy sector for America means that, more than any other, path-breaking energy research needs Federal support until it becomes commercially viable because energy research is complex.  Though energy is an overlooked ingredient in economic supremacy, those nations that master its dimensions are leading in economic growth.  For decades, American Presidents have made statements targeting energy independence. That makes national security sense. But this year, that target is finally in sight. A recent Energy Information Administration report expects the United States to be a net energy exporter by 2026. The Department of Energy deserves great credit for bringing us to this point.  Beginning back in the old 1970s and eighties when this all got started, it took 30 years of Department of Energy support in concert with the private sector to unleash the fracking revolution that has helped change our world dramatically. Where was that technology developed? At the Department of Energy, and it didn't happen in a year or 2. It took years. The next revolution will be the clean energy revolution. We must not forfeit that game.  Finally, I would like to raise my concerns over the controversial riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill, but also our most precious resource: water. Exempting the repeal of the Clean Water Rule from the Administrative Procedure Act cedes far too much authority to the executive branch and is something that I cannot support.  For that reason, and for the draconian cuts to clean energy, I must urge my colleagues to oppose the Energy and Water portion of this spending package. When those concerns are rolled together with busting the spending caps and building an expensive border wall that doesn't keep us safe or solve our immigration needs, I believe that there is no excuse for any Democrat to support the overall bill before us.
