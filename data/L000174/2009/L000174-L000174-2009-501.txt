As the senior Senator from New Hampshire and I both said on the floor this afternoon, the omnibus bill already explicitly authorizes the use of foreign military financing assistance to Egypt for border security programs and activities in the Sinai. Senator Gregg and I put that language in to help them police the border and reduce the smuggling into Gaza. Egypt is cooperating with Israel and the United States to do this. If we were to pass this it would be seen in Egypt as though we do not acknowledge their cooperation, it would be seen as publicly shaming Egypt.  Senators can vote against the Kyl amendment and still be on record supporting additional funds to stop smuggling into Gaza. That is already in the omnibus bill. This is an unnecessary roiling of the waters. Both Senator Gregg and I said this afternoon that it should be opposed.  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
