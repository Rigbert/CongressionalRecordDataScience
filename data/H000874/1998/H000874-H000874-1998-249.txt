Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, let me read again the New York Times editorial: ``Newt Gingrich has selected today as the moment to line up his firing squad and kill campaign finance reform.'' It concludes by saying, ``It is a cynical maneuver.''  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us is another one of those cynical maneuvers. Let me tell the Members why. The gentleman from Florida got up and talked about all those campaign contributions. They were, in fact, illegal, should not have been accepted. They were returned. The Republican party has returned over $1 million, as well. They should not have been received. This bill will not affect any of those contributions. They were illegal at that time and are now.  What is this bill about? It was introduced some time ago. Then it was changed. Let me tell the Members what it was changed to. It added one line. It added the title: Illegal Foreign Contributions Act of 1998.                              {time}  2015  This is a 30-second ad. That is all it is. It is a 30-second cynical ad to pretend that this bill affects that poster. It does not, I say to the gentleman from Florida, because they were illegal from the beginning and should not have been accepted.  Soft money is made illegal by this bill. There is much support for that. Not for this bill, but much support for that objective. But the fact of the matter is, this bill is for one purpose only: For a press release that the Republicans can say they were against illegal foreign contributions, which of course they accepted and it was wrong. It was wrong. We did the same. It was wrong. But this bill is simply a PR effort. It has no substance to it.
