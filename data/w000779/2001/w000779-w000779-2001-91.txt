President, I am pleased to be joined today by my good friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, in introducing the Pacific Coast Commercial Fishery Preservation Act of 2001.  The West Coast groundfish fishery is in crisis, and many fishermen are facing bankruptcy. This legislation will help fishermen get through the crisis, and move the fishery toward a more sustainable future.  Sustainable management of this resource is long overdue and in January 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared the West Coast groundfish fishery a disaster. This bill will put the right number of fishers out there, at the right time, catching the right number of fish.  Catching the right number of fish should mean using the fish that are caught. Fish that are caught in excess of a fisher's trip limit are called ``regulatory discards'' or ``overages,'' and thousands of pounds of fish are wasted every year when they are thrown overboard. This bill authorizes fishermen to retain those extra fish and donate them to charitable organizations.  The right number of fishers is key to a sustainable fishery. There are currently too many fishers in the West Coast groundfish fishery to sustain the resource. This bill authorizes the Secretary to administer and implement acapacity reduction or ``buyback'' plan to ease the transition to the right number of fishers. In a survey distributed by the author of the buyback plan, 70 percent of recipients completed and returned their survey and a majority of them were interested in participating in the buyback program. A buyback plan has been developed by Oregonians, in consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and this bill incorporates key elements of it.  This is not a Federal handout. Half the funding will come from the industry and half from the Federal government. The industry portion will be a government-backed loan which will be repaid by the fishers who stay. The Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements in California, Washington and Oregon to collect the fees that will be used to repay the industry portion of the buyback fund.  Another way we seek to ease the transition away from fishing is through reform of the Capital Construction Fund. Currently, the fund allows fishers to put pre-tax funds aside for the construction of a new boat, or for upgrading their old one. It was effective in building America's fishing fleets, but in these days of dwindling stocks and fisheries disasters it is crucial that the fisheries have an alternative use for their money, such as retirement. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act and the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently trapped in the Capital Construction Fund to be rolled over into a retirement account without adverse consequences to either taxpayers or the account holders.  Ultimately, sustainable fisheries are a result of government regulation and management. When federal management fails, the government has a responsibility to help fishers and their families in a timely fashion. It has taken 18 months for the recent fishery disaster funding to hit Oregon. When you are an out-of-work groundfisher, 18 months is way too long to wait. This bill requires the Secretary of Commerce to recommend legislative or administrative changes to the existing law that would enable disaster funding to reach fishers more expeditiously.  This plan is supported by the West Coast Seafood Processors, the Fishermen's Marketing Association, the Pacific Federation of Fishermen, the Pacific Conservation Council, and the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 973       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Pacific Coast Groundfish      Fishery Preservation Act''.     SEC. 2 PILOT PROJECT FOR CHARITABLE DONATION OF BYCATCH.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate a      pilot project under which fishermen in a commercial fishery      covered by the West Coast groundfish fishery are permitted to      donate bycatch, or regulatory discards, of fish to charitable      organizations rather than discard them. The pilot project      shall incorporate a means, through the requirement of on-     vessel observers or other safeguards, of ensuring that the      opportunity to donate such fish does not encourage or permit      the evasion of pre-vessel trip limits, total allowable catch      limits, or other fishery management plan measures.       (b) Reports.--       (1) Initiation.--The Secretary shall notify the Senate      Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, within 90      days after the date of enactment of this Act and before the      pilot project is implemented, of--       (A) the fishing season in which the pilot project will be      conducted; and       (B) the period during which the pilot project will be      conducted.       (2) Follow-up.--Within 90 days after the pilot project      terminates the Secretary shall submit to the Committee a      report containing findings with respect to the pilot project      and the Secretary's analysis of the ramifications of the      pilot project based on those findings.     SEC. 3. REPORT ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR PACIFIC COAST                    GROUNDFISH FISHERY.       The Secretary shall report to the Senate Committee on      Commerce, Science, and Transportation no later than 45 days      after the date of enactment of this Act the action or actions      taken under section 312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)) to      provide disaster relief to fishing communities affected by      the commercial fishery failure in the Pacific Coast      groundfish fishery. The Secretary shall include in the report      any recommendations the Secretary deems appropriate for      additional legislation or changes in existing law that would      enable the Department of Commerce to respond more      expeditiously in the future to fisheries disasters resulting      from commercial fishery failures.     SEC. 4. CAPACITY REDUCTION IN THE PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH                    FISHERY.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall, after      notice and an opportunity for public comment, adopt      regulations to implement a fishing capacity reduction plan      for the Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery under section 312(b)      of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and      Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(b)) that--       (1) has been developed in consultation with affected      parties whose participation in the plan is required for its      successful implementation;       (2) will obtain the maximum sustained reduction in fishing      capacity at the least cost through the use of a reverse      auction process in which vessels and permits are purchased;       (3) will not expand the size or scope of the commercial      fishery failure in that fishery or into other fisheries or      other geographic regions;       (4) except as otherwise specifically provided in this      section, meets the requirements of that section; and       (5) incorporates the components described in subsection (c)      of this section.       (b) Expedited Adoption of Plan.--In carrying out subsection      (a), the Secretary--       (1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register within 30      days after the date of enactment of this Act of      implementation of the fishing capacity reduction plan;       (2) provide for public comment for a period of 60 days      after publication; and       (3) adopt final regulations to implement the plan within 45      days after the close of the public comment period under      paragraph (2).       (c) Plan Components.--The fishery capacity reduction plan      shall--       (1) provide for a significant reduction in the fishing      capacity in the Pacific Coast groundfish fisheries;       (2) permanently revoke all State and Federal fishery      licenses, fishery permits, area and species endorsements, and      any other fishery privileges for West Coast groundfish,      Pacific pink shrimp, Dungeness crab, and Pacific salmon      (troll permits only) issued to a vessel or vessels (or to      persons on the basis of their operation or ownership of that      vessel or vessels) for which a Pacific Coast groundfish      fisheries reduction permit is issued under section      600.1011(b) of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations;       (3) ensure that the Secretary of Transportation is notified      of each vessel for which a reduction permit is surrendered      and revoked under the program, with a request that such      Secretary permanently revoke the fishery endorsement of each      such vessel and refuse permission to transfer any such vessel      to a foreign flag under subsection (f) of this section;       (4) ensure that vessels removed from the Pacific Coast      groundfish fisheries under the program are made permanently      ineligible to participate in any fishery worldwide, and that      the owners of such vessels contractually agree that such      vessels will operate only under the United States flag or be      scrapped as a reduction vessel pursuant to section      600.1011(c) of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations;       (5) ensure that vessels removed from the Pacific Coast      groundfish fisheries, the owners of such vessels, and the      holders of fishery permits for such vessels forever      relinquish any claim associated with such vessel, permits,      and any catch history associated with such vessel or permits      that could qualify such vessel, vessel owner, or permit      holder for any present or future limited access system      fishing permits in the United States fisheries based on such      vessel, permits, or catch history; and       (6) notwithstanding section 1111(b) of the Merchant Marine      Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C.

App. 1279f and 1279g).       (e) Industry Fees.--       (1) In general.--As part of the fishery capacity reduction      plan, the Secretary shall establish an industry fee system      under section 312(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery      Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(d)) to      generate revenue to repay the loan provided under subsection      (d)(2).       (2) Allocation of fees.--The Secretary shall allocate the      fees payable under the industry fee system among--       (A) holders of Pacific Coast groundfish permits,       (B) holders of Washington, Oregon, and California pink      shrimp fishing permits,       (C) holders of Washington, Oregon, and California salmon      trolling permits, and       (D) holders of Washington, Oregon, and California Dungeness      crab fishing permits,     so that the percentage of the revenue generated by the fee      system from holders of each kind of permit will correspond to      the percentage of the total amount paid under buyback program      for that kind of permit.       (f) Duties of Secretary of Transportation.--       (1) The Secretary of Transportation shall, upon      notification and request by the Secretary, for each vessel      identified in such notification and request--       (A) permanently revoke any fishery endorsement issued to      such vessel under section 12108 of title 46, United States      Code; and       (B) refuse to grant the approval required under section      9(c)(2) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C.

(2) The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for      public comment, adopt final regulations not later than 6      months after the date of enactment of this Act, to prohibit      any vessel for which a reduction permit is surrendered and      revoked under the fishing capacity reduction program required      by this section from engaging in fishing activities on the      high seas or under the jurisdiction of any foreign country      while operating under the United States flag.       (g) Regulatory Flexibility.--Any requirements of the      Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or      any Executive order that would, in the opinion of the      Secretary, prevent the Secretary from meeting the deadlines      set forth in this section shall not apply to the fishing      capacity reduction program or the promulgation of regulations      to implement such program required by this section.     SEC. 5. COLLECTION OF INDUSTRY FEES.       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall enter into an      agreement with the States of California, Oregon, and      Washington to collect program fees paid under the system      established under section 4(e).       (b) Withholding Fee From Purchase Price.--The fee for each      vessel required to pay a program fee under that system shall      be deducted by the first ex-vessel fish purchaser from the      proceeds otherwise payable to the seller and forwarded to the      appropriate State at the same time and in the same manner as      other fees or taxes are forwarded to that State.       (c) State To Collect and Forward Fees.--Upon receipt of      program fees forwarded by fish purchasers under subsection      (b), the State shall forward the fees to the Secretary in the      manner provided for in the agreement established under      subsection (a).       (d) Fish-Processing Vessels Treated as Purchasers.--A      vessel which--       (1) both harvests and processes fish; or       (2) receives fish from a harvesting vessel and processes      that fish on board, shall be considered to be the first ex-     vessel fish purchaser with respect to the fish processed      on the vessel and shall forward the appropriate fees to      the appropriate State at the same time and in the same      manner as other fees or taxes are forwarded to that State.
