 The point is that medical costs are going up substantially more than inflation. In fact, general inflation is actually going down. There is no question but that as medical inflation continues to remain high, millions and millions more workers are going to be forced to pay this tax. One of the other side effects of this tax is that many employers, in order to avoid it, are going to start cutting the health care benefits that workers receive. Today it may be dental; tomorrow it will be vision. The next day it will be more copayments, more deductibles. This is grossly unfair to working families.
