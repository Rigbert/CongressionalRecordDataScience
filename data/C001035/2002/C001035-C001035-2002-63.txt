If we do not act, if we do not act within the next few weeks, States will have no choice but to slash their Medicaid Programs, thus depriving our needy low-income families of the health care they depend on. They will be forced to cut education programs for K-12 and for State universities. They will be forced to make choices that will cause real harm to the citizens of this country.  They have no other option. Unlike the Federal Government, they cannot temporarily run a deficit. Forty-nine States are required to balance their budgets so they will have no choice, given that the fiscal year for most States is going to begin on July 1, but to make Draconian cuts in the programs that serve the most needy members of our society.  We need to act as their partners. We need to provide them with help to get over this difficult period.  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his excellent question.
