 President, in fairness to the Members, I think it is better to have a time certain for the first vote.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that vote occur on or in relation to the McCain amendment no later than 10 a.m., Thursday, and that the time between 9:30 and 10 a.m., be equally divided in the usual form.
