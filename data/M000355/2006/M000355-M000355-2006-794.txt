 President, I congratulate my good friend from West Virginia on his extraordinary reminiscence of his remarkable wife of 68, almost 69 years. I think those of us in the Senate are well aware that the marriage of Robert and Erma Byrd was one of the great marriages of American history. No two people were ever more right for each other, ever more committed to each other, or provided a better example for our country than Senator and Mrs. Byrd.
