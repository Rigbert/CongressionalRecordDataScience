Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of the District of Columbia several questions.  The appropriations bill for the District of Columbia was to be submitted to the President for signature by October 1 so that the ordinary operations of the D.C. Government could continue. Can the gentleman from New York tell me when that appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996 was submitted to the President?
