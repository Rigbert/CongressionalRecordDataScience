 President, the bombings in Atlanta over the past 2 months--the second of which occurred last weekend--have marked the opening of yet another unfortunate new chapter in the escalation of domestic terrorism.  While the magnitude of these attacks were far less than the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, they were noteworthy for the pernicious technique this criminal--or criminal organization--used:  First, the terrorists attracted police, firefighters, and rescue workers to the scene by detonating one bomb,  And then, with the unmistakable intent to injure the public safety officers responding to the first explosion, detonated a second explosive device in the parking lot outside the location of the first bombing.  According to the experts, this tactic is one imported from the hotbed of terrorist activity--the Middle East.  On two occasions last year, follow-on bombs were detonated in Southern Lebanon. One almost killed Israel's northern commander--Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine.  Then this January, only 6 days before the Atlanta abortion clinic bombing, two bombs were detonated only 10 minutes apart near a bus station in Tel Aviv. Thirteen people were injured, including one police officer who came to the scene in response to the first bomb and was wounded by the second.  Last month in Atlanta, the first bomb injured no one, but the ``follow-on'' bomb wounded seven people, including two FBI agents, one ATF agent, and two local firefighters. Experts have stated that many more rescue workers would have been injured had the force of the second blast not been deflected by a car, which just happened to be parked in the right spot.  Five people were injured by the bomb that exploded in an Atlanta restaurant last Friday, but fortunately, the police found the second bomb and detonated it with a remote-controlled robot.  Of course, all terrorist acts are horrific. But this follow-on bombing tacticis especially henious because the technique is designed to do one thing-- kill the police, firefighters, paramedics, and all the other professionals who unhesitatingly rush to the scene of a bombing to provide aid to the wounded.  Mark my words: now that this tactic has been employed in Atlanta, covered by the national media, and probably communicated across the country through the Internet, some other devious, sick, individual, somewhere in the United States, will do it again. Mark my words.  I believe that those who employ tactics aimed exclusively at injuring the police, firefighters, and other public safety officers should be punished above and beyond whatever punishment they would receive for destroying property or causing injury.  That is why today I am introducing the Police and Rescue Squad Protection Act.  The bill will increase the punishment for anyone who plants a follow-on bomb with the intent to injure public safety officers. And it clearly states that anyone who detonates, or attempts to detonate one bomb right after another bomb in the same location is acting with the criminal intent to injure law enforcement and emergency medical officials.  In my view, this legislation will send a strong message that we will not tolerate the grotesque tactics that we've seen in the streets of Tel Aviv, and now, in Atlanta.  More importantly, this legislation honors those who, without fear or hesitation, put themselves in jeopardy at a time of crisis.  If this bill deters one terrorist from planting a follow-on bomb and saves the life of one police officer, firefighter, ambulance driver, or paramedic that rushes to the scene of a crime, then it will have been well worth the energy expended to enact it.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.                                 F_____                                       By
