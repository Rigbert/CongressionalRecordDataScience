President, few weeks pass when there is not a report of an appalling atrocity in Algeria. The testimony of eyewitnesses echo the same refrain--a tale of slaughter, decapitation, mutilation, burning, and shooting of innocent men, women, and children. Thousands of civilians have fled their homes as the violence has escalated, but the protection and safety they seek is difficult, if not impossible to find.  The reaction of the international community has not been one of outrage and alarm, but a quiet, almost uneasy expression of concern. It is almost as though the reports are too grisly, too horrific to even broach--as though by addressing the subject and opening it up to scrutiny, one will somehow be tainted by the extreme levels of violence and degradation. However, the subject must be addressed and a credible investigation must be carried out.  Time and again around the world, we have seen the needless suffering that occurs when governments and the world community as a whole are too slow to shoulder their mantle of moral responsibility. The crisis in Algeria presents another opportunity to change this pattern and set a new standard for the next century.  Mr. President, on January 26, 1998, fifteen Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, Senators and Representatives, sent a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the tragic situation in Algeria. I ask that the text of the letter be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                               Washington, DC,                                                 January 26, 1998.     Hon. Madeleine Albright,     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Secretary: We are writing to express our alarm      concerning the recent massacres in Algeria, which have      brought the toll of those killed in the five-year civil war      to an estimated 80,000 persons, mostly civilians. The      Algerian Government has consistently failed to adequately      investigate the atrocities and bring those responsible to      justice. The administration's call for an international      inquiry is an appropriate and necessary first step in      responding to this crisis.       Since the civil war erupted in 1992, extremist opposition      groups have increased their attacks on innocent people. The      tactics of these groups rank among the most inhumane seen      anywhere. While their conduct should be strongly condemned,      there are persistent reports that Algerian security forces      have failed to stop or prevent the massacres or to arrest      those involved. Eyewitnesses to the violence report that      terrorist groups have operated in collusion with, and under      the     protection of, units or factions of the army, police, and      state-armed militias. According to human rights monitors, no      one has been arrested by Algerian authorities in connection      with a series of bloody attacks that occurred in August and      September leaving hundreds of civilians dead. Algerian      authorities have made no effort to explain why army and      police garrisons located nearby failed to intervene. Since      then, the frequency and brutality of the attacks have only      increased--over 1,000 Algerian civilians have reportedly been      killed in the last month alone.       Little progress was made during a January 20, 1998      diplomatic mission led by British Minister of State for      Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Derek Fatchett.      Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has reportedly denounced      international expressions of concern about possible official      complicity in the killings. In addition, the ability of human      rights organizations and the media to look into allegations      of abuses has been increasingly limited by the Algerian      Government and details about armed attacks are often      censored.       We believe it is essential that the administration take an      active and visible role in ensuring that an international      investigation occurs in an expedient and effective manner      with the necessary political and logistical support. We urge      the administration to sponsor a resolution calling for such      an inquiry to ascertain the facts and make recommendations at      the March 1998 meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in      Geneva. We further urge that the administration send a clear      message of support for this initiative in public as well as      in diplomatic contacts with Algeria and other governments.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,         Patrick Leahy, Senator; Sam Brownback, Senator; Paul D.            Wellstone, Senator; Nancy Pelosi, Representative;            Robert Torricelli, Senator; Edward Kennedy, Senator;            Frank R. Lautenberg, Senator; Tom Lantos,            Representative; Chris Smith, Representative; Robert            Wexler, Representative; James M. Jeffords, Senator,            Dianne Feinstein, Senator; Dick Durbin, Senator;            Russell Feingold, Senator; Tom Harkin, Senator.                          ____________________
