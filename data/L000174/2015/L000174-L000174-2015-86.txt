President, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last time that I speak in this Chamber about the Iran nuclear agreement. I listened to some of the hearings on this subject in both the House and the Senate, last week, and I want to provide a bit of my perspective on the challenge before us.  I was a law student in Washington during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. My wife and I were living probably 2 miles from the White House, and we were paying very close attention to what might happen. Afterward, as more of the history came out, we realized that some of President Kennedy's top advisers and Members of Congress pushed for a military attack on Cuba--actually, a military attack against the then-Soviet Union. A war between the two nuclear superpowers would have at the very least risked the annihilation of both countries. Fortunately, President Kennedy had the thoughtfulness, patience, and fortitude to resist the pressure to go to war.  It is not easy to stick with the long road of tough negotiations when many are clamoring for a military solution rather than negotiations. It is the same today as it was back in the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Today we are considering an agreement at the end of such negotiations between the United States and our allies, and Russia, China, and Iran to curb an illicit nuclear program that threatens the Middle East and the world.  I know from my conversations with the President and with Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz how difficult this was. I also know from my conversations with them that they were prepared to walk away rather than settle for a bad deal. But based on what I have heard so far, this is not a bad deal.  There are aspects of the agreement that I and others have legitimate questions about, but we already know a lot about it.  We know that prior to negotiations, Iran's nuclear program was hurtling forward despite multinational sanctions.  I remember back in September of 2012, I had been named the Senate delegate to the U.N., and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke. He warned that Iran was within months--months--of producing a nuclear bomb. Well, whether or not that was accurate then, it certainly is not accurate if this agreement is implemented.  We know negotiations succeeded in freezing Iran's nuclear development in place, and now we have an agreement to roll back Iran's program.  We know that this is the most rigorous monitoring and inspection regimen ever included in a nonproliferation agreement. Actually, I think it is a lot more rigorous than many observers predicted it would be.  We know that without this deal, the monitoring and the onsite inspections would go away, and so would support for the international sanctions we painstakingly built. Remember, it took years for us to put together a coalition of other countries to impose the sanctions. Many of them did so at great economic cost to their own economies, but they stuck with us because they thought we would negotiate in good faith and that diplomacy could succeed. If we walk away now, many of these countries are going to say: OK, you are in this by yourself. The United States can impose sanctions, but they will be nowhere near as effective as they were when we joined you.  We know that the sanctions reprieve in this agreement is limited and reversible. It is structured so that many sanctions remain in place, sanctions in which other countries have joined us. If Iran fails to meet its commitments, we and our partners can revoke the limited relief and we can impose additional sanctions.  Some criticized this agreement within minutes of the agreement being announced. They are long on scorn, but they are short on alternatives.  Again, I remember that speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu years ago when he warned that Iran was just months away from building a nuclear weapon. Today, people are expressing concern about what may happen 15 years from now, not a few months from now. They ignore the fact that if Congress rejects this agreement, Iran can immediately resume its development of highly enriched uranium. Iran can build a nuclear weapon in far less than 15 years. I would ask, is that the alternative they support?  Or is it another war in the Middle East, which our senior military leaders say could spiral out of control and at best would delay the resumption of Iran's nuclear weapons programs by 2 to 3 years, after which it would not be subject to international inspections?  Some of the most vociferous critics of this agreement reflexively supported sending American troops to overthrow Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. We did this after having hearings and meetings in which the Vice President of the United States implied that Iraq was involved in the attack on 9/11 and made it very clear that they had weapons of mass destruction.  I voted against that war because I read the intelligence files, and they were very clear that there was no credible evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and it was very clear that they had nothing to do with 9/11. That colossal mistake killed or maimed thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, and by now has cost more than $2 trillion and the meter is still running--$2 trillion. It is the first time in this Nation's history when we went to war on a credit card; we didn't enact a tax to pay for it. Even unpopular wars, like Vietnam and Korea, were paid for.  Is it the critics' alternative to reject this agreement and then somehow convince the other parties to it--Russia, China, and the rest of the P5+1--to impose even stronger multilateral sanctions? Have they bothered to ask officials in any of those governments what the chances of that would be? Certainly the statements those officials have made make it very clear that those chances--to use a precise expression--are zilch.  I am as outraged as anyone by Iran's support of terrorism, its arbitrary arrests and imprisonment of Americans, its denial of due process, its use of torture and other violations of human rights, and its summary executions of political opponents, just as I object to similar abuses by many countries we deal with every day.  But as horrific as Iran's behavior is, it pales compared to the havoc Iran could wreak if it obtains a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran could commit acts of terrorism that dwarf by thousands or even millions of times over those it engages in today. There is simply no comparison.  A workable agreement doesn't just buy more time, it can also buy more opportunities. In Iran, the impetus for reforming its hostile and destabilizing foreign policy comes from the Iranian people. For decades, the Iranian middle class has been smothered--first by a revolution that crushed their aspirations and then by a regime that imposed the harsh consequences of its own criminal behavior on the Iranian population.  Ordinary Iranians overwhelmingly do not want an empire; they want more economic opportunities, freedom of expression, and to reengage peacefully with the world. With this agreement, the Iranian middle class can continue to be a factor in future negotiations.  It is well understood that in the Congress, we agree or disagree, we debate, and we vote. That is one of the reasons I wanted to be a Member of this body. Ideally, we do so in a manner that reflects the respect each of us owes to this institution. For a nation of over 300 million Americans, there are only 100 of us who have the privilege at any given time to serve in this body. We are but transitory occupants of the seats the voters have afforded us the opportunity to occupy. In carrying out our responsibilities, we should do our best to live up to the standards of those who created what we take pride in calling the world's oldest democracy.  I mention this because, as I said earlier, I listened to portions of the hearings in the various House and Senate committees on the Iran nuclear agreement at which the Secretaries of State and Energy testified. Presumably, they were asked to testify because the members of those committees had questions and concerns about those agreements and wanted to hear the witnesses' responses. However, rather than a respectful, substantive exchange, what has too frequently occurred has been an embarrassing display of political theater.  What we have heard is a series of speeches often containing assertions or accusations that are either contradicted by the actual words of the agreement or without factual basis, and then they are followed by questions the witnesses were unable to answer because when they tried, they were interrupted or told the time had expired.  Many Vermonters have talked to me about those hearings. They were often embarrassing to watch, and they did a disservice to the American people who deserve to know that their representatives are engaged in a substantive, in-depth exchange of views on the hugely important issue of how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  I have questions myself because, short of unilateral surrender by one party, every agreement involves compromise. That is as true for international diplomacy as it is for the Senate. Neither side gets everything it wants. Anyone who suggests that was a possible outcome here is fooling themselves or, even worse, deceiving the voters who sent them here.  The President has been unwavering in his insistence that the goal of this agreement is to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I commend him for his vision and resolve. I have spoken with him at length about this.  I will say to my colleagues what I said to the President. It is now up to Congress to carry out its oversight responsibility. We can strive to make this work, keeping in mind the vital national security interests at stake for our country and for our allies, or we can impulsively sabotage this chance.  But we should engage in this process in a manner that enhances the image of the U.S. Senate and that affords those in our government who spent years forging this agreement the respect and appreciation they deserve.  Mr. President, there have been many thoughtful articles and opinion pieces written about the Iran nuclear agreement. I am sure there will be many more. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record one of those articles, authored jointly by Eric Schwartz and Brian Atwood, two former Assistant Secretaries of State.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [Commentary, July 30, 2015]                Cheerleaders for War Are Still so Wrong      congress needs to ``practice history'' and ok the agreement.                  (By Eric Schwartz and Brian Atwood)       In ``Practicing History,'' historian Barbara Tuchman      observed that there are ``two ways of applying past      experience: One is to enable us to avoid past mistakes and to      manage better in similar circumstances next time; the     other is to enable us to anticipate a future course of      events.''       Tuchman would find it strange today that many of the      loudest opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement are the same      prominent individuals and organizations who unequivocally      supported the most significant national security blunder by      the U.S. in recent memory, the war of choice in Iraq.       As evidence has accumulated since the failure to find      weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the price of that      foreign policy engagement has become obvious to most. The      cost to the U.S. includes trillions of dollars lost to future      generations of Americans, tens of thousands killed or      injured, the opening of a Sunni-Shia Pandora's box of      sectarian strife, the ascendance of Iran and the diminished      influence of the U.S. in the Middle East.       Remarkably, there are still unrepentant cheerleaders for      that war, as well as those who argue that the U.S. invasion      was a good idea in principle that was just executed poorly.      And they are among the most influential voices opposed to the      agreement with Iran.       Why does it matter that the pundits who were so convinced      about invading Iraq more than a decade ago now pursue with      passionate certainty the defeat of the diplomatic effort      involving Iran?       It matters because, then and now, these voices suffer from      a greatly exaggerated view of the ability of the U.S. to      unilaterally dictate geopolitical outcomes that we desire. In      the case of Iraq, this was perhaps best expressed by former      Vice President Dick Cheney who, when pressed before the war      on our capacity to remake Iraqi society, argued that we would      be ``greeted as liberators.'' Of course, the experience in      Iraq, the resulting ascendance of Iran and reduced U.S.      influence in the region have only further diminished our      capacity to act without the support of others and have      underscored the importance of smart power--diplomacy backed      with all of the resources at our disposal to achieve our      objectives.       The nuclear agreement, now endorsed unanimously by the      United Nations Security Council, is long and complex, and it      is presumed that Congress will study carefully the details.      Are the verification provisions adequate and does the      International Atomic Energy Agency have the resources to      monitor compliance? What is the process by which sanctions      could be reimposed if violations occur? Are all paths to a      nuclear bomb blocked? What are the alternatives to this      approach and are they acceptable to the American people?       Our expectation is that a serious examination of this      agreement should win over a bipartisan majority. The      agreement's substantial reductions in uranium stockpiles and      installed centrifuges, robust inspection regime and      dramatically diminished capacity for an Iranian breakout and      ``race to a bomb'' provide unprecedented means to ensure Iran      will meet its stated commitment to never build a nuclear      weapon.       But these elements will not win over those with an      unrealistic view of the capacity of the U.S. to play the Lone      Ranger in international politics. And while opponents say      they support diplomacy, the so-called alternatives they would      prefer--like pressing for a harder line on sanctions relief--     would put us at odds with our allies, be rejected by Iran and      increase the risks of another war in the Middle East that      would be tragic for both the U.S. and for Israel.       The nuclear agreement will of course pose challenges for      U.S. policymakers, as sanctions relief will provide benefits      to Iran and opportunities to make mischief in the region. But      through our continued presence, support of regional friends      and allies, and an enforceable nuclear agreement, we have the      strongest capacity to manage such challenges effectively.       Americans must hope that Congress will be preoccupied with      the substance of the Iran agreement and the poor alternatives      to it, and not be influenced by voices of the past that cling      to dangerous views about our prospects as a go-it-alone      superpower. Congress should ``practice history'' and      recognize that this agreement has the potential to interrupt      the downward spiral in the region, from conventional war and      terrorism to nuclear conflict.       Forcing the president to veto a rejection resolution would      reflect badly on the Congress and the United States of      America. Even worse, overriding a presidential veto would      have grave implications for the U.S., for Israel and for the      region for many years to come.
