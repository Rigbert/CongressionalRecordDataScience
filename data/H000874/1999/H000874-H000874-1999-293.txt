Speaker, I thank my very good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for yielding me this time. I want to thank also the gentleman from New Jersey (Chairman Smith) for his graciously asking for additional time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 28 and urge my colleagues to do the same. We must make it clear to the government of China that it will not be business as usual with the United States if they continue to abuse their own citizens. Some of us frankly have been voting that way consistently on MFN.  The government of China rhetorically recognizes the universal declaration of human rights and, indeed, its own constitution and laws provide for fundamental rights. That is, of course, on paper. Obviously, and tragically, these laws are honored more in the breach than in the practice. In fact, according to the recently released StateDepartment Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China, the situation has substantially deteriorated since President Clinton's visit in July of last year.  Beginning in the fall, dozens of political activists were arrested for attempts to register a political party and engage in other political activities which we believe to be fundamental to the rights of individuals.  Over 30 members and supporters of the China Democracy Party were detained, and three of its leaders were sentenced to lengthy jail terms in closed trials that flagrantly violated due process.  The State Department report also reveals that the government of China continues to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners, forced concessions, and arbitrary arrests and detention.  At a minimum, Mr. Speaker, our government should take the steps called for by H. Con. Res. 28 and formally rebuke the government of China before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  Mr. Speaker, the Statute of Liberty stands at the gateway of America and says, ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me.'' Millions have come seeking freedom, seeking justice, seeking fundamental human rights.                              {time}  1430  Mr. Speaker, we know that America cannot take all of the homeless, all of those tossed by tempest within our borders. But what we can do, and what we must do, as the leader not just of the free world but as the leader of the world committed fundamentally to human rights, we need to speak up, speak out, and act upon our principles, and make it clear to the rest of the world that we will not do business as usual with those who undermine human rights in this world.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I urge strong support of this resolution.
