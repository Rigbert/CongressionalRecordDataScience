 President, do you know what, so many of you stayed around. I do not know how many times I have heard of other Senators having voted 10,000 or 12,000 times and I probably did not stay around, and I probably have not earned what you have said about me because I did not pay that much attention to the rest of you who have gone before. So let me apologize for that, and I will bet next time I will stay around.  So I am not flying under false colors, I would like to say a couple things. One person spoke about my being a farmer, and that is absolutely right. I am. But I can tell you this, that when you get a 25-year-old grandson, grandfathers are not as important in the farming operation as you would like to be. So I consider myself now more of a hired man for Robin Grassley and Pat Grassley than I am a family farmer. But I still am a crop sharer with my son, and I market my own crops, and I am there to help put the crop in when they need me--and wish they needed me more--and help get the crop out, and wish they needed me more. So I do appreciate that.  As much as I would like to be called Dr. Grassley--you can get that impression maybe because I did do 2 years of graduate work beyond my master's degree, but I did not quite finish it because I was elected to the State legislature and I never went back to the University of Iowa to finish it, and I kind of regret that. But I did not get back.
