 President, I took the floor last night to speak about the nomination of William Pryor and the unfortunate circumstances surrounding that nomination, and since that time certain of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to mischaracterize my statements and perpetuate the unfair and baseless charges I was trying to debunk.  I want to briefly correct the record on two of these mischaracterizations, because I believe very strongly that these types of wrongful allegations should not be allowed to stand.  First, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania stated that anyone who questioned Mr. Pryor's ``deeply held beliefs'' would be questioning his religious beliefs. Specifically, he said: I just suggest that it is obvious to anyone that this code word is an antireligious bias.  Senator Durbin attempted to correct the record immediately but was not allowed to do so until later. I appreciate his efforts in that regard, but I think I should also set the record straight myself.  First, what I said in my statement was clearly not a religious attack. I said, and I quote:       Many of us have concerns about nominees sent to the Senate      who feel so very strongly, and sometimes stridently, and      often intemperately about certain political beliefs and who      make intemperate statements about those beliefs. So we raise      questions about whether those nominees can be truly      impartial, particularly when the law conflicts with those      beliefs.  So Mr. President, I was very careful to raise this concern about deeply heldpolitical beliefs, not religious beliefs. And my concern is not just the beliefs themselves but the manner in which they are expressed. I have found that intemperate statements often accompany intemperate people.  Indeed, I went on to say that, and again I quote:       It is true that abortion rights can often be at the center      of these questions. As a result, accusations have been      leveled that any time reproductive choice becomes an issue,      it acts as a litmus test against those whose religion causes      them to be anti-choice. But pro-choice Democrats on this      committee have voted for many nominees who are anti-choice      and who believe that abortion should be illegal, some of whom      may even have been Catholic. I do not know because I have      never inquired.       So this truly is not about religion. This is about      confirming judges who can be impartial and fair in the      administration of justice. I think when a nominee such as      William Pryor makes inflammatory statements and evidences      such strongly held beliefs on a whole variety of core issues,      it is hard for many of us to accept that he can set aside      those beliefs and act as an impartial judge--particularly      because he is very young, 41; particularly because this is a      lifetime appointment; and particularly because we have seen      so many people who have received lifetime appointments then      go on and do just what they want, regardless of what they      said. So it is of some concern to us.  That is what I said. I did not attack Mr. Pryor's religion. Nobody in this debate has. I did not attack his religious beliefs. Nobody in this Senate has.  To accuse anyone in this body of using an anti-Catholic litmus test is inaccurate, and wrong. It is ill-advised, and it risks bringing us back to a day where religion and race and gender debates split this Nation apart at its seams.  The judicial nominations process is a serious one and filled with countless debates about very serious issues. We should focus on what is important and real, not on what can inflame political supporters.  The second mischaracterization of my statement was by the junior Senator from Alabama. I know he feels very strongly about this nominee, so I do not blame him for fighting hard for Mr. Pryor.  Nevertheless, the junior Senator from Alabama did not accurately portray what I said in my statement. Specifically, the Senator said that I claimed Mr. Pryor had ``used his power as attorney general to obstruct the enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act in Alabama.''  What I actually said was that Pryor ``used his position as attorney general to limit the scope of crucial civil rights laws like the Violence Against Women's Act, VAWA, the Age Discrimination In Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Family Medical Leave Act. . . . For example, he was the only attorney general to argue against a key provision in the Violence Against Women Act on federalism grounds.''  Now in retrospect, I should have been more careful in the wording of my statement, and for that I am sorry. I said that Mr. Pryor ``used his position as attorney general to limit the scope of crucial civil rights laws . . .'' rather than saying what I meant to say, which was that he argued for limiting the scope of those laws--sometimes successfully--in briefs before the Federal courts.  But I certainly never said that he used his power to ``obstruct'' the law in Alabama.  Some other comments have been made throughout this debate that mischaracterize the Democratic opposition to this nominee and in many instances state, or at least imply, that our opposition is based on religion.  I will say once again, this is simply not true.  I hope, as I said yesterday, that this debate can focus on what it should focus on, the qualifications of this nominee. That focus should not have been lost through a violation of the committee rules, the thwarting of an ongoing investigation into the nominee, or these false charges of religious bias.                          ____________________
