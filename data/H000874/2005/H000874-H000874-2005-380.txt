Speaker, reclaiming my time, thank you for that information, Mr. Leader.  Mr. Leader, obviously next week I suppose the most controversial and most focused-upon piece of legislation will be the Central American Free Trade Agreement. This week, of course, the PATRIOT Act, which we thought was going to start Thursday and go through today, in fact was accelerated and NASA was taken today, clearly to ensure full consideration of the PATRIOT Act.  Might it be possible with some assurance to let the Members know when the CAFTA bill will be on the floor, in effect adopting a similar procedure?  I yield to the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As I said earlier, it is very difficult. Certainly we will consult with the minority as to timing. For instance, right now we think we will have a highway conference report. There may be an energy conference report. There could be one to three appropriations conference reports. It is very difficult today to fashion a schedule that we could give to the Members.  I feel very confident by Monday we will have a better feel for what the week should look like and, in consultation with the minority, we would have a better idea when the Central American Free Trade Agreement can be considered. But I say to the gentleman that it will be fully discussed with an ample amount of time for debate, and we will just do it when we can get to it.
