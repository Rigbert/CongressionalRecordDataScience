Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Keith Elliott Washington for accomplishing his goal of visiting all seven continents.  I first met Keith a few years ago and he expressed his deep passion in politics and his interest in the needs of the American people.  I applaud him on completing a mission which began 18 years ago, when he first visited Senegal in 1996. This was his first visit outside of North America.  On February 2, 2010 at 12:00 p.m., Keith visited Antarctica and achieved his dream of visiting the last continent. I congratulate him for his determination to complete this personal milestone.                          ____________________
