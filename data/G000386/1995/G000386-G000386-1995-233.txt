 President, this morning I want to speak on a topic that has received a lot of attention around here lately. My topic is cyberporn, and that is, computerized pornography. I have introduced S. 892, entitled the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995.  This legislation is narrowly drawn. It is meant to help protect children from sexual predators and exposure to graphic pornography.  Mr. President, Georgetown University Law School has released a remarkable study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. This study raises important questions about the availability and the nature of cyberporn. It is this article I ask to have printed in the Record.  Later on, on this subject, some time during the middle of July, I will be conducting hearings before the full Judiciary Committee to fully and completely explore these issues. In the meantime, I want to refer to the Carnegie Mellon study, and I want to emphasize that this is Carnegie Mellon University. This is not a study done by some religious organization analyzing pornography that might be on computer networks.  The university surveyed 900,000 computer images. Of these 900,000 images, 83.5 percent of all computerized photographs available on the Internet are pornographic. Mr. President, I want to repeat that: 83.5 percent of the 900,000 images reviewed--these are all on the Internet--are pornographic, according to the Carnegie Mellon study.  Now, of course, that does not mean that all of these images are illegal under the Constitution. But with so many graphic images available on computer networks, I believe Congress must act and do so in a constitutional manner to help parents who are under assault in this day and age. There is a flood of vile pornography, and we must act to stem this growing tide, because, in the words of Judge Robert Bork, it incites perverted minds. I refer to Judge Bork from the Spectator article that I have permission to insert in the Record.  My bill, again, is S. 892, and provides just this sort of constitutional, narrowly focused assistance in protecting children, while also protecting the rights of consenting adults to transmit and receive protected pornographic material--protected, that is, under the first amendment.  Also, according to the Carnegie Mellon University study, cyberporn is really big business. Some computer networks which specialize in computer pornography take in excess of $1 million per year.  Later this week, I am going to introduce the Antielectronic Racketeering Act of 1995 which will target organized crime which has begun to use the awesome powers of computers to engage in criminal activity.  As we all know from past debates in this body, organized crime is heavily involved in trafficking illegal pornography. The Antielectronic Racketeering Act will put a dent into that.  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to give this study by Carnegie Mellon University serious consideration, and I urge my colleagues to support S. 892. I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                   [From the Spectator, Feb. 4, 1995]                    An Electronic Sink of Depravity       New York.--If last year it was merely modish to be seen      speeding down the information superhighway, this year it is      fast becoming essential, at least in America. Hitch your      wagon to cyberspace, says the new Speaker of the House, Mr.      Newt Gingrich, and your democracy will become absolute, with      all America joined together for the first time into one vast      and egalitarian town meeting.       Mr. Gingrich made this all clear two weeks ago when he      unveiled a new system for bringing Congress to the      electronically connected populace, which in honour of      President Jefferson is called ``Thomas''. Anyone with a      computer and a modem at home or in the office (or even up in      the skies, courtesy of USAir's new back-of-the-seat      telescreens) may now, with only the click of a few buttons,      find the text of any bill, any resolution, any government      statement.       Mr. Gingrich is hugely excited by this idea--going so far      as to suggest, and not at all facetiously, that perhaps every      citizen be given a thousand-dollar tax deduction to allow him      to buy himself a laptop computer. Thus will all America be      conjoined, he argues, and thus will its democracy be ever      strengthened as in no other country on earth.       Fine, say I, and not just because I will become richer by      $1,000. For the last three years or so I have been a      dedicated and enthusiastic user of the Internet. (The      Internet--``the net'' to those in the know--began innocently      enough 20 years ago as a vast worldwide network of computers,      linked together by government-funded telephone     lines, with high-powered government-funded ``exchanges'' to      speed calls on their way, which enabled universities and      governments to swap information. Five years or so ago, its      controllers opted to make it more democratic, and now anyone      is able to connect to it; tens of thousands of new      subscribers join every day, and the net is becoming truly      global, with at least 20 million regular users.)       I am a typical enough user. I send electronic mail--e-     mail--to everyone who is similarly hooked up (it is lightning      fast and essentially free); and I browse through the world's      libraries and data-bases to do research for whatever book I      happen to be writing. I bask happily in the      Panglossian principle that the Internet seems to enshrine.      By virtue of the net, I have complete freedom to explore      and trawl for anything I want in what has become by custom      an untrammelled, uncontrolled, wholly liberated ocean of      information. The Internet seems and sounds to be something      almost noble. One can understand why the US Congress named      its own portion of the net after Jefferson: all knowledge      there is is on hand for all the people--just the kind of      thing the great man would have liked.       But this week, while I was peering into an area of the      Internet where I have hitherto not lingered, I discovered      something so appalling as to put all such high-minded      sentiments into a quite different perspective.       I had stumbled, not entirely accidentally, into a sinkhole      of electronic but very real perversion. The first thing I      read, almost as soon as I entered it, was a lengthy, very      graphic and in stylistic terms quite competently composed      narrative that presented in all its essentials the story of a      kidnapping, and the subsequent rape, torture, mutilation and      eventual murder of the two victims. That author called      himself by a code-name, Blackwind; and while it is quite      likely that he is American, almost as certain that he is      well-educated and quite possible that he is at least a      peripheral member of the academic community, we know, and are      allowed to know, nothing else about him.       His anonymity is faultlessly safeguarded by a system of      electronics which has been built into the Internet, and which      even the police and the other agents of the state are unable,      technically or in law, to penetrate. This is, from their      point of view, highly regrettable. Blackwind's offerings--and      the very similar stories currently being published on the      Internet by scores of men who are in all likelihood as      deranged as he seems to be--should be subject to some kind of      legal sanction, and for one very understandable reason: the      victims of the story he has written are small children.       One is a six-year old boy named Christopher, who, among      other indignities, suffers a castration--reported in loving      detail--before being shot. The other is a girl named Karen,      who is seven years old and is raped repeatedly by no fewer      than nine men, before having her nipples cut off and her      throat slashed.       At the moment of my writing this, I find that there are      perhaps 200 similar stories presently circulating and      available on one of the so-called ``newsgroups'' on the      Internet. The choice of tales is endlessly expanded and      refreshed by new and ever more exotic stories that emerge      into this particular niche in the other every day, almost      every hour. You want tales of fathers sodomizing their three-     year-old daughters, or of mothers performing fellatio on      their prepubescent sons, or of girls coupling with horses, or      of the giving of enemas to child virgins? Then you need do no      more than visit the newsgroup that is named      ``alt.sex.stories'' and all will reliably be there, 24 hours      a day, for everyone with a computer and a telephone, anywhere      on (or above) the face of the earth.       There are about 5,000 separate newsgroups on the net, each      one of them presenting chatter about some scintilla of human      knowledge or endeavour. I have long liked the system, and      found it an agreeable way to discover people around the world      who have similar interests. I used to tell others who were      not yet signed up to the net that using newsgroups was like      going into a hugely crowded pub, finding in milliseconds      those who wanted to talk about what you wanted to know,      having a quick drink with them before leaving, without once      having encountered a bore.       And so, with an alphabetical list running from `ab.fen'--     which shows you how much fun you can have in Alberta--down to      something in German called `zer.zmetz.Wissenschaft.physlk',      the enthusiasms of the world's Internet-connected population      are distilled into their electronic segments. Alberta-philes      can chat with each other, as can German physicists, and those      who would bore these are left to chat among themselves. In      theory, an admirable arrangement.       By Jeffersonian rights it should be uplifting to the      spirit. In reality it is rather less so. In far too many      groups the level of discussion is execrable and juvenile.      Arguments break out, insults are exchanged, the chatter      drifts aimlessly in and out of relevance. This is a reality      of the electronic world that few like to admit. It is      prompting many browsers to suspect, as I do, that a      dismayingly large number of users of this system are not at      all the kind of sturdy champions of freedom and democracy and      intellect that Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Gore would like them to      be.       More probably, to judge from the tone and the language in      many of the groups, they are pasty-faced and dysfunctional      men with halitosis who inhabit damp basements. And it is for      them, in large measure, that the newsgroups whose titles      begin with the code-letters `alt.sex' seem to exist.       There are 55 of these, offering manna for all diets. Some      are fairly light-hearted; `alt.sex.anal', for example      contains much spirited chat about amusing uses to which you      can put the colonic gateway; `alt.sex.voyeurism' seems to      contain reasonably harmless chatter between a whole worldful      of civic-minded Peeping Toms, who like to advise one another      which public loos in which national parks have eye-sized      knotholes in their doors. There is also `alt.sex.nasal.hair',      into which I have not thus far been tempted.       There are a number of the groups, though, which are not so      amusing. There is `alt.sex.intergen', where the last letters      stand for `intergenerational', which is the current      paedophile bulletin-board; and there is my current target,      `alt.sex.stories'. I came across it by accident, and I      double-clicked my mouse to open it, briefly enthralled. It      did not take many seconds before I realized I had been ill-     prepared for what was on offer.       There is a kind of classification system. Each story entry      lists a title, an author (invariably either a pseudonym, or      posted via an anonymous computer that has laundered the words      and made the detection of the author impossible), and a      series of code-words and symbols that indicate the      approximate content.       Blackwind's many offerings--there were about 200 stories in      all, with Blackwind contributing perhaps 15 of them--     usually fell into the categories that are denoted by the      codes `m-f, f-f, scat.pedo.snuff', meaning that they      contain scenes of male-female sex, female-female sex,      scatological imagery, paedophiliac description and the      eventual killing of the central victim. You quickly get, I      think, the drift. Others are more horrifying still--those      that end with the invariable `snuff' scene, but whose      enticements on the way include `best', `torture', `gore'      or `amputees', and which refer to sex with animals,      bloodlettings, sadistic injury, and the limitless erotic      joy of stumps.       It is important to note that no one polices or, to use the      Internet word, `moderates', this group, (Some of the more      obscure and non-sexual newsgroups do have a volunteer,      usually a specialist in the field, who tries to keep order in      what might, if unchecked, become an unruly discussion.) On      `alt.sex.stories' there is only one man, a Mr. Joshua Laff of      the University of Illinois at Urbana, who oversees the group,      in a somewhat lethargic way. He helpfully suggests the code-     words for the various kinds of perverse interests. He      indicates to people who want to talk about sex stories,      rather than actually contributing them, that they would be      better advised to post their gripes on      `alt.sex.stories.discussion', next door, and so on.       But Mr. Laff has no admitted scruples about what is      permitted to go out over the air. So far as he is concerned,      the First Amendment to the Constitution protects all that is      said on `alt.sex.stories' as free speech. What is      demonstrated on these thousands of electronic pages is a      living exhibition of the birthright of all who are fortunate      enough to be born in the land that has given us the National      Rifle Association, the Reverend Jimmy Swaggart, and      Blackwind.       In truth, Mr. Laff and those who support the published      existence of such writings are technically right. No obscene      pictures are published--these could be banned in law. No      obscene truths are proffered, so far as we know--no      confessions of real rapes, nor of actual acts of pedorasty.      And since all the stories are prefaced with warnings that      those under 18, or those of sensitive disposition, should      read no further--devices that presumably attract precisely      those they purport to deter--so, the authors seem to agree,      their ramblings do no harm at all.       Most individual states legislate firmly or less so against      printed pornography: but so far no one has successfully      prosecuted the Internet--not least for the reason that with      so amorphous, so global and so informal a linking of      computers, who out there can be held responsible? People like      Blackwind simply open accounts at what are known as      `anonymous posting systems', and their words become filtered      through two or three computers in such a way that the      original source can never be known, and the perpetrator of      any possible crime becomes impossible to find. And, anyway,      those who endlessly cry First Amendment! Here we want to say      that the publishing of more words, even those from so clearly      depraved an individual as Blackwind, can do no harm at all.       Commonsense would argue otherwise. A long and graphic      account of exactly how and at what hour you wait outside a      girls' school, how best to bundle a seven-year-old into your      van, whether to tell her at the start of her ordeal that she      is going to be killed at the end of it (Blackwind's favoured      modus operandi), how best to tie her down, which aperture to      approach first, and with what--such things can only tempt      those who verge on such acts to take a greater interest in      them.       Surely such essays tell the thinker of forbidden thoughts      that there exists somewhere out there a like-minded group of      men for whom such things are really not so bad, the enjoyment      of which, if no one is so ill-starred as to get caught, can      be limitless. Surely it is naive folly--or, at the other end      of the spectrum, gross irresponsibility--to suppose      otherwise.       Such material is not, I am happy to say, universally      available. Some of the big corporations which offer public      access to the Internet--America On-Line, CompuServe, Prodigy,      Mr. Murdoch's Delphi--have systems in place that filter out      the more objectionable newsgroups. On America On-Line you may      read the ramblings on `alt.sex.voyeurism' and probably even      `alt.sex.nasal.hair', but you may read no `alt.sex.stories',      nor may you learn techniques for having real relationships,      as paedophiles like to say they have, with young children.       But for those with the wherewithal to find more robust and      uncontrolled access to cyberspace--and that means, quite      frankly, most of the world's computer users, be they 90 years      old or nine--all newsgroups are equally available, the evil      along with the excellent. The question we have to ask is      whether that should continue to be the case.       One might not mind so much if the material were being      confined to the United States, where most of it originates.      But in fact it manages to seep its electronic way everywhere,      from Wiltshire to Waziristan. And crucially, no mechanism is      yet in place allowing foreigners--whose laws might well be      far less tolerantly disposed to it--to filer it out.       A computer owner in Islington or Islamabad can have easy      and inexpensive access to material over the net which would      be illegal for him or her to read or buy on any British or      Pakistani street. In China, pornographers would be imprisoned      for publishing material that any Peking University students      can read at the click of a mouse; and the same is true in      scores of other countries and societies. The Internet, we      smugly say, has become a means of circumventing the      restrictive codes of tyrannics. But the reverse of this coin      is less attractive; it also allows an almost exclusively      American contagion to ooze outwards, unstoppable, like an oil      spill, contaminating everyone and everything in its path.       We cannot, of course, prevent: such things being thought.      We may not prevent them being written for self-gratification      alone. But, surely, science and the public can somehow      conspire and co-operate to see that such writings as are      represented by `scat.pedo.torture.snuff' and the like are      neither published nor read, and that they do not in      consequence have the opportunity to spread outwards as an      electronic contagion from the minds of those who, like      Blackwind, first create them.       The Jeffersonian model for universal freedom which Mr.      Gingrich so rightly applauds could not take into account the      barbarisms of the modern mind. Nor could it imagine the      genius by which such barbarisms can be disseminated as they      are today, in seconds, to the remotest and still most      innocent corners of the world. Someone, perhaps even the      Speaker of the House of Representatives, is going to have to      consider soon the implications, for ill as well as good, of      our venture out onto the information superhighway, or else      there are going to be some very messy electronic traffic      accidents.                                  ____                    [From Time Magazine, June 1995]                    Cyberporn--On a Screen Near You                        (By Philip Elmer-Dewitt)       It's popular, pervasive and surprisingly perverse,      according to the first survey of online erotica. And there's      no easy way to stamp it out.       Sex is everywhere these days--in books, magazines, films,      television, music videos and bus-stop perfume ads. It is      printed on dial-a-porn business cards and slipped under      windshield wipers. It is acted out by balloon-breasted models      and actors with unflagging erections, then rented for $4 a      night at the corner video store. Most Americans have become      so inured to the open display of eroticism--and the arguments      for why it enjoys special status under the First Amendment--     that they hardly notice it's there.       Something about the combination of sex and computers,      however, seems to make otherwise worldly-wise adults a little      crazy. How else to explain the uproar surrounding the      discovery by a U.S. Senator--Nebraska Democrat James Exon--     that pornographic pictures can be downloaded from the      Internet and displayed on a home computer? This, as any      computer-savvy undergrad can testify, is old news. Yet      suddenly the press is on alert, parents and teachers are up      in arms, and lawmakers in Washington are rushing to ban the      smut from cyberspace with new legislation--sometimes with      little regard to either its effectiveness or its      constitutionality.       If you think things are crazy now, though, wait until the      politicians get hold of a report coming out this week. A      research team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania, has counted an exhaustive study of online      porn--what's available, who is downloading it, what turns      them on--and the findings (to be published in the Georgetown      Law Journal) are sure to pour fuel on an already explosive      debate.       The study, titled Marketing Pornography on the Information      Superhighway, is significant not only for what it tells us      about what's happening on the computer networks but also for      what it tells us about ourselves. Pornography's appeal is      surprisingly elusive. It plays as much on fear, anxiety,      curiosity and taboo as on genuine eroticism. The Carnegie      Mellon study, drawing on elaborate computer records of online      activity, was able to measure for the first time what people      actually download, rather than what they say they want to      see. ``We now know what the consumers of computer pornography      really look at in the privacy of their own homes,'' says      Marty Rimm, the study's principal investigator. ``And we're      finding a fundamental shift in the kinds of images they      demand.''       What the Carnegie Mellon researchers discovered was:       There's an awful lot of porn online. In an 18-month study,      the team surveyed 917,410 sexually explicit pictures,      descriptions, short stories and film clips. On those Usenet      newsgroups where digitized images are stored, 83.5 percent of      the pictures were pornographic.       It is immensely popular. Trading in sexually explicit      imagery, according to the report, is now ``one of the largest      (if not the largest) recreational applications of users of      computer networks.'' At one U.S. University, 13 of the 40      most frequently visited newsgroups had names like      alt.sex.stories, rec.arts.erotica and alt.sex.bondage.       It is a big moneymaker. The great majority (71 percent) of      the sexual images on the newsgroups surveyed originate from      adult-oriented computer bulletin-board systems (BBS) whose      operators are trying to lure customers to their private      collections of X-rated material. There are thousands of these      BBS services, which charge fees (typically $10 to $30 a      month) and take credit cards; the five largest have annual      revenues in excess of $1 million.       It is ubiquitous. Using data obtained with permission from      BBS operators, the Carnegie Mellon team identified (but did      not publish the names of) individual consumers in more than      2,000 cities in all 50 states and 40 countries, territories      and provinces around the world--including some countries      like China, where possession of pornography can be a      capital offense.       It is a guy thing. According to the BBS operators, 98.9      percent of the consumers of online porn are men. And there is      some evidence that many of the remaining 1.1 percent are      women paid to hang out on the ``chat'' rooms and bulletin      boards to make the patrons feel more comfortable.       It is not just naked women. Perhaps because hard-core sex      pictures are so widely available elsewhere, the adult BBS      market seems to be driven largely by a demand for images that      can't be found in the average magazine rack: pedophilia (nude      photos of children), hebephilia (youths) and what the      researchers call paraphilia--a grab bag of ``deviant''      material that includes images of bondage, sadomasochism,      urination, defecation, and sex acts with a barnyard full of      animals.       The appearance of material like this on a public network      accessible to men, women and children around the world raises      issues too important to ignore--or to oversimplify. Parents      have legitimate concerns about what their kids are being      exposed to and, conversely, what those children might miss if      their access to the Internet were cut off. Lawmakers must      balance public safety with their obligation to preserve      essential civil liberties. Men and women have to come to      terms with what draws them to such images. And computer      programmers have to come up with more enlightened ways to      give users control over a network that is, by design, largely      out of control.       The Internet, of course, is more than a place to find      pictures of people having sex with dogs. It's a vast      marketplace of ideas and information of all sorts--on      politics, religion, science and technology. If the fast-     growing World Wide Web fulfills its early promise, the      network could be a powerful engine of economic growth in the      21st century. And as the Carnegie Mellon study is careful to      point out, pornographic image files, despite their evident      popularity, represent only about 3 percent of all the      messages on the Usenet newsgroups, while the Usenet itself      represents only 11.5 percent of the traffic on the Internet.       As shocking and, indeed, legally obscene as some of the      online porn may be, the researchers found nothing that can't      be found in specialty magazines or adult bookstores. Most of      the material offered by the private BBS services, in fact, is      simply scanned from existing print publications.       But pornography is different on the computer networks. You      can obtain it in the privacy of your home--without having to      walk into a seedy bookstore or movie house. You can download      only those things that turn you on, rather than buy an entire      magazine or video. You can explore different aspects of your      sexuality without exposing yourself to communicable diseases      or public ridicule. (Unless, of course, someone gets hold of      the computer files tracking your online activities, as      happened earlier this year to a couple dozen crimson-faced      Harvard students.)       The great fear of parents and teachers, of course, is not      that college students will find this stuff but that it will      fall into the hands of those much younger--including some,      perhaps, who are not emotionally prepared to make sense of      what they see.       Ten-year-old Anders Urmacher, a student at the Dalton      School in New York City who likes to hang out with other kids      in the Treehouse chat room on America Online, got E-mail from      a stranger that contained a mysterious file with instructions      for how to download it. He followed the instructions, and      then he called his mom. When Linda Mann-Urmacher opened the      file, the computer screen filled with 10 thumbnail-size      pictures showing couples engaged in various acts of sodomy,      heterosexual intercourse and     lesbian sex. ``I was not aware that this stuff was online,''      says a shocked Mann-Urmacher. ``Children should not be      subjected to these images.''       This is the flip side of Vice President Al Gore's vision of      an information superhighway linking every school and library      in the land. When the kids are plugged in, will they be      exposed to the seamiest sides of human sexuality? Will they      fall prey to child molesters hanging out in electronic chat      rooms? It's precisely these fears that have stopped Bonnie      Fell of Skokie, Illinois, from signing up for the Internet      access her three boys say they desperately need.       ``They could get bombarded with X-rated porn, and I      wouldn't have any idea,'' she says. Mary Veed, a mother of      three from nearby Hinsdale, makes a point of trying to keep      up with her computer-literate 12-year-old, but sometimes has      to settle for monitoring his phone bill. ``Once they get to      be a certain age, boys don't always tell Mom what they do,''      she says.       ``We face a unique, disturbing and urgent circumstance,      because it is children who are the computer experts in our      nation's families,'' said Republican Senator Dan Coats of      Indiana during the debate over the controversial anti-     cyberporn bill he co-sponsored with Senator Exon.       According to at least one of those experts--16-year-old      David Slifka of Manhattan--the danger of being bombarded with      unwanted pictures is greatly exaggerated. ``If you don't want      them you won't get them,'' says the veteran Internet surfer.      Private adult BBSs require proof of age (usually a driver's      license) and are off-limits to minors, and kids have to      master some fairly daunting computer science before they can      turn so-called binary files on the Usenet into high-     resolution color pictures. ``The chances of randomly coming      across them are unbelievably slim,'' says Slifka.       While groups like the Family Research Council insist that      online child molesters represent a clear and present danger,      there is no evidence that it is any greater than the thousand      other threats children face every day. Ernie Allen, executive      director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited      Children, acknowledges that there have been 10 or 12 ``fairly      high-profile cases'' in the past year of children being      seduced or lured online into situations where they are      victimized. Kids who are not online are also at risk,      however; more than 800,000 children are reported missing      every year in the U.S.       Yet it is in the name of the children and their parents      that lawmakers are racing to fight cyberporn. The first blow      was struck by Senators Exon and Coats, who earlier this year      introduced revisions to an existing law called the      Communications Decency Act. The idea was to extend      regulations written to govern the dial-a-porn industry into      the computer networks. The bill proposed to outlaw obscene      material and impose fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms      of up to two years on anyone who knowingly makes ``indecent''      material available to children under 18.       The measure had problems from the start. In its original      version it would have made online-service providers      criminally liable for any obscene communications that passed      through their systems--a provision that, given the way the      networks operate, would have put the entire Internet at risk.      Exon and Coats revised the bill but left in place the      language about using ``indecent'' words online. ``It's a      frontal assault on the First Amendment,'' says Harvard law      professor Laurence Tribe. Even veteran prosecutors ridicule      it. ``It won't pass scrutiny even in misdemeanor court,''      says one.       The Exon bill had been written off for dead only a few      weeks ago. Republican Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota,      chairman of the Commerce committee, which has jurisdiction      over the larger telecommunications-reform act to which it is      attached, told Time that he intended to move to table it.       That was before Exon showed up in the Senate with his      ``blue book.'' Exon had asked a friend to download some of      the rawer images available online. ``I knew it was bad,''      he says. ``But then when I got on there, it made Playboy      and Hustler look like Sunday-school stuff.'' He had the      images printed out, stuffed them in a blue folder and      invited his colleagues to stop by his desk on the Senate      floor to view them. At the end of the debate--which was      carried live on c-span--few Senators wanted to cast a      nationally televised vote that might later be      characterized as pro-pornography. The bill passed 84 to      16.       Civil libertarians were outraged. Mike Godwin, staff      counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, complained      that the indecency portion of the bill would transform the      vast library of the Internet into a children's reading room,      where only subjects suitable for kids could be discussed.      ``It's government censorship,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the      Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``The Amendment      shouldn't end where the Internet begins.''       The key issue, according to legal scholars, is whether the      Internet is a print medium (like a newspaper), which enjoys      strong protection against government interference, or a      broadcast medium (like television), which may be subject to      all sorts of government control. Perhaps the most significant      import of the Exon bill, according to EFF's Godwin, is that      it would place the computer networks under the jurisdiction      of the Federal Communications Commission, which enforces,      among other rules, the injunction against using the famous      seven dirty words on the radio. In a Time/CNN poll of 1,000      Americans conducted last week by Yankelovich Partners,      respondents were sharply split on the issue: 42 percent were      for FCC-like control over sexual content on the computer      networks; 48 percent were against it.       By week's end the balance between protecting speech and      curbing pornography seemed to be tipping back toward the      libertarians. In a move that surprised conservative      supporters, House Speaker Newt Gingrich denounced the Exon      amendment. ``It is clearly a violation of free speech, and      it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with      each other,'' he told a caller on a cable-TV show. It was a      key defection, because Gingrich will preside over the      computer-decency debate when it moves to the House in July.      Meanwhile, two U.S. Representatives, Republican Christopher      Cox of California and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, were      putting together an anti-Exon amendment that would bar      federal regulation of the Internet and help parents find ways      to block material they found objectionable.       Coincidentally, in the closely watched case of a University      of Michigan student who published a violent sex fantasy on      the Internet and was charged with transmitting a threat to      injure or kidnap across state lines, a federal judge in      Detroit last week dismissed the charges. The judge ruled that      while Jake Baker's story might be deeply offensive, it was      not a crime.       How the Carnegie Mellon report will affect the delicate      political balance on the cyberporn debate is anybody's guess.      Conservatives thumbing through it for rhetorical ammunition      will find plenty. Appendix B lists the most frequently      downloaded files from a popular adult BBS, providing both the      download count and the two-line descriptions posted by the      board's operator. Suffice it to say that they all end in      exclamation points, many include such phrases as ``nailed to      a table!'' and none can be printed in Time.       How accurately these images reflect America's sexual      interests, however, is a matter of some dispute. University      of Chicago sociologist Edward Laumann, whose 1994 Sex in      America survey painted a far more humdrum picture of      America's sex life, says the Carnegie Mellon study may have      captured what he calls the ``gaper phenomenon.'' ``There is a      curiosity for things that are extraordinary and way out,'' he      says. ``It's like driving by a horrible accident. No one      wants to be in it, but we all slow down to watch.''       Other sociologists point out that the difference between      the Chicago and Carnegie Mellon reports may be more apparent      than real. Those 1 million or 2 million people who download      pictures from the Internet represent a self-selected group      with an interest in erotica. The Sex in America respondents,      by contrast, were a few thousand people selected to represent      a cross section of all American. Still, the new research is a      gold mine for psychologists, social scientists, computer      marketers and anybody with an interest in human boards, they      left a digital trail of their transactions, allowing the      pornographers to compile data bases about their buying habits      and sexual tastes. The more sophisticated operators were able      to adjust their inventory and their descriptions to match      consumer demand.       Nobody did this more effectively than Robert Thomas, owner      of the Amateur Action BBS in Milpitas, California, and a kind      of modern-day Marquis de Sade, according to the Carnegie      Mellon report. He is currently serving time in an obscenity      case that may be headed for the Supreme Court.       Thomas, whose BBS is the online-porn market leader,      discovered that he could boost sales by trimming soft- and      hard-core images from his data base while front-loading his      files with pictures of sex acts with animals (852) and nude      prepubescent children (more than 5,000), his two most popular      categories of porn. He also used copywriting tricks to better      serve his customers' fantasies. For example, he described      more than 1,200 of his pictures as depicting sex scenes      between family members (father and daughter, mother and son),      even though there was no evidence that any of the      participants were actually related. These ``incest'' images      were among his biggest sellers, accounting for 10 percent of      downloads.       The words that worked were sometimes quite revealing.      Straightforward oral sex, for example, generally got a      lukewarm response. But when Thomas described the same images      using words like choke or choking, consumer demand doubled.       Such findings may cheer antipornography activists; as      feminist writer Andrea Dworkin puts it, ``the whole purpose      of pornography is to hurt women,'' Catharine MacKinnon, a      professor of law at the University of Michigan, goes further.      Women are doubly violated by pornography, she writes in      Vindication and Resistance, one of three essays in the      forthcoming Georgetown Law Journal that offer differing views      on the Carnegie Mellon report. They are violated when it is      made and exposed to further violence again and again every      time it is consumed. ``The question pornography poses in      cyberspace,'' she writes, ``is the same one it poses      everywhere else: Whether anything will be done about it.''       But not everyone agrees with Dworkin and MacKinnon, by any      means; even some feminist think there is a place in life--and      the Internet--for erotica. In her new book, Defending      Pornography, Nadine Strossen argues that censoring sexual      expression would     do women more harm than good, undermining their equality,      their autonomy and their freedom.       The Justice Department, for it part, has not asked for new      antiporn legislation. Distributing obscene material across      state lines is already illegal under federal law, and child      pornography in particular is vigorously prosecuted. Some 40      people in 14 states were arrested two years ago in Operation      Longarm for exchanging kiddie porn online. And one of the      leading characters in the Carnegie Mellon study--a former      Rand McNally executive named Robert Copella, who left book      publishing to make his fortune selling pedophilia on the      networks--was extradited from Tijuana, and is now awaiting      sentencing in a New Jersey jail.       For technical reasons, it is extremely difficult to stamp      out anything on the Internet--particularly images stored on      the Usenet newsgroup. As Internet pioneer John Gilmore      famously put it, ``The Net interprets censorship as damage      and routes around it.'' There are border issues as well.      Other countries on the Internet--France, for instance--are      probably no more interested in having their messages      screened by U.S. censors than Americans would be in having      theirs screened by, say, the government of Saudi Arabia.       Historians say it should come as no surprise that the      Internet--the most democratic of media--would lead to new      calls for censorship. The history of pornography and efforts      to suppress it are inextricably bound up with the rise of new      media and the emergence of democracy. According to Walter      Kendrick, author of The Secret Museum: Pornography in Modern      Culture, the modern concept of pornography was invented in      the 19th century by European gentlemen whose main concern was      to keep obscene material away from women and the lower      classes. Things got out of hand with the spread of literacy      and education, which made pornography available to anybody      who could read. Now, on the computer networks, anybody with a      computer and a modem can not only consume pornography but      distribute it as well. On the Internet, anybody can be Bob      Guccione.       That might not be a bad idea, says Carlin Meyer, a      professor at New York Law School whose Georgetown essay takes      a far less apocalyptic view than MacKinnon's. She argues that      if you don't like the images of sex the pornographers offer,      the appropriate response is not to suppress them but to      overwhelm them with healthier, more realistic ones. Sex on      the Internet, she maintains, might actually be good for young      people. ``[Cyberspace] is a safe space in which to explore      the forbidden and the taboo,'' she writes. ``It offers the      possibility for genuine, unembarrassed conversations about      accurate as well as fantasy images of sex.''       That sounds easier than it probably is. Pornography is      powerful stuff, and as long as there is demand for it, there      will always be a supply. Better software tools may help check      the worst abuses, but there will never be a switch that will      cut it off entirely--not without destroying the unbridled      expression that is the source of the Internet's (and      democracy's) greatest strength. The hard truth, says John      Perry Barlow, co-founder of the EFF and father of three young      daughters, is that the burden ultimately falls where it      always has: on the parents. ``If you don't want your children      fixating on filth,'' he says, ``better step up to the tough      task of raising them to find it as distasteful as you do      yourself.''
