 It is my understanding that the amendment you are asking unanimous consent for takes $8 billion out of the general fund and puts it back in the trust fund, which is exactly what happened back in 1998, in reverse.  Taxpayers pay their gas tax into the trust fund, expect it to go for transportation projects. In 1998, we took $8 billion of that money that they expected to go into transportation funding and put it in the general fund.  What you are asking to do tonight is simply to take that $8 billion back and put it exactly where taxpayers expected it to go originally, which was to transportation funds; is that not correct?
