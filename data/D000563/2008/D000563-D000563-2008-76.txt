. is closely linked to the stability of far-flung places beyond our borders. From food riots to failed states, we have become more aware of how important it is to help the poorest around the world live healthier, more productive, and stable lives.  Foreign assistance for development is not only the right thing to do; it's in our national interest. In the U.S., the responsibility for such development falls largely to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.  USAID was founded by the Kennedy administration in 1961. It became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization whose primary emphasis was on long term economic and social development efforts overseas.  During its first decade, it had more than 5,000 dedicated Foreign Service Officers serving all over the world, often in the most difficult of conditions. They helped build clinics in Nepal, provide clean water in Honduras, and boost the agricultural and industrial sectors of Pakistan.  Today, when the U.S. needs to show its leadership overseas more than ever, USAID operates with just 1,000 Foreign Service Officers.  Many people on both sides of the aisle agree that USAID is no longer equipped to do its job effectively. We simply are not meeting the international development goals of the United States.  USAID has not received adequate funding, staffing, or political support--and America's efforts abroad have suffered as a result.  It is time to make a change.  We should be sending bright, talented public servants to help improve child and maternal health, treat those with AIDS, TB and malaria, provide clean water and sanitation for the world's poor, help farmers and women start or improve their business, and assist reformers and civic leaders to build stronger democratic institutions.  Today, along with Senator Kerry and Senator Murray, I am introducing the Increasing America's Global Development Capacity Act of 2008 to take the first step toward putting the Agency for International Development on firmer footing.  The bill would authorize USAID to hire an additional 700 Foreign Service Officers. This would basically double the current number of development officers available to work in targeted countries. This is fundamental to rebuilding the agency's capacity.  Senator Leahy, Chair of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, shares a commitment to rebuilding USAID. I am heartened by the Subcommittee's recommended increase in funding for USAID's operating expenses for fiscal year 2009. This was a priority for me in the bill, and Chairman Leahy has been very supportive.  My bill also would establish a goal of hiring an additional 1,300 Foreign Service Officers by 2011.  After three years, USAID would have more than 3,000 of talented, committed Americans serving in the world's most difficult locations helping to improve the lives of others. It won't be the 5,000 experts of the 1960s, but it will be a big improvement from today.  Foreign development assistance is as important a foreign policy tool as diplomacy and defense. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is perhaps the most persuasive advocate for rebuilding our civilian development capacity. He argues that we need to engage in nonmilitary ways to pursue global development goals.  The civilian instruments of national security--diplomacy, development assistance, sharing expertise on civil society--are becoming more and more important. Secretary Gates arguesthat these tools are good for the world's poor, our national security, and our country.  I agree.  Let us take one concrete step to rebuild that important civilian capacity, which would help improve our ability to help the world's poorest countries and people.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3643       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing America's Global      Development Capacity Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) foreign development assistance is an important foreign      policy tool in addition to diplomacy and defense;       (2) development assistance is part of any comprehensive      United States response to regional conflicts, terrorist      threats, weapons proliferation, disease pandemics, and      persistent widespread poverty;       (3) in 2002 and 2006, the United States National Security      Strategy includes global development, along with defense and      diplomacy, as the 3 pillars of national security;       (4) in its early years, the United States Agency for      International Development (USAID) had more than 5,000 full-     time Foreign Service Officers;       (5) as of 2008, USAID has slightly more than 1,000 full-     time Foreign Service Officers;       (6) the budget at USAID, calculated in real dollars, has      dropped 27 percent since 1985;       (7) this decline in personnel and operating budgets has      diminished the capacity of USAID to provide development      assistance and implement foreign assistance programs; and       (8) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate      recommended increasing the amount to be appropriated for      USAID operating expenses for fiscal year 2009 by $171,000,000      compared to the amount appropriated for such expenses for      fiscal year 2008.     SEC. 3. HIRING OF ADDITIONAL FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS AS                    USAID EMPLOYEES.       (a) Initial Hirings.--Not later than 1 year after the date      of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of USAID      shall use additional amounts appropriated to USAID for fiscal      year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 to increase by not      less than 700 the total number of full-time Foreign Service      Officers employed by USAID compared to the number of such      officers employed by USAID on the date of the enactment of      this Act. These officers shall be used to enhance the ability      of USAID to--       (1) carry out development activities around the world by      providing USAID with additional human resources and expertise      needed to meet important development and humanitarian needs      around the world;       (2) strengthen its institutional capacity as the lead      development agency of the United States; and       (3) more effectively help developing nations to become more      stable, healthy, democratic, prosperous, and self-sufficient.       (b) Subsequent Hirings.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2),      during the 2-year period beginning 1 year after the date of      the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of USAID shall      increase by not less than 1,300 the total number of full-time      Foreign Service Officers over the number of such Officers at      the beginning of such 2-year period to carry out the      activities described in subsection (a), contingent upon      sufficient appropriations.       (2) Reprogramming.--If the Administrator of USAID      determines that USAID has competing needs that are more      urgent than the hirings described in paragraph (1), the      Administrator may use amounts available for such hirings for      such competing needs if the Administrator submits to the      Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign      Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations      and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of      Representatives a report describing such competing needs.                                 ______                                       By
