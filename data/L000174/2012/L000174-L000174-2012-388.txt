President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley to introduce the Drug Free Communities Reauthorization Act of 2012, a bill to reauthorize the successful Drug Free Communities Program. It is crucial that communities around the country have the support and resources needed to respond to serious drug problems in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. Drug Free Community, DFC, coalitions have been proven to significantly lower substance abuse rates in our communities nationwide.  The DFC program encourages local citizens to become directly involved in solving their community's drug issues through grassroots organizing and data-driven approaches. Since the program's inception, DFC grants, which must be matched dollar for dollar, have helped to fund nearly 2,000 coalitions and have mobilized nearly 9,000 community volunteers. Today's legislation will reauthorize the DFC Program for an additional 5 years, at a reduced rate to reflect current fiscal realities. The community coalition model has proven extremely effective and has achieved impressive outcomes. It is critical that today's bill become law.  The DFC Program strategically invests Federal anti-drug resources at the community level with those who have the most power to reduce the demand for drugs--parents, teachers, business leaders, local media, religious leaders, law enforcement, youth, and others in the community. Grantees execute collaborative strategies to address their communities' unique substance use and abuse issues. This is the optimal way to ensure that the entire community benefits from prevention. I have consistently supported funding for these coalitions, and was pleased that last year, eight Vermont coalitions were awarded Drug Free Community grants totaling $946,852.  In Vermont, we have felt the presence of drug abuse and drug-related crime in our communities, and prescription drug abuse is on the rise. The myth persists that drug abuse and drug-related crime are only big-city problems, but rural America is also coping with these issues. I have brought the Judiciary Committee to Vermont several times to examine these problems and gain perspectives to help shape solutions. One thing is clear. Law enforcement, while crucial, cannot solve the problem on its own. Reducing substance abuse requires a comprehensive approach with equal attention to law enforcement, prevention and education, and treatment, all with active community buy-in.  We see significant results in the fight against youth drug abuse when we have people working together at the local, State, and Federal levels, and in the law enforcement, prevention, and treatment fields. We have seen success driven by DFC coalitions in Vermont and throughout the country, but there is more work to be done. Drug abuse and drug-related crime is a persistent problem in major metropolitan areas and rural communities alike. I hope all Senators will support this bipartisan bill so that communities nationwide can sustain effective community coalitions to reduce youth drug use.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2159       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
