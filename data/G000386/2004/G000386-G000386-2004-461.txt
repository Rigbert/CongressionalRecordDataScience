 I was disappointed that, despite our best efforts, we were unable to clear the full text of the Conrad-Nickles amendment. But for an objection that was unrelated to the purpose of the Conrad-Nickles amendment, the highway bill would contain the full agreement between Senators Baucus, Nickles, Conrad, and me. I want to assure them that I fully intend to make good on the promise made in the committee markup. As the legislative process moves forward, I pledge that I will continue working to address their concerns.
