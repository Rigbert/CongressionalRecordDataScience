 President, before I make my statement, which will be on the Reid amendment, I would like to congratulate Senator Collins, Senator Inouye, Senator Murray, and all of the Members who worked in committee on this bill. Although one doesn't often tell tales of what happened in a Democratic caucus, I would like to quote Senator Murray in that caucus. She said, ``This bill will make a difference.''  I think that is a very dispositive, definitive, and positive statement. So I would like to offer my congratulations to the chairman of the committee and all who worked on it and thank them very much.                           Amendment No. 4936  Mr. President, I would like to speak about this very long Reid amendment which has been offered to be part of this bill. The amendment, much like the Real Security Act introduced last week, is a comprehensive package of ways to strengthen our national security through improved intelligence, military, diplomatic, and homeland security tools. But in particular I would like, as a member of both the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee, to address the issue of electronic surveillance to identify and prevent terrorist attacks.  All Democrats support giving the President the tools he needs to find the terrorists before they have a chance to strike us again. This cannot be said too many times in too many ways. It is a fact, and I have never heard anything to the contrary.  We also agree, though, that these intelligence tools, especially electronic surveillance of telephone content--the content of a phone call or wiretapping of a phone call--can and should be done in a way that protects constitutional and privacy rights of all Americans, because whatever is done here will go on for decades and because whatever is done here will likely impact tens of thousands of persons in the United States.  I am pleased that the minority leader has endorsed these concepts, as they are the key pillars of legislation that Senator Specter and I have introduced. That is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act. I thank the minority leader for ``Rule 14'ing'' my bill, which now appears as the Feinstein-Specter bill as hotlined, S. 3877.  Tomorrow in Judiciary we will be marking up FISA bills. This same bill but under a different bill number, namely S. 3001, will be subject to markup along with the other bills. Senator Specter's Administration bill, Senator DeWine's bill, and a bill by Senator Schumer will be marked up tomorrow morning and Thursday morning.  My legislation, which is pretty simple and pretty limited, is aimed at providing our intelligence agencies with more authority, more resources, and more flexibility to conduct electronic surveillance. In doing so, the legislation reaffirms that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, is the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance to collect foreign intelligence in the United States. I believe this is very important.  We have had hearings in Judiciary. The Attorney General has testified. The head of the NSA program has testified. It is pretty clear to me that this terrorist surveillance program can be fit into the confines of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed in 1978. What has to be done is a streamlining of the process leading up to it and some revised provisions for emergency hot pursuit. So what I have tried to do is take what the Attorney General has said to the committee were obstructions to using FISA and solve those obstructions but keep FISA because it is so important.  The legislation that I have introduced would recognize that further changes are needed in this shadowy world of asymmetric terror. That is why the legislation would give the executive branch the authority to listen in to conversations between terrorists and their conspirators inside and outside the United States.  At the same time, we preserve the cornerstone of FISA, and that is that it is by warrant, that a Federal judge reviews and approves every individual warrant request for content to ensure the Government is not spying on innocent Americans.  I think it is useful to remind ourselves why this body wrote and enacted FISA in the first place. In 1976 a committee headed by Frank Church, which became known as the Church committee, provided a report to the Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.  There are three books just like this, on what went on in our Nation prior to 1976. It is startling. I will get to it in a moment. But it was the genesis for the 1978, very carefully considered Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This committee reported--and please read it, Members--on a series of excesses and abuses that had taken place in the intelligence community. These included some of the worst civil rights violations our Government has ever committed, such as the secret campaign to smear Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and domestic targeting of Americans peacefully advocating civil disobedience in areas such as civil rights and opposition to the Vietnam war.  The Church committee found these abuses stemmed from a lack of oversight and checks on Government power. Watch lists were established on people whose views ranged from Joan Baez on the left to members of the John Birch Society on the right.  The Church committee's report led not only to FISA but also to the establishment of the Permanent Intelligence Committees in both Houses of the Congress. It was a historic report.  So discussions today that the President has the authority to go around FISA and doesn't need court approval should cause Members of this great body serious concern. It was a surprise to almost every Senator to learn last December that the President had authorized the National Security Administration to electronically surveil U.S. persons without following the law.  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have received many briefings on the President's program. There are still some unanswered questions, and the administration has a responsibility to provide Congress with answers. But basically the Senate Intelligence Committee has been briefed on the program in the main.  But from what I have learned to date, I am convinced of two things: First, the work that NSA is doing is important to prevent terrorists from attacking us again--and I support it. Second, the surveillance that is done under the ``terrorist surveillance program'' can be done under FISA's framework with some changes. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I participated in the hearings, and I thank my chairman, Senator Specter, for holding these hearings.  The conclusion I draw from them, and from the briefings, is that fairly modest changes can be made to FISA which would remove the barriers standing in the NSA's way while also restoring the FISA Court oversight that is necessary to protect a citizen's constitutional right.  Let me briefly tell you what we have done.  We have expanded hot pursuit. Currently, the law states that during specified ``emergency'' periods surveillance can proceed without a warrant for 72 hours. At the recommendation of former FISA judges, we have extended the time for hot pursuit to 7 days. So if something happens and the NSA wants to immediately wiretap someone, they can, provided they notify the Attorney General within 24 hours that it is happening, and then go to the FISA Court.  Attorney General Gonzales testified to us that he personally has to approve applications before they go to the FISA Court. That was a problem. So we created additional flexibility to handle the increased caseload by allowing the Attorney General to delegate this authority to two Senate-confirmed officials: the Deputy Attorney General, and the Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  Wartime authority: Currently, FISA provides the President with authority to wiretap without a warrant for 15 days after a declaration of war. That is a good thing, I believe.  Our bill would expand Presidential authority by allowing the President to also order wiretaps without a warrant for 15 days following a congressional authorization to use military force and a terrorist attack on the United States.  Additional resources: The staff and court need additional resources, and Members have expressed concern about a backlog of FISA applications. We would authorize additional judges as necessary, additional OIPR assistant United States attorneys as necessary, and additional NSA and FBI staff as necessary, so that this problem would be taken care of.  Then we clarify ``foreign to foreign.'' It has often been said that in the 28 years since FISA was written changes in technology have made the law outdated. Communications that start and end outside of the United States but may switch through the United States--communications that FISA never attempted to cover--are now regularly put before the FISA Court.  General Alexander expressed his frustration that foreign-to-foreign communications impede the FISA process.  This bill--which again has been ``Rule 14'd''--would explicitly exempt these telephone calls and e-mails from FISA while preserving the existing process for the appropriate handling of communications involving a U.S. party that were inadvertently wiretapped.  We believe these provisions will go a long way. We also would mandate that briefings on electronic surveillance conducted for foreign intelligence purposes be given to the full Intelligence Committee of both the House and the Senate, really to prevent what was happening, which was the beginning of a major wiretapping program where only eight Members of Congress knew very early on about the program, and therefore there was virtually no congressional oversight that was meaningful in any way, shape, or form.  In this bill is a two-page sense of the Senate beginning on page 313 of the Reid amendment and going through pages 314 and 315. Essentially, it states up front that the U.S. Government should have the legal authority to engage in electronic surveillance of any telephone conversation in which one party is reasonably believed to be a member or an agent of a terrorist organization.  It goes on to say that absent emergency or other appropriate circumstances, domestic electronic surveillance should be subject to judicial review in order to protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens or Americans with no ties to terrorism.  I strongly support the Reid amendment. I support the Sense of the Senate. And I look forward to being able to debate the bill which Senator Reid has agreed to cosponsor, as well as Senator Specter--it is a bipartisan bill--at the appropriate time when bills to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are before the body.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. Once again, I indicate my very strong support for the bill before the U.S. Senate today.  Thank you, Mr. President.
