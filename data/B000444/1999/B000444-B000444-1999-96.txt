 KYL. The Washington Times, Tuesday, October 12.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Times article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Moscow, Beijing Balk at Monitors                            (By Bill Gertz)       Russia and China refused to permit seismic monitoring near      their nuclear weapons test sites that could have resolved      some verification problems now troubling the Comprehensive      Test Ban Treaty, according to U.S. government officials.       Clinton administration officials and congressional aides      said the failure of U.S. negotiators to win the cooperation      of Moscow and Beijing was a ``negotiating failure'' that      undermined the treaty. It also is a key reason U.S.      intelligence agencies said both nations could conduct hidden      nuclear tests without detection.       The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity      because of sensitive intelligence issues, said the treaty's      international monitoring system that includes 50 ``primary''      seismic stations and 120 ``auxiliary'' seismic stations does      not include stations close to China's remote northwestern Lop      Nur testing site in Xinjiang province, or Russia's arctic      Novaya Zemlya.       U.S. intelligence agencies suspect the two locations were      used recently for small nuclear test blasts.       China's test on June 12 may have been part of efforts by      Beijing to build smaller warheads for its short-range      missiles, or multiple warheads for its intercontinental      ballistic missiles (ICBMs), U.S. intelligence officials said.       Two suspected nuclear tests detected near Novaya Zemlya on      Sept. 8 and Sept. 23 are believed to be part of Russia's      secret nuclear testing program.       U.S. intelligence agencies reported recently to policy-     makers and members of Congress that Russia and China are the      two nations are most interested and capable of conducting      covert tests. ``Both have locations where they could conduct      secret tests that would not be detected,'' said one      intelligence official.       The official said that during treaty negotiations from 1994      to 1996 at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, U.S.      negotiators failed to press for Russian and Chinese agreement      to tougher monitoring provisions in the treaty that would      satisfy the concerns of U.S. spy agencies about cheating.       According to the official, ``if Russia had been convinced      to have one facility at Novaya Zemlya and China agreed to      have one near Lop Nur, the level of verification would have      improved greatly.''       Russia and China also blocked a treaty provision that would      have required treaty signatories to allow small explosive      tests that would have ``calibrated'' regional seismic      stations so they accurately measure underground blasts, the      officials said.       Without the calibration, the regional stations will provide      misleading or confusing data that undermines more accurate      data provided by primary stations, they said.       A National Intelligence Estimate, the consensus judgment of      all U.S. intelligence agencies, presented a finding in 1997      that said verifying the test-ban treaty will be difficult.       That estimate is currently being revised and is expected to      conclude that because of the lack of verification and the      possibility that states could conduct secret tests without      detection, the treaty is even more difficult to verify, said      officials close to the intelligence community.       Under the treaty, Russia will have six primary seismic      stations and 13 secondary stations; China will have two      primary seismic posts and four secondary facilities.       None of these stations, however, is located close enough to      the main Russian and Chinese testing facilities to be able to      detect tests conducted covertly inside underground caves, or      tests of very small nuclear blasts, the officials said.       By contrast, the United States has five primary seismic      monitoring facilities under the treaty, including one in      Nevada, where the main U.S. nuclear testing site is located.      It will also have 11 secondary sites.       Michael Pillsbury, a former acting director of the U.S.      Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said China would have      agreed to better seismic monitoring if Beijing were pushed      into it.       ``Chinese officials have told me that if the Clinton      administration had pushed harder they would have agreed to a      primary site near the test site,'' said Mr. Pillsbury, who      also took part in a recent Defense Science Task Force study      on nuclear weapons, ``but the Chinese had the impression the      Clinton administration didn't place as a high priority on      treaty verification as they did on maintaining good trade      relations.       A Senate defense specialist said Russia agreed to allow      more sensitive seismic monitors to be placed near Novaya      Zemlya, but only if the United States agreed to provide      Moscow with advanced computers and U.S. nuclear weapons      testing data. The administration refused.       On Russia, the aide said the administration faces a      dilemma. ``Either they accuse the Russians of violating the      treaty or concede the treaty cannot be verified,'' the aide      said.       U.S. intelligence agencies are now saying that ``you can      have militarily significant developments below the [seismic]      detection threshold,'' the aide said.       Administration officials have said verification is not as      important as promoting the agreement itself as a deterrent to      nuclear weapons proliferation.       ``The CIA has indicated that they cannot verify to a      hundred percent whether or not someone has conducted a      nuclear test,'' Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said      Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''       ``But we believe with this treaty, you're going to have at      least an additional 320 sites that will help monitor testing      around the world,'' he said. ``. . . We are satisfied we can      verify adequately, not a hundred percent, but satisfy      ourselves that there is no testing doing on that would put us      at any kind of a strategic disadvantage.''       Asked about the fact, that the United States cannot detect      unclear blasts below a few kiloton yield, Secretary of State      Madeleine K. Albright said: ``We can detect what we need      to.''       ``Those that are below a certain level, we do not think      would undercut our nuclear deterrent because they would be so      small that they would not affect our nuclear deterrent      capacity,'' Mrs. Albright said on ABC's ``This Week.''       A Pentagon official, however, said the Clinton      administration is supporting anti-nuclear-weapons activists      by supporting the test ban.
