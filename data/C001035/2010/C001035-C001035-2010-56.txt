Casey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 537       Whereas 62,000 Americans are diagnosed with a primary brain      tumor each year and 150,000 more are diagnosed with a      metastatic brain tumor that results from cancer spreading      from another part of the body to the brain;       Whereas brain tumors are the leading cause of death from      solid tumors in children under the age of 20 and are the      third leading cause of death from cancer in young adults ages      between the ages of 20 and 39;       Whereas brain tumors may be malignant or benign, but can be      life-threatening in either case;       Whereas 612,000 Americans have been diagnosed and are      living with a brain tumor;       Whereas the treatment of brain tumors is complicated by the      fact that more than 120 different types of brain tumors      exist;       Whereas the treatment of brain tumors presents significant      challenges because of--       (1) the location of brain tumors in an enclosed bony canal;       (2) the difficulty of delivering treatment across the      blood-brain barrier;       (3) the obstacles to complete surgical removal of the      tumors; and       (4) the serious edema that results when the blood-brain      barrier is disrupted;       Whereas brain tumors have been described as a disease that      affects the essence of ``self'';       Whereas brain tumor research is supported by a number of      private nonprofit research foundations and by institutes at      the National Institutes of Health, including the National      Cancer Institute and the National Institute for Neurological      Disorders and Stroke;       Whereas important advances have been made in understanding      brain tumors, including the genetic characterization of      glioblastoma multiforme, 1 of the deadliest forms of brain      tumor;       Whereas advances in basic research may fuel the research      and development of new treatments;       Whereas daunting obstacles still remain to the development      of new treatments, and no strategies for the screening or      early detection of brain tumors exist;       Whereas a need for greater public awareness of brain tumors      exists, including awareness of the difficulties associated      with research on brain tumors and the opportunities for      advances in brain tumor research and treatment; and       Whereas May, when brain tumor advocates nationwide unite in      awareness, outreach, and advocacy activities, would be an      appropriate month to recognize as National Brain Tumor      Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates May 2010 as ``National Brain Tumor Awareness      Month'';       (2) encourages increased awareness of brain tumors to honor      those individuals who have lost their lives to brain tumors,      as well as those individuals who are living with brain      tumors;       (3) supports efforts to develop better treatments for brain      tumors that will improve the quality of life and their long-     term prognosis of those individuals diagnosed with a brain      tumor;       (4) expresses the support of the Senate for those      individuals who are battling brain tumors, as well as the      families, friends, and caregivers of those individuals; and       (5) urges a collaborative public-private approach to brain      tumor research as the best means of advancing basic knowledge      of, and treatments for, brain tumors.
