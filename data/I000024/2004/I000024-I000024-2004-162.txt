President, I have to admit that I do not read the New YorkTimes cover to cover each day. But from time to time, items in that paper do catch my attention. For instance, when a group runs a full-page advertisement, one cannot help but at least glance at the ad.  A couple weeks ago, one such advertisement caught my attention. It was a full-page advertisement placed in the New York Times by two special interest groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council and Moveon.org. These two special interest groups are especially vocal and devoted solely to disparaging the environmental record of the Bush administration.  I have an enlarged version of that advertisement that ran in the New York Times. It is chart 1. As you can see, it states, in large print: ``First Arsenic, Now Mercury.'' It has pictures of President Bush alongside a powerplant billowing with smoke. The ad makes such claims as: the President's policies are the source for mercury contamination in fish and that the President is simply following the wishes of industry contributors. The ad makes direct statements such as: ``So why is President Bush trying to weaken controls on mercury pollution?''  I am chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, so this ad was of particular interest to me for at least a couple reasons. To anyone reading this advertisement, the reader would naturally assume there must be some already existing controls on mercury emissions from powerplants because the ad explicitly claims that President Bush is trying to weaken those controls.  How can you weaken controls if there are no controls to start with? So it is assuming there are controls existing. This claim is completely false. I believe this chart demonstrates that. The NRDC's lobbying claim is that the President is weakening controls on mercury emissions from powerplants. The facts, however, are very different.  On December 15, 2003, this President proposed the first ever controls on mercury emissions from utilities. Now, keep in mind, there were no controls before, none whatsoever. How can you weaken controls if there are no controls there?  The Clinton administration had 8 years to propose such controls and did not. In nearly 3,000 days as EPA Administrator, how many mercury regulations on powerplants did former EPA Administrator Carol Browner issue? Zero. Instead, in the last month of the eighth year of the Clinton administration, Carol Browner deftly handed a regulatory lemon to the Bush administration that she was unwilling to impose during the Clinton administration. What a courageous move.  I am very proud that President Bush and his EPA Administrator, Mike Leavitt, have shown leadership where President Clinton and Carol Browner fumbled and failed. In fact, Administrator Leavitt testified before the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air in a hearing on April 1, 2004. In questioning, the Administrator ably drew the line between fact and fiction regarding the President's proposals regulating mercury from powerplants. I want to read to you one of his quotes. The Administrator explained:       One fiction is that the EPA does not view mercury as a      toxin. The fact is mercury is a toxin and it needs to be      reduced. Another fiction is that somehow the agency is      seeking the Administration to roll back standards. The fact      is there has never been a standard, this will be the first      time that we will have regulated mercury from power plants in      our Nation's history and we want to do it right.  Now, that is what Administrator Leavitt said, reemphasizing there has been no regulation on mercury.  Why shouldn't we propose the right mercury rule based on sound science? There are no existing control standards for utility mercury emissions, so how can President Bush weaken a control standard for mercury that does not exist? That simply does not make sense.  The NRDC has been a prominent national special interest group for many years. So why would the NRDC run such an ad that is completely false? I believe the answer to that question leads me to the second reason this ad was of particular interest to me.  I had this advertisement enlarged to highlight one particular part of it. Keep in mind, this was a full-page ad that cost, as I understand it, around $110,000 for 1 day.  This is what was on the bottom, if you will notice the perforated block at the end of the full-page ad circled in red. I especially wanted to highlight this portion of the ad pictured on the chart because this block is the reason why this ad ran. This perforated block is a contribution form. The contribution form states:       Yes, I want to join the Natural Resources Defense Council      and help thwart President Bush's plan to weaken controls on      toxic mercury.  This is the most important part:       Here is my tax deductible gift of $ [blank].  The form further states to ``make your check payable to the NRDC and mail it to the NRDC mercury campaign.''  I believe it is bad enough to run a false advertisement, but to solicit charitable contributions based on that false advertisement is especially troubling. The New York Times is widely distributed in my home State of Oklahoma, as it is throughout the rest of the country. It would be very disturbing to learn that based on a false ad, people are scared into contributing.  For the past several years, my State of Oklahoma has been rated in the top 25 percent of States for charitable contributions per gross income. It would greatly trouble me if even one of these contributors was misled by any charitable solicitation.  The Council for Better Business Bureaus, a national organization, compiles a Wise Giving Alliance report authorizing a seal of approval to charities that meet the organization's standards. One of the standards the council has established to measure charities deals with solicitations by those charities. Part C of those standards states the following:       1. Solicitations and informational materials, distributed      by any means, shall be accurate, truthful and not misleading,      both in whole and in part.       2. Soliciting organizations shall substantiate on request      that solicitations and informational materials, distributed      by any means, are accurate, truthful and not misleading in      whole or in part.  The NRDC, describing itself as a charity, should substantiate this false advertisement. The President has proposed the first controls on mercury emissions from powerplants, the first ever. The Better Business Bureau should hold the NRDC accountable for their purposefully misleading statements. However, NRDC's irresponsibility is sanctionable in other manners as well.  Solicitations by charitable organizations are regulated in part by Federal statutes and case law. However, the solicitation of charitable contributions is mainly regulated by individual State law, and violations of solicitation statutes can be prosecuted under state law. Solicitation by charitable organizations is strictly regulated against fraud and misleading advertisement under the Oklahoma statutes. Oklahoma State law reads in relevant part:       Any person [or organization] who attempts to solicit any      contribution as a charitable organization by means of      knowingly false or misleading advertisement shall lose its      status as a tax exempt organization and upon conviction be      guilty of a felony.  This criminal liability extends to all officers and agents of the charity involved in the solicitation. We take this very seriously in Oklahoma. At least 40 other States have just as strict statutes against soliciting contributions by misleading advertising.  Arguably this ad by NRDC may be unlawful in as many as 40 other States that also have charitable solicitation statutes. This advertisement by the NRDC and MoveOn.org explicitly states the President is weakening mercury standards while they are trying to swindle contributions from people all across the country who may see this advertisement. I don't know what else this ad represents, but specifically NRDC, which describes itself as a charitable organization on its Web site, soliciting contributions by making knowingly false statements to cheat people out of contributions--in Oklahoma, that could make you a felon.  The most shocking part of this is not even that NRDC is running a completely false ad or NRDC is running a completely false ad simply to fleece people for contributions; the most shocking part is the American taxpayer subsidizes the NRDC hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to conduct this type of activity. Public IRSrecords for the last several years demonstrate NRDC regularly receives thousands of Federal grant dollars each year. In 2002, the NRDC received more than a half million dollars in government grants. In 2003, the NRDC was additionally awarded more than half a million dollars again in government grants. The cycle continues year after year after year.  The Environment and Public Works Committee has oversight jurisdiction over several Federal agencies. I believe my committee has the obligation to ensure Federal funds allocated to these agencies are used responsibly.  One agency in particular under the jurisdiction of the committee I chair, the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, is the Environmental Protection Agency. The committee has the responsibility to assure American taxpayers their money is going toward accomplishing the EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment.  On March 3, my committee held its first hearing into the matter in which EPA allocates grants each year. The EPA is a granting agency, allocating more than half of its $8 billion annual budget in grants to State, local, tribal governments, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and a variety of other recipients. I announced at the hearing the committee was going to take its oversight responsibilities seriously in regard to grants management, and I intend to take this responsibility seriously until real changes are made in grants management.  The committee heard testimony of problems with grants management. I am confident we will begin to make real changes with the leadership of the Bush administration and Administrator Leavitt.  However, the NRDC, for example, has made it a matter of doing business to apply for Federal grant awards that I believe help subsidize it to run ads such as this one. It costs more than $110,000 a day to run a full-page ad in the New York Times. The NRDC and MoveOn.org are spending thousands of dollars to purposely misrepresent the Bush environmental record and scare people into contributing based on those false representations.  I am announcing that I am sending letters today to the two largest judicial jurisdictions in Oklahoma and requesting those district attorneys to investigate the legality of this advertisement in Oklahoma. I am also sending a letter to the Better Business Bureau requesting that organization to more carefully consider this false advertisement in their rating of the NRDC in awarding their Wise Giving Alliance seal and ask that it formally request NRDC to substantiate its baseless claim.  I ask unanimous consent that all three letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on                                 Environment and Public Works,                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2004.     Hon. Tim Harris,     District Attorney, Tulsa County Courthouse,     Tulsa, OK.       Dear Tim: I am writing to bring to your attention an      advertisement that ran in the New York Times on March 26,      2004. A copy of this advertisement is attached to this      letter. I wanted to highlight issues of concern to me in this      advertisement. The New York Times is widely distributed in      Tulsa, Oklahoma, throughout Oklahoma, and the rest of the      country. This advertisement makes claims that due to      President Bush's policies concerning environmental protection      specifically concerned regulations on mercury emissions from      public utilities, more toxic mercury will be emitted into the      air. It pictures President Bush next to a picture of a power      plant billowing with smoke, and specifically solicits      contributions to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a IRS      designated 501(c)(3) organization, to ``help thwart President      Bush's plan to weaken controls on toxic mercury.''       As you are aware, I am Chairman of the U.S. Senate      Committee on Environment and Public Works, so this      advertisement was of particular interest to me. One of the      issues before this Congress is regulation emissions from      power plants. President Bush has proposed the first controls      on toxic mercury emissions from utilities. Currently there      are no existing controls on mercury emissions from utilities.      The Clinton Administration had eight years to propose such      controls and did not. I believe NRDC's claim that President      Bush is trying to weaken control on mercury pollution is      completely false and simply an effort to raise contributions.       It is irresponsible enough that NRDC runs false      advertising, however, it is also attempting to solicit      contributions as a 501(c)(3) and self-described charitable      organization.       I understand that there are federal statues governing      charitable solicitations, but I also know that Oklahoma state      statutes address perceived false solicitation by a charitable      organization under The Oklahoma Solicitation of Charitable      Contributions Act (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.1 et seq). What I      find particularly interesting is the penalties section of the      Act stating the following:       ``Any person who solicits or attempts to solicit any      contribution as a charitable organization or for a charitable      purpose by means of knowingly false or misleading      representation, advertisement or promise or any person      violating the provisions of this act, including the filing of      false information hereunder, shall lose its status as a tax-     exempt organization, and shall be taxed in the same manner      and at the same rate as any other corporation, and shall upon      conviction be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to      exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment in      the State Penitentiary for not more than two (2) years, or by      both such fine and imprisonment, and every officer or agent      of a charitable organization who authorizes or conducts      illegal solicitations shall be jointly and severally liable      for such fine.'' (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.18).       I know that your office is continually engaged in      prosecuting hundreds of felony cases each year with      tremendous success. As a resident of your jurisdiction, I      appreciate the work of your office. Any attention that your      office could provide to this matter would be greatly      appreciated. I intend to highlight the irresponsible      activities, like the enclosed advertisement, by groups like      NRDC that the federal government subsidizes with hundreds of      thousands of taxpayer dollars in grants and other financial      assistance each year.       Thank you again for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                  James M. Inhofe,     Chairman.                                  ____   First Arsenic Now Mercury--George Bush's EPA and the Politics of                                Pollution       America learned this week that tuna, and many other fish,      can contain harmful levels of toxic mercury. Forty-five      states already post warnings of mercury contamination in      their lakes and streams. So why is President Bush trying to      weaken controls on mercury pollution?       It's deja vu all over again. Early in his presidency,      George Bush tried to allow more arsenic in drinking water.      Now, he wants the EPA to let coal-fired power plants treat      their mercury pollution as ``non-hazardous'' even though      mercury threatens pregnant women and children.       The Bush administration's ploy would allow coal-fired power      plants to put more mercury into the air, where it rains down      on lakes and oceans, is swallowed by fish, and could wind up      on your plate. Exposure to mercury can cause learning      disabilities and neurological damage in kids and the      developing fetus.       Guess who is praising this scheme? Coal power companies,      who are big mercury polluters and big political contributors,      too.                        the mercury money trail       The big mercury polluters and their trade associations are      aggressive political players in Washington. Their executives      and PACs are also generous political donors. It's no surprise      that the Bush administration is following the industry's      script for weakening mercury regulations.       Last time around, President Bush had to back down on      arsenic in the face of a massive outcry from people across      the political spectrum.       Let's make history repeat itself.       Tell President Bush to get serious about reducing mercury      pollution. Our kids deserve no less. Let the Bush      administration and the EPA hear your voice about its proposed      mercury rule.

As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment      and Public Works, this advertisement was of particular      interest to me. One of the issues considered before the      Congress is multi-emissions legislation. On December 15,      2003, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first      controls on toxic mercury emissions from power plants.

I request that the      Council require the NRDC to substantiate its claims and      consider this false advertisement in future ratings of this      charity.
