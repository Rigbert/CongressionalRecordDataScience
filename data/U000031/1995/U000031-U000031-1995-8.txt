Speaker, actually it was 260, not 280, Democrats that voted for it. But the outcome was the same.  As we go back home to our districts, people ask us, ``Why don't you take some action? What is going on?'' This is exactly the same vote in essence of what we did with the Durbin-Bennett vote on the gulf war, and, that is, Congress ought to have a say in what goes on. It does not say whether we will approve it or not, but Congress ought to have a say. And this vote, of which your side of the aisle voted 260 to 5, ought to reflect that on this resolution, which does virtually exactly the same thing.
