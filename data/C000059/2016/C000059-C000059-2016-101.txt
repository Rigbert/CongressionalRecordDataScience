 I appreciate the gentleman's interest in forestry issues and his support for changing the way we budget for catastrophic wildland fires. An increase in the Forest Service's research capability will help address our forest management issues. I support the amendment, and I certainly urge its adoption.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
