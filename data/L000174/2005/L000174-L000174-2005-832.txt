President, my amendment, cosponsored by my friend and colleague, Senator Cantwell, would greatly assist the many victims of domestic violence whose physical well-being or whose children's physical well-being would be threatened by summary eviction as a result of filing or bankruptcy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of our amendment be printed in the Record after my remarks.
