But there is no real technology based security being applied to containers being shipped to the United States of America. Less than 5 percent are inspected. No one is going to shoot a missile at us, but if they can get ahold of a nuclear weapon they will put it in a container and ship it here.  Let's look at the great C-TPAT program they are waxing on about. It is an honor system. You fill out an on-line form and your containers automatically are ranked less of a threat.  Now, sometime, 1 to 3 years later, the U.S. might send an inspector by, with prior notice, 1 day to look at your factory. That day you shoo all the al Qaeda people out and say don't come in tomorrow; the U.S. is sending a guy by for 1 day. And then you go back to business. This is an incredibly ridiculous program that does not provide real security.  Is there a threat? Well, I think there is a threat because the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security says the goal of this administration and the Republican majority is not to inspect containers before they leave foreign ports. His goal, at home, our goal is to have 100 percent inspection of all containers as they depart a U.S. port headed into our country. The ports are sacrifice zones is what they are telling us here, because they might contain a threat. So we have to inspect them before they go from Seattle inland to somewhere in the Pacific Northwest but not before they get to Seattle.                              {time}  1045  The place to inspect is on the other side of the ocean, and it can be done without disturbing commerce. It has been proven in Hong Kong. They will say it is not technologically feasible. If that is so, then why do we endorse this same technology, these same bureaucracies, for the CSI program and the Megaports program? The Bush administration's bureaucracy says the technologies do work.  They say the technologies do not work. They say they will delay cargo. They are being used in Hong Kong. You can drive a truck past at 10 miles per hour.  They say, well, no one is reading the data. Why is no one reading the data? Because the U.S. will not assign people to read the data.  This is incredible. This loophole-ridden system has to stop. We need real security. You should have allowed an amendment. Why are you afraid to vote on an amendment for 100 percent screening?
