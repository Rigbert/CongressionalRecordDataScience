If I could go through a couple of these bills. The defense authorization bill, Mr. Leader, do you expect at this point in time to have that on a particular day of the week? Do we know when that will be?  Mr. DeLAY. While it is certainly subject to change, I would expect us to consider the stem cell bill on Tuesday, followed on Tuesday by the energy and water bill. Hopefully, we could finish that bill by Tuesday night and start the DOD authorization bill on Wednesday and Thursday, if necessary, and complete the week with the military quality of life appropriations bill.
