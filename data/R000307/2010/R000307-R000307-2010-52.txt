President.  This motion commits the bill back to the Finance Committee with instructions to repeal ``the four rationers'' of health care reform. These four horsemen of the rationing apocalypse are the Patient Center Outcomes Research Institute, already conducting research that will be used to deny coverage and ration care; the CMS Innovation Center, which will grant new powers to CMS--that should be a pleasant thought by any beleaguered hospital administrator--the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is given new powers--that is the outfit that said women should not have mammograms until age 50--wonderful--and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, vested with extraordinary power to set Medicare payment rates and make policy decisions.  These rationers comprise the infrastructure for the ``Brave New World'' of big government intrusion into health care decisions of all Americans, and they must be repealed.  Start over. Put patient care first. Get them back in the corral. Support the amendment.
