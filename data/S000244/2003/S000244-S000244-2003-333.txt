Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 330, the Veterans' Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003. Attacks against Federal cemeteries and veterans' memorials uniquely affront the memory of those who have sacrificed for our freedom and undermineour collective commitment to honor their service. The egregious nature of these crimes necessitates a swift and decisive Federal response.  S. 330 establishes a specific criminal penalty for the willful destruction of property commemorating service in America's Armed Forces. It provides that anyone who willfully injures or destroys or attempts to injure or destroy property that commemorates service in our Armed Forces shall be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined for these acts of vandalism.  In 1997, Congress passed legislation that directed the United States Sentencing Commission to enhance penalties for the destruction of property on Federal cemeteries. However, unlike the earlier legislation, S. 330 specifically recognizes the abhorrent nature of these offenses by establishing a new Federal crime for injuring or destroying veterans' memorials. Its purpose is to stem the disturbing prevalence of vandalism at some of America's most sacred memorials.  In considering this legislation, I urge my colleagues to heed the admonitions of General John A. Logan's Memorial Day Order of May 5, 1868. Speaking to those who had fallen in America's defense, General Logan stated: ``We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All the consecrated wealth and taste of the Nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders. Let no wanton foot tread rudely on such hallowed grounds. Let no vandalism or avarice or neglect, no ravages of time, testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten, as a people, the cost of a free and undivided Republic.''                              {time}  1015  S. 330 was reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary without amendment and passed the full Senate under unanimous consent.  As our Nation prepares to honor its veterans this Memorial Day, I can think of few times in recent memory when this legislation would be more timely and appropriate.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record an exchange of letters between the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), and myself.                                         House of Representatives,               Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2003.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I am writing with regard to S.      330, the Veteran's Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act      of 2003. As you know, the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure was named as an additional Committee of      jurisdiction.       I recognize your desire to bring this important bill before      the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I will not      exercise my Committee's right to mark up the legislation. By      agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill, however, the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive      its jurisdiction over S. 330. In addition, the Transportation      and Infrastructure Committee reserves its right to seek      conferees on provisions of the bill that are within its      jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be      convened on this legislation. I ask for your commitment to      support any request by the Transportation and Infrastructure      Committee for conferees on S. 330.       I request that you include a copy of our exchange of      letters in your Committee's Report on S. 330 and in the      Congressional Record during consideration on the House Floor.      Thank you.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2003.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: This letter responds to your letter      dated May 19, 2003 concerning S. 330, the ``Veterans'      Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003.''       I agree that the bill contains matters within the      Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's jurisdiction      and appreciate your willingness to be discharged from further      consideration of S. 330 so we may proceed to the floor. I      acknowledge that by being discharged, your committee in no      way waives its jurisdiction over these matters.       Pursuant to your request, a copy of your letter and this      letter will be included in the Committee on the Judiciary's      report on S. 330 and in the Congressional Record during House      floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your attention      to this matter.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
