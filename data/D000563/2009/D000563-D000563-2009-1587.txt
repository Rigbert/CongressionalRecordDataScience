HATCH. Certainly not. And as the Senator knows, many States today provide that care to legal immigrants through CHIP or otherwise. And let me emphasize that all expenses are supposed to be provided by the sponsoring families for 5 years. If that was the wrong time or it should have been shortened, I would have worked with the distinguished Senator to do that. But that was the deal. That was the rule. That was what we worked on. That is what we thought would work. That is what we thought was fair.  What I don't want to do is have our own children who are U.S. citizens be without care while we cover those who were supposed to be covered by their sponsor families who brought them to the United States.
