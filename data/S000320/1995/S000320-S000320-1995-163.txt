 President, today I am introducing a bill to help strengthen the role of the family in America. With the hustle and bustle of the world today, we sometimes overlook simple, commonsense ways to help one another. My bill, entitled ``Adoption Assistance for Families Act,'' would effectively find homes for children who need parents and find children for parents who need families. Mr. President, the objective of my legislation is to provide an appropriate and reasonable incentive to encourage a policy which should be embraced by all Americans.  Adoption is a positive action that benefits everyone involved. Obviously, a loving, caring family is the primary benefit of adoption. Studies show the child also receives a strong self identity, positive psychological health and a tendency of financial well-being.  On the other hand, parents who adopt children also benefit. They receive the joy and responsibility of raising a child as well as the love and respect only a child can give. The emotional fulfillment of raising children clearly contribute to the fullness of life.  Lastly, do not forget society. Society is unambiguously better off as a result of adoption. Statistics show time and again that children with families intact are more likely to become productive members of society than children without both parents.  Unfortunately more times than not, a financial barrier stands in the way of otherwise qualified parents-to-be. The monthly costs of supporting the child [[Page S3750]] is not the hurdle, but instead the initial outlay. Many people may not realize, but there are many fees and costs involved with adopting a child. These include: maternity home care, normal prenatal and hospital care for the mother and child, preadoption foster care for the infant, home study fees, and legal fees. These costs can range anywhere from about $13,000 to $36,000 according to the National Council for Adoption.  Just like the person who wants to buy a home, but cannot because the financial hurdle of a downpayment stops them, so are the parents-to-be who cannot adopt a child because of the substantial initial fees, fees that could actually exceed the cost of a downpayment for a house. As a result, the benefits to everyone involved never materialize; children do not receive loving parents and married couples are prohibited from welcoming children into their compassionate family.  My bill seeks to address this problem. The Adoption Assistance for Families Act would allow a $5,000 refundable tax credit for adoption expenses. This credit would be fully available to any individual with an income up to $60,000 and phased out up to an income of $100,000.  I believe this tax credit will go a long way in helping children find the caring homes they so desperately need. This legislation would undeniably benefit children, parents, and society as a whole. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in reaching out to families in order to provide a better, brighter future for our children and a heightened degree of appreciation for the potential life holds.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______      By
