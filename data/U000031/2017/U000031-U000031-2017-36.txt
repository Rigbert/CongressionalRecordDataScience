Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DeSantis) having assumed the chair, Mr. Estes of Kansas, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3043) to modernize hydropower policy, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
