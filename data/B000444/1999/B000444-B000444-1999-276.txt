 President, I want to take this opportunity today to salute a distinguished servant of the legislative branch of the U.S. Congress in the field of foreign affairs. In June 1999, Dr. Robert Sutter will leave the Congressional Research Service after 22 highly productive years as a source of expertise on China and the Asia-Pacific region. Dr. Sutter is resigning from his current position as a Senior Specialist in Asia and International Politics in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of CRS to become the National Intelligence Officer for East Asia, a critical intelligence community assignment.  Since 1977, when he first came to work at CRS as a China specialist, Dr. Sutter has provided Members of Congress and their staffs with authoritative, in-depth analysis and policy options covering a broad range of foreign policy issues involving China, East Asia, and the Pacific. It should be a matter of pride to this body to know that Dr. Sutter is well known both here and in the Asia-Pacific region as one of the most authoritative and productive American Asia hands.  In his government career to date of over 30 years, Dr. Sutter has held a variety of analytical and supervisory positions including service with the Foreign Broadcast Information Service and temporary details with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of State. It is in service to Congress, however, specifically with the Congressional Research Service, that Dr. Sutter has spent most of his distinguished career. I want to make a few comments that illustrate the strengths and great contributions of both the institution and the man himself.  The first point to make concerns one of the great institutional strengths that CRS offers to the congressional clients it serves, and which Dr. Sutter's tenure and contributions here epitomize perfectly: institutional memory. Dr. Sutter's first published report at CRS was entitled U.S.-PRC Normalization Arguments and Alternatives. Published first as a CRS Report for general congressional use, on August 3, 1977, it soon became a Committee Print of the House International Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. The report and subsequent Committee Print addressed a number of highly controversial issues arising out of President Carter's decision to normalize relations with China. Congressional concern about the consequences of derecognition of the Republic of China, and dissatisfaction with the terms of the agreement negotiated with the People's Republic of China, directly led to the landmark Taiwan Relations Act, which still governs our policy decisions today, and which continues in 1999 to be a factor in debates in this very chamber.  Besides Bob Sutter, only 48 Members of Congress serving today, in the 106th Congress, were here in 1977 and 1978 to witness these initial steps of U.S.-China relations. In the more than 20 years since then, both U.S.-China relations and the U.S. Congress itself have undergone tremendous change, both for the better and for worse. Bob Sutter has been an active participant in congressional deliberations on China policy, and in the U.S. national debate over these issues, from normalization of relations, to the Tiananmen Square crackdown, to the recent tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Dr. Sutter's two decades of service spanned the tenures for four U.S. presidents and some ten Congresses. Despite several shifts of party control in the Senate, and one  in the House, Dr. Sutter continued to deliver timely, accurate, objective, and non-partisan analysis. The institutional memory represented by CRS analysts, which Dr. Sutter so perfectly exemplifies, is of incalculable value to the work of the Congress.  The second point I want to make concerns Dr. Sutter himself. He has, for one thing, consistently demonstrated an astonishing capacity for work. In 1974 Dr. Sutter received his Ph.D. in History and East Asian Languages from Harvard University, writing his Ph.D. thesis while maintaining a full-time job. Routinely, he has been one of--perhaps the most in terms of sheer output of written work--productive analysts in CRS. In the last 5 years alone, Dr. Sutter has been called on for advice from Members of Congress and their staffs nearly 6,000 times--an average of 1,140 times each year. He has regularly maintained six or more ongoing, continually updated products, and his output of CRS written reports for Congress totals at least 90 since late 1987 alone. As is evident in these products, he excels at providing accurate, succinct, and well-organized analysis of congressional policy choices and their likely consequences. His work always reflects up to date knowledge of issues, usually based on personal research in East Asia and/or close contact with the U.S. private and official community of Asian analysts and scholars.  Even more to the point, Dr. Sutter has always understood the powers and special needs of Congress, including its legislative and oversight responsibilities, and our obligation to representthe interests of our constituents. In his research and writing, Dr. Sutter never forgets the unique role of Congress and the importance of reflecting the full range of competing viewpoints.  Reflecting his commitment to service and cheerful willingness to assume responsibility, Dr. Sutter has fulfilled a number of roles in the CRS. He has served as Chief of the Foreign Affairs Division in CRS, as well as Chief of the Government Division in CRS, in both cases maintaining a full research work load for Congress in the midst of significant management duties. He has frequently conceived, coordinated, and moderated Asia policy seminars and workshops for Members of Congress and their staffs. He routinely serves on special advisory groups in CRS and the Library of Congress. As a well-known and respected analyst, he has been a sought-after speaker at dozens of foreign policy seminars, panels, and conferences in Washington and around the world.  In recent years, he has maintained this outstanding record of productivity for the Congress while managing in his spare time to teach several college courses per year at Washington area universities. He has also found time to write more than a dozen books on foreign policy issues during his tenure at CRS.  Finally, Dr. Sutter's simple decency, modesty, engaging manner, and professionalism set a high standard for others and make it a great pleasure to work with him. He cheerfully volunteers for onerous tasks. He is pleasant and good-humored. Moreover, in the midst of the pressured environment of Washington and Capitol Hill, he has always found time to serve as a mentor, counselor, and friend to others, whether they be his own students, younger colleagues, or new congressional staff. And, a fact known only to close friends, he has a record of community service, including Church work and teaching of English to native Spanish speakers, that is nearly as impressive as his professional contribution.  Dr. Sutter will be greatly missed, but the loss of his service to the Congress will be partly compensated for by bringing to the Executive branch his knowledge of the Congress and its special role in the making and oversight of U.S. foreign policy. When he comes back to Capitol Hill for one-on-one meetings, briefings, and testimony, he will bring with him a high degree of credibility and a special awareness of congressional needs for information and analysis.                          ____________________
