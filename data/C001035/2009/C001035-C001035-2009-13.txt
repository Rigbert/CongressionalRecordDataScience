President, I wish to congratulate the president and CEO of Maine Motor Transport Association, Dale Hanington, on his retirement. The men and women of Maine's trucking industry are grateful for his determined and effective leadership. I am grateful for his guidance and support on transportation legislation, and for his friendship.  Dale, a Maine native who earned his bachelor's degree in business administration, retired from the Maine State police at the rank of lieutenant after 20 years of service. After retiring from the Maine State police, he served as a safety engineer with a large construction company for 2 years. In 1989, Dale joined the Maine Motor Transport Association as assistant to the executive director, and he became the president and CEO of the association in 1993.  Dale has been a strong advocate for Maine's most important transportation needs, including raising the Federal truck weight limit in Maine, which we have worked together tirelessly to address. With Dale's help and support, we finally have made progress in securing a 1-year truck weight pilot project for Maine.  I am grateful for our strong working relationship over the years. I offer my sincerest appreciation to Dale for his service and congratulations on a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
