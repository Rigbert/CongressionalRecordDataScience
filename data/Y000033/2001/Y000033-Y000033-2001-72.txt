Mr. Chairman, at this point, I would make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment includes an emergency designation under section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985; and as such constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. I ask for a ruling from the Chair.
