President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Competition Policy, by cosponsoring once again the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels, NOPEC, Act. I thank Senator Kohl for his leadership on this important issue, and Senators Specter, Grassley, Feingold, Snowe, Schumer, Durbin, Boxer and Coburn the other cosponsors, for their continued support of this critically important effort.  The collusive behavior of certain oil producing nations has artificially--and drastically reduced the supply and inflated the price of fuel. Put simply, the behavior of these oil cartels, which would be illegal under antitrust laws, grievously harms American consumers and businesses.  We have introduced this measure in each of the last four Congresses. We introduce it again today, in our never-ending effort to make OPEC accountable for its anticompetitive behavior by allowing the Justice Department to crack down on illegal price manipulation by oil cartels.  This bill will allow the Federal Government to take legal action against any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing and artificially limiting the amount of available oil. While OPEC actions remain protected from antitrust enforcement, the ability of the governments involved to wreak havoc on the American economy will remain unchecked.  When the President took office, Americans could fill their cars, heat their homes, and run their businesses on gasoline that cost $1.45 a gallon. Fuel prices have skyrocketed since then. Prices will at times fall, but because fuel prices are not properly subject to competition oversight and enforcement, the American consumer will only benefit from lower prices when it serves some other purpose of the cartel and foreign governments.  President Bush has said he is concerned about gasoline costs and has pledged that the government would keep a close watch on unacceptable profiteering. It is time for the President to join us in supporting this legislation.  Our antitrust laws have been called the ``Magna Carta of free enterprise.'' If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this type of behavior, it would already be subject to them. It is wrong to let OPEC producers off the hook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of national governments. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to say ``No'' to OPEC.                                 ______                                       By
