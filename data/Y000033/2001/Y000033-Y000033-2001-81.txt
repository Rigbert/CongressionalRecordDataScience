Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman from North Carolina that the funding in this bill is for the purpose of reinstituting full broadcast service to the people of New York City. The NTIA will make the funding available to the stations as soon as the most appropriate location of the replacement tower is secured.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague from Alabama for a brief statement.
