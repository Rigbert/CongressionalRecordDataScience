 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I want to echo the remarks of the gentleman from Mr. Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht).  Mr. Speaker, I think there is a lot to be said for the underlying bill. I think the Democratic amendment makes the bill stronger, but I am going to vote against the Republican bill and the Democratic alternative because in my State and throughout this country, there are huge numbers of workers who were promised benefits when they signed up for the job, and then those benefits were taken away from them in the dead of night when the defined benefits that they had signed on for were converted into cash balance payments.  I personally regard it as an immoral outrage that IBM, among many other companies, which has a CEO that has received $175 million in compensation in a 2-year period, has $500 million in unexercised stock options, felt it necessary when they had a pension surplus to cut back on the pension promises made to tens of thousands of their workers, not to mention the health care promises made to their retirees.  Mr. Speaker, it is my intention to offer a motion to recommit, which is cosponsored by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht), among others, which basically says that when a company makes an agreement with a worker and promises defined benefit, that they cannot simply in the middle of the night change their minds and convert that to a cash balance payment which could cost those workers up to 50 percent of the benefits that they were promised.  All over this country there is what I call pension anxiety, and that is workers who are 50-55 years of age who are wondering whether or not they will receive the benefits, the retirement benefits, they were promised. I think they should, and I think it is unfortunate that the underlying bill and the amendment do not address this important issue.                              {time}  1415
