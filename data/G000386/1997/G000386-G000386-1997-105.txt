 President, I rise today to introduce the Working Family Farmer Protection Act of 1997. As the only family farmer in the Senate, I feel I have a unique responsibility to make sure that family farming remains a strong and vibrant part of American life. For generations, family farms have fed this country. But the global marketplace presents some new and unique challenges to the family farmer. That's why I'm introducing the Family Farmer Protection Act today, on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin.  This bill makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code permanent. Currently, chapter 12 is due to expire in 1998, and I think it would be a terrible error if this Congress did not act now to reauthorize chapter 12 on a permanent basis.  In order to understand why we need to make chapter 12 permanent, I think we have to go back a decade or so to the 1980's farm crisis. During the mid-1980's, the agricultural economy in the Midwest took a sharp downturn. And many family farmers were forced into bankruptcy. At that time, the only choice a family farmer had was to go into chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11, the creditors form a committee and help to draw up a reorganization plan. Most family farms only had one major creditor--the bank with the mortgage on the farm. And that one creditor was able to keep farmers from reorganizing in an effective way. As a result, the family farmers who filed chapter 11 were frequently forced out of farming. In short, the family farm was on a fast track to extinction, and family farmers were fast becoming an endangered species.  That's why in 1986 I drafted an entirely new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code to preserve the family farm. That chapter is chapter 12. Chapter 12 simply limits the power of the bank to exercise a veto over a farmer's reorganization plan.  I think it's very important to realize that chapter 12 is not a handout or a get-out-of-debt-free card. Farmers are hard-working people who want the chance to earn their way. In fact, chapter 12 is modeled on chapter 13, where individuals set up plans to repay a portion of their debts.  Chapter 12 has been wildly successful. So many times in Washington we develop programs and laws with the best of intentions. But when these programs get to the real world, they don't work well. Chapter 12, on the other hand, has worked exactly as intended. According to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent of family farmers who filedchapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming and 61 percent of farmers who went through chapter 12 believe that chapter 12 was helpful in getting farmers back on their feet.  In conclusion, chapter 12 works and it works well. Let's make sure that we keep this safety net for family farmers in place. I urge my colleagues to think of this bill as a low-cost insurance policy for an important part of America's economy and America's heritage.                                 ______                                       By
