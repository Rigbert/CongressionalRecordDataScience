 One of the outrages of what is going on in terms of the overall budget that the Republicans are bringing forth is, you know, I always get a kick out of, on Veterans Day, all the politicians going out, thank you, veterans, for all of your sacrifices. God only knows the terrible sacrifices in World War II and Korea and Vietnam and elsewhere that your veterans made, many of them wounded in body and in spirit. Yet the Republican budget over a 7-year period would make slashing cuts in the VA and in veterans' programs.  Right now, thank God, last night we were able to late at night, as you know, we were able to make sure that our veterans' pensions and their compensation checks were able to go out, but in fact the VA still remains largely closed down. And those people who want to apply for new VA veterans' benefits are unable to do so while this Congress goes into recess.
