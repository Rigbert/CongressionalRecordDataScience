  I think the proof basically is in the pudding. If our current trade policy in terms of NAFTA, in terms of GATT, in terms of MFN with China was a success, then we would see it. We would see it, and how would we see it? Well, we would see that wages for middle class and for working people would have gone up. That is what we would have seen. That is what a success is. People would be making more money.  But what is the reality? The reality is that in 1973 the average American worker earned $445 a week. Twenty years later, taking inflation into account, that same worker was making $373 a week. Real wages have declined precipitously.  Now if this trade policy was working so well, then the working men and women of this country would be working fewer hours, they would have more time to spend with their kids and with their families.  Family values; we all remember that expression. But I will tell you something going on in Vermont that I expect all over this country is that theworking families in my State are working longer hours. In the State of Vermont we have many workers who do not have one job, who do not have two jobs; they have three jobs, and many women who would prefer to stay home with the kids are now forced to go out and work because the family needs two breadwinners.  So where is the success of this trade policy? Is it working well? Well, we have to acknowledge, yes, it is working well for some. We were all delighted to read several weeks ago that the CEO's of major American corporations last year saw a 54-percent increase in their compensation. Hey, that is not too bad; a 54-percent increase. The average worker barely kept up with inflation, and some workers went below inflation, continue to see a decline in their standards of living.                              {time}  2045  The average CEO is now making over 200 times what the workers in the company are earning, which gives us by far the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the entire industrialized world.  So I think there is a little bit of confusion when our friends in the corporate media tell us how good our trade policy is doing. They hang out at the country clubs with their other rich friends and they all talk to each other and say, ``Hey, how are things going, Joe?'' ``Pretty good. Made 60 percent more this year than last year.'' Write an editorial, things are going really good.  But they forget to go into the small business community and they forget to go into the factories and into the plants. Talk to workers there and what do the workers say? They say, ``They cut back on our health care benefits, they lowered our wages, they are forcing us to work more hours for less pay.'' But that is the part of America that we do not see reflected here in this Congress very often, we do not see reflected in the editorial pages of America's newspapers.  The whole issue of so-called free trade is not very complicated. Just imagine any community in America, any normal community, and just suddenly see the size of that community double and that the people who came in were prepared and forced to work for 20 cents an hour or 40 cents an hour.  Now, what do we think would happen to wages and benefits in that community? It does not take a Ph.D. in economics to figure it out. Employers would much prefer to pay people 20 cents an hour or 40 cents an hour. I think in Vietnam now they have gone down to 6 cents, that Nike has finally reached the lowest of the low, that in Vietnam they can hire people at 6 cents an hour. So what do you think happens in a community with wages? They go down and benefits go down.  So-called free trade that exists right now, whether it is MFN with China or NAFTA, is an effort by corporate America to take decent-paying jobs in this country to desperate Third World countries, exploit the people there, rather than pay American workers a decent wage.  It seems to me that our challenge is not only to end the exploitation of Third World workers, but to develop trade policy and tax policies that say to the Nikes and the other major corporations in this country, ``Hey, come back to this country. If you want Americans to consume your products, how about giving them a chance to manufacture those products?''  I think this is the crux of the entire economic crisis that we are facing. We have to get a handle on this trade crisis, or else we are going to see the middle class continuing to decline and the standard of living of working people go down and down.
