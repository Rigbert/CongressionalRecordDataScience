 President, I am introducing today legislation to ensure that the Board of Veterans' Appeals errs on behalf of our veterans rather than on the side of the Federal Government. Specifically, my legislation will allow a veteran to correct a rating decision which is a clear and unmistakable error.  I am pleased to be joining with Congressman Lane Evans in introducing this legislation. Congressman Evans has been a champion in this cause and he has shepherded clear and unmistakable error legislation through the House of Representatives in the last two Congresses. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee will markup this legislation later this week; again, paving the way for House passage of this legislation. This is the first time that Senate legislation has been introduced on clear and unmistakable error. I look forward to working with my colleagues at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to raise the profile of this issue in the Senate in the coming days.  Since joining the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in the last Congress, I have made it a priority to work closely with the veterans of my State. This legislative initiative is a direct result of that partnership between my office and the veterans of Washington State. Several veterans service organizations have contacted me in support of this legislation, and I do also know that this issue is a priority for the Disabled American Veterans.  For the record, I want to detail a vivid example of a clear and unmistakable error. The Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for rating disabilities prescribes a 40-percent disability rating for an amputation of the leg below the knee and a 60-percent disability rating for an amputation of the leg above the knee. In an instance where a veteran had an above the knee amputation but was assigned a 40-percent rating, the rating decision is indisputably wrong--clear and unmistakably wrong. My legislation would ensure that egregious errors like this at any administrative level of adjudication would be subject to review.  In recent months, I've handled several cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs that directly involved clear and unmistakable error. In one case, a veteran with a serious shoulder injury dating back to the Vietnam war was rated incorrectly for more than 20 years. In another case, a veteran with PTSD also dating to service in Vietnam was misdiagnosed for a lengthy period, affecting his disability rating and benefits and the treatment he received. To the VA's credit, some cases of clear and unmistakable error are reversible but it depends on where the veteran is in the VA process. Some cases of clear and unmistakable error no longer offer recourse to the veteran. My legislation seeks to correct this. I believe that we must make available every opportunity to right a wrong on behalf of a veteran.  Importantly, this legislation will also allow a veteran who under current law cannot seek to have a clear and unmistakable error claim reviewed the opportunity to request that the Board of Veterans' Appeals review its prior decision. So often we in Congress talk about providing for veterans or about meeting our obligations to veterans. That is what this bill is all about; it gives a veteran the right to request a review rather than subjecting an ailing vet to a sometimes faceless bureaucracy hesitant to correct its mistakes.  This issue has been cast by some as arcane and complicated. And it is. But let me break it down to its most basic element for the Members of the Senate. Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that have deprived and continue to deprive veterans of benefits for which their entitlement is undeniable. To deny a veteran due to a bureaucratic mistake is beyond comprehension. When I first heard of this problem, I doubted the severity of the problem. But for a small number of veterans, the problem is real, very real, and it is causing hardships for some in meeting the challenges of everyday life.  The Congressional Budget Office determined a previous version of this legislation to be budget neutral. Stated another way, this legislation would not require additional resources for the VA or take needed resources from other VA programs or benefits.  The Department of Veterans Affairs does have a number of objections to the legislation. I do look forward to working with Secretary Jesse Brown to address these concerns so that this important veterans legislation can go forward. Secretary Brown is the most passionate advocate for veterans within government service. I have every confidence that he will work with me and other concerned Members to ensure that the VA works for the veteran.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to review this legislation and join me as cosponsors of this important initiative on behalf of veterans.                                 ______                                       By
