President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of citizens in Decatur, IL, who noticed a serious problem in their community, banded together to develop a solution to this problem, and then saw this practical solution through with a strong sense of commitment and compassion.  All over this country, communities like Decatur are responding to the realization that the experiences of the earliest years of life have a powerful influence on how human beings develop. Research indicates that young children are developing brain patterns which will affect everything they do for the rest of their lives. The way they process information, the way they relate to other people, their abilities in every domain--these important human functions are being written on the minds of children at a time in their lives when basic needs often go unmet. We often realize the importance of this time only when it is too late to go back and fill in the gaps--when these children fail in school or commit a crime or become a burden to society.  The people of Decatur, IL realized that the most important resource every child must have is a loving adult who cares for them, understands their needs, and makes that child a priority. How can we encourage parents to nurture their own children? How can we take advantage of this wonderful window of opportunity for young children by making sure they are loved and encouraged to develop?  My friends in Decatur pondered these very questions in 1986 and the result is Baby Talk. Baby Talk is a community collaboration that reaches out to all parents of very young children and gives them the support that they need. This project is a joint effort of schools, hospitals, libraries, health clinics, Head Start, literacy projects, and local government. Baby Talk establishes a relationship with every family who has a newborn child in order to offer encouragement and support for the most important task they will ever undertake--raising a child.  Baby Talk delivers programs where parents and children already are. In this way, Baby Talk reaches the entire population of child raising families casting a net of support over the community. Every parent of a child born in one of Decatur's two hospitals, receives a personal visit from Baby Talk to learn about their newborn's abilities and needs. Parents receive a book and advice about how to read aloud with their child. They also receive a magnet with the Baby Talk telephone number to call for assistance.  Information about predictable challenges and encouragement for parents are provided at child clinics and through letters sent to families every 2 to 3 months through the child's first 3 years. ``Baby Talk Times'' and ``Lapsit'' groups meet weekly at many locations where parents and children play, sing, read books, and share their challenges and achievements.  Parents who did not finish high school participate in Baby Talk's Even Start program where comprehensive family literacy programming is offered at the health department and Head Start.  Baby Talk makes 4,000 contacts monthly with parents and children of different backgrounds and income levels. Fortunately, this service does not exist only in Decatur. Professionals from 30 States and Canada have received training and materials from the Baby Talk organization to serve families in their communities.  Baby Talk has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for meeting Goal One of the America 2000 Strategy: ``That by the year 2000, all children will start school ready to learn.''  Recently, Baby Talk celebrated its 10th anniversary with the announcement that it has served the families of 20,000 babies. I would specifically like to commend the efforts of Claudia Quigg who was the initial pioneer of this effort and currently acts as Baby Talk's executive director. Through the efforts of Ms. Quigg and many other dedicated Baby Talk staff members, the city of Decatur is investing in its future and putting into practice their belief that a stitch in time saves nine.  We are looking forward to the years ahead when thousands of Baby Talk children grow up to be caring, successful, and productive citizens. I present Baby Talk as an example of what can be accomplished when a community pulls together and stays committed to an important goal. I am very proud to have this organization performing their good works in my State and I hope others can learn from the accomplishments that Baby Talk has had in Illinois.                          ____________________
