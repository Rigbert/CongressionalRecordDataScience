Speaker, I rise to comment on yesterday's debacle. Some rose and said that this was legitimate campaign finance reform. The American public wants campaign finance reform. They do not want money to be the arbiter of the politics of America. They want money contributed honestly and reported effectively.  The chairman of the Committee on House Oversight, who offered these bills to the Congress, had one principal large bill. That bill, he said, would pass. We said it was a sham. The New York Times said it was a sham. The Washington Post said it was a sham. We were criticized on our side of the aisle for being partisan and saying it was a sham.  But, Mr. Speaker, when the vote was called, two-thirds of the majority party voted against their leadership's bill, including their leadership.  It was, indeed, a sham.                          ____________________
