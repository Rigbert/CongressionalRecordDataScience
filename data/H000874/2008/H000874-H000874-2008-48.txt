There have been discussions, as you know, on timing with the White House. I don't know whether you know, but I've had discussions with the White House on timing. I think they're relatively flexible on timing. Nobody has said this time or that time. There is obviously a wide variety of dates being discussed, mid-November being one. The Speaker and I, and I think Senator Reid has also expressed himself on this issue, but the Speaker and I are hoping that we would do a February date or even a March 1 date, so there would be some clarity in where we're going, whoever is elected President.  The date, though, is still obviously not resolved. We will have to discuss that with the White House and see what we can get through the House and the Senate, but November is obviously a possibility.  I will tell the gentleman we will be back here. I hope my office has had these discussions with you. But we're looking at, as we usually do, the week before Thanksgiving, about a week-and-a-half, 10 days after the election, the week of the 17th as the date when we would come back and organize, which would also be a week available for session if it was needed.  I might also add, if I could, further, that we had discussions today and we're all very, very concerned, and you and I are going to be meeting on it later tonight, very concerned with the economic conditions that confront our Nation at this point in time. So we are going to be ready to come back in October, if necessary, depending upon what discussions we have and what, hopefully together, in a bipartisan way, we believe needs to be done to respond to the crisis.
