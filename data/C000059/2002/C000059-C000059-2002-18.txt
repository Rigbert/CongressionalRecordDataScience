Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being and safety of the County of Riverside, CA, is exceptional. The County of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Larry Smith is one of these individuals. On August 1, 2002, Larry will be retiring after thirty-six years of dedicated service to the community as a law enforcement officer. His outstanding work as a police officer and sheriff, in addition to his personal involvement in the community, will be celebrated on August 1st dedicated as ``Larry D. Smith Day''.  Larry Smith obtained his bachelor's degree in Public Management from Pepperdine University and his first assignment in law enforcement was as deputy sheriff in the Blythe Jail and Patrol. His tenure included a variety of command assignments, including narcotics enforcement, information services, jails and patrol. He served as the County's Search and Rescue coordinator and commanded the department's Emergency Services Team (SWAT).  In 1987 Smith was promoted to chief deputy sheriff. Under his superb leadership as chief of the Corrections Division, two modern jails were financed and built. He guided the division through its largest growth in the history of the Department.  Larry was elected as Riverside County's eleventh sheriff, winning the office in the June 1994 primary and assuming the office of sheriff on December 14, 1994. He was reelected to his second term in December 1998 and he served as the first sheriff, coroner, public administrator and marshal in the history of Riverside County. As sheriff, he procured 365 acres at March Air Reserve Base for a public safety training center, which provides training for law enforcement, fire and paramedics. This paved the way for future centers throughout the United States by enabling the transfer of surplus land from the U.S. Military to the private sector through the legislative process.  Larry has also been actively involved in the community, serving as a member of the board for the American Heart Association and the United Way of the Inland Empire. He presently serves on the Advisory Committee for the Debbie Chisholm Memorial Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to granting the wishes of terminally ill children. In recognition of his outstanding service, Larry has been a recipient of numerous awards such as special recognition in 1996 from the California Narcotics Officers' Association; he was named the outstanding law enforcement officer in 1996 from Veterans of Foreign Wars; the 1997 director's award for partnership from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection; and, the 1998 professional of the year from the California Peace Officers Association.  Larry's tireless work as the Riverside County Sheriff has contributed unmeasurably to the safety and betterment of Riverside County. His involvement in community organizations makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of the residents of Riverside County are grateful for his service and salute him as he departs and I look forward to continuing to work with him for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
