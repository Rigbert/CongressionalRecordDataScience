 President, the situation at AIG is an offense to the taxpayers, and we are going to get to the bottom of it even if the Department of the Treasury hasn't.  Here is a company that has been taking billions and billions of dollars from taxpayers in the middle of what could be the worst economic downturn since the Depression. Now we hear that those taxpayer dollars were going in the front door, supposedly to keep the company afloat, and then right back out the back door into the hands of those corporate officials who got us into this mess in the first place.  The Treasury Department was supposed to be minding the store. They had the authority to disburse the funds and to provide oversight. It was Treasury's responsibility to watch how these funds were being used. Obviously, they fell asleep on the job. The Treasury Department was completely asleep on the job. They need to wake up. Americans are fed up with their hard-earned tax dollars going to people who got us into this mess in the first place. They deserve to know how this happened. The American people deserve to know how this happened. The administration and the Treasury Department need to reassure the American people that this will never, ever happen again.                          ____________________
