Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time for this colloquy.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the Committee Chairman has been willing to work with me to clarify the intent of House Resolution 450.  While this legislation does place a moratorium on regulations issued after [[Page H2089]] November 20, 1994, isn't it true that the bill also contains a provision exempting regulations dealing with routine administrative actions?
