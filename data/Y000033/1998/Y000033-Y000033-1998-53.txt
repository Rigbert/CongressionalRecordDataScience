Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1833, the proposed Tribal Self-Governance Amendments Act of 1998, would make permanent the Indian Health Service Self-Governance demonstration program.  Thereby, Indian and Alaska Native tribes would be able to contract for the operation, control, and redesign of various IHS activities on a permanent basis.  Pursuant to H.R. 1833, tribes which have already contracted for IHS activities would continue under the provisions of their demonstration compacts, while an additional 50 tribes would be selected each year to enter into compacts.  H.R. 1833 also allows for the tribal contracting of programs outside the IHS, but within the Department of Health and Human Services on a demonstration-project basis.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1833 is a major piece of Native American legislation which we have been working on for months and months. This bill lays out 55 pages of findings, Secretarial obligations, Secretarial prohibitions, rulemaking requirements, reporting requirements, and tribal obligations.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Miller), and his staff, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), and his staff, along with my staff, have worked extensively on this legislation. I commend them and their staffs for their perseverance through the scores of meetings which were needed to craft this bill.  This is a landmark piece of legislation in the field of self-governance. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have had a part in its movement through Congress. I support H.R. 1833 and ask my colleagues to vote for this legislation and urge the passage by my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
