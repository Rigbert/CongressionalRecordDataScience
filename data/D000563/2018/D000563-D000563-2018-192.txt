President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. Certainly I am happy he is bringing to the attention of the Senate this critical issue of the future of the Supreme Court and the impact it will have on families across America. Certainly, when it comes to something as basic as our health insurance, we understand this.  There are forces at work in Washington in the Trump administration that are trying to put an end to the Affordable Care Act, and in Congress, many Members of Congress--the House and the Senate--have voted 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We barely saw it survive just a few months ago when Senator John McCain, in the middle of the night, came and stood in that well and voted no, along with two other Republican Senators. They saved the Affordable Care Act.  Most Americans had their own questions about the Affordable Care Act and how important it was, but they couldn't understand how the Republicans would come to us and say ``Get rid of it'' and have no replacement.  We realize, as the Senator from Connecticut just explained, that under the old rules with insurance companies, under the old rules, many of us were victims. If you had someone with a preexisting condition in your family--perhaps you had diabetes, perhaps your child was a cancer survivor, had asthma, or so many different things--health insurance was very expensive, if you could get it. We changed the law. We said: You can't discriminate against an American because someone in their family has had a preexisting condition. Everybody is in the same pool in America. We are going to join together.  Well, now the Trump administration has said they are going to fight that in court. They are going to try to declare it unconstitutional to protect people with preexisting conditions, so they filed a brief in a lawsuit--a lawsuit that is wending its way to the Supreme Court. When the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, came before us and talked about the new nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, it is important that he focused on the impact it could have on ordinary people.  Most Americans, put to the test, couldn't name the Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Well, they know it is a big Court, an important Court, the highest Court in the land, but they don't know who is there until we get into this kind of debate. As we do, people tend to learn a lot more about the Justices and what their core beliefs are.  When it comes to Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who now sits on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, he has a lengthy record--12 years of opinions as a judge, not to mention all the years before that when he was active politically in Washington, DC. Senator Murphy of Connecticut is correct to note that his approach to the law and his approach to the Constitution do not give us great hope in preserving the protections on health insurance that are part of the Affordable Care Act. One decision by that Supreme Court could undo years of legislative work and literally remove protections from families. We are talking about that today. We should be talking about that today. But it isn't what we are voting on today, and that is why I have come to the floor.                    Nomination of Brian Benczkowski  Mr. President, back on page 8 of the Executive Calendar of the United States Senate, there is a long list of nominations that are pending before the Senate, and one of these, Calendar No. 639 on the Message No. 1402, is the name Brian Allen Benczkowski, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Attorney General. You would have to search the Executive Calendar to find it, but it is going to be voted on this afternoon in the Senate.  Is it another routine nomination? Not at all. This position in the Department of Justice is the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, who is the leader and is responsible for over 600 Federal prosecutors who are prosecuting cases across the criminal spectrum from treason against the United States to the opioid crisis and everything in between--600 men and women, career prosecutors, prosecuting the laws, the cases on behalf of the U.S. Government. President Trump has suggested that he wants this man, Brian Allen Benczkowski, of Virginia, to be in charge of those 600 prosecutors.  Is this a big assignment? In the Department of Justice, it is one of the biggest assignments. This person will be directing the cases that are filed on behalf of the United States of America, critical cases for protecting our national security, critical cases relative to crimes that are being committed, critical cases when it comes to our rights as citizens. He will be leading 600 Federal prosecutors.  Is it not reasonable for us to ask a basic question about Brian Allen Benczkowski, of Virginia? We did so in the Judiciary Committee, and here is the question we asked: Mr. Benczkowski, you are seeking the position of Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division with 600 prosecutors that you will direct. Please tell the committee how many cases you have prosecuted. As a lawyer--first, how many civil cases have you tried.  The answer? None.  Oh, well, how about criminal cases? How many criminal cases have you prosecuted in your lifetime as a lawyer? None.  How many motions have you argued before a Federal court? None.  Wait a minute. You are being chosen to head up the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and you have no experience? You have never prosecuted a case ever--never once been in a Federal courtroom, not one time?  So far, President Trump has sent us a record number of nominees for the Federal courts, and I will tell you, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, all but a few have been approved. I think some of them are awful choices, and some are good. But the awful choices are men and women who have said and done things in their legal practice and private lives that really raise serious questions about whether they have the temperament to be a Federal judge.  With few exceptions, all of the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have voted every time for Trump nominees. Two exceptions were a district court nominee for Washington DC and a district court nominee for Alabama, and in both of those cases, the people who were being appointed by the Trump administration to a lifetime appointment in a Federal district court had no experience in a Federal courtroom.  I can tell you that one of the hearings on one of the Trump nominees--and I will not bring his name up for the record, but you can find it if you wish--cross-examination by a Republican Senator on our committee, Senator Kennedy of Louisiana, was devastating. This Trump nominee couldn't find his way to a Federal courthouse with GPS. He had no experience whatsoever in trying a case, so the decision was made to withdraw his nomination. Only rarely in a year and a half have Trump nominees been so unqualified that they have withdrawn their nominations.  Now, this afternoon, we consider Brian Allen Benczkowski, of Virginia, to head up the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, a man with no trial experience--none--in a Federal courtroom, not in a civil case, not in a criminal case.  There is more to the story. Why is he here? He is here because at one point in his career he was staff director to then-Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. He worked on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I remember seeing him. He looked like a competent, affable Senate staffer. We didn't have any direct relationship. Now that Senator Sessions has been elevated to Attorney General, he wants this staffer, Brian Allen Benczkowski, to head up one of the most important divisions in the Department of Justice. That is his connection. That is his angel. That is why his name is on this calendar. That is why the Trump administration chose him.  If that were the end of the story, it would be bad enough--someone with no experience whatsoever prosecuting a case to head up 600 Federal prosecutors. But as they say, and as Paul Harvey used to say, there is more to the story.  You see, what happened was this--and follow me if you will. After Donald Trump won the Presidency and was in his transition period, Mr. Benczkowski left his private practice of law to be part of the Trump transition team assigned to the Department of Justice. Between November and January, the swearing-in, he served on that transition committee, trying to smooth the way for the new administration to take over the Department of Justice.  At the end, when President Trump was sworn in, Mr. Benczkowski left the transition committee and went back to his private practice here in Washington for a well-known firm. But before he returned to that firm, he asked the Trump administration and his former boss, I hope you will consider appointing me as a U.S. attorney somewhere in the United States.  Remember, he has no experience--none. He has never prosecuted a case, but he suggested that he wanted to be considered for that lower level position--compared to the head of the division--as he returned to private practice.  He went back to his law firm, and follow the story. He goes back to this law firm, and one of the partners at the law firm calls him in and says: I need you to take over a case to represent one of our firm's clients. The client is known as Alfa Bank. It is a Russian bank, and it is a Russian bank, as I describe the story, that is very significant in terms of our conversation today about the Russian impact on the U.S. election. Alfa Bank needed Mr. Benczkowski to look at the so-called Steele dossier. Do you remember that? It was the memo that came out about then-Candidate Trump and things that were alleged that occurred in Russia. Well, they said to Mr. Benczkowski: Represent the Alfa Bank because their name popped up in the Steele dossier, and we think it is terrible, and they want to consider a defamation lawsuit. So Mr. Benczkowski took on the Alfa Bank as a client in reference to allegations made in the Steele dossier.  There is more to the story. During the course of the Trump campaign, there were unexplained pings and contacts between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign computers--more than one. It is still unexplained as to why this Russian bank would have any access or communication with the computers of the Trump campaign.  The Alfa Bank is not just another corner bank. The Alfa Bank is run by individuals who are oligarchs in Russia. They are closer to Vladimir Putin than you can imagine.  This Alfa Bank is pretty well connected, and they had some communication, still unexplained, between that bank and the Trump campaign. Now, Mr. Benczkowski began representing the Alfa Bank on a question of defamation lawsuits concerning the Steele dossier as well conducting a forensic computer analysis of the server communications.  Wouldn't you think for a moment that if you were Mr. Benczkowski considering the possibility of a job in the Trump administration, you would have said to your law firm: I am not going to touch this one. We have all these allegations about Russian involvement in the campaign. We have some computer contact between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign. We have this oligarch close to Vladimir Putin personally. We have this Steele dossier, which mentions the Alfa Bank. Wouldn't you think that the average lawyer would say to his law firm: Sorry, I am being considered for a position in the Trump administration. I am not going to get close to the Alfa Bank.  No, Mr. Benczkowski said: I will do the work for the Alfa Bank.  When the time came and he wasn't considered for the U.S. attorney spot, he was considered to head up the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and Mr. Benczkowski filed all of these papers about all of his activities--as a Senate staffer, as a lawyer, and all the rest. It came out in the course of that that he had represented the Alfa Bank.  That is not good. It was discovered, with some background checks through the FBI, that he was in that position. He was confronted. Basically, we said in the committee: Are you going to recuse yourself from any matters before the Department of Justice involving the Russia investigation?  He said: No, I will not. I am going to stick with involving myself in the Russia investigation.  What will you recuse yourself from, in light of this representation of Alfa Bank?  I will not take up any cases involving Alfa Bank.  That is it?  That is it.  That is the best we could get from him in terms of recusing himself from any potential conflict of interest. Why is this important at this moment in time? Because at this moment in time, I don't know when Bob Mueller will complete his investigation. I don't know how the White House will react. I don't know what will happen with Attorney General Sessions, who now hasrecused himself from the Russia investigation. I don't know what will happen when it comes to any threats to the Deputy Attorney General in terms of his future.  There is a possibility that if this President decides that he is going to take an action that is going to have a direct impact on the Mueller investigation and if he decides, for example, that he is going to remove from consideration of this in the future the Deputy Attorney General who appointed Bob Mueller--I am talking about Rod Rosenstein--a vacancy in that position could be filled on an acting basis by Mr. Benczkowski. He could take up that position.  Is this an important decision, then, back here on page 8 of the calendar, to be voted on this afternoon? I think it is. First, there is the obvious gross incompetence and inexperience of this man to head up the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice; second, the fact that he represented the Alfa Bank, which is under suspicion as to its activities; third, the close connection between Alfa Bank and its owners with Vladimir Putin and Russia; fourth, the ongoing investigation of the Russian involvement in the last election campaign; fifth, the threat that this could occur again in the future; sixth, the fact that we need an aggressive Department of Justice to stand up and protect our democracy and the right to vote of every single American. The list goes on and on.  This is the wrong man for this job. I cannot believe, as a proud Democratic Senator, that the Republican Party couldn't find one experienced prosecutor in the United States to take over the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Instead, they are going to give it to a man who has never, ever darkened the door of a Federal courthouse. That is what they are doing.  It shows you the lengths they are going to go to, and it shows you the importance of just another nomination stuck on page 8 on the calendar that will be voted on this afternoon.  Here is the question. It is a majority vote. There are 50 Republican Senators and 49 Democrats in this Chamber. Senator McCain, of course, is ill and hasn't been here for several months. It is 50 to 49, among those likely to attend today. Under the rules, as written in the Senate, a majority vote can move this man forward--Mr. Benczkowski. That is all it takes. What it boils down to is whether or not any Republican Senators see a problem with this nomination. I hope that each one of those Senators will reflect on the fact that they personally know a handful of individuals, maybe more, who are more qualified to take on this critical job than Mr. Benczkowski. Please join us in stopping this nomination. Let's put somebody in this job who understands it, who has experience.  How many people would walk into a lawyer's office and say: I would like you to represent me. Have you ever had a case like mine before?  And the lawyer says: No, I have never seen one like this and have never represented anybody like you.  And the client would reply: Perfect, that is just what I am looking for, someone who is so inexperienced and so incapable of representing me that I can't wait to pay their fee.  Let's not pay the fee to Mr. Benczkowski. Let's return him to his private practice.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to President Trump urging the withdrawal of Mr. Benczkowski's nomination, dated May 9, 2018, and signed by all Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2018.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We urge you to withdraw the nomination      of Brian Benczkowski to be Assistant Attorney General for the      Department of Justice's Criminal Division and to submit      another nominee for this important position.       With new information about Russia's election interference      continuing to come to light and with a federal criminal      investigation ongoing, it is imperative that we have a head      of the Criminal Division who is free and clear from Russian      connections. Mr. Benczkowski's representation of the Putin-     allied Alfa Bank and his refusal to recuse himself from      Russia-related matters mean that he will not be able to      credibly oversee the Division's involvement in Special      Counsel Mueller's investigation and other sensitive matters      such as the criminal investigation of Michael Cohen.      Furthermore, at a time when the Department of Justice's      handling of criminal matters has come under intense public      scrutiny, it is essential that the Criminal Division have an      experienced and well-qualified leader whose judgment and      independence are beyond reproach. Mr. Benczkowski, who has no      prosecutorial experience, does not meet these criteria.      Simply put, Mr. Benczkowski is not the nominee our country      needs at this critical moment.       The Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division      must oversee and manage litigation strategy for hundreds of      federal prosecutors handling a wide range of criminal cases.      Mr. Benczkowski, however, has never served as a prosecutor,      nor has he ever tried a case. While Mr. Benczkowski does      possess experience as a top aide to then-Senator Jeff      Sessions and in various Department of Justice staff      positions, this does not qualify him to lead the career      prosecutors of the Criminal Division. His dearth of courtroom      experience makes him ill-suited for the position he now      seeks.       Mr. Benczkowski also demonstrated poor judgment by choosing      to represent Alfa Bank, a Russian bank controlled by Putin-     allied oligarchs, in March 2017--while he was seeking      employment in the Justice Department and despite public      reports that the bank was under FBI investigation for      suspicious computer server contacts with the Trump      Organization. He continued representing Alfa Bank in April      and May 2017 even while he was under consideration to head      the Criminal Division. At a time when we need the Department      of Justice's Criminal Division to help uncover, prevent, and      deter Russian interference in our democracy, Mr.      Benczkowski's choices so far have not inspired confidence      that he is the right person to lead that fight.       Additionally, unanswered questions remain about Alfa Bank      that should be resolved before the Senate even considers      voting to confirm this bank's lawyer to a top Justice      Department position. The Senate does not know if Alfa Bank      has been, or still is, under federal criminal investigation,      nor do we know the full story behind Alfa Bank's suspicious      contacts with the Trump Organization during the 2016      campaign. The work that Mr. Benczkowski did for Alfa Bank,      which included reviewing the Steele Dossier for a potential      defamation suit and overseeing a forensic data firm's      analysis of Alfa's computer server contacts, in no way put to      rest the serious questions about Alfa Bank's activities. It      would be an abdication of the Senate's advice and consent      role to confirm Mr. Benczkowski without first getting answers      to these crucial questions.       We are further concerned about Mr. Benczkowski's capability      to serve as an independent leader of the Criminal Division.      Mr. Benczkowski has worked closely in the past with Attorney      General Sessions and sought his help obtaining a Justice      Department job in the Trump Administration. We are troubled      by Mr. Benczkowski's refusal to commit to recuse himself from      Russia-related matters if confirmed, and also by the      Department's refusal to identify steps that would be taken to      prevent Mr. Benczkowski from learning information about      Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and relaying that      information to Attorney General Sessions in contravention of      the Attorney General's recusal commitments. Also, if      confirmed Mr. Benczkowski would have visibility into the      criminal investigation and potential prosecution of Michael      Cohen, who reportedly sought to pursue business deals in      Russia, among other alleged activities. Attorney General      Sessions has reportedly declined to recuse himself from the      Cohen matter, and Mr. Benczkowski, if confirmed, could serve      as a conduit of information to the Attorney General about      this sensitive matter, which may implicate the Russian      interference investigation. We need a head of the Criminal      Division who will instill confidence that recusal obligations      will be respected and that criminal enforcement decisions      will be made independently based solely on the facts and the      law. Because of his own inadequate recusal commitment, Mr.      Benczkowski does not inspire this confidence.       Many of us know Mr. Benczkowski and we respect his public      service. But we can, and must, do better when it comes to the      nominee to head the Justice Department's Criminal Division.      There are many well-qualified attorneys who have significant      prosecutorial experience, who are free and clear from Russian      connections, and whose independence and judgment are      unquestioned. Mr. Benczkowski is not such a nominee. We urge      you to withdraw Mr. Benczkowski's nomination and send the      Senate a new nominee who meets that standard.           Sincerely,         Richard J. Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick J. Leahy,            Amy Klobuchar, Richard Blumenthal, Cory A. Booker,            Sheldon Whitehouse, Christopher A. Coons, Mazie K.            Hirono, Kamala D. Harris.
