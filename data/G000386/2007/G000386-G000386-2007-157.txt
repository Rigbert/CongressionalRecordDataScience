 President, the underlying intent of any of these proposals is to put downward pressure on insurance costs, thereby reducing the cost of health care.  If Congress goes in the direction of a tax credit, the tax credit must be structured so that low-income individuals have a meaningful tax subsidy to purchase health insurance.  If Congress goes in the direction of a standard tax deduction, any deduction must be structured to ensure that taxpayers who continue to receive health care coverage through their employer do not see a significant increase in their taxes.  Congress should also contemplate a combination of a tax credit and a deduction.  A combination effectively marries these tax concepts and may serve as a viable compromise.  I believe that the Senate Finance Committee should hold hearings on the various ways we can reform the health care system. We may even be able to mark up a proposal that could be acted upon by this body before the end of the year.  I yield the floor.
