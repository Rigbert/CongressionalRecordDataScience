 President, today I wish to pay tribute to my good friend, Betty Rives Allen Callaway, whom I have known for many years.  Betty was born January 17, 1928, in Selma, AL, to Carolyn Young and Vickers Rives Allen. Raised in Old Town, Betty attended Byrd Elementary School, Selma Junior High School, and later, Albert G. Parrish High School. As a young woman in Selma, Betty quickly became a fixture in the community by donating her time and energy to various civic causes.  In 1943, while Betty was a student at Selma Junior High School, the United States was in the midst of World War II. In towns across America, civilians were mobilizing scrap drives to collect metal for war material. Betty, taking an active role in Selma's drive, secured the gift of the old Cahaba Bridge from Dallas County, a locomotive and track from the local railroad, and old buses from Clarence Agee Bus Company.  Her success in the scrap metal drive earned her the privilege of being selected to travel to Mobile to christen the William C. Gorgas, a Liberty Ship named by the students at Selma Junior High School. The trip was memorable for Betty, as she once recalled christening the ship, ``[E]xcept it took me more than once to smash the bottle of champagne.''  Following her graduation from Albert G. Parrish High School, Betty embarked on her professional career. Her penchant for business and sense of style quickly earned her a position in Louise Martindale's dress shop. As a self-described ``conscientious mother and housewife,'' Betty proved to be more than capable of balancing her home and her work. While raising her three sons, Johnny, Vick, and Jimmy, Betty also worked as a receptionist in several local offices and businesses, and later served as the social editor at the Selma Times-Journal.  In 1970, Betty began her career as an aide to some of Alabama's political figures, including U.S. Representatives Bill Nichols, Walter Flowers, and Earl Hilliard. Betty also served with distinction for 8 years in my office during my time in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a member of my staff, Betty helped countless Alabamians navigate Federal bureaucracy, many times going above and beyond her call of duty.  Betty's service to her community extended far beyond her duties as a legislative aide. As an expert on Selma history, Betty was instrumental in the effort to restore Cahawba, Alabama's first capital. She also worked to revitalize Selma's Water Avenue, one of the Nation's most historic riverfront streets. A true civic leader, Betty served on the Alabama Sheriffs' Boys Ranch Advisory Committee and as a member of the board of directors of the Selma-Dallas County United Way. She was also the first woman named to the Selma-Dallas County Chamber of Commerce's board of directors.  In 1997, Betty moved from Selma to Point Clear. However, in May, her lifelong friends from Selma were glad to see her return home to live. Today, Betty enjoys spending time with her son, Johnny, and daughter-in-law, Teresa, as well as with her six grandchildren, Caroline, Allen, Ben, Michael, Rachel Holt, and Clare.  I wish Betty much luck on the next phase of her life, and I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life and career of my good friend Betty Callaway.                          ____________________
