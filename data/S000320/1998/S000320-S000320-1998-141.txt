 I think what we need to do in the next few weeks, working together with some of my colleagues like Senator Kerrey and others on the other side of the aisle, is to let our colleagues know what this is and what it does. If we pass this legislation in the future, it is going to be another step toward accountability for us with the American people. I think it is very possible. I will be glad to add the Senator on.
