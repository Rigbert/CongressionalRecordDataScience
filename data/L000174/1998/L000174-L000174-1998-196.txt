 The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.                           Amendment No. 3494       (Purpose: To make technical corrections)  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a package of technical amendments to the desk. It is a fairly long list, but essentially involves corrections, language inadvertently left out, changes to assure consistency and date corrections. For example, the word ``appropriated'' was struck in one instance and replaced with the technically correct ``made available.'' I send these technical amendments to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.
