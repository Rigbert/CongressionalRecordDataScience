 President, nobody is here to yield time. I will be happy to begin the debate on the Leahy amendment. Obviously, I can't yield time from Senator Grassley or Senator Leahy's time on this point.  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Since nobody is here to debate the Leahy amendment, is it appropriate to be able to proceed on the bill for another few minutes?
