 President, when I spoke prior to Senator Pryor's amendment, I made a pitch that I want to repeat about the opportunity we have now, after four Congresses--this is the fifth Congress--to get this bill to the President. It has passed the House so many times, and we have never been able to get it to finality in the Senate. We have the House in position now, even after all of these compromises we have made which have diluted the bill more than I would have liked to have done, of passing a bill the leadership in the House of Representatives tells us they will take the way we pass it and send it to the President as long as there are no changes, and this assurance about no changes comes from two standpoints.  One, in the previous Congress we made compromises to get Democratic votes with the idea that once those changes were made and we got this bill through the Senate, they would not be changed in the House. We also got the assurance from the House that they would not change it, even though the House has passed much stronger legislation a couple of times. So there is an assurance in this body for people who would rather not pass strong legislation but they know there needs to be some changes in class action regime, to make some modest changes, and make sure that what they agree to will be what gets to the President, and then the House saying now for a new Congress they will pass this legislation without amendment.  So every Democrat who has made a compromise with us so we can get this bill behind us can be satisfied that they will not be nickeled and dimed to death.  Obviously, not all Democrats are satisfied with this sort of agreement and that is their right as individual Senators to try to change it more. But as I said before, any changes in this bill negate both promises that have been made. It means the promise to go through the House will not be kept because the bill has been changed in the Senate, and then for those Senators who got the assurance from me that this bill would not be changed in the House so that they were not nickeled and dimed away with their compromises are going to lose the opportunity of getting what they want without the assurance that somewhere else in the legislative process, probably conference, there might be a much stronger bill than they want.  This bill was originally introduced in the 105th Congress, then the 106th Congress, then the 107th Congress. We moved it in the 108th Congress. Now we are here in the 109th Congress. Almost everybody seems to believe there is some reform that needs to be done in the class action tort regime. This bill is it.  Now we have amendments. We defeated the amendment of Senator Pryor. We had an amendment by Senator Bingaman that we were going to deal with, that would have destroyed this compromise. There must have been a belief on the part of the people behind the Bingaman amendment that it would not go, so instead of the Bingaman amendment we have in front of us a Feinstein modification of the Bingaman amendment.  I am in the same position I was with the amendment of Senator Pryor, asking people to defeat the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment. I will be very precise why that needs to be done. But the substance of the amendment and my arguing against the substance of the amendment should not carry as much weight with my colleagues as my pleading with them that we defeat all amendments because this bill has been compromised to satisfy a supermajority of Senators--not a bare majority, a supermajority.  So I take this opportunity to speak out against the Feinstein-Bingaman ``choice of law'' amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Pure and simple, this amendment blows a hole in the bill and guts the modest reforms we are finally going to be able to get to the President.  This amendment would require the Federal courts to certify a class that does not meet basic class action requirements. In addition, what the amendment does is a contravention of the requirements of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which rule says you have to have similar law in fact in order to certify a class. The net result of this amendment is that it would require Federal judges to hear dissimilar claims that do not belong together as a class action, and would not be allowed to proceed as a class action under current law. Requiring courts to subclass does not make this amendment any better.  This amendment would require Federal judges to not follow the requirements for certifying class under rule 23. Why do the proponents of this amendment want to do that? They have given reasons for their amendment and I think, whether this is their intention or not--and I should not question the motives of people--but the end result is perpetuating the abuses that were already seen in the magnet courts, these infamous judicial hellholes which have been referred to. I remember only one out of dozens throughout the country, but one was in Madison County, IL.  The purpose of class actions is obvious: to enable courts to decide large numbers of similar claims and to do it fairly and to do it in an efficient manner. Different claims cannot be pulled together as a class action because that would be unfair and it would violate the due process rights of both plaintiffs and defendants. But the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment would require judges to do just that. As you know, that is exactly what the problem is all about, what our bill was trying to correct: judges certifying classes that should never have been certified in the first place. Rules are in place as to what should or should not be certified,and the Feinstein-Bingaman amendment blows those rules off. The efficiency and the rationale of that rule should not be followed.  The Federal courts should undertake a review to determine whether multistate class actions involving State law claims should be certified. They need to determine that the legal claims are sufficiently similar to warrant class certification. Most State courts make the same kind of determinations as well. The magnet State courts, on the other hand, do not make this determination and that is why they certify huge classes that involve claims that are completely dissimilar, to the detriment of both plaintiff and defendant. That ends up being a due process problem.  In addition, this amendment before us ignores how diversity jurisdiction works, and it eviscerates the reforms that are contained in our bill.  Another argument for this amendment by Senator Feinstein and Senator Bingaman is allegedly that Federal courts refuse to certify nationwide class actions. That sort of presumption is plain wrong. That is not the case. There are numerous examples of where Federal courts have certified multistate class actions based on State law claims. There is not a rule against nationwide class actions. Federal courts do certify nationwide class actions where the laws that govern the claims are similar.  Class actions are also certified when the plaintiffs' lawyers organize the claims in a manner so that they may be litigated fairly, even under differing State laws, where they appropriately organize the claims into subclasses. But this amendment does not give the courts any choice to determine whether it is appropriate to subclass.  So for a third time during this period that I am standing, I remind my colleagues again about the extensive efforts on the part of Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator Hatch of Utah, and this Senator from Iowa, getting to this version of the Class Action Fairness Act. No one can question that we negotiated in good faith with our colleague Senator Feinstein, as well as our colleagues Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Landrieu, to make changes to address concerns they had about the original bill introduced.  The bill we have now will keep many class actions in State court under the Feinstein home State exception. That was accepted in committee, way back there in early 2003, in the 108th Congress. Also under the local controversy exception we crafted with Senators Dodd, Schumer, and Landrieu, that will stay in State court.  So I hope I get us back in an understandable way, and what people think is rational after all these compromises, so that there is no further need to change this bottom-line compromise. Again, the purpose of this amendment is to gut the modest, commonsense reforms contained in this bill. This is an attempt to legitimize the class action abuse we have been seeing in the magnet State courts. It is an attempt to legalize the problem by putting it into the rule.  All I can say is, that is not all right. It is not OK. If we are serious about putting a stop to class action abuse, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter by Walter Dellinger.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        O'Melveny & Myers LLP,                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2005.     Re Proposed Choice-of-Law Amendment to Class Action Fairness          Act (S. 5).     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning the ``choice-of-law''      amendment that Public Citizen has been suggesting should be      offered to the Class Action Fairness Act. As I understand it,      this amendment would encourage or require federal court      judges, faced with multi-state or nationwide class actions,      to either: (1) apply the laws of one state to all the claims      in the case; or (2) certify the class action despite the      manageability problems created by conflicting state laws.       I strongly recommend rejection of this seriously flawed      proposal for several reasons.       The Public Citizen amendment violates basic principles of      federalism and would extend ``magnet'' state court abuses to      federal court. Many consumer protection cases now proceed on      a nationwide basis in federal court in those instances in      which Congress has determined that a single national law      ought to govern. This has been the case with laws such as the      Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement      Practices Act (RESPA). Frequently, nationwide class actions      are brought and tried to successful conclusions under laws      such as these.       Where Congress has chosen not to enact uniform national      legislation under which citizens can bring suit, however, it      has left the legal issues to be resolved by each state      adopting its own law. Allowing each state to decide for      itself and for its citizens is the essence of federalism.      Instructing a federal judge to pick out one state's law and      impose it on other states is a profound violation of      federalism principles. Congress is elected by all the people      of the United States. When it is acting within its      constitutional power under Article I, Congress can decide to      impose a uniform rule on the states. It is a far more serious      intrusion into the autonomy of the States when a single      judge, not Congress, acts to set aside the laws of all of the      states (but one) by choosing whichever particular state law      the judge likes best and imposing that law on all of the      other states.       For example, in Avery v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 746      N.E.2d 1242 (Ill. App. 2001), the sate court decided that      Illinois law could be applied to a nationwide class of      policyholders, and held that State Farm's use of ``non-     original equipment manufactured'' automobile service parts      violated Illinois law. Yet many other states' insurance laws      either expressly or implicitly permitted or even required      insurance companies to use non-OEM parts as a way to reduce      insurance costs. Avery has been uniformly recognized as an      example of judicial excess--the Illinois court exceeded its      authority by purporting to dictate the insurance laws of 49      other states. Nonetheless, the proposed amendment would tell      federal courts to do precisely the same thing. It would, in      effect, recreate in federal court the very state-court      problem that precipitated the introduction of this      legislation.       The amendment would reverse the decisions of numerous state      supreme courts that have rejected application of their laws      extraterritorially. Opponents of S. 5 have argued that this      amendment is necessary because ``state courts . . . are far      more comfortable handling cases involving state contract or      tort law.'' Aside from certain magnet courts, however, many      state courts have strongly rejected what Public Citizen      proposes: i.e., nationwide application of individual states'      laws. In fact, the proposed amendment would eviscerate a      number of decisions by state supreme courts, refusing to      apply one state's consumer protection laws in nationwide      class actions. Among the state court decisions that could be      reversed by the proposed amendment are the following:       Goshen v. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, 774      N.E.2d 1190 (N.Y. 2002), (explaining that to ``apply the [New      York consumer] statute to out-of-state transactions in the      case before us would . . . tread on the ability of other      states to regulate their own markets and enforce their own      consumer protection laws.'').       Compaq Computer Corp. v. Lapray, 2004 Tex. LEXIS 435 (Tex.      May 7, 2004) (``The putative class members are domiciled in      fifty states and the District of Columbia. All these fifty-     one relevant jurisdictions are likely to be interested in      ensuring that their consumers are adequately compensated for      a breach of warranty. Texas law may not provide sufficient      consumer protections in the view of the other states . . .      The differences in state law outlined above cannot be      concealed in a throng.'').       Zarella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Ins. Co., 1999 R.I. Super.      LEXIS 161 (R.I. Super. Ct. 1999) (the court found that there      were substantial variations on issues such as statutes of      limitations and burdens of proof, which ``plaintiffs have not      adequately addressed'').       Ex parte Green Tree Financial Corp., 723 So. 2d 6, 11 (Ala.      1998) (the Alabama Supreme Court expressed ``grave concerns      as to whether any national class of plaintiffs in an action      involving the application of the differing laws of      numerous states can satisfy the requirements'' for      certifying a class action).       Dragon v. Vanguard Indus., 277 Kan. 776, 789 (Kan. 2004)      (reversing certification of a nationwide class of property      owners alleging defective plumbing due to, inter alia, ``wide      variance in the laws of various states'' on relevant issues).       State ex rel. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Clark, 106 S.W.3d      483, 487 (Mo. 2003) (``The trial court abused its discretion      in certification of the class with respect to insureds whose      contracts are subject to the laws of states other than      Missouri'').       Henry Schein v. Stromboe, 102 S.W.3d 675 (Tex. 2002)      (decertifying a class of some 20,000 purchasers of software      products on theories of fraud, breach of express warranty,      negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and      deceptive trade practices because class could not demonstrate      that Texas law should apply to individual issues of reliance      and trial court was required to look to the laws of all fifty      states to adjudicate the claims).       Philip Morris, Inc. v. Angeletti, 358 Md. 689, 747 (Md.      2000) (denying certification of a proposed tobacco class      because, inter alia, Maryland ``conflict of law principles      necessitate that the [lower court] engage in individualized      assessments for each class member'').       Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court, 24 Cal. 4th 906,      926 (Cal. 2001) (reversing the     certification of a nationwide class and holding that ``a      class action proponent must credibly demonstrate, through a      thorough analysis of the applicable state laws, that state      law variations will not swamp common issues and defeat      predominance'').       Stetser v. TAP Pharm. Prods. Inc., 598 S.E.2d 570, 586      (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (reversing trial court's certification      of a nationwide class of persons alleging the defendant      companies had inflated prices and defrauded patients and      insurance companies) (``Because this case is composed of      plaintiffs nationwide, the remaining forty-nine states' laws,      as well as the law of the District of Columbia, must be      analyzed to determine whether it conflicts with the law of      North Carolina.'').       Linn v. Roto-Rooter, Inc., 2004 Ohio 2559, P57 (Ohio Ct.      App. 2004) (reversing trial court's decision to certify a      nationwide class ``because of the widespread reluctance to      certify nationwide class actions involving consumer      protection, fraud, and unjust enrichment claims, and due to      the variances in these laws which would render a nationwide      class unmanageable . . . the trial court abused its      discretion in certifying the class which entails litigants      from 35 states'').       Liggett Group Inc. v. Engle, 853 So. 2d 434, 448, 449 (Fla.      Dist. Ct. App. 2003) (decertifying a statewide class of      smokers because, inter alia, the ``highly transient      population'' of Florida would ``require examination of      numerous significantly different state laws governing the      different plaintiffs' claims'') (matters under review by the      Florida Supreme Court, see 873 So. 2d 1222 (Fla. 2004)).       Although proponents of the amendment say that its purpose      is to protect state law, its real effect would be to overrule      an established body of state law.       I would also note that these state supreme court decisions      are no less binding on federal courts than on lower state      courts. The reason is because, in ``diversity'' cases,      federal courts look to the choice-of-law rules of the state      in which they sit to decide what substantive state law should      apply. Thus, a federal court confronting a nationwide class      action would currently defer to the decision of the highest      appellate court of that state declining to allow that state's      law (or any other single state's law) to govern the claims of      consumers residing throughout the nation. But the ``choice-     of-law''' amendment would change that. As its proponents      concede, the ``amendment would allow a federal court to      choose not to follow the choice-of-law rule of the state in      which the court is located.'' That is another serious      distortion of federalism principles.       The amendment could hurt consumers from states with strong      consumer protection laws. Another problem with the proposal      is that, in their effort to make sure that a single state's      law may be applied even in a nationwide class action, critics      of S. 5 have not thought through the consequences of what      would happen if federal courts actually did apply a single      state's law. To pose the question bluntly: which single      state's law? If the choice-of-law amendment were adopted,      that question--the ``which state'' question--likely would be      the source of considerable mischief, often to the detriment      of consumers.       For example, assume that someone brings a nationwide class      action alleging that the defendant company participated in      fraudulent sales behavior. State consumer protection statutes      vary widely, but the court may decide to apply Alabama law to      all claims. That would be bad news for the class members      living in California and other states with strong consumer      protection statutes, because the Alabama statute prohibits      the assertions of consumer protection claims on a class      basis. Thus, the claims of all class members presumably would      be subject to dismissal. In short, consumers with valid      claims under their home state laws, adopted by their own      state legislatures and courts to protect their interests, may      have their claims obliterated (or, at least, rendered much      less beneficial).       Even its proponents appear to acknowledge this problem.      Professor Arthur Miller, for example, has suggested that one      state whose law would ``often'' be applied in a nationwide      class action would be ``the state in which the defendant's      headquarters is located.'' See Letter of Prof. Arthur Miller      to Sen. Bingaman, June 17, 2004, at 3.       The amendment, in short, is a radical attempt to avoid the      fact that in some areas Congress has chosen to leave the      decision of what substantive law should govern conduct to the      legislative process of each state. By having judges dismiss      the laws of all states but one, the Public Citizen amendment      violates fundamental principles of federalism.       The amendment is based on the false premise that federal      courts never certify multi-state classes based on state law.      It is worth noting that neither federal nor state courts have      any hard-and-fast rule against the certification of      nationwide or multi-state classes asserting state law claims.      To the contrary, federal ``[c]ourts have expressed a      willingness to certify nationwide classes on the ground that      relatively minor differences in state law could be overcome      at trial by grouping similar state laws together and applying      them as a unit.'' In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America Sales      Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 315 (3d Cir. 1998). Indeed,      the two leading proponents of the Public Citizen amendment--     Prof. Arthur Miller and Prof. Samuel Isaacharoff--have      themselves succeeded in persuading federal courts to certify      such nationwide class actions.       The main reason why courts, state and federal, often refuse      to certify nationwide classes is because attorneys too often      propose classes that overreach--classes that encompass too      many people with too many disparate facts asserted under too      many different laws. See, e.g., Chin v. Chrysler Corp., 182      F.R.D. 448 (D.N.J. 1998) (``Plaintiffs could have reduced or      simplified the case . . . by the creation of a smaller and      more clearly defined proposed class. Instead, Plaintiffs have      asked this Court to certify the largest class possible . . .      on the basis of mere promises that a manageable litigation      plan can be designed . . . for five causes of action under      the laws of 52 jurisdictions''). That, I submit, is a      necessary consequence of respect for federalism. There is no      reason to exalt the need for nationwide class actions in      every case above the basic principles of federalism.       The amendment, which would ignore the manageability      problems engendered by varying state laws, would violate due      process rights. If a federal court decided that a single      state's law cannot be applied over all claims in a nationwide      class action without violating the Constitution, the choice-     of-law amendment would allow a federal court to apply several      states' laws to the claims at issue. But in that      circumstance, the proposed amendment would then forbid the      court from denying class certification (even ``in part'') on      the grounds that applying those several states' laws would      render the case one devoid of common legal issues that could      not be tried fairly on a class basis.       The amendment would distort traditional and prevailing      class action practice in a way that raises serious due      process concerns. The basic reason is that it would instruct      federal judges that, even if they truly believe that the fact      that several (or even all 50) states' laws must be applied in      a particular case means that the case cannot possibly be      fairly adjudicated as a class action, they must simply ignore      that true belief and grant class certification anyway.       In deciding whether to certify a class, for example, a      federal court must inquire into (a) whether ``common      questions of law'' will ``predominate'' and (b) whether the      class action is ``superior'' to other methods, both of which      require consideration of any ``difficulties likely to be      encountered in the management of the class action.'' Fed. R.      Civ. P. 23(b)(3). What that means is that a party objecting      to the proposed class action can argue that various state's      laws must be applied in the case; that those state laws      differ in important ways (indeed, they may even conflict);      and that those variations (or conflicts) will make it      impossible to adjudicate the class action fairly on a class      basis--and will make it impossible for one jury to decide      those different or conflicting laws in one trial. In the      parlance of Rule 23, the party objecting to the proposed      class may argue that the differing state laws are reasons why      common questions of law do not ``predominate'' and that the      multi-state or nationwide class action is not ``superior'' to      other methods of resolving the case (including a statewide      class action).       Again, the Avery case makes for a good example. If the      court had (correctly, in my view) concluded that many states'      laws would need to be applied to resolve that nationwide      class action, that determination would in all likelihood have      also led the court to conclude that it would not have been      fair to try before one jury the legality of the use of non-     OEM parts nationwide. After all, how could a single jury      hearing that the practice is illegal in Illinois, legally      required in other states, permitted in other states, and not      addressed at all by still other states, render a fair and      coherent verdict? Especially when one keeps in mind that some      class actions involve dozens of claims, nationwide class      actions would in some cases require literally hundreds of      different decisions for a single jury to make.       These Rule 23 requirements have due process underpinnings.      Class actions serve an important public function: they allow      numerous, similarly situated individuals whose relatively      small claims might otherwise be shut out of the legal system      to aggregate their claims and obtain collective relief. At      the same time, the purpose of the class action device is to      allow the aggregation of only some--not all--lawsuits.      Indeed, as the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, there is a      strong presumption in our legal system that claims will be      litigated individually; class actions are an exception to      that general rule. Thus, lawsuits seeking damages in which      common questions of questions do not ``predominate,'' and in      which the class action is not ``superior'' method of      resolving the dispute, are denied class treatment for the      very reason that the court concludes that it would not be      fair to resolve the whole case in one trial. In other words,      a class cannot be certified at the expense of ``procedural      fairness.'' Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613      (1997); see also Malcolm v. Nat'l Gypsum Co., 995 F.2d 346,      350 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding that the benefits of aggregated      litigation ``can never be purchased at the cost of      fairness''). This principle is as important for protecting      the plaintiffs (that is, the unnamed class members) as it is      for protecting defendants. See id.; see also Hansberry v.      Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40-42 (1940).       The proposed amendment violates this principle by elevating      the class certification decision over ``procedural      fairness.'' Whereas the fact that different state laws would      need to be applied to a multi-state or nationwide class      action is unquestionably a valid factor to consider in      deciding whether a class should be certified, the proposed      amendment would dictate to federal judges that they cannot      consider that factor at all. For example, under the facts of      the Avery case, the     choice-of-law amendments would require the federal court to      ignore the central fact that the 50 states have made      fundamentally conflicting policy choices over the legality of      the conduct at issue. The court would be required not to      consider the obvious fact that it might be procedurally      unfair for the same jury to decide whether the use of non-OEM      parts is legal in all of the different states.       I am not suggesting that, in every multi-state class      action, the laws of every state must be applied as a matter      of due process. That depends upon the particular case, and      upon the connection that any one state might have to a      proposed class action. Rather, what I am suggesting is that      in cases in which federal courts themselves decide that due      process requires the application of numerous states' laws, it      is a serious due process problem to tell those same federal      courts that they may not deny class certification on same      basis--to tell those federal courts that they must certify a      class despite their firmly held relief that the differing      state laws will make use of the class action device      fundamentally unfair.       For all of the foregoing reasons, I find the proposed      choice-of-law amendment to be constitutionally suspect (both      from a federalism and due process standpoint) and wrongheaded      as a public policy matter. It should be rejected.           Sincerely,                                              Walter E. Dellinger.
