 Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding this time to me.  I strongly oppose this legislation, and I urge all of my Democratic and Republican Members and friends to oppose it.  This bill should be opposed from both a process point of view and a policy point of view.  In terms of process, there is no disagreement that this bill, as a Republican member, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson), just told my colleagues a few moments ago was quote, unquote, stolen away from the committee by the Republican leadership. That is what she said, and what the Republican leadership then did is went behind closed doors, where, heavily influenced by special interests, they wrote the bill. We received the bill this morning, hundreds of pages, and now we are supposed to support it.  This process is undemocratic, it is an outrage, and no Member should vote for this bill on that ground alone. But we should also oppose this bill because of its content.  Last week we had an all-day debate upon the crisis of dairy farming in this country. There were six or seven amendments, and we went on and on, and at the end of the day, by a 285 to 140 vote, the Members of this body, Republicans and Democrats, said we need to reform the milk market order system in order to protect family farmers all over this country; 285 Members voted for it. When that issue came to the conference committee, they did not spend 1 minute discussing that issue. We spent all day; we voted for it; they did not spend 1 minute.                              {time}  1215  How can you support legislation which ignores an attempt to address the crisis facing dairy farmers? Please vote ``no.''
