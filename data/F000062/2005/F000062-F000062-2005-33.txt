 President, I rise today to introduce the Santa Ana River Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2005.  This legislation authorizes Federal assistance through Title XVI for projects developed by local communities to reduce their dependence on water from the Colorado River. It helps California develop safer and more reliable water supplies.  Congressman Gary Miller along with Congressmen Calvert, Dreier, Royce, Cox and Rohrabacher introduced similar legislation in the House.
