Madam Speaker, today I wish to honor Michael G. Anderson--a great American. Mike has devoted his life to the service of our country for the past 38 years. For the first 32 years, Mike served in our United States Air Force. Most recently, Mike was the Chief of Staff of my congressional office, where he dedicated himself to working for the people of Alaska. After 6 years as my Chief, Mike retired and moved into the private sector where he serves Alaska Natives in his new capacity as President of Wolf Creek Fabrication Services, a subsidiary of Chugach Alaska Corporation.  Born in Maui, Hawaii, Mike was appointed in July 1971 to the United States Air Force Academy by Senator Hiram L. Fong. After graduating from the Academy in June 1975, he launched a distinguished military career that began as a combat aircrew member and included operational and staff assignments in the B-52 and B-1B bombers. Additionally, Mike served as an acquisition program manager and commanded two aircraft maintenance squadrons as well as a logistics group. Mike concluded his military service at the Pentagon, where he was assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force's Legislative Liaison Office. Notably, Mike set benchmarks and was recognized for high standards of performanceand achievement at each of his assignments. He retired from the Air Force in January 2003 finishing his military career at the rank of Colonel.  I handpicked Mike as my Chief of Staff after meeting and working with him on several congressional delegation (CODEL) trips to international locations and to Alaska. Mike began serving Alaska and Alaskans with the broad perspective he gained on those CODELs, and immediately gained knowledge and expertise that I would depend on throughout his 6 years on Capitol Hill. As Chief, Mike would serve when the largest transportation bill in our nation's history--SAFETEA-LU--was being formulated and passed. He would travel on my behalf throughout Alaska to ensure constituent issues were heard, investigated, and resolved quickly. He managed a staff that was assigned tough, Alaska-unique legislation, and coordinated congressional policy to make sure it served Alaska and national interests. As a result, my congressional office cemented and grew its reputation for timely and effective constituent services, and for authoring and coordinating relevant and meaningful legislation serving the interests of the people of Alaska.  Mike also received the distinction of being selected and graduating as a Congressional Stennis Fellow for the 110th Congress. He was one of only 72 picked for this distinguished fellowship. He used relationships from the fellowships he nurtured to help secure my legislative priorities for Alaska and our great Nation.  While Mike is moving on to a new career in the private sector, his impact and contribution to our work in Congress will continue. His expertise in Alaska Native issues garnered great respect for him, and will allow him to continue to serve that vital heart of Alaska's culture and heritage. We are grateful for his service to his Nation, to Congress, and to Alaska. More importantly, my wife Lu and I are most appreciative of his loyalty and friendship. Mike and his wife Rene have become dear friends, and we wish them Godspeed and the very best as they start their next career together.                          ____________________
