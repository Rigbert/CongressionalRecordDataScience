 In May, 2000 an energy crisis began in California and eventually spread to the other Western States. For about a year, FERC refused to execute its mandate to enforce the provisions of the Federal Power Act which required the Agency to enforce ``just and reasonable'' electricity prices.  In May, 2001 Pat Wood became the Chairman of the Commission and under his leadership the Commission has finally begun to aggressively investigate what went wrong in the California and Western energy markets.  However, there are still some weaknesses in FERC's authority to investigate problems in energy markets, solicit necessary information and punish wrongdoers. A report by the General Accounting Office, GAO, last month concluded that FERC does not have the necessary legal authority to police competitive energy markets.  This legislation is designed to bolster FERC's authority and allow the Agency to levy penalties that will hold market manipulators accountable for violations of the law. This legislation will go a long way toward providing FERC with the resources and legal authority it needs to protect consumers and ensure that energy prices are just and reasonable.  My legislation would do five things: 1. It would grant FERC the authority to use monetary penalties on companies that don't comply with requests for information. This is essentially the same authority that the Securities and Exchange Commission has; 2. It would make it easier for FERC to hire the necessary outside help they need including accountants, lawyers, and investigators for investigative purposes; 3. It would eliminate the requirement that FERC receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget before launching an investigation or price discovery of electricity or natural gas markets involving more than 10 companies; 4. It would increase the penalty amounts to $1 million instead of the current $5,000 for violations of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act; five years instead of the current two for violations of the statute; and, $50,000 per day per violation instead of the current $500 for violations of rules or orders under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act; and 5. It would increase the Commission's authority to impose civil penalties, it also broadened to all sections of Part II of the Federal Power Act and the penalty amount is increased from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation per day.  I continue to support FERC and Chairman Pat Wood in its efforts to stabilize energy prices, and ensure that our energy markets function properly although I believe that much more still needs to be done.  But even if FERC has the will, the GAO report correctly points out that it may not have all the necessary tools. It is my hope that this legislation will help by providing FERC the necessary authority to continue to aggressively monitor energy markets and investigate wrongdoing.                          ____________________
