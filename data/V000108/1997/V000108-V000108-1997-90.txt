Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a distinguished young man, Anthony Todd Williams, for attaining the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Anthony is a member of the Boy Scout Troop 550. He will receive this award at an Eagle Scout court of honor on Sunday, March 16 at St. Maria Goretti Church Hall, located in Dyer, IN.  An elite group, comprising only 2.5 percent of all Boy Scouts, attains the Eagle Scout ranking, which is the highest of seven rankings in the Boy Scouts organization. In order to become an Eagle Scout, a Scout must complete the following three tasks: earn 21 merit badges; complete a service project; and demonstrate strong leadership skills within the troop.  Anthony, a student at Lake Central High School, made a turtle island in a community pond for his service project. Anthony has also helped to coordinate various troop outings, and he attended Boy Scout camp for 4 years. In addition Anthony attended the National Scout Preserve in Philmont, NM, which is a high adventure camp with a rugged terrain. Anthony currently has plans to attend the Sea Base Scuba High Adventure Camp in August of this year.  The rank of Eagle Scout always has carried with it special significance--and not only within Scouting. Eagle Scouts are recognized as individuals with great talent and promise as they enter institutions of higher education, the work force, or engage in community service.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Anthony Todd Williams for his commendable achievement. His parents, Kim and Richard Williams, can be proud of their son because it takes a great deal of tenacity and devotion to achieve such an illustrious ranking. This young man has a promising future ahead of him, which will undoubtedly include improving the quality of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
