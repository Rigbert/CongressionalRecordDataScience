President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of LTG William J. Lennox, United States Army, Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. General Lennox is retiring on the June 30, after 35 years of active military service. I have known General Lennox for many years. His military career exemplifies a soldier who always sought and achieved excellence.  After graduating from West Point in 1971, General Lennox served in a wide variety of assignments in the field artillery. He served as a Forward Observer, Executive Officer, and Fire Support Officer in the 1st Battalion, 29th Field Artillery, and as Commander, Battery B, 2d Battalion, 20th Field Artillery, in the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO. He was the Operations Officer and Executive Officer for the 2d Battalion, 41st Field Artillery, in the 3d Infantry Division in Germany. He returned to Fort Carson to command the 5th Battalion, 29th Field Artillery, in the 4th Infantry Division and also commanded the Division Artillery in the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA.  General Lennox also served in a number of staff positions including a White House Fellowship, as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, and as the Executive Officer for the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans.  Additionally, General Lennox served as the Deputy Commanding General and Assistant Commandant of the U.S. Army Field Artillery Center; the Chief of Staff for III Corps and Fort Hood; the Assistant Chief of Staff, CJ-3, at Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea; the Deputy Commanding General, Eighth United States Army and Chief of Legislative Liaison.  General Lennox is not only a soldier, however, he is also a scholar. After West Point, he continued his education at Princeton University, receiving a master's degree and a doctorate in literature. He was first in his class at Fort Leavenworth's Command and General Officer's School. He also completed the Senior Service College Fellowship at Harvard University.  In June 2001, General Lennox became the Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, and took the helm of one of the Nation's premier institutions of higher learning. Managing 7,000 people and $250 million budget per year on the 16,000-acre campus, he provided strategic direction for the academic, military, athletic and values programs.  During his tenure, his key accomplishments not only preserved but even enhanced the prestige of the Military Academy. General Lennox oversaw upgrades to the core liberal arts program while sustaining the fourth-ranked undergraduate engineering program in the country. Today, only Harvard, Princeton, and Yale produce more Rhodes scholars than West Point.  General Lennox has implemented and intensified opportunities for cultural exposure and expanded semesters abroad to countries such as China, Russia, Spain, and Chile.  In the summer of 2005, he himself traveled to the People's Republic of China to strengthen ties with educators and government officials and improve the opportunities for exchanges. His has increased the number of foreign students by 74 percent, an initiative that promises to build language and cultural skills, as well as lasting relationships with our allies across the globe.  General Lennox also realized the importance of the physical infrastructure of the Academy to the ultimate success of the cadets. His capital improvements have changed the face of the historic post for the better. He planned and began building a $120 million library learning center and science complex that is architecturally compatible with the granite buildings from previous centuries, and he completed construction of the $95 million physical development center.  To provide the margin of excellence necessary to maintain the U.S. Military Academy's status as a tier I university, LTG Lennox completed a $150 million fund raising campaign with over $220 million. The funds from private sources enabled further improvements in the academic, athletic and military programs.  General Lennox also recognized that the United States Military Academy was part of a larger community. From the outset of his tenure, he sought the comments and insights of graduates, the Academy, and the members of the surrounding neighborhood, whenever appropriate, to give them a closer identification with and support for the institution and ultimately its decisions.  LTG Lennox leaves a notably improved Academy in terms of leadership, facilities, and finances. The military, academic, physical and moral/ethical development programs at the Academy have never been stronger and more connected to the Army. General Lennox has set the course for officer education into the first half of the new century.  Bill Lennox is an extraordinary soldier. He combines great intellect, great character and great dedication. He is also an extraordinary man. Together with his wife, Anne, he has raised three sons, Andrew, Matthew, and Jonathan, who have continued the Lennox tradition of service. He and Anne have been a remarkable example of husband and wife in service to the Army and in service to the Nation. And anyone who has enjoyed the warm embrace of their friendship, treasures their company and their kindness.  The motto of West Point is ``Duty, Honor, Country.'' Throughout its history, West Point has been guided by leaders who exemplify and live out that great credo. LTG William Lennox is such a leader. He leaves a proud andenduring legacy as the 56th Superintendant of the United States Military Academy.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S3638-S3639]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    TRIBUTE TO LTG WILLIAM J.
