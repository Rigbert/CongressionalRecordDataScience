Speaker, I want to say that today the official reporters of debates, the reporters who chronicle all [[Page H3336]] the proceedings on this floor, say farewell, farewell to a valued member of their staff, and of ours.  For the past 17 years, Marian Van Den Berg has been a transcriber with the official reporters. As we all know, working with the official reporters is not a 9-to-5 job. It often entails long hours, demands devotion far beyond that called for with ordinary jobs, and requires a high degree of competence. Marian has met all these criteria and more. She has been an outstanding, hard-working, always cheerful, always devoted member of our staff.  She is now leaving to pursue a new career.  Marian is a native of Annapolis, MD, I tell my friend, Mr. Gilchrest, one of his constituents. The daughter of champion swimmers, her mother was a swimmer of Olympic caliber. Marian herself lives near the bay in Annapolis and has had a lifelong love of the water and water activities.  She attended the University of Maryland, and then Strayer Business College and Strayer School of Court Reporting. While living in California, she worked at IBM. At home in Annapolis, she worked at the Naval Academy.  In addition to her work with the reporters, Marian worked 2 years with Representative Clark Thompson of Texas.  Her children are Susan and Rick, son-in-law, Tom, and she is the loving and proud grandmother of young Patrick--whose picture she shows at every opportunity.  Marian loves music of all kinds, is a jazz aficionado, is especially devoted to rock and roll, and plays a mean piano, I am told.  This exemplary employee of the House of Representatives will be greatly missed by her colleagues and by each and every Member of the House of Representatives and the American public whom she serves. Marian has touched the hearts of everyone who has had the good fortune to meet her and to work with her.  Marian, there are just a few of us on the floor, but if you would please rise we would like to give you a hand and thank you so much for all you have done for all of us.  Marian, God bless you and Godspeed.                            ____________________
