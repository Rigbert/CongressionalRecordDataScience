Stearns.  I rise in strong support of this amendment offered by my friends Mr. Walden, Mr. Stearns and others on both the authorizing as well as the Appropriations Committee.  There is an old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Internet is not broken. It is working. It is creating jobs. Look at all the devices out there, whether it be iPods, iPhones, BlackBerrys, cell phones. Look at all the things that are working. We don't need regulations on the Internet.  I think it was George Will that said that most Americans think the government doesn't work so well and theInternet does. Why are we allowing the FCC then to regulate the Internet? It makes no sense.  This amendment denies funds to the FCC to implement this order. It is a good amendment. I would like to think it would be bipartisan. I support the authors that are offering this.
