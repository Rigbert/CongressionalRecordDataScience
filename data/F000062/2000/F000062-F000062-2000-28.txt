 President, it is my privilege to recognize the truly world-changing efforts of Roger Sant, a distinguished and successful businessman who, in his six years as Chairman of World Wildlife Fund, has brought profound changes to the way conservation is accomplished here in the United States and, indeed, around the world.  Having taught corporate finance at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business early in his career, Mr. Sant moved east to lead the Ford Administration's energy conservation efforts as head of the energy conservation program at the Federal Energy Administration. In 1981, he founded AES Corporation, a publicly held global power company characterized by its innovative approaches to energy production. Throughout his career, culminating in his chairmanship of WWF, Mr. Sant has been committed to conservation in all its aspects, inspired by the imperative of leaving a living planet to future generations.  As the involved and inspiring chairman of World Wildlife Fund, Mr. Sant has encouraged the organization to think big, working to achieve conservation results at a new ecoregional, landscape scale. He has applied his business acumen as well as a range of skills and approaches honed through his work in government, academia, and the nonprofit world to make a compelling case for conservation to decision makers around the world, from heads of state to government leaders in the United States. Encouraging partnerships, he has supported significant and innovative cooperative arrangements between conservation organizations, governments and private entrepreneurs, and among governments, all with the goal of advancing conservation priorities at a scale that can achieve lasting results. His personal support of conservation initiatives has made a world of difference.  As Roger Sant steps down on September 19 after six years as WWF Chairman, he continues his personal commitment to conserving the world's endangered species and spaces. Based on his track record, we all can give thanks for his substantial conservation achievements as well as for all we know he will achieve for conservation in the coming years.                          ____________________
