 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of November 2, which notwithstands rule XXII, be modified to have all executive session cloture motions ripen following the disposition of the Gibson nomination; further, that if cloture is invoked on the Engel nomination, the time postcloture be counted as if invoked at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.
