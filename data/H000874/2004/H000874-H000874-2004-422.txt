George Miller) and our side of the aisle. The most clever thing, though, that we did was to get 229 people in the House of Representatives to say, we need to give relief to these folks who have lost their unemployment insurance. That was the most clever. The gentleman did not vote on that side of the proposition, I understand that, but 229 Members did, Republicans and Democrats. I would respectfully suggest to the leader that his observation may be correct, that the way in which this was done, because the rules required us to do it this way, may not be the best way to do it. There is a best way to do it and it can be done immediately, hopefully even by unanimous consent; simply extend, as we have been requesting for the last 4 months, to extend unemployment benefits so that these folks, these 375,000 who have lost their unemployment benefits, would be covered. The gentleman and I may agree. This may not be the best way to do it. It may have been a clever way, as the gentleman observes, for us to get this issue up, but as I say, the more clever thing was to get 229 Members of the House, a majority of the House, to say that we ought to be doing this.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, he did not use all of my quote. I said it was a clever political stunt. Members do vote sometimes, without questioning anybody's motive, do vote for political reasons or whatever reason they may. But the truth still remains, and our side of the aisle feels very strongly that it is more important to provide jobs than unemployment. We understand the gentleman's point of view. We respect his point of view. We have a different point of view. If this was a substantive amendment that had real teeth in it, I do not think the vote would have been the same.
