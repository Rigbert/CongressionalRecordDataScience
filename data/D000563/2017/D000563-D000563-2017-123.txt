President, this vote really gives the U.S. Senate a choice. On one side, we have the biggest banks in America, financial institutions, which are arguing that you as a consumer, as someone who uses their banks, should be basically signing an arbitration clause that denies you the freedom to go to court. On the other side, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has argued these financial institutions are misusing this power, denying people access to courts, and it should come to an end. That is the choice.  I think I know who is going to win. I am not sure if the party on the other side of the aisle would have called this issue if they didn't already have it lined up for the financial institutions. I know many on the other side, maybe most, hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau like the devil hates holy water.
