President, Vermont is home to many treasures, from our natural beauties to our manufactured goods to our award-winning agricultural industry. It is also home to many spirited personalities, and today I would like to honor one of them: a good friend and talented cook, Mary Anne Gucciardi. Affectionately known as ``Mama Gucc'' to those who have had the good fortune of sitting at her dining room table, she makes newcomers feel like old friends. For more than two decades, she has opened her home to hundreds of University of Vermont sports teams, from skiing to soccer, hockey to basketball. Her menu includes classics like baked stuff mushrooms, chicken cacciatore, and of course meatballs and sauce. The mere mention of her name makes both coaches' and athletes' mouths water.  Mama Gucc grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the daughter of an Italian-American father and a French-Canadian mother. It was her mother's Italian mother-in-law who served as the inspiration for Mama Gucc's gourmet Italian favorites. As the grandson of Italian immigrants myself, I have benefited from Mama Gucc's lavish feasts. She has made me feel right like I was right back in my own mother's kitchen. Mary Anne's heart is even bigger than her generous portions. She has not only cooked for hundreds of athletes, hosted distinguished guests such as bishops, senators and governors, but she has prepared countless charity dinners, raising over $50,000 in scholarships in memory of a UVM student, Kevin Roberson, tragically killed in a car accident. Her love for cooking and for hosting has made ``Mama Gucc'' a surrogate mother for the lucky student-athletes to come through her door, making those students, sometimes hundreds of miles from their families, feel right at home. In 1999, The University of Vermont honored Mama Gucc and her husband by naming a new fitness facility the Richard and Mary Anne Gucciardi Recreation and Fitness Center, a tribute most rightfully deserved.  From every Vermonter who has indulged in Mama Gucc's famous cooking, and has been blessed with her warm hospitality and generous support, we thank Mary Anne Gucciardi for providing a home-away-from-home to all who have passed through her doors.  I ask unanimous consent that The Burlington Free Press article, ``Celebrating the Italian Mama,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 10, 2013]                    ``Celebrating the Italian Mama''       Among iconic maternal figures, the Italian mama or nonna      (grandmother) hovering over a fragrant pot of tomato sauce      ranks high--and few bring the legend to life better than      South Burlington's Mary Anne Gucciardi.       Recently in the Burlington kitchen of friends, Gucciardi,      80, known as Mama Gucc (pronounced ``gooch''), arrived not      only with ingredients to make her famous meatballs and sauce,      but also containers of meatballs and sauce, Italian wedding      soup and sausage Calabrese to give away.       ``You get back what you give out,'' said the mother of four      and grandmother of four with a smile and a shrug.       If that were literally the case, Gucciardi would be      swimming in an ocean of herb-flecked tomato sauce with      meatballs.       For more than two decades until just a few years ago,      Gucciardi regularly cooked huge Italian feasts for a number      of University of Vermont sports teams with the support of her      husband and family. Her multi-course dinners--usually once a      season for the ski, soccer, hockey and basketball teams--     included a variety of home-cooked Italian classics like      minestrone, baked stuffed mushrooms, chicken cacciatore,      meatballs and sauce, and lasagna for as many as 40 team      members.       ``She opened up her home to us,'' said longtime UVM men's      ice hockey coach, Mike Gilligan. ``She just treated the kids      and the coaches like they were her own family.''       ``Mama Gucc was just wonderful,'' agreed former men's      basketball coach, Tom Brennan. ``She took care of us before      we got pretty,'' he joked, referring to the pre-championship-     era of his team. ``The food was always so lavish, from soup      to nuts . . . You know these kids, they eat like horses.      Everybody would eat until they couldn't stand up.''       ``She was always there for us,'' Brennan continued,      recalling how Gucciardi accompanied the team to the 1993      funeral of their recently graduated teammate, Kevin Roberson,      who had been tragically killed in a car accident. ``It was so      comforting to have her there and she brought a big pile of      food.''       In addition, the Gucciardi family held frequent dinner      parties for distinguished guests including coaches, senators,      governors, professors and bishops, and also cooked countless      benefit dinners, which raised more than $50,000 for a UVM      scholarship fund in Roberson's name. In September 1999, UVM      honored Gucciardi and her husband by naming a new 6,000-     square-foot fitness facility the Richard and Mary Anne      Gucciardi Recreation and Fitness Center.       It all began after Gucciardi met some student-athletes      while helping with a Newman Catholic Center fundraiser, she      explained while mixing together a double batch of meatballs.      (``I never make a single batch,'' she said.) During winter      break, when athletes often had to stay on campus to train,      she said, ``they were away from home, looking for a good      meal. There was a lot of joy in seeing them enjoy the food.''       Gucciardi also shared a more personal motivation to give      back after her youngest son, now 50, survived a very serious      car accident when he was 3\1/2\. The family was in the      process of moving to Burlington where her husband had landed      a job with General Electric.     For six weeks, Gucciardi slept by her son's bedside in the      hospital and prayed daily in the chapel at UVM. The local      Italian community warmly welcomed them, she recalled, and      offered support. ``I just always said I would give back for      what was given to us,'' she said.                             Family recipes       Scraping the fat and caramelized bits from a pan of roasted      Italian sausage into her sauce pot, Gucciardi explained that      she has taken family recipes and ``made them my own over the      years.''       She grew up in Haverhill, Mass., with an Italian-American      father and a French-Canadian mother, but her mother learned      to cook Italian from her mother-in-law, Gucciardi's paternal      grandmother, ``a great cook,'' Gucciardi said.       After frying the onions and garlic in the sausage fat      (``You just get such flavor from that,'' she explained),      Gucciardi added tomato paste and canned Italian tomatoes      along with a little water and generous amounts of dried      parsley and basil, which would come fresh from her garden in      the summer, she said.       ``I never measure anything,'' she added apologetically.       Luckily for her fans, Gucciardi taught a series of cooking      classes in the mid-'80s for which she had to write down her      recipes. It was in that class that Gucciardi met John      Varricchione, in whose Burlington kitchen she was cooking      last week.       Varricchione, 66, a retired teacher and football coach at      Rice Memorial High School, grew up in the center of      Burlington's Italian community where, just like in      Gucciardi's family, his paternal grandmother taught his      French-Canadian mother to cook family favorites.       ``But I never got my grandmother's recipes,'' he said with      regret.       Last week, Varricchione and his wife, Joanne, helped      Gucciardi form meatballs while her sauce simmered on the      stove. The Varricchiones' 3-year-old grandson, Carlo      Pizzagalli, popped in and out of the kitchen to visit with      his grandparents and ``Mama Goose,'' as he called her.       The cooks used a small ice cream scoop to measure out each      meatball, a tool Gucciardi said she adopted years ago when      student-athletes helped her to produce meatballs for      fundraising dinners during which they would feed more than      800. ``I had it down to a science,'' she said proudly.       Gucciardi watched her helpers with a kind but careful eye.      ``If they have any cracks in them, I reject them,'' she said,      explaining that they would fall apart in the sauce.       As they worked, the scent of meatballs and simmering sauce      filled the kitchen. ``I can smell those meatballs cooking,''      said Gucciardi happily.       ``That's always a good thing,'' agreed Varricchione.       The first batch of meatballs emerged from the oven, brown      and sizzling, and the second batch went in. Gucciardi stirred      a generous pinch of sugar into her sauce to balance the      acidity of the tomatoes.       When the meatballs had cooled a little, Carlo tasted one      and gave his full approval, followed by a big hug for the      cook.       The next generation had fallen in love with the cooking of      Mama Gucc.                          ____________________
