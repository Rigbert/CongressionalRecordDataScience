 The late brothers Arl and Carl Dick opened two separate general stores over 60 years ago which are still open for business and family operated today. In the midst of an economy where small businesses commonly struggle, it is inspiring that Kentucky's very own Pulaski County has two successful family-run businesses that have withstood the test of time.  The brothers Carl and Arl were Kentucky natives, but were living in Ohio when they decided to return to their Pulaski County roots and open a general store that would become a backbone in the local economy. At the beginning of 1952, there were a total of three general stores in the downtown area of Science Hill; one owned by local businessman Ed Gibson and the other two belonging to the Dick brothers. The stores were ahead of their time; they not only carried a full line of groceries but were supplied with items such as shoes, clothes, and hardware as well.  None of the three stores were necessarily in competition with each other because each store specialized in carrying a different supply of items. Carl's grandson James Dick, who grew up working in the family business, started out as a delivery boy. If a customer requested an item that a particular store did not have in stock, James would run from store to store to find the item and make sure it was delivered to the customer.  Carl's son Russell Dick remembers the generosity his father showed to customers on a daily basis. Carl initiated a local system of credit so farmers could obtain the items they needed with an agreement that they would pay for the items as soon as their crops were sold. Carl was also notorious for investing in the local economy. He would lend money to farmers who wished to purchase new farm equipment and entrepreneurs who were interested in starting local businesses, all of which was paid back to him in full.  For the past half century, the general stores of downtown Science Hill have provided a family atmosphere for customers and have established a reputation for caring about their community. Carl Dick's General Store--now run by Carl's son and daughter-in-law Russell and Hazel Thurman Dick--and Science Hill Market, now run by Arl's widow Ruth Elliot Dick, still value friendly, caring customer service above all else. This devotion to the local customer has led to the long-lasting success of this small Kentucky business in today's modern economy.  The Pulaski County-area publication the Commonwealth Journal recently published an article that illustrates the impact three generations of the Dick family and their businesses have made on the community of Science Hill. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:             [From The Commonwealth Journal, June 19, 2011]          Carl Dick's General Store: A Science Hill Tradition                             (By Don White)       Wal-Mart would have had a tough time competing with the      Science Hill of yesteryear.       Three general merchandise stores once operated downtown,      all within a few feet of each other, carrying items ranging      from shoes and clothing, paints, wallpaper, and flooring, to      a full line of groceries.       Brothers Arl and Carl Dick each opened his own store at      about the same time, and both remain in business.       Arl's widow, Ruth Elliot Dick, is owner/manager of Science      Hill Market, and across the way is Carl Dick's General Store,      where his son and daughter-in-law Russell and Hazel Thurman      Dick hold down the fort, often assisted by their son, James.       The Pulaski County natives opened their stores in 1948 and      1952 after returning home from living in Ohio.       ``Arl's is the oldest, and the other store in town was      operated by Ed Gibson,'' says James. ``They were so close      together, it was almost like they were under the same roof,''      notes the former delivery boy/floor sweeper/stocker, and      cashier who grew up in the business.       James supplemented the $5 per week paid for working in the      store with such chores as delivering mail, watering flowers      for residents at a nickel per job, and mowing lawns.       ``I was so young when I started mowing my customers had to      start the mower for me,'' he says laughingly.       Often, when things were extra busy in the store, James      welcomed the opportunity to make deliveries and figures he      went to every house in town, either by walking, riding a      bike, motorcycle or driving a golf cart.       ``When our store didn't have something a customer wanted,      chances were pretty good one of the others would, so I did      the running from store to store picking up and delivering the      items.''       The 45-year-old bachelor and 1984 Somerset High graduate      remains on the run, currently serving as president and CEO of      Morris & Hislope and Pulaski Funeral homes, in addition to      being a licensed funeral director. Life lessons learned in      the store are given credit for the success he enjoys today in      the world of business and helping people.       He learned about credit due to a big portion of the      customers purchasing items with an agreement to pay when      their crops were sold.       When adults would gather around the coal stove in the      center of the building and swap stories and words of wisdom,      James tried to stay within hearing distance.       ``Adults were always talking, and I was listening, picking      up lots of good advice along the way.''       His papaw stressed the value in remaining humble throughout      life, saying . . . ``If you've got a quarter in your pocket,      be sure and make people think it's a nickel,'' and to always      be thrifty.       ``I once ended up with $25 at the end of a month of      working, and they took me to Roses to pick out toys. I bought      all quality toys. Ended up with a basket full and plenty of      change left over.''       Well versed in local history, James says his pawpaw's store      was called Four Brothers and operated by the Randall brothers      when Carl took over.       Arl purchased his store from Millard Roy.       ``All the stores stayed extremely busy, and there was never      a feeling of one being in competition with the other because      each was known for certain items.       ``We specialized in shoes, feed and clothing,'' says James.       ``I can remember selling bibbed overalls for $2.98 per      pair,'' says Russell, also widely known as a used car dealer      from 45 years with two lots in Science Hill.       James has always been aware of the respect people in the      area have had throughout three generations of service for      Dick family members.       ``I have all good memories of growing up in Science Hill, a      really close-knit community that's a great place to live and      work.       ``It's been a pleasure to see all the progress, like      watching Charles Hall (former superintendent for the Science      Hill Independent School System) build that school into one of      the best in the state.''       At the visitation for his papaw, he heard from dozens of      people about the things he had done for them, including      lending money for the buying of farm equipment.       ``Vernon Merrick told me that papaw took a dollar off every      pair of shoes he bought his children, and that meant a lot.''       Coming to town to ``do your tradin' '' at the three stores      was a big deal.       ``I seldom meet an area family who didn't shop downtown,''      he says.       And the best thing about the good ol' days is that they      aren't over yet in Science Hill, Kentucky.       Carl Dick's General Store is open Monday through Saturday      from 8 A.M. until 5 P.M., still selling everything from      delicious baloney sandwiches to diamond rings.       Even old-fashioned candy is still sold by the pound at      Christmas time.       In fact, the shelves are still stacked high with so much      merchandise, the walkways are passable, but very narrow.       ``Chances are, if you want it, we've got it, if we can find      it,'' says Hazel.                          ____________________
