 President, I rise today to give congratulations to one of the great local fire departments in Delaware, the Georgetown Fire Company, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this month. This anniversary is a tribute to those who had the vision to found the fire department and to those volunteers who have carried on this tradition all the way through today.  We are very lucky in Delaware to have such a rich history of volunteer community fire departments. With the addition of the Georgetown Company, we have had 15 fire companies in our state celebrate 100 years of service. In fact, we have even had 3 companies--Lewes, Carlisle of Milford, and Good Will of New Castle--celebrate 200 years of service.  With such successes though, it is easy to forget the humble beginnings of many of these departments. On April 11, 1903, the town commissioners of Georgetown announced in a town meeting that it would be forming a fire company to bring down the cost of fire insurance. Before the establishment of a fire company, the community had relied on so-called bucket brigades and a hand-drawn ladder wagon.  When it was founded, there were fourteen charter members of the Georgetown Fire Company and only one piece of fire equipment. Today, there are almost one hundred members of the company and an entire fleet of state of the art fire equipment.  And as a testament to the unceasing dedication of the volunteers who serve in this company and to the respect and veneration it has in the community, almost half of the members of the Georgetown Fire Company are life members or honorary members. Many members of the company who have served their town as volunteer firefighters for decades never stop serving.  The Georgetown Fire Company has become an integral part of the community it has served. It has saved the lives and the property of many. In the town of Georgetown, everyone knows who the real heros are.  It is my privilege to share the company's great history with my colleagues and with our fellow citizens today. We honor the company's 100th anniversary and the extraordinary commitment that it has never stopped showing to its community. Congratulations to all of the officers, members, and friends of the Georgetown Fire Company. It is very well deserved.                          ____________________
