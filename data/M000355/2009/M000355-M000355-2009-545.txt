  I appreciate very much the thought about Wednesday. My Members are anxious to offer amendments, and that gives us an opportunity to do that during the day on Wednesday, even though your conference is tied up. It would be my hope that we could vote Wednesday night and process amendments. This is such a big week, and such an important measure, as we all know, that I have told my Members--and I hope it is the case--that after tonight, all bets are off in terms of working in the evening, and my Members are expecting that to happen. I ask my friend the majority leader if it is his view that is the way we will operate this week?
