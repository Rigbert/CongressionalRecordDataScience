 President, for Women's History Month, I want the world to know how proud I am of the women's business leadership in California and the entire United States. It is with great pride that we recognize California is No. 1 in the number of women entrepreneurs as well as the fastest growing state for women minority entrepreneurs.  The entire nation should celebrate with us as we recognize that there are almost 9 million women entrepreneurs today of which 1.1 million are minorities.  The female labor force is making great strides as we project, along with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that 72 million women will be working by the year 2005 representing 63% of women 16 and older.  As the decade draws to an end and a new millennium approaches, we celebrate women entrepreneurs as the fastest growing segment in our economy. And may I remind you again, dear colleagues, California is No. 1.  Despite all the good news, women entrepreneurs still are under-served in access to capital. I am proud of several of the California banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. They need to do more, as do all of our California banks (and all banks across the United States) to help finance the growth of women-owned business, the growth of minority-owned business, and the financing of U.S. Exports.  How can one represent the great State of California and not talk about technology. It is fantastic to note that women now represent 52% of all Internet users. The analyst said just a few years ago we were technologically illiterate. We proved them wrong.  I want to recognize the Business Women's Network (BWN) for its outstanding capacity and record to unite business women. BWN is a giant network now of 1200 women's associations whose membership total more than 9 million. In addition, BWN has located 750 women's web sites nationwide and will publish profiles of the 1200 organizations and 750 web sites in its 1998 Directory due out in October 1998.  Women are the economy, as University of California/Berkeley professor and former Chairman for the Council of Economic Advisors, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, reminds us of this fact. Women represent more than $3.5 trillion in spending economy. And, women owned businesses generate over $3 trillion in revenue.  Again, thanks to the Business Women's Network for helping us recognize that it is essential to salute business women. As my Congressional sisters today have selected Women in Business as the issue of the day, how appropriate that I, too, with the support of my Senate colleagues recognize the important progress women in business are achieving.  I also want to salute Aida Alvarez, Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). She single-handedly has moved women entrepreneurs and minority entrepreneurs up as priorities for this Nation. With the role of the Office of Women Business Ownership and its Women Centers, and with SCORE's commitment to counsel more women and add to its rolls more women counselors, we all say, felicitates Administrator Alvarez.  I praise the National Women's Business Council for emphasizing critical issues such as access to capital for women entrepreneurs.  In summary, as Women's History Month makes us stop and reflect where we come from, I personally want to salute all women in business and look forward to much greater gains for the next millennium, now not many months away. Congratulations to the Business Women's Network (BWN), and the 1200 business organizations representing entrepreneurs and professionals, diversity, and high and low income business women.                          ____________________
