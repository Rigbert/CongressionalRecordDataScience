       Also, it is exceedingly important--I have already mentioned      it here--to George Bush. . . . It is vitally important to      him, if he is to expect to see his programs considered and      adopted. And hopefully, from his standpoint, certainly, and      from the standpoint of many others, if he is to see those      programs succeed, he--  Meaning President Bush--       is going to have to have help. He can't depend on all of it      coming just from his side--  Meaning the Republican side of the aisle.       He is going to have some help over here. . . .  Meaning the Democrats side of the aisle.  As always, Senator Byrd said it very well. At this point in history, the President's agenda, including the cornerstone of his proposed tax relief for working men and women, is tied in with his power-sharing agreement. With this power-sharing agreement that govern the operation of this Senate, this year, certainly from the perspective of those on this side of the Aisle, there is a connection.
