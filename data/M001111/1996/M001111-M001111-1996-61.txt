 President, the welfare bill recently passed by the Senate provides that families may be denied cash assistance after receiving benefits for a cumulative period of 5 years. States are also required to have 15 percent of welfare recipients involved in work participation. By 2002, this percentage must increase to 50 percent of the people on assistance. The bill as it entered the Senate, however, would clearly have failed to prepare these people for the jobs that they are required to obtain.  The facts are clear--you are highly unlikely to get off assistance and into work if you are unable to read.  Vocational education under the bill as it came to the floor was limited to no more than 12 months for any individual. Most education and training programs have a 2-year duration, and therefore, cannot be completed within the bill's time allowance.  In addition, States are unable to incorporate adult basic education activities into the training programs. This, at a time when we know more than ever about the link between adult education and literacy and dependence on the welfare system.  Analysis by the Urban Institute shows that of people who have been AFDC recipients of less than 25 months, 34.8 percent have not obtained a high school degree or a GED. But, among recipients who receive AFDC assistance for 60 months or more, this number jumps to 62.8 percent. The less educated a person is, the longer he or she is likely to remain reliant on the welfare system.  A 1995 report released by the Policy Information Center at the Education Testing Service also notes that welfare recipients with higher literacy levels worked more weeks and earned higher average weekly wages in comparison with other recipients during the previous year. All this simply reinforces the importance of education and literacy in helping people get off, and stay off, the welfare system.  This bill as it came to the Senate did not provide enough flexibility, and did not allow the necessary education and training required to produce successful employees. In order to correct the inflexibility of this welfare bill, Senators Simon, Jeffords, Kerry, Specter, and I yesterday proposed and passed a literacy amendment that will let states do what is needed.  This amendment has three basic provisions. The length of allowable educational training will be extended from 12 to 24 months; extending training period to permit the completion of training programs. The amendment also expands the definition of vocational training to include adult basic education, such as a GED completion course.  Without basic educational and literacy levels, people cannot perform job duties nor can they expand their skills through more advanced education. The amendment also allows States to increase people in educational programs from 20 to 30 percent of their participation percentages. States with high unemployment rates might otherwise find it difficult to place workers who have virtually no skills.  This amendment provides solutions to get people learning, and building skills. I want to thank Senators Simon and Jeffords for their leadership on these efforts. With the adoption of this amendment, people on public assistance will be able to gain the basic skills they need to become productive workers and remain off the welfare system.                          ____________________
