Hopefully, this colloquy will serve as an announcement to all of our colleagues who may be listening to the debate, wherever they may be, that they should proceed rapidly to the floor. Three o'clock is the cutoff time for the introduction of amendments. On our side of the aisle, we have attempted to make that known in many ways. I am hopeful that at least no one will be under any other illusion. At 3, we will have an opportunity to survey the amendments that have in fact been placed before us to try to determine, as I understand, either time agreements or the ability to accept on both sides of the aisle some of these amendments.  I see, having said that, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has arrived just in time.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
