Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Nothing in this bill precludes any scientific study, any type of cooperation with other countries. All we are doing is getting back the responsibility of this Congress that we swore to uphold. The Constitution of the United States is all I am asking for. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
