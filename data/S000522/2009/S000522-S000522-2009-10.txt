I want to thank my friend and colleague for his eloquent and very passionate statement. Knowing of his work on behalf of human rights and of his standing as a human rights advocate globally, thank you so very much, And, for that very powerful statement.  I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), and want to, again, thank him for his leadership for so many years in the defense of life.
