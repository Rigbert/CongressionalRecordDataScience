Speaker, I rise today to honor Joseph Gembus of Rossford, OH who has taken from this life on Thursday, April 10, 1997 at the age of 85 years.  A man of integrity, humility, and true grit, Joe was a glassworker who gave of his energies to his profession, his family, and his community. Always a staunch and dignified defender of working people, he served as his union local's financial secretary for 23 years, retiring in 1977. Upon his retirement and in recognition of his tireless efforts on their behalf, his brothers and sisters in the union named the United Glassworkers Local 9 hall the Joseph F. Gembus Hall. Throughout his tenure with the union, he also served on the Toledo AFL-CIO Executive Board and as Vice-President of the State of Ohio AFL-CIO Executive Board. He served on the Wood County Democratic Executive Committee, MidAm Bank Advisory Board, and the City of Rossford Charter Commission.  Fiercely loyal to our Nation, Joe served in the U.S. Army during World War II, fighting in the China-Burma-India Theater. After his service, he joined the Rossford American Legion Post #533 and the Northwood VFW, where he was a life member. Never one to let his years slow him down, Joe was also a member of the Lady of Fatima Council of the Knights of Columbus, the Wood County Committee on Aging, and the Glassworkers Local 9 Cullet Club.  Joe now joins with his wife Mary, but leaves to this earth his sister, Angela Gembus, sisters-in-law Betty Torda and Kate Eckhart, and many nieces and nephews. They, and we, will miss him and cherish his memory and contributions in making our community a finer place in which to live.                          ____________________
