Leader, but I thought it was probably not worth asking because I knew the answer. But to the other question, with respect to offering substitutes, very frankly, what happens is you can offer a substitute, but if it is not germane and you do not receive a waiver when you are granted the right to offer the substitute, obviously on the one hand you have the ability to offer a substitute, but you do not really have the ability to offer an alternative. There is a very substantial difference.  I do not necessarily expect an answer today, but I really would hope, because we are talking about very significant, important issues, where there are differences in a bipartisan fashion on either alternative, that alternatives should be allowed that are consistent with the objective, although, as the leader well knows, from time to time because of what is or is not included in the committee product may or may not be germane even though it is pointed to the subject. I offer that as food for thought because I think it is fair and I think it would be good for the American public to have a broader spectrum of options than is sometimes allowed to us, notwithstanding the fact that theoretically a substitute is made available.  I think the gentleman understands my point, and I thank the gentleman for the information.                          ____________________
