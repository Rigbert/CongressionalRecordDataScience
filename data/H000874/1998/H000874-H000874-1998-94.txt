 I rise today, my colleagues, not so much to speak on the veto override, although the bill in question, I believe sincerely, will not in fact stop any abortion. This is about a procedure, not about abortion. The issue should not be about a procedure. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to late-term abortions by any procedure.  I rise today to call Members' attention to legislation which has been referenced before that has as its intent stopping all late-term abortions by whatever procedure.  I asked the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) was there an alternative procedure he thought preferable. He would not answer that question. Nor will anybody on this floor. Not one. Because there is no alternative procedure that proponents believe is a preferable procedure.                              {time}  1130  The fact is I think most of us are against what the gentlewoman from Florida talked about, elective late-term abortions. I am absolutely opposed to that, unequivocally opposed to elective late-term abortions.  Do I make exceptions in my bill? Yes. As the gentleman from Texas intoned, for the life of the mother. There is not a Member, I think, on this floor who would not vote for that exception. Not one. Then, yes, we go on to say for serious adverse health consequences to the mother, a wrenching, difficult decision for a doctor and a patient to make.  But I am opposed and believe that any ethical doctor would oppose elective late-term abortions by whatever procedure. And if they do not, the medical association ought to take them to task and our bill would impose a very significant penalty on so doing.  Whether this bill today passes or fails, I would ask the Committee on the Judiciary and ask the gentleman from Florida to report this bill to the floor. Let us debate. Let us go on record as 41 States in America have gone on record and say, we are opposed as public policy to late-term, elective abortions. Period. No ifs, ands or buts, no this procedure is not good but that procedure is okay. Not deal with procedures. Deal with substance. Deal with saying that we should not have these abortions late-term for elective reasons.
