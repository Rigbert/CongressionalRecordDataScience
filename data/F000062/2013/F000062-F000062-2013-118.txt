 President, I rise today in support of an amendment that I have filed, along with Vice Chairman Chambliss, to the appropriations bill now on the floor, which will address a unique problem the intelligence community faces in applying the sequester reductions to the National Intelligence Program, NIP, budget.  In short, this amendment would ensure that the intelligence community--which has to be as predictive and agile as possible--will have the same level of flexibility in implementing budget cuts as the Department of Defense, where most of its budget is located. Without this relief, the intelligence community will be far less discriminating in how it adjusts personnel and financial resources to address the dynamic and unforeseen threats our Nation will face in the upcoming months.  This is a commonsense amendment. It does not cost a dime, and it will likely avoid a great deal of harm to our intelligence capabilities.  Let me briefly describe the background and how the amendment would work.  As has been described many times, the terms of the sequestration require that the same level of budget cuts apply across the board. That is, departments and agencies have to apply the same percentage cut across each account.  It therefore becomes very important how those accounts are defined. If the account is very large, a manager has more leeway to prioritize funding and cut the least important, or the least urgent, needs. By contrast, if the account is defined as being smaller, there is less flexibility to cut funding responsibly, and more important programs will suffer.  Because of language included in the Fiscal Year 2012 Defense Appropriations Act, however, the intelligence community must apply the sequester in a highly restrictive way. That legislation required that the definition of an account for sequestration in the intelligence community is at something known as the Programs, Projects, and Activities--known as PPA--level. The intelligence community's budget has 685 PPAs, and each will need to be cut equally. The most problematic of these PPAs for the intelligence agencies are the 354 PPAs within the intelligence agencies' Operations and Maintenance, O&M, accounts. These are the accounts which fund current operations and salaries.  The overall Department of Defense budget is roughly 10 times that of the intelligence community, but it has only 3 times more PPAs--in other words, it has relatively fewer accounts that are affected by sequestration, and thus greater flexibility to absorb the sequester cuts, since they can be applied within larger budget accounts.  This amendment would help alleviate this problem by permitting the agencies in the intelligence community that are funded by the Defense Appropriations bill to use the same definition of what constitutes a Program, Project, and Activity Account as the Defense Department when applying sequestration reductions to its O&M accounts. This specific change will reduce the number of these PPAs from 354 to 5 and will not affect other PPAs. No budget outside of the intelligence community is affected--we simply provide these intelligence agencies with the same level of flexibility as the Pentagon.  In times like today, where the threats are neither static nor predictable, I ask that my colleagues approve this amendment so that the intelligence community may be nimble and responsive to the dangers our Nation faces.  This is not a simple budgetary matter. How the cuts of sequestration are applied makes a great deal of difference in practical terms.  Just yesterday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and other intelligence agency heads testified at the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's hearing on Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States. They described the numerous, complex, and interrelated threats we face. Director Clapper noted``how quickly and radically the world--and our threat environment--are changing.'' He stated there is an increasing risk to U.S. critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, in particular from isolated state or non-state actors using less sophisticated but still effective techniques that are more prevalent today. I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt from this transcript be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  The terrorist threat continues to become more diffuse since the al-Qa'ida core leadership has been degraded and its affiliates in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa look to fill that void and strike against the United States. Countries like Iran and North Korea continue their efforts to develop ever more deadly weapons of mass destruction, and look to market them to counter their failing economies. And, the instability in the Middle East and North Africa that has grown since the Arab spring continues to create more dangers and potential flashpoints in countries that 3 years ago were not assessed to have such risks.  In the past 6 months, it has been clear that the intelligence community needs to surge additional resources to collect and analyze intelligence on Northern Africa. Our policymakers need more and better information to deal with instability and terrorist activities in Libya, Mali, and Algeria. Under sequestration, however, agencies would be limited to do so. The same needs apply to address threats that emanate from Iran, North Korea, Syria, and cyberspace, to name just a few.  There is no doubt that the intelligence community can reduce spending and contribute to the Governmentwide reductions. But to strip it of all flexibility to cut programs and personnel across the board makes no sense.  If our intelligence agencies are to absorb the cuts required by sequestration, our Nation's security would be better served by providing the intelligence community with the flexibility it needs to implement cuts in as responsible and thoughtful way under these circumstances.  The changes my amendment seeks are necessary to help the intelligence community adapt to a changing world as the sequestration reductions are implemented. I understand there may be concerns with how the other chamber will view this amendment, but I believe that our counterparts on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence--Chairman Mike Rogers and Ranking Member Dutch Ruppersberger--support making these changes to help intelligence agencies succeed in their mission.  Finally, Mr. President, let me make clear that this amendment is intended, and I believe does, have no effect on the visibility that Congress has in how the intelligence community will make budget reductions due to sequestration or with how these agencies reprogram funds. The only thing affected by the amendment is the size of the accounts from which sequestered funds must be taken.  On behalf of myself and Vice Chairman Chambliss, I urge adoption of the amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Excerpts From the Testimony of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, March 12,                                   2013       In my considered judgment as the nation's senior      intelligence officer, sequestration jeopardizes our nation's      safety and security. And this jeopardy will increase over      time. The National Intelligence Program, or NIP as it's      called, which I manage is spread across six cabinet      departments, and two independent agencies. Much of it is      included in the DOD budget. For that portion of the NIP, the      Congress directed that the National Intelligence Program use      an even more onerous set of rules to carry out these cuts      than that imposed on the Defense Department.       This restrictive Program Project and Activity, or PPA,      structure as it's known, compounds the damage because it      restricts our ability to manage where to take deductions in a      balanced, and rational way. Accordingly the sheer size of the      budget cut, well over $4 billion, or about 7 percent of the      NIP will directly compel us to do less, with less. Some      examples, and I'll have to be circumspect here, in a--in an      open, unclassified setting, and we're prepared to speak more      specifically in a classified setting, of the impacts of      sequestration.       We'll reduce human technical, and counter intelligence      operations resulting in fewer collection opportunities while      increasing the risk of strategic surprise. This includes for      example, possibly furloughing thousands of FBI employees      funded in the National Intelligence Program. Our cyber      efforts will be impacted. This is an area where, as you all      know, we must--we need to keep ahead of rapid technology      advances to maintain and increase access to adversaries as      well as provide warning of a cyber attack against the U.S.       Critical analysis and tools will be cut back. So we'll      reduce global coverage, and may risk missing the early signs      of a threat. Our response to customers will suffer as well.      We'll let go over five thousand contractors, and that number      may grow, who are an integral part of the intelligence      community, and this is on top of the thousands of contractors      we've let go in previous years. We'll delay major systems      acquisitions, and decommission older, but still productive      overhead reconnaissance capabilities, thus reducing coverage.      Virtually all of the 39 major systems acquisitions across the      intelligence community would be wounded.       We'll have to re-negotiate contracts and slip schedules to      the right, which in the long run, will cost us more. And      we'll scale back cutting edge research that helps us maintain      a strategic advantage. Since we're already halfway through      the fiscal year, the mandate of across the board cuts are      equivalent to 13 percent, because we'll be forced to take      them in just seven months. These condensed timelines magnify      the impact these cuts will have on the I.C. So in response,      our approach starts with the premise that mission comes      first. Therefore, our two highest priorities are: One, to      protect our most valuable resource, our civilian workforce so      we can focus on the threats we face. And two to support      overseas operations.       Our civilian workforce works 24/7 around the world and is      crucial to performing that mission. It is our civilian      professionals who will provide the resilience and ingenuity      to help compensate for the other cuts we'll incur. I am      resolutely committed to minimizing the number, and lengths of      furloughs that would be required, not only because of the      direct impact on our mission because of the severe impact on      the morale of the people who do it. I plan to follow Deputy      Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter's sterling example, and have      my pay reduced as well in solidarity with any I.C. employees      that have to be furloughed.       Now let me emphasize here that we are not arguing against      taking our share of the budget reductions. What I am saying      is we must manage this budget crisis, and continue our vital      missions. And in so doing, we'll minimize the impact on our      nation,and on our employees. Therefore, I plan to submit a      reprogramming action that mitigates some of the most      egregious cuts to help us cut in a more rational mission      focused manner. And in this, I'm asking for your support, and      the other intelligence oversight committees for expedited      management and consideration.       And Madam Chairman I want to on behalf of the entire      intelligence community, thank you for your leadership and      your care for the mission of the intelligence community, and      introducing a bill that would give us that flexibility. Now I      must tell you that, unfortunately, I've seen this movie      before. 20 years ago I served as director of Defense      Intelligence Agency, the job that Lieutenant General Mike      Flynn has right now. We were then enjoying to reap the peace      dividend occasioned by the end of the Cold War.       We reduced the intelligence community by 23 percent. During      the mid to late '90s, we closed many CIA stations, reduced      human collectors, cut analysts, allowed our overhead      architecture to atrophy, and we neglected basic      infrastructure needs, such as power, space, and cooling. And      we let our facilities decay. And most damaging, most      devastatingly we badly distorted the workforce. All of that      of course was--was reversed in the wake of 9/11, and thanks      to the support of the Congress over the last decade, we      rebuilt the intelligence community into the premier in such      capability on the planet.       And now if we're not careful, we risk another damaging      downward spiral. So I'm going to do all I can to prevent      history from repeating that cycle. But to be clear, the--the      scope and magnitude of the cuts already underway will be long      lasting. Unlike more directly observable sequestration      impacts, like shorter hours of public parks, or longer      security lines at airports, the degradation to intelligence      will be insidious. It will be gradual and almost invisible,      unless and until, of course we have an intelligence failure.
