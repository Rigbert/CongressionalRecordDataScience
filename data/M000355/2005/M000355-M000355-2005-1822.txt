 We have not received any requests for a rollcall vote on the Gutierrez nomination and it is expected we will be able to dispose of that nomination on a voice vote. Therefore, no rollcall votes are expected during Monday's session. We will continue to work through the President's nominations as they become available. We will have more to say with respect to the voting schedule next week.  I also remind all of my colleagues that we were able to lock in a time agreement on the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. We will debate the Rice nomination throughout the day Tuesday and vote on that nomination on Wednesday of next week.                          ____________________[Page S105]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
