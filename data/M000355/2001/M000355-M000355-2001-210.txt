 President, I would like to read into the Record excerpts from the cogent analysis of S. 27 that was prepared by James Bopp, Jr., General Counsel of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, entitled ``Analysis of S. 27, `McCain-Feingold 2001.' '' In this analysis, Mr. Bopp thoroughly demonstrates why this bill violates the free speech and associational rights of individuals, political parties, labor unions, corporations, and ``issue advocacy'' groups.  Mr. Bopp begins his analysis by noting whom S. 27 will hurt--the ``little guy'', as he puts it--and whom it will help, chiefly the wealthy and the news corporations:       McCain-Feingold 2001 is a broad-based and pernicious attack      on the rights of average citizens to participate in the      democratic process, thereby enhancing the power of already      powerful wealthy individuals, millionaire candidates, and      large news corporations--the archetypal story of big guys      enhancing their power to dominate the little guy.       McCain-Feingold 2001 is a major assault on the average      citizen's ability to participate in the political process      because it targets and imposes severe restrictions on two key      citizen groups, which serve as the only effective vehicles      through which average citizens may pool their money to      express themselves effectively: issue advocacy groups and      political parties. However, McCain-Feingold 2001 leaves      wealthy individuals and candidates and powerful news      corporations unscathed, thereby enhancing their relative      power in the marketplace of ideas.       Both issue advocacy groups and political parties are      private organizations that provide a vehicle for average      citizens to effectively participate in the political process      by pooling their resources to enhance their individual      voices. These organizations participate broadly in our      democratic process by advocating issues of public concern,      lobbying for legislation, and directly promoting the election      of candidates.       Issue advocacy groups and political parties enhance      individual efforts by association. One individual of average      means can accomplish little alone in the public arena, but      thousands of average citizens who pool their resources with      like-minded individuals can accomplish great things by      working together. The right to associate, therefore, is so      fundamental to our democratic Republic and the ability of      average citizens to affect public policy so important that      the United States Supreme Court has recognized it as a      fundamental right with powerful constitutional protection.       Furthermore, political parties are not just about electing      candidates, particularly federal ones. Political parties      constitute a vital way by which citizens come together around      issues and values expressed in the planks of their party      platforms--at all levels of government. Parties advocate      these issues in the public forum in addition to lobbying for      legislation and engaging in efforts to elect candidates.      Parties are just as focused on the promotion of issues as are      ideological corporations, such as the National Right to Life      Committee or The Christian Coalition of America, and labor      unions, such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress      of Industrial Organizations, although with a broader spectrum      of issues. McCain-Feingold 2001 ignores this reality and      treats political parties as simply federal candidate election      machines.       McCain-Feingold 2001 attacks the abilities of ordinary      citizens to participate in the political process in two ways:      (1) by focusing restrictive efforts on issue advocacy      corporations, labor unions, and political parties--three      organizations vital to the ability of average citizens to      pool their resources to make their opinions heard, and (2) by      imposing sweeping restrictions that reach broadly beyond      direct participation in elections to restrict issue advocacy      (limiting discussion of issues of public concern, the views      of candidates on issues, and grassroots lobbying for favored      legislation).       If McCain-Feingold 2001 succeeds, the influence of the      average citizen would be drastically reduced because      association with like-minded individuals is essential to      effective participation in the public policy arena. With the      little guys locked in the dungeon of nonparticipation, the      rich and powerful will run politics, much as they did before      the first and foremost campaign reform adopted by our Nation,      the First Amendment, which protects the right of association      and demands that ``Congress . . . make no law . . . abridging      the freedom of speech''--especially speech about those in      power and on the critical issues of the day.       Campaign finance ``reform'' proposals, notably McCain-     Feingold 2001, do not, and could not, eliminate the power of      the giant news media corporations, which are protected by the      First Amendment from regulation of editorial content and news      coverage. Neither may the wealthy be prohibited from spending      their own money--either to express their views on public      issues and candidates or to advocate their own election. But      the wealthy don't need to pool their resources to be      effective, they have all the money they need to pay for      communications about the issues they care about. Furthermore,      millionaire candidates remain unaffected by proposed campaign      ``reforms'' because they need not rely on contributions from      others--they can spend their own money to campaign--and      officeholders of all stripes have the incredible power of      incumbency to support their candidacy. Thus, campaign finance      ``reform,'' as proposed by McCain-Feingold 2001, strips power      from the People and gives it to the already wealthy and      powerful.       So there are winners and losers under McCain-Feingold 2001.      The losers are citizens of average means, citizens groups,      advocacy organizations, labor unions, and political parties.      The winners are the wealthy, major news corporations, and      incumbent politicians. It is small wonder then that the      wealthiest foundations and individuals are prime supporters      of so-called campaign finance ``reform,'' that the mainstream      media is the primary cheerleader for it, and that incumbent      politicians are so attracted to it.       But in our Republic, founded by the People for the People,      the right of the People to speak out on the most critical      issues of the day in the political arena through issue      advocacy and the right of the people to come together to pool      their resources through associations may not be infringed      without violating the Constitution. The United States Supreme      Court and other federal courts have been stalwart in defense      of the citizens' rights of free speech and association. Be      assured that if these unconstitutional measures pass, we      stand ready to promptly challenge them in the courts with a      high probability of success.  Mr. Bopp then goes on to layout the general principles that the Supreme Court has set forth for analyzing government restrictions on political speech and political association. He states that:       ``Many of the so-called reforms floating around Washington      are in fact nothing more than incumbent protection acts. Many      politicians feel threatened by negative advertisements and      want to control what is said during campaigns.'' Others want      to reduce spending on campaigns.       Chief among these proposals is McCain-Feingold 2001, the      self-styled ``Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001'' (S.      27), sponsored principally by Senators John McCain and      Russell Feingold. Though announced with the promise of      reducing the corrupting influence of big money, McCain-     Feingold 2001 is instead a broad attack on citizen      participation in our democratic Republic. This bill shakes a      fist at the First Amendment; if passed, it is destined for a      court-ordered funeral. The most egregious provisions and      their infirmities are discussed below.       As noted in the introduction, average citizens must pool      their resources to have an effect in the political sphere of      issue advocacy,     lobbying, and electoral activity. The wealthy and powerful      have no such need. So ordinary people band together in      ideological corporations, labor unions, and political parties      to amplify their voices. This right to associate is a bedrock      principle of our democratic Republic, powerfully protected by      the U.S. Constitution. McCain-Feingold 2001, however, would      suppress this ability, along with the foundational      constitutional right to free speech.       It should be noted at the outset of this analysis that      political speech and association are at the heart of the      First Amendment protections. As the United States Supreme      Court has declared, ``the constitutional guarantee [of the      First Amendment] has its fullest and most urgent application      precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.''      Free expression in connection with elections is no second-     class citizen, rather political expression is ``at the core      of our electoral process and of the First Amendment      freedoms.'' Thus, ``there is practically universal agreement      that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect      the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course      includ[ing] discussions of candidates.''       Furthermore, the fundamental right of association was well      articulated by the United States Supreme Court in the case of      NAACP v. Alabama, when the Court reviewed a suit against the      National Association for the Advancement of Colored People      brought by the State of Alabama seeking disclosure of all its      members.       The unanimous U.S. Supreme Court strongly affirmed the      constitutional protection for the freedom of association:       ``Effective advocacy of both public and private points of      view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced      by group association, as this Court has more than once      recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the      freedoms of speech and assembly. It is beyond debate that      freedom in association for the advancement of beliefs and      ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ``liberty'' assured by      the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which      embraces freedom of speech. Of course, it is immaterial      whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association      pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural      matters, and state action which may have the effect of      curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest      scrutiny.''     Thus, the Court held that ``[i]nviolability of privacy in      group association may in many circumstances be indispensable      to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where      a group espouses dissident beliefs,'' and it, therefore,      protected the identity of members of the NAACP form      disclosure.       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the      constitutional protection for association. `[E]ffective      advocacy of both public and private points of view,      particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by      group association. [Consequently,] the First and Fourteenth      Amendments guarantee freedom to associate with others for the      common advancement of political beliefs and ideas.' The Court      then noted that `action which may have the effect of      curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest      scrutiny.' This highest level of constitutional protection,      of course, flows from the essential function of associations      in allowing effective participation in our democratic      Republic. Organizations, from political action committees      (`PACs') to ideological corporations to labor unions to      political parties, exist to permit `amplified individual      speech.'  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp next explains how S. 27 unconstitutionally prohibits and restricts the abilities of outside groups to exercise their rights to freedom of speech and of association. He first discusses how the bill's ``electioneering communication'' standard sweeps in issue speech and then shows how that standard violates Supreme Court precedent:       McCain-Feingold 2001 prohibits political participation by      citizens of average means by broadly defining `electioneering      communication' so that issue advocacy expenditures      currently permitted become forbidden under federal law for      corporations and labor unions.       McCain-Feingold 2001 restricts the issue advocacy of      ideological, nonprofit corporations and labor unions by first      defining `electioneering communication' to include issue      advocacy, i.e., `any broadcast, cable, or satellite      communication' to `members of the electorate' that `refers to      a clearly identified [federal] candidate' `within 60 days      before a general . . . election (30 days before primaries),'      and then adding it to the list of prohibited activities by      corporations and labor unions.       The broad definition of `electioneering communication'      plainly sweeps in and prohibits a wide variety of issue      advocacy communications traditionally engaged in by such      organizations. First, Congress is often in session within 60      days before a general election and 30 days before a primary.      As a result, grass-roots lobbying regarding a bill to be      voted on during this 60 period would be prohibited if the      broadcast communication named a candidate by referring to the      bill in question (`the McCain-Feingold bill') or by asking a      constituent to lobby their Congressman or Senator.       With corporations and labor unions prohibited from making      such communications, McCain-Feingold 2001 then requires those      that may still do so, individuals and PACs, that spend over      $10,000 per year, to file reports with the FEC. Among other      things, the reports must list every disbursement over $200      and to whom it was made, the candidate(s) to be identified,      and the identity of all contributors aggregating $1,000 or      more during the year. The $10,000 triggering expenditure      occurs when a contract is made to disburse the funds, which      might be months in advance--allowing ample time for incumbent      politicians, who object to the general public being informed      of their voting record or positions on issues, to attempt to      discourage the broadcast medium, or to intimidate the person      or PAC paying for the ad, from actually running the ad.       In sum, the issue advocacy communications of nonprofit      corporations and labor unions, are treated like express      advocacy communications and organizations doing such issue      advocacy are treated like PACs. However, as seen next, there      is no constitutional warrant for Congress to regulate issue      advocacy or the organizations that primarily engage in it.      Period.       To protect First Amendment freedom, the Supreme Court has      created a bright line between permitted and proscribed      regulation of political speech. Government may only regulate      a communication that `expressly advocates the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate' (`express      advocacy'), by `explicit words' or `in express terms,' such      as `vote for,' `support,' or `defeat.' Election-related      speech that discusses candidates' views on issues is known by      the legal term of art `issue advocacy.' Although issue      advocacy undoubtedly influences elections, it is absolutely      protected from regulation--even if done by corporations,      labor unions, or political parties.       Although the First Amendment says that `Congress shall make      no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech', the      `reformers,' and the incumbent politicians that their efforts      would protect, have refused to take ``no'' as an answer. But      the federal courts have consistently enforced the First      Amendment against all attempts to regulate issue advocacy.       The Supreme Court has recognized that the freedom of speech      is both an inherent liberty and a necessary instrument for      limited representative government. The Court observed that      `[i]n a republic where the people[, not their legislators,]      are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed      choices among candidates for office is essential, for the      identities of those elected will inevitably shape the course      that we follow as a nation.' As a result, `it can hardly be      doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of the freedom of      speech] has its fullest and most urgent application precisely      to the conduct of campaigns for political office.'       The seminal case is the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo,      where the Supreme Court was faced with constitutional      questions regarding the post-Watergate amendments to the      Federal Election Campaign Act (`FECA')--which was by far the      most comprehensive attempt to regulate election-related      communications and spending to date. One of the more      nettlesome problems with which the Court struggled was the      question of what speech could be constitutionally subject to      government regulation. The post-Watergate FECA was written      broadly, subjecting any speech to regulation that was made      `relative to a clearly identified candidate' or `for the      purpose of . . . influencing' the nomination or election of      candidates for public office.       In considering this question, the Court recognized that the      difference between issue and candidate advocacy often      dissipated in the real world:       ``[T]he distinction between discussion of issues and      candidates and advocacy of the election or defeat of      candidates may often dissolve in practical application.      Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to      public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the      basis of their positions on various public issues, but      campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.''       Thus, the Court was faced with a dilemma whether to allow      regulation of issue advocacy because it might influence an      election or to protect issue advocacy because it is vital to      the conduct of our representative democracy, even though it      would influence elections.       The Court resolved this dilemma decisively in favor of      protection of issue advocacy. First, the Court recognized      that `a major purpose of [the First Amendment] was to protect      the free discussion of governmental affairs . . . of course      includ[ing] discussions of candidates.' Thus, the Court      concluded that issue advocacy was constitutionally      sacrosanct:       ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the      qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of      the system of government established by our Constitution. The      First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such      political expression in order `to assure [the] unfettered      interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political      and social changes desired by the people.' ''       Second, in order to provide this broad protection to issue      advocacy, the Court adopted the bright-line `express      advocacy' test which limited government regulation to only      those communications which `expressly advocate the election      or defeat of a clearly identified     candidate,' in `explicit words' or by `express terms.' In so      doing, the Court narrowed the reach of the FECA's disclosure      provisions to cover only `express advocacy.' A decade later,      the Court reaffirmed the express advocacy standard and      applied it to the ban on corporate and labor union      contributions and expenditures in connection with federal      elections.       Finally, not even the interest in preventing actual or      apparent corruption of candidates, which was found      sufficiently compelling to justify contribution limits, was      deemed adequate to regulate issue advocacy. The Court      rejected this interest even though it recognized that issue      advocacy could potentially be abused to obtain improper      benefits from candidates.       In adopting a test that focused on the words actually      spoken by the speaker, the Court expressly rejected the      argument that the test should focus on the intent of the      speaker or whether the effect of the message would be to      influence an election:       ``[W]hether words intended and designed to fall short of      invitation [to vote for or against a candidate] would miss      the mark is a question both of intent and of effect. No      speaker, in such circumstances, safely could assume that      anything he might say upon the general subject would not be      understood by some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly      clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general      advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker in these      circumstances wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding      of his hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be      drawn as to his intent and meaning.       ``Such a distinction offers no security for free      discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty      whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and      trim.''       Some `reformers' claim that the Court was not sufficiently      farsighted to see the effect that issue advocacy would      eventually have in influencing elections and, if we only      bring this to their attention, then the Court will allow      government regulation of it. However, the Court made clear      that it was not so naive:       ``Public discussion of public issues which also are      campaign issues readily and often unavoidably draws in      candidates and their positions, their voting records and      other official conduct. Discussions of those issues, as well      as more positive efforts to influence public opinion on them,      tend naturally and inexorably to exert some influence on      voting at elections.''     As a result, the Court explicitly endorsed the use of issue      advocacy to influence elections:       ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they      want to promote the candidate and his views.''       The several lower federal courts and state courts that have      been faced with restrictions on issue advocacy have      faithfully adhered to the `explicit' or `express' words of      advocacy test according to its plain terms.       For example, in Michigan, the Secretary of State      promulgated a rule that banned corporate and labor union      communications made within 45 days of an election that merely      contained the `name or likeness of a candidate.' Two      traditional adversaries, Right To Life of Michigan and      Planned Parenthood, challenged the rule in separate federal      courts and had the rule declared unconstitutional.      Consequently, if passed, McCain-Feingold 2001's materially      identical `electioneering communication' definition is dead      on arrival in the federal courts.       The weight of authority is indeed heavy; the express      advocacy test means exactly what it says. Campaign finance      statutes regulating more than explicit words of advocacy of      the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates are      `impermissibly broad' under the First Amendment.''  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp then notes that while S. 27 has an exception for not-for-profit corporations so that they would not be banned from engaging in core political speech, issue advocacy, the price that the bill extorts from these groups from doing so--the disclosure of confidential donor information--is unconstitutional. I will quote Mr. Bopp's analysis of this part of S. 27, Mr. President, but I should note that because this body has adopted Senator Wellstone's amendment to this bill, not-for-profit corporations now cannot engage in issue advocacy at all within 60 days of an election, even if they divulge to the federal government their confidential donor information. Mr. Bopp observes that:       McCain-Feingold 2001 makes a very minor exception for      nonprofits that (1) permits expenditures for ``electioneering      communication,'' (2) applies only to those organizations tax      exempt under Sec. Sec. 501(c)(4) or 527 of the Internal      Revenue Code, and (3) applies only if they are made by a      quasi-PAC established by the corporation, to which      contributions can only be made by individuals and with      respect to which all receipts and disbursements must be      reported.       The first thing to be noted about this minor exception is      that it only applies to 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations. That      means all other nonprofits are excluded from engaging in      issue advocacy for a couple of months before an election,      including 501(c)(3)s, veterans groups, trade associations,      and labor unions.       Furthermore, this quasi-PAC is required to report all of      its contributors of $1,000 or more. This is a very      substantial burden because it exposes contributors to      harassment and intimidation by ideological foes. The United      States Supreme Court in Buckley held that such burdens      could not be applied to issue-oriented groups, as McCain-     Feingold 2001 does, because disclosure of private      associations is an unconstitutional burden.''  Next, Mr. President, Mr. Bopp explains how the ``coordination'' provisions of McCain-Feingold effectively prohibits persons from exercising their First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances, as well as their free speech and associational rights. Mr. Bopp notes that:       McCain-Feingold 2001 also prohibits corporations and labor      unions for funding any ``coordinated activity.''      ``Coordinated activity'' is so broadly defined and uses such      vague terms that it would ban nearly everything of any      conceivable value to a candidate by converting it into a      forbidden ``contribution.''       ``Coordinated activity'' is ``anything of value provided by      a person [including corporations and labor unions] in      connection with a Federal candidate's election who is or      previously has been within the same election cycle acting in      coordination with that candidate . . . (regardless of whether      the value being provided is in the form of a communication      that expressly advocates a vote for or against a      candidate).'' Thus, there are two key concepts to this      prohibition: (1) ``anything of value'' and (2)      ``coordination.''  Mr. Bopp first discusses why ``anything of value'' is both vague and broad, and he then explains why a ``coordinated activity'' is also extremely sweeping:       A ``coordinated activity'' includes ``anything of value      provided by a person in connection with a Federal candidates'      election.'' ``Anything of value'' is breathtakingly broad and      vague and any such thing is subject to being coordinated. It      provides no limit or notice to organizations subject to civil      and criminal sanctions for coordinating it with a candidate.       Furthermore, with respect to communications, it is not      limited to express advocacy and thus clearly encompasses      issue advocacy by an organization. While the courts are      currently divided on whether a coordinated communication must      contain express advocacy to be subject to regulation or      prohibition, no court has suggested that any and all      communications are so subject.       Under current law, coordination between a candidate and a      citizen group exists only when there is actually prior      communication about a specific expenditure for a specific      project that effectively puts the expenditure under the      candidate's control or is made based on information provided      by the candidate about the candidate's needs or plans.      However, McCain-Feingold 2001 expands ``coordination'' to      include, inter alia, mere discussion of a candidate's      ``message'' any time during ``the same election cycle,''      i.e., a two-year period or, perhaps, a four-year period, if      it relates to a President, or a six-year period if it relates      to a Senator.       For example, if an incorporated ideological organization      praised Sen. McCain for his work on campaign finance      ``reform'' early in a session of Congress and worked with him      on promoting such ``reform'' legislation, then      ``coordination'' would be established and anything of value      to Sen. McCain's candidacy would be deemed coordinated, would      be a contribution to his campaign, and would be illegal      because corporations cannot make contributions to candidates.       However, the very notion that American citizens should be      punished for communicating, or even working, with their      elected officials on a wide range of public issues important      to the official and his constituency by having any subsequent      efforts to praise the candidate's issue position or to      support the candidate in his or her campaign considered a      coordinated activity is repugnant to our constitutional      scheme of participatory government in a democratic Republic      run by and answerable to the People. In a conceptually      related context, in Clifton v. FEC, the First Circuit struck      down the FEC's voter guide regulations which prohibited any      oral communications with candidates in preparation of voter      guides. The court held that this rule is ``patently offensive      to the First Amendment'' and that it is ``beyond reasonable      belief that, to prevent corruption or illicit coordination,      the government could prohibit voluntary discussions between      citizens and their legislators and candidates on public      issues.''       And coordination would also be presumed, under McCain-     Feingold 2001, if the ideological corporation used the same      vendor of ``professional services,'' including ``polling,      media advice, fundraising, campaign research, political      advice, or direct mail services (except for mailhouse      services)'' if the vendor had worked for a candidate and if      the vendor is retained to do work related to that candidate's      election. Under this scheme, a vendor's decision to do work      for a candidate could unilaterally lock an ideological      corporation out of otherwise permitted issue advocacy at      election time. And even if the corporation has a connected      PAC, the PAC would be prohibited from making an independent      expenditures of more than $5,000,     since that expenditure would also be deemed to be a      contribution.       This presumption is also fatally infirm as coordination      must be proven. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.      v. FEC, the FEC took the position that party expenditures      were presumed to be coordinated with their candidates as a      matter of law. The Supreme Court rejected this view: ``An      agency's simply calling an independent expenditure a      `coordinated expenditure' cannot (for constitutional      purposes) make it one. . . . [T]he government cannot      foreclose the exercise of constitutional rights by mere      labels.'' The Court held that there must be ``actual      coordination as a matter of fact.'' Congress, therefore,      cannot merely recite some factual scenarios wherein it might      be possible, or even probable, that coordination with      candidates takes place and then presume as a matter of law      that it has occurred in such instances. To do so, would allow      the government to drastically curtail independent      expenditures by mere labels, which cannot be constitutionally      limited.       Finally, McCain-Feingold finds ``coordination'' if there is      any ``general understanding'' with the candidate about the      expenditure. This general catchall goes way beyond the narrow      understanding that the courts have on what ``coordination''      is. Consistent with other federal courts, the District Court      in FEC v. Christian Coalition held that a communication       ``becomes `coordinated' where the candidate or her agents      can exercise control over, or where there has been      substantial discussion or negotiation between the campaign      and the spender over a communication's: (1) Contents; (2)      timing; (3) location, mode, or intended audience (e.g.,      choice between newspaper or radio advertisement); or (4)      `volume' (e.g., number of copies of printed materials or      frequency of media spots). `Substantial discussion' or      `negotiation' is such that the candidate and spender emerge      as partners or joint venturers in the expressive expenditure,      but the candidate and spender need not be equal partners.''     This is a far cry from a `general understanding.'  Mr. President, at this point in Mr. Bopp's analysis, he explains that the citizenry needs a bright line not only to protect them from prosecution, but to protect them from a punitive investigation simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights.       While it may be theoretically possible to do issue advocacy      without running afoul of it being a prohibited      `electioneering communication' or `coordinated activity,'      only the reckless, foolish, or wealthy and powerful are      likely to try. Particularly in Washington, D.C., the      punishment is in the process. Any organization that does      something that could be deemed of value to a candidate can      expect to be the subject of an FEC complaint and      investigation to ferret out whether the activity was      `coordinated.' Thus, publicly praising an officeholder for      her vote on a bill invites investigation by the FEC. Daring      to tell constituents to get an incumbent to change his      position on an upcoming vote could provoke an FEC      investigation. This is the world of ubiquitous FEC      investigations that all advocacy groups can expect.       And these `mere' investigations themselves violate the      First Amendment. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained when      Congress was busy investigating Communist influence in the      1940's and 50's, `[t]he mere summoning of a witness and      compelling him to testify, against his will, about his      beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of      government interference' with First Amendment freedoms.  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp then notes another major impediment to individuals and citizens' groups exercising their First Amendment rights, and that is how the bill's coordination provisions interplay with contribution limits. He notes that ``[f]or any individual, and for any organization that can actually do a `coordinate activity,' which seems to be only a federal PAC, the `coordinated activity' would be limited by contribution limits. So a substantial amount of traditional `independent expenditures' by PACs are now swept under the control of McCain-Feingold 2001 and limited because a multi-candidate PAC can only make a contribution of $5,000 per election to a candidate.''  Of course, Mr. President, this is only part of the story. As Mr. Bopp explains, S. 27 also violates the free speech and associational rights of our political parties in its effort to regulate non-federal money. Specifically, he states that ``[i]n its effort to regulate `soft money,' McCain-Feingold 2001 has two dramatic adverse effects on political party activity: (1) it imposes federal election law limits on the state and local activities of national political parties, and (2) it dramatically limits the issue advocacy, legislative, and organizational activities of political parties. But first it is important to recall the U.S. Supreme Court's comment that `[w]e are not aware of any special dangers of corruption associated with political parties. . . .' Political parties are merely the People associating with others who share their values to advance issues, legislation, and candidates that further those values. When they do these things, they are just doing their historic job as good citizens. The notion that they are somehow corrupt for doing so is both strange and constitutionally infirm.''  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp next notes that this bill federalizes state and local parties and totally federalizes national parties, which engage in a multitude of activities besides federal elections. He observes that ``[a]lthough national parties care about local, state, and federal elections, they are treated by McCain-Feingold 2001 as if they only care about federal elections. As to state and local political parties, if there is a federal candidate on the ballot, they too are treated as if only the federal candidate matters. In short, McCain-Feingold 2001 federalizes the state and local election activities of national, state, and local political parties.''  Mr. Bopp then explains how this federalization occurs: ``As to national political parties, this happens as a result of the total ban on national political parties receiving `soft money.' This happens to state and local political parties as a result of the definition of `federal election activity,' which governs political party expenditures if any federal candidate is on the general election ballot, and which includes `voter registration' during the 120 days before an election, `voter identification, get-out-the-vote activity, or [any activity promoting a political party].' Therefore, if state and local political parties do `federal election activity,' they must use `hard money,' i.e., money subject to FECA restrictions, for such activity if a federal candidate is on the ballot. These activities are traditional activities that state and local parties have always done and the national political parties have supported. The fact that there is a federal candidate on the ballot, along with the state and local candidates for whom state and local parties have the greater concern, does not justify federalizing and limiting these activities.''  Mr. Bopp concludes his analysis of S. 27 by explaining the constitutional problem with the bill's prohibition on the parties' use of non-federal dollars to engage in issue discussion. He first notes that under the bill `` `federal election activity' includes `a public communication that refers to a clearly identified [federal] candidate .  .  . and that promotes or supports a candidate or opposes a candidate .  .  . (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) .  .  .' Presently, political parties, like any other entity, may receive and spend an unlimited amount of money on issue advocacy. McCain-Feingold 2001 would virtually eliminate this basic constitutional freedom for national political parties, by prohibiting the receipt of all `soft money,' and severely limit it for state and local political parties, by requiring only hard money to be used if a federal candidate is involved. Because McCain-Feingold 2001 prohibits the raising of `soft money' by national political parties, they have no such money available for issue advocacy, legislative, and organizational activities. It treats political parties as if they were just federal-candidate election machines. As a result, McCain-Feingold 2001 has effectively amputated these other important, historical activities of political parties.''  Mr. President, the constitutional problems with such restrictions on parties are explained in detail by Mr. Bopp as follows:       [T]hese restrictions fail constitutional muster. Political      parties enjoy the same unfettered right to issue advocacy as      other entities, which is especially appropriate because      advancing a broad range of issues is their raison d'etre.      `Reforms' banning political parties from receiving and      spending so-called `soft money' cannot be justified as      preventing corruption, since the Supreme Court has already      held that interest insufficient for restricting issue      advocacy in Buckley.       If individuals and narrow interest groups enjoy the basic      First Amendment freedom to discuss issues and the position of      candidates on those issues, how can political parties, which      have wide bases of interests that are necessarily tempered      and diffused, be deprived of the right to engage in such      issue advocacy?       However, proponents of abolishing `soft money' argue that      this is simply a `contribution limit.' The fallacy of that      argument, of     course, is that the Supreme Court has justified contribution      limits only on the ground that large contributions create the      reality or appearance of quid pro quo corruption, which, as      discussed above, cannot justify a limit on issue advocacy.       Furthermore, the proposed ban on soft money contributions      cannot be justified on the theory that political parties      corrupt federal candidates, which the Supreme Court has      already rejected. In Colorado Republican, the FEC took the      position that independent, uncoordinated expenditures by      political parties ought to be treated as contributions to the      benefitted candidate. Such treatment would have resulted in      allowing individuals, candidates, and political action      committees to spend unlimited amounts of money on independent      expenditures to advocate the election of a candidate, while      limiting the amount a political party could spend for the      same purpose.       The Supreme Court disagreed with the FEC, noting that `[w]e      are not aware of any special dangers of corruption associated      with political parties'' and, after observing that      individuals could contribute more money to political parties      ($20,000) than to candidates ($1,000) and PACs ($5,000) and      that the ``FECA permits unregulated `soft money'      contributions to a party for certain activities,' the Court      concluded that the `opportunity for corruption posed by these      greater opportunities for contributions is, at best,      attenuated.' The Court continued in this vein with respect to      the FEC's proposed ban on political party independent      expenditures, which has direct application to McCain-Feingold      2001's ban on soft money contributions:       ``[R]ather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive      influence of political parties, the legislative history [of      the Act] demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance      what was seen as an important and legitimate role for      political parties in American elections.  .  .  .       ``We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law      controls the outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution      that grants to individuals, candidates, and ordinary      political committees the right to make unlimited independent      expenditures could deny the same right to political      parties.''     The concurring justices also found little, if any,      opportunity for party corruption of candidates because of      their very nature and structure.       The Supreme Court echoed the same theme with respect to the      independent expenditures of political action committees:       ``The fact that candidates and elected officials may alter      or reaffirm their own positions on issues in response to      political messages paid for by PACs can hardly be called      corruption, for one of the essential features of democracy is      the presentation to the electorate of varying points of      view.''     If this is true of PACs, then a fortiori there can be no      corruption or appearance of corruption resulting from issue      advocacy by political parties.       In addition, the Supreme Court in MCFL provided further      guidance on whether the threat of corruption is posed by an      organization such as a political party. The Court considered      the ban on independent expenditures by corporations under 2      U.S.C. Sec. 441b. The MCFL Court evaluated whether there was      any risk of corruption with regard to an MCFL-type      organization that would justify such a ban on its political      speech. While MCFL considered whether an ideological      corporation was sufficiently like a business corporation to      justify the ban on using corporate dollars for independent      expenditures, there are several transferable concepts to      evaluating the threat of corruption posed by a political      party.  The concern raised by the FEC in MCFL was that Sec. 441b served to prevent corruption by `prevent[ing] an organization from using an individual's money for purposes that the individual may not support.' The Court found that `[t]his rationale for regulation is not compelling with respect' to MCFL-type organizations because `[i]ndividuals who contribute to [an MCFL-type organization] are fully aware of its political purposes, and in fact contribute precisely because they support those purposes.' `[I]ndividuals contribute to a political organization in part because they regard such a contribution as a more effective means of advocacy than spending the money under their own personal direction.' `Finally, a contributor dissatisfied with how funds are used can simply stop contributing.' Thus, the Court held that the prohibitions on corporate contributions and expenditures in Sec. 441b could not be constitutionally applied to non-profit ideological corporations which do not serve as a conduit for business corporation contributions.       Political parties similarly pose no risk of corruption      because people give money to parties precisely because they      support what the political party stands for. A contribution      to a political party is for the purpose of enhancing advocacy      of the issues the party represents. Any individual unhappy      with the use of the money may simply quit contributing and      leave the political party. In sum, the threat of corruption      cannot justify a limit on issue advocacy and, even if it      could, political parties pose no threat of corruption to      their candidates.       Finally, the Supreme Court also found that, just as      independent expenditures of interest groups pose no danger of      corrupting candidates, neither do those of political parties.      And while no one disputes that expenditures on express      advocacy actually coordinated with candidates are properly      contributions to the candidate because of the possibility of      quid pro quo corruption, the Court held that coordination      must be proven as a matter of fact; it cannot be presumed.      `Reforms' may not presume coordination where it does not      actually exist.       Thus, there is no justification, in either policy or law,      for the severe limits on national, state, and local political      parties that McCain-Feingold 2001 imposes.  Thus, Mr. President, Mr. Bopp has thoroughly shown the myriad of constitutional problems from which this bill suffers, and I am confident that the Supreme Court will ultimately validate his analysis.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, the letter authored by Laura Murphy, Director of the Washington, D.C. office of the American Civil Liberties Union and Professor Joel Gora of the Brooklyn Law School. In this letter, Ms. Murphy and Professor Gora analyze S. 27, ``The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001'' and thoroughly discuss its many constitutional infirmities.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Civil Liberties Union, Washington National            Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2001.       Dear Senator: The McCain-Feingold bill, also misnamed as      ``The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001'' (S.      27) is a destructive distraction from the serious business of      meaningful campaign finance reform. Meaningful campaign      finance reform would develop comprehensive programs for      providing public resources, benefits and support for all      qualified federal political candidates. Since 25 years of      experience have shown that limits on political funding simply      won't work, constitutionally or practically, it is time to      seek a more First Amendment-friendly way to expand political      opportunity. Public financing for all qualified candidates is      an option that provides the necessary support for candidacies      without the imposition of burdensome and unconstitutional      limits and restraints. The ACLU has long argued for this, but      instead we must use our time today to condemn the ill-     conceived iterations of McCain-Feingold that are non-remedies      to our national campaign finance woes and are wholly at odds      with the essence of the First Amendment.       Simply put, the McCain-Feingold bill is a recipe for      political repression because it egregiously violates      longstanding free speech rights in several ways: It stifles      issue advocacy in violation of the First Amendment; it      criminalizes any constitutionally-protected contact that      groups and individuals may have with candidates (through bans      on so-called ``coordination''); and it virtually destroys      political parties in an unconstitutional fashion.        I. S. 27 Erodes Robust Citizen Speech Prior to Elections       As Virginia Woolf stated, ``If we don't believe in freedom      of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it      at all.'' Clearly, the authors and supporters of McCain-     Feingold despise any form of issue advocacy that has the      audacity to mention candidates for federal office by name.      The bill virtually silences issue advocacy (redefined as      ``electioneering communications'') in three ways:       Section 201 requires accelerated and expanded disclosure of      the funding of issue advocacy.       Section 202 effectively criminalizes issue advocacy as a      prohibited contribution if it is ``coordinated'' in the      loosest sense of that term with a federal candidate.       Section 203 bans issue advocacy completely if it is      sponsored by a labor union, a corporation (including such      non-profit corporations organized to advance a particular      cause like the ACLU or the National Right to Life      Committee or Planned Parenthood, unless they are willing      to obey the government's stringent new rules) or other      similar organized entity. Even an individual who receives      financial support--from prohibited contributors such as      corporations, unions or wealthy individuals--is also      barred from engaging in ``electioneering communications.''       The bill would impose these limitations on communications      about issues regardless of whether the communication      ``expressly advocates'' the election or defeat of a      particular candidate. Nor is there any requirement of even      showing a partisan purpose or intent. Instead, during 60 days      before a primary or 30 days before a general election, any      such communication is subject to the new controls simply by      identifying any person who is a federal candidate, which will      usually be an incumbent politician.       These restraints and punishments are triggered by the      making of any ``broadcast, cable, or satellite      communication'' which ``refers to a clearly identified      candidate for Federal office'' within 60 days of a general or      runoff election or 30 days of a primary election or      convention, ``made to an audience that includes members of      the electorate'' for such election or convention. This      distinction between broadcast, cable and satellite from     those communications through other media bears no relevance      to the only recognized justification for campaign finance      limitations or prohibitions, namely, the concern with      corruption. Suppressing speech in one medium while permitting      it in another is not a lesser form of censorship, just a      different form.  A. These Issue Advocacy Restrictions Would Have Adverse, Real-Life                               Consequences       Had these provisions been law during the 2000 elections,      for example, they would have effectively silenced messages      from issue organizations across the entire political      spectrum. The NAACP ads--financed by a sole anonymous donor--     vigorously highlighting Governor Bush's failure to endorse      hate crimes legislation--is a classic example of robust and      uninhibited public debate about the qualifications and      actions of political officials. By the same token, last      Spring, when New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a candidate for      the United States Senate, any broadcast criticism of his      record on police brutality as mayor of New York, undertaken      by the New York Civil Liberties Union, would have subjected      that organization to the risk of severe legal sanctions and      punishment under these proposals. The Supreme Court in cases      from New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)      through Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) to California      Democratic Party v. Jones, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (2000) have      repeatedly protected full and vigorous debate during an      election season. The provisions of the pending bills would      silence that debate.       Second, the ban on ``electioneering communications'' would      stifle legislative advocacy on pending bills. The blackout      periods coincide with crucial legislative periods, including      the months of September and October as well as months during      the Spring. During Presidential years, the blackout periods      would include the entire Presidential primary season,      conceivably right up through the August national      nominating conventions. For example had this provision      been law in 2000, for most of the year it would have been      illegal for the ACLU or the National Right to Life      Committee to criticize the ``McCain-Feingold'' bill as an      example of unconstitutional campaign finance legislation      or to urge elected officials to oppose that bill! The only      time the blackout ban would be lifted would be in August,      when many Americans are on vacation!       During the 104th Congress, for example, the ACLU identified      at least 10 major, controversial bills that it worked on that      were debated in either chamber of the Congress within 60 days      prior to the November 1996 general election. This legislation      includes several anti-abortion bills including so-called      partial birth abortion legislation, public disclosure of the      CIA budget, creation of a federal database of sex offenders,      new federal penalties for methamphetamine use, prohibition on      discrimination of gays and lesbians in the workplace, same-     sex marriage prohibition, anti-immigration legislation and      school vouchers, among others. This pattern of legislating      close to primary and general elections has only been repeated      in subsequent Congresses.       B. Why These Limitations Run Afoul of the First Amendment       Under the reasoning of Buckley v. Valeo and all the cases      which have followed suit, the funding of any public speech      that falls short of such `express advocacy' is wholly immune      from campaign finance laws. Speech which comments on,      criticizes or praises, applauds or condemns the public      records and actions of public officials and political      candidates--even though it mentions and discusses candidates,      and even though it occurs during an election year or even an      election season--is entirely protected by the First      Amendment.       The Court made that crystal clear in Buckley when it      fashioned the express advocacy doctrine. That doctrine holds      that the FECA can constitutionally regulate only      ``communications that in express terms advocate the election      or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,'' and include      ``explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat.'' 424      U.S. at 44, 45. The Court developed that doctrine because it      was greatly concerned that giving a broad scope to FECA, and      allowing it to control the funding of all discussion of      policy and issues that even mentioned a public official or      political candidate, would improperly deter and penalize      vital criticism of government because speakers would fear      running afoul of the FECA's prohibitions. ``The distinction      between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of      election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in      practical operation. Candidates, especially incumbents, are      intimately tied to public issues involving legislative      proposals and government actions. Not only do candidates      campaign on the basis of their positions on various public      issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public      interest.'' Id. at 42-43. If any reference to a candidate in      the context of advocacy of an issue rendered the speech or      the speaker subject to campaign finance controls, the      consequences for the First Amendment would be intolerable.       Issue advocacy is freed from government control through a      number of other doctrines the courts have recognized as well.      First, the constitutional right to engage in unfettered issue      advocacy is not limited to individuals or cause      organizations. Business corporations can speak publicly and      without limit on anything short of express advocacy of a      candidate's election. See First National Bank of Boston v.      Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978). (Of course, media corporations      can speak publicly and without limitation on any subject,      including editorial endorsements of the election or defeat of      candidates, i.e. ``express advocacy'', see Mills v. Alabama,      384 U.S. 214 (1966).)       Contributions to issue advocacy campaigns cannot be limited      in any way, either. See Citizens Against Rent Control v.      Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 (1981). Finally, issue advocacy may      not even be subject to registration and disclosure. See      McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995);      Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 821, 843-44 (1975) (holding      unconstitutional a portion of the FECA which required      reporting and disclosure by issue organizations that      publicized any voting record or other information ``referring      to a candidate''). The rationale for these principles is not      just that these various groups have a right to speak, but      also that the public has a right to know and a need to hear      what they have to say. This freedom is essential to fostering      an informed electorate capable of governing its own affairs.       Thus, no limits, no forced disclosure, no forms, no      filings, no controls should inhibit any individual's or      group's ability to support or oppose a tax cut, to argue for      more or less regulation of tobacco, to support or oppose      abortion, flag-burning, campaign finance reform and to      discuss the stands of candidates on those issues.       That freedom must be preserved whether the speaker is a      political party, an issue organization, a labor union, a      corporation, a foundation, a newspaper or an individual. That      is all protected ``issue advocacy,'' and the money that funds      it is all, in effect, ``soft money.'' Those who advocate      government controls on what they call ``sham'' or ``phony''      or ``so-called'' issue ads, and those who advocate outlawing      or severely restricting ``soft money'' should realize how      broad their proposals would sweep and how much First      Amendment law they would run afoul.       Finally, it is no answer to these principled objections      that this flawed bill would permit certain non-profit      organizations to sponsor ``electioneering communications'' if      they in effect created a Political Action Committee to fund      those messages. Under governing constitutional case law,      groups like the ACLU and others cannot be made to jump      through the government's hoops in order to criticize the      government's policies and those who make them. In addition,      most non-profits would be unwilling to risk their tax status      or incur legal expenses by engaging in what the IRS might      view as partisan communications. Moreover, the groups would      still be barred from using organizational or institutional      resources for any such communications. They would have to      rely solely on individual supporters, whose names would have      to be disclosed, with the concomitant threat to the right of      privacy and the right to contribute anonymously to      controversial organizations that was upheld in landmark cases      such as NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958). This holding      guaranteed the opportunities that donors now have to      contribute anonymously--a real concern when a cause is      unpopular or divisive.         II. S. 27 Assaults the Free Speech of Issue Advocates       The second systemic defect in this bill is its grossly      expanded concept of coordinated activity between politicians      and citizens groups. Such ``coordination'' then taints and      disables any later commentary by that citizen group about      that politician. By treating all but the most insignificant      contacts between candidates and citizens as potential      campaign ``coordination,'' the bill would render any      subsequent action which impacts that politician as a      regulated or prohibited ``contribution'' or ``expenditure''      to that candidate's campaign. These provisions violate      established principles of freedom of speech and association.       Under existing law, contact coordination between a      candidate or campaign and an outside group can be regulated      as coordinated activity only where the group takes some      public action at the request or suggestion of the candidate      or his representatives, i.e., where the candidate is the      driving force behind the outside group's action. See Federal      Election Commission v. Christian Coalition, 52 F. Supp. 2d 45      (D. D.C. 1999). Under the bill, however, the definition of      coordination is expanded in dramatic ways with severe      consequences, thereby prohibiting certain kinds of contact      with candidates. A coordinated activity can be found whenever      a group or individual provides ``anything of value in      connection with a Federal candidate's election'' where that      person or group has interacted with the candidate then or in      the past in a number of ways. This includes, for example,      instances which the outside person or group has ``previously      participated in discussions'' with the candidate or their      representative, ``about the candidate's campaign strategy . .      . including a discussion about .  .  . message. . .''       Section 214 of the bill thus imposes a year round      prohibition on all communications that are deemed ``of      value'' to a federal candidate. The bill wrongly asserts that      issue groups are ``coordinating'' if they merely discuss      elements of the lawmaker's message with the lawmaker or his      or her staff anytime during a two year period. For example,      if a veteran's group suggests to a candidate how best to talk      about the flag amendment in order to win the hearts and minds      of voters, the group then can't run ads in Senator McCain's      state praising him for protecting the flag.       Once such so-called coordination is established it triggers      a total ban on issuing any communication to the public deemed      of value to the candidate, and it defines such communication      as an illegal corporate contribution! These rules act as a      continuing prior restraint, which bars the individual or      group from engaging in core First Amendment speech for the      lawmaker's entire term of office. Even if such an      organization has a connected PAC, it can no longer engage in      any independent expenditure affecting the lawmaker because by      merely speaking to the candidate or his or her staff it has      engaged in illegal ``coordination.'' Here again, the bill      attempts to impose another gag rule on issue advocacy      organizations.       Translated into the way in which citizen advocacy groups      work, this means that a group cannot urge a candidate to make      a particular proposal a part of the candidate's platform if      the group subsequently plans to engage in independent      advocacy on that issue. Likewise, a group like the National      Rifle Association could not discuss a gun control vote or      position with a Representative or Senator if the NRA will      subsequently produce a box score that praises or criticizes      that official's stand. Similar to the ban on coordination      (Section 202) discussed earlier in this letter, banning      ``coordination'' of ``electioneering activity'' resulting in      a long blackout period when an outside group or individual      can be blocked from broadcasting information about a      candidate, this ban--on coordination of ``anything of      value''--can operate month in and month out throughout the      entire two or six year term of office of the pertinent      politician. That is why the AFL-CIO, among other groups, is      so concerned about the treacherous sweep of the anti-     coordination rules. See ``Futile Labor: Why Are The Unions      Against McCain-Feingold?'' The New Republic, March 12, 2001,      pp. 14-16.       Thus, these coordination rules will wreak havoc on the      ability of the representatives of unions, corporations, non-     profits and even citizen groups to interact in important ways      with elected representatives for fear that the taint of      coordination will silence the voices of those groups in the      future. The First Amendment is designed to encourage and      foster such face-to-face discussions of government and      politics, see Buckley v. American Constitutional Law      Foundation, 525 U.S. 182 (1999), not to drive a wedge between      the people and their elected representatives .III. S. 27 Allows the Unconstitutional Virtual Destruction of Political                                 Parties       In addition to its disruptive and unconstitutional effect      on issue groups and issue advocacy, S. 27 also would have a      disruptive if not destructive effect on political parties in      America by totally shutting off the sources of funding that      support so much of what American political parties do. It      would cast a pall over the vital democratic work that      political parties perform. These unprecedented restrictions      on soft money would make parties less able to support      grassroots activity, candidate recruitment and get-out-the-     vote efforts.   A. The Bill Represents a Three-pronged Attack on Political Parties       (1) Section 101 of the bill completely eliminates all      ``soft money'' funding for all national political parties and      all of their constituent committees and component parts.      Under current law there are no federal restrictions on      raising, spending or routing such soft money by federal state      or local parties or their candidates or office holders. Under      McCain-Feingold, all of the funding for all of the vital      party activities described above would become illegal, unless      it came only from individuals, in small dollar amounts. In      other words, political parties may only raise and spend      highly regulated ``hard money'' for virtually everything they      do.       (2) Section 101 of the bill also bars any federal candidate      or officeholder from having any contact whatsoever with the      funding of any ``federal election activity'' by      any organization unless that activity is funded strictly      with hard money. The scope of ``federal election      activity'' is extremely broad and encompasses the      following activities if they have any connection to any      federal election or candidate: (1) voter registration      activity within 4 months of a federal election, (2) voter      identification, get-out-the-vote activity or ``generic      campaign activity,'' (3) any significant ``public      communication'' by broadcast, print or any other means      that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and      ``promotes,'' ``supports,'' ``attacks,'' or ``opposes'' a      candidate for office (regardless of whether the      communication contains ``express advocacy''). Under this      rule, a candidate would attend an NAACP Voters Rights      benefit dinner at his or her peril, if funds were being      raised for any ``federal election activity'' such as      getting people to the polls on election day. The same      might be true for one who attended an ACLU Bill of Rights      Day fund raiser, when the ACLU produces a box score on      civil liberties voting records during an election season.       (3) The bill also reaches and regulates all State and local      political parties and bans them from raising or spending soft      money for any ``Federal election activity'' also or any      activity which has any bearing on a federal election. It      basically federalizes all of the restrictions and limitations      of the FECA.    B. Political Party Activity is Protected by the First Amendment       Political funding by political parties is strongly      protected by the First Amendment no less than political      funding by candidates and committees. The only political      funding that can be subject to control is either      contributions given directly to candidates and their      campaigns (or partisan expenditures explicitly coordinated      with campaigns) or communications that constitute express      advocacy. These can be subject to source limitations (no      corporations or unions or comparable entities) or amount      restraints ($1,000, or $5,000 in the case of PACs). All other      funding of political activity and communication is beyond      presumptive constitutional control. That would include soft      money activities by political parties.       Parties are both advocates for their candidates' electoral      success and issue organizations that influence the public      debate. Get-out-the-vote drives, voter registration drives,      issue advocacy, policy discussion, grass-roots development      and the like are all activities fundamentally protected by      the First Amendment and engaged in by a wide variety of      individuals and organizations. An issue ad by the ACLU      criticizing an incumbent Mayor on police brutality is an      example of soft money activity, in the broadest sense of that      term, as is an editorial on the same subject in The New York      Times. We need more of all such activity during an election      season, not less, from political parties and others as well.       The right of individuals and organizations, corporate,      union or otherwise, to support such issue advocacy traces      back to the holding in Buckley that only those communications      that ``expressly advocate'' the election or defeat of      identified candidates can be subject to control. The Supreme      Court in the 1996 Colorado Republican Federal Campaign      Committee v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604 (1996) case noted the varying      uses of soft money by political parties. In the recent case,      Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Governmental PAC, 528 U.S. 377      (2000), which upheld hard money contribution limits, the      Court's opinion was silent on whether soft money could be      regulated at all. Although certain individual Justices      invited Congress to consider doing so, the case itself had      nothing to do with soft money.       To be sure, to the extent soft money funds issue advocacy      and political activities by political parties, it becomes      something of a hybrid: it supports protected and      unregulatable issue speech and activities, but by party      organizations often more closely tied to candidates and      officeholders. The organizational relationship between      political parties and public officials might allow greater      regulatory flexibility than would be true with respect to      issue advocacy by other organizations. Thus, for example,      disclosure of large soft money contributions to political      parties, as is currently required by regulation, might be      acceptable, even though it would be impermissible if imposed      on non-party issue organizations. But the total ban on soft      money contributions to political parties raises serious      constitutional difficulties.       Just last year, the Supreme Court reminded us once again of      the vital role that political parties play in our democratic      life, by serving as the primary vehicles for the political      views and voices of millions and millions of Americans.      ``Representative democracy in any populous unit of governance      is unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band      together in promoting the electoral candidates who espouse      their political views. The formation of national political      parties was almost concurrent with the formation of the      Republic itself.'' California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530      U.S. 567 2402, 2408 (2000). As Justice Anthony M. Kennedy put      it in his separate opinion in Colorado Republican Federal      Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 518 U.S.      604 (1996): ``The First Amendment embodies a profound      national commitment to the principle that debate on public      issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.      Political parties have a unique role in serving this      principle; they exist to advance their members' shared      political beliefs.'' Id. at 629.       While electing candidates is a central mission of political      parties, they do so much more than that. They engage in issue      formulation and advocacy on a daily basis, they mobilize      their members through voter registration drives, they      organize get-out-the-vote efforts, they engage in generic      party communications to the public. Much of these activities      are supported by what S. 27 would deem as soft money. The      bill before you would dry up these significant sources of      funding for those party activities. It would basically starve      the parties' ability to engage in the grass roots and issue-     advocacy work that makes American political parties so vital      to American democracy.    C. S. 27 Diminishes the Ability of Political Parties to Compete       Equitably with Others Who Choose to Speak During Campaigns.       Finally, the law unfairly bans parties, but no other      organizations, from raising or spending soft money. That      would mean that anyone else--corporations, foundations, media      organizations, labor unions, bar associations, wealthy      individuals--could use any resources without limit to attack      a party and its programs, yet the party would be defenseless      to respond except by using limited hard money dollars. The      NRA could use unregulated funds to mount ferocious attacks on      the Democratic Party's stand on gun control, and the Party      would be effectively silenced and unable to respond.      Conversely, NARAL could mercilessly attack the Republican      Party's stand on abortion, using corporate and foundation      funds galore, and that     Party would likewise be stifled from responding in kind. A      system which lets one side of a debate speak, while silencing      the other, violates both the First Amendment and equality      principles embodied in the Constitution.       The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001 is not      reform at all, but is a fatally flawed assault on First      Amendment rights.       Sincerely,     Laura W. Murphy,       Director.
