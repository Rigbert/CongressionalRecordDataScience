 President, in January of this year the President of the United States made several appointments without obtaining the Senate's advice and consent. He asserted that the Recess Appointments Clause of the Constitution authorized these appointments, even though the Senate was conducting a series of pro forma sessions at the time of the appointments. According to the administration, these pro forma sessions had no legal effect on the President's authority under this Clause because pro forma sessions do not allow the Senate to perform its constitutional functions or conduct business. The Congressional Research Service has found, however, that pro forma sessions, such as the ones occurring during the time of these so-called recess appointments, have satisfied--and continue to satisfy--numerous Constitutional, statutory, and legislative requirements, and that the Senate, in fact, has conducted business during such sessions. The Congressional Research Service also has found that the administration has repeatedly recognized the legal validity of pro forma sessions for purposes of satisfying these various requirements. I ask unanimous consent that the analysis of the Congressional Research Service from March 8, 2012 entitled ``Certain Questions Related to Pro Forma Sessions of the Senate'' be printed in the Record following this statement.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                                    March 8, 2012.     MEMORANDUM     To: Senate Minority Leader     From: Christopher M. Davis, Analyst on Congress and the          Legislative Process, 7-0656     Subject: Certain Questions Related to Pro Forma Sessions of          the Senate       This memorandum responds to your request for information      about certain pro forma sessions of the Senate. Specifically,      you asked CRS to identify instances in which a pro forma      session of the Senate might be interpreted as accomplishing      some further end in addition to meeting the constitutional      requirement that neither chamber recess or adjourn for      extended periods without the permission of the other.                Pro Forma Sessions of Congress Generally       Under Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of the Constitution,      neither chamber of Congress may adjourn or recess for more      than three days without the consent of the other. In      calculating such a three day period, either the day of      adjourning or the day of convening must be included. Sundays      are excluded from the calculation, being considered a dies      non under longstanding parliamentary law.       A chamber can adjourn within the three day limit, for      example, from Thursday to Monday, or from Friday to Tuesday,      by simply adopting a motion. Should a chamber wish to leave      for a longer period, however, the other chamber must consent      to the absence. Historically, for such purposes, the two      houses have most often adopted a concurrent resolution      through which each consents to the absence of the other for a      specified period.       In the normal course of business, party leaders in one or      both chambers may wish to schedule periods of absence that      exceed the three day constitutional limit by only a short      period, perhaps by as little as one day. It is not uncommon,      for example, for the House or Senate to adjourn from Thursday      to Tuesday, or from Friday to Wednesday. In instances of this      type, the chambers have evolved a practice of holding a short      session sometime during the absence to comply with the      constitutional limit described above. Such ``pro forma''      sessions, or sessions held for the sake of formality, allow a      chamber to comply with the Constitution but not expend the      time or trouble of acting on an adjournment resolution. In      most cases, little or no business is conducted during such      sessions because it is generally understood that few Members      are present, and that the primary purpose of the meeting      is to obviate the need to agree to an adjournment      resolution. The Senate often adopts an order by unanimous      consent which specifies that such a meeting or series of      meetings is to be pro forma and that no legislative      business is to be conducted on such days.       It is important to note that the term pro forma describes      the reason for holding the session, it does not distinguish      the nature of the session itself. In common congressional      usage, Members and staff often use the term pro forma as      being synonymous with a session at which no business will be      conducted. While the primary purpose of a pro forma session      of the Senate may be to comply with the constitutional      strictures on adjournment, a pro forma session is not      materially different from other Senate sessions. While, as      noted above, the Senate has customarily agreed not to conduct      business during pro forma sessions, no rule or constitutional      provision imposes this restriction. Should the Senate choose      to conduct legislative or executive business at a pro forma      session, it could, providing it could assemble the necessary      quorum or gain the consent of all Senators to act. The House      of Representatives, which is bound by the same constitutional      requirements as the Senate, regularly permits business on pro      forma days, including the introduction and referral of      legislation, the filing of committee reports and      cosponsorship forms, and the receipt and referral of      executive communications and Presidential messages. Even in      cases in which the Senate has agreed not to conduct business      at a pro forma session, it could subsequently adopt a second      consent agreement which would permit them do so.   Other Motivations or Purposes for Pro Forma Sessions of the Senate       While the primary purpose of a pro forma session of the      Senate has been to comply with the constitutional limits on      adjournments and recesses, it is possible that such meetings,      being sessions of the Senate, may have additional purposes as      well. At your request, CRS examined pro forma sessions of the      Senate which occurred between the 109th Congress (2005-2006)      and the present as well as the opening day of each Senate      session between 1934 and the present, in order to identify      sessions which may have satisfied some other purpose in      addition to compliance with Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of      the Constitution. On the basis of these data, CRS identified      two pro forma sessions at which legislative business was      conducted, three periods of pro forma sessions that allowed      the Senate to avoid returning nominations to the President,      and six pro forma days that satisfied the constitutional or      statutory requirement that the Senate convene a new session.      In addition, both the Senate and the Executive Branch take      pro forma sessions into account in calculating various      required time periods pursuant to expedited procedure      statutes. The following sections discuss each of these      categories in turn.       The instances cited in this memorandum cannot be said to be      exhaustive, but are intended to underscore the idea that pro      forma Senate sessions may be motivated by factors other than      complying with the constitutional limit on adjournments, and      may satisfy the requirements of other procedural authorities,      including other provisions of the Constitution, Senate rules,      and statutes.     Pro Forma Sessions At Which Legislative Business Was Conducted       Using information from the Legislative Information System      of the U.S. Congress (LIS) and relevant issues of the daily      Congressional Record and Senate Calendar of Business, CRS      identified 114 pro forma sessions of the Senate which      occurred between January 4, 2005 and March 8, 2012. These pro      forma sessions are identified in Table 1.       Of these 114 pro forma meetings of the Senate, CRS      identified two at which legislative business appears to have      been conducted. On both of these occasions, the two houses      had agreed to no adjournment resolution, so that the Senate      was required to meet in order to avoid violating the      constitutional prohibition on absences of more than three      days length. The days in question are:       December 23, 2011: On this day, the Senate adopted an order      by unanimous consent which provided for Senate passage of a      H.R. 3765, a House measure extending the, ``payroll tax,      unemployment insurance, TANF, and the Medicare payment fix.''      The consent order further provided that upon receiving a      message from the House of Representatives requesting a      conference with the Senate on H.R. 3630, the Middle Class Tax      Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, the Senate agree to the      request, and the Senate presiding officer be authorized to      appoint Senate conferees with a party ratio of 4-3. An      enrolled measure was also signed on this day by Sen. Reid,      serving as Acting President Pro Tempore.       August 5, 2011: On this day, the Senate, by unanimous      consent, passed H.R. 2553, a measure to amend the Internal      Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure      authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and to amend      title 49, United States Code, to extend the airport      improvement program.       In the first instance cited above, the previous meeting of      the Senate had occurred on Tuesday, December 20, 2011. In the      second instance, the Senate had most recently met on Tuesday,      August 2, 2011. At both of these pro forma sessions, pursuant      to unanimous consent orders adopted by the Senate, no      legislative or executive business was to be conducted. The      Senate subsequently, however,     decided to conduct business during the session.Pro Forma Sessions Which Satisfied Senate Rules Governing the Return of                         Presidential Nominations       CRS also identified three distinct periods of recent pro      forma Senate session which, in addition to satisfying the      constitutional limits on recesses and adjournments discussed      above, also seemed to satisfy provisions of the Senate's      standing rules related to the consideration of presidential      nominations. Paragraph 6 of Senate Rule XXXI, states in part:       . . . if the Senate shall adjourn or take a recess for more      than thirty days, all nominations pending and not finally      acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or recess      shall be returned by the Secretary to the President, and      shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made      to the Senate by the President.       In short, unless the Senate takes action (such as adopting      a unanimous consent request) to override the provisions of      Rule XXXI, the Senate Executive Clerk is supposed to return      all nominations to the President at the outset of any period      in which the Senate is to be absent for more than thirty      calendar days.       In the three instances identified, the Senate held only pro      forma meetings during periods in excess of thirty days. In      each period, however, nominations were not returned to the      President pursuant to Rule XXXI. It seems apparent that the      Senate viewed its occasional pro forma meetings as a means of      preventing a recess of more than thirty days for purposes of      these requirements of it rules. Arguably, the Executive      Branch, not having had its nominations returned to it as      would be the well-established practice, was also at least      aware of the Senate's understanding in this regard. The three      periods in question identified are:       August 2--September 6, 2011: The Senate held pro forma      sessions during this 34-day period of recess. No unanimous      consent agreement was identified to hold pending nominations      in status quo and they were not returned to the President.       September 29--November 15, 2010: The Senate held pro forma      sessions during this 47-day period of recess. No unanimous      consent agreement was identified as being adopted prior to      the recess to hold pending nominations in status quo and they      were not returned to the President.       2008-2009: The Senate held pro forma sessions during three      relevant periods of recess in 2008-2009: August 1-September      8, 2008 (31 days); October 2-November 17, 2008 (46 days); and      November 20, 2008-January 3, 2009, the balance of the 110th      Congress (43 days). Consequently, although no unanimous      agreement was identified as having been adopted in 2008 to      hold pending nominations in status quo, they were not      returned to the President until the sine die adjournment of      the Congress.  Pro Forma Sessions of the Senate Which Satisfied the 20th Amendment       CRS also identified six pro forma meetings of the Senate      which satisfied the provisions of Clause 2 of the 20th      Amendment to the Constitution.       Clause two of the 20th amendment to the Constitution      states:       The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year,      and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of      January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.       At your request, CRS examined the opening day session of      each regular and special session of the Senate held between      1934 and the present, the period coinciding with the period      that paragraph 2 of the 20th Amendment has been in force. CRS      identified six Senate pro forma opening day sessions which      satisfied the constitutional requirements for convening its      session on the prescribed date. These opening day pro forma      sessions were:       January 3, 1980       January 3, 1992       January 3, 2006       January 3, 2008       January 5, 2010       January 3, 2012       With one exception, the January 3, 1980 session, each of      these meetings was pro forma in nature, with no legislative      or organizational business conducted. In the case of the      January 3, 1980 session, the Senate referred a previously-     received message from President Jimmy Carter transmitting his      veto of S. 2096, a bill to provide for a study by the      Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare of the long-term      health effects in humans of exposure to dioxins. In addition,      five Senators inserted undelivered remarks in the      Congressional Record on this day. The approximate duration of      the January 3, 1980 session of the Senate was two minutes. Pro Forma Sessions Count for Purposes of Computing Certain Statutory                               Time Periods       Finally, CRS has identified several rules enacted in      statute under which pro forma sessions are treated as      sessions of the Senate like any other for purposes of      computing certain time periods related to actions taken by      Congress and the President. Pro forma Senate sessions satisfy      not only the limits on recesses and adjournments contained in      Article I, Section 5, Clause 4, but also the provisions of      each of these statutory rules in the eyes of both the      Executive and Legislative Branches.       Congress sometimes chooses to include in law provisions      which delegate to the President or another Executive Branch      official the authority to issue a regulation or take some      other specified action. As part of this delegation of      authority, Congress often reserves the right in the law to      pass its own judgment on the proposed regulation or action,      typically by passing a joint resolution to approve or      disapprove it before it takes effect. To facilitate action on      such a joint resolution, Congress often writes into law      special parliamentary procedures for considering the measure,      including strict time periods for the introduction, committee      action, and floor consideration of such a joint resolution.      Such statutory procedures are often colloquially referred to      as ``fast track'' procedures because they expedite the      consideration of specified legislation in one or both      chambers.       Time periods under such statutory rules are usually      calculated in one of two ways. The first way marks time by      counting days of ``House/Senate session.'' Under such a      mechanism, any day which the House or Senate meets counts      toward the deadline established by the law. Under the terms      of the Congressional Review Act, for example, the Senate has      60 days of ``Senate session'' to act under fast track      procedures on a joint resolution which would disapprove a      proposed rule promulgated by the Executive Branch. Both      branches understand and have agreed to this time period for      expedited action before a proposed agency rule can enter into      force. When calculating time periods under statutory rules of      this type, pro forma sessions of the Senate count as days of      Senate session; that is, they are viewed as a session of the      Senate like any other.       The second way of counting time which is common in such      statutory rules is known as counting ``days of continuous      session.'' This way of calculating time periods takes into      account the differing schedules of the House and Senate. When      counting days of continuous session, every calendar day is      counted, including Sundays and holidays, and the count pauses      only when either the House or Senate (or both) have adjourned      for more than three days pursuant to an adjournment      resolution. For example, under the terms of the Defense Base      Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, the Secretary of Defense      may not close or realign any of the specified military      installations until 45 ``days of continuous session'' have      elapsed after a base closure plan is submitted to the House      and Senate. As with the Congressional Review Act described      above, both the Legislative and Executive Branch understand      and have agreed to be bound by this manner of counting.       As with days of Senate session, pro forma meetings of the      Senate are also taken into account by both branches when      calculating ``days of continuous session'' for purposes of      such statutory rules. Should the Senate meet in a series of      pro forma sessions, a statutory ``days of continuous      session'' clock would continue to run not only on the days of      the pro forma sessions themselves, but also during the      intervals of three or fewer days between the pro forma      sessions, when the Senate was absent but formally in recess.       CRS has identified 22 statutory legislative procedures now      in law which calculate time periods in either or both of the      ways discussed above and which take pro forma days of Senate      session into account in conducting a specific calculation.
