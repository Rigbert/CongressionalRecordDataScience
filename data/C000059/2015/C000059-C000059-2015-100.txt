Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  It is my understanding that the proposed rule is supported broadly by many in the trucking manufacturing industry, so for that reason, I support her amendment.  However, as with any rule, there are some specifics that we need to iron out. I would like to work with my colleague and with EPA to see if we can't resolve those specifics between now and the final rule.  In the meantime, I support including language in the Interior bill, and I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
