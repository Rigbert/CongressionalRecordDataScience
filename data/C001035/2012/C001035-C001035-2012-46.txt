President, today I wish to congratulate the men andwomen of L.L.Bean as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. This legendary Maine company is one of America's most inspiring family business success stories and one of my State's most cherished institutions.  Many L.L.Bean customers know the story of the company's origin. Leon Leonwood Bean was an avid Maine outdoorsman who was tired of cold, wet feet while hunting or fishing. In 1912, he invented the Maine Hunting Shoe, a boot with leather uppers and a thick rubber sole. His fellow outdoorsmen liked the boot and a business was born.  The second, less-known part of the story really tells the tale. The rubber bottoms of those shoes separated from the leather tops and 90 of the first 100 pairs were returned. Although it nearly put him out of business, L.L. kept his word and refunded the purchase price. He borrowed more money, corrected the problem and, with undiminished confidence, mailed more brochures. L.L. had learned the value of personally testing his products, of honest advertising based on firm convictions and of keeping the customer satisfied at any cost.  Leon Leonwood Bean founded his business on his personal guarantee of ``100 percent satisfaction in every way.'' In all the years since, that promise has been kept. Whether seeking expert advice, making a purchase, or exchanging or returning a product, generations of customers have found L.L.Bean to be a place where that first commitment to customer satisfaction still resonates.  Today, L.L.Bean is one of the world's most respected retailers, with sales exceeding $1.5 billion. From the flagship store in Freeport, ME, to dozens of stores and outlets throughout the United States, more than 11 million people visit L.L.Bean stores each year. The company's famous catalogues are sent to 160 countries, and its Internet presence leads the industry. In its first century, the company has grown from a one-room operation selling a single product to a global enterprise providing some 4,900 year-round jobs, and that figure typically doubles during peak holiday season.  In addition to its remarkable retail success, L.L.Bean remains true to its origins as a manufacturer. In Brunswick and Lewiston, ME, more than 435 skilled workers craft such iconic products as the Maine Hunting Shoe, the L.L.Bean Boot and the Boat and Tote Bag. Leon Leonwood Bean made 100 pairs of boots in his first production run in 1912. Last year, Maine workers produced more than 400,000 pairs.  When the man TIME magazine called ``The Merchant of the Maine Woods'' passed away in 1967, leadership of the company was passed on to his grandson, Leon Gorman.  Soon after becoming president, Leon introduced the stakeholder concept, which clearly linked L.L.Bean's success as a business to key stakeholders--customers, employees, shareholders, vendors, communities and the natural environment. In his 30 years as president, Leon Gorman led L.L.Bean from a $4.75 million catalog company to an over-one-billion-dollar multichannel enterprise. Leon firmly established L.L.Bean as a leader in the outdoors industry, offering high-quality equipment and apparel, backed by world-class service and products guaranteed to last.  It is fitting that L.L.Bean is celebrating its centennial with special projects that advance the company's guiding principles. These include the Million Moment Mission, in which L.L.Bean will contribute $1 to the National Park Foundation for every outdoor moment shared by customers up to a total of $1 million, and a commitment of an additional $1.5 million at the local and State levels to encourage our young people to discover the outdoors.  I am often asked what L.L.Bean means to our State. As one of Maine's largest employers, the company certainly means a great deal to the thousands who work there. L.L.Bean offers careers with opportunities for advancement in a respectful, positive environment. The spin-off benefits to other Maine industries, including product vendors and business suppliers, are enormous. The continued commitment to Maine-made products--wreaths, maple syrup, mustard, furniture, running shoes, slippers, in addition to the company's famous tote bags and boots--sustains a great many businesses and households throughout our State.  Certainly, the sales, revenue, and growth numbers are impressive. Even more impressive is the fact that this family company succeeds in a modern, global economy with the timeless values that foster dedicated employees and loyal customers. It is a pleasure to congratulate the people of L.L.Bean on this centennial and to thank them for their contributions to our Nation and to the great State of Maine.                          ____________________
