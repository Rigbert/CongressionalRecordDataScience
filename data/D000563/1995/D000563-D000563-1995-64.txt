Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen], in saying at the outset that this subcommittee, despite the tremendous challenges which we have had to provide funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other important agencies, despite these challenges and despite the fact that the resources available are so limited, it has been a genuine pleasure to work on this subcommittee.  We have our differences, we have our battles, but I think that the people of this country would be proud of the way that they are handled. Virtually every issue is handled on a bipartisan basis. We strive to find a commonsense solution. Quite honestly, I think that is what people expect of Congress and expect of their elected representatives in both the House and the Senate. It is one of the reasons why I have enjoyed this subcommittee so much over the years, both as chairman and as the ranking minority member.  I want to salute the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] for his leadership. It has been a tough, tough year. Not only did you have budgetary restraints, the new mantle of leadership puts you in a tougher position than you have seen in the past, and you have handled it so well. It is a great source of satisfaction to you, I am sure, and to all of us to have been part of this process.  I want to salute my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues who have played such an important role on our side of the aisle: the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. Thornton], the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey], the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], and, of course, sitting right next to me during the course of the deliberations, the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur]. All of them made a significant contribution.  Let me tell you about the pluses and minuses, and I think the chairman has pointed to them.  I am very happy to report that the level of funding for the women, Infants and Children supplemental feeding program has been maintained at what I consider a very responsible level at a very tough time. The gentleman from New Mexico and all Members know of my commitment to this program. I honestly believe that if we do not invest our dollars in the women of America who are in fact lower income and disadvantaged and pregnant, that we will pay a very dear price.  We have to make certain that these women are given the very best in medical care and in nutritional care, as well, so that they have a good pregnancy and give birth to a healthy baby. That is the best investment in the future of this country we can make.  This committee is the ag subcommittee but it is also by and large a nutrition subcommittee. When we assign priorities to nutrition in America, there is no higher priority than pregnant women and their small children. The WIC Program takes care of them.  I thank the chairman for taking care of them this year. He has maintained a commitment which we all have the highest respect for in the future of this program. We cannot let up in the future years. We have got to keep this commitment very much alive.  I am concerned that even though we have improved some figures on rural development, we still are far short of what we need. The chairman lives in small town America, as do I, he in the southwestern part of the United States, myself in the Midwest. Small towns in this country are really facing great pressures, economic pressures. They need to make sure that resources are available to modernize their infrastructure and to provide for housing. We help them. Unfortunately, we are not going to help them enough.  I hope we can find creative ways, perhaps with less Government money but with better results in the future, and that is what we are striving to do. I am glad that we were able to restore some of the money for research in this bill, because ag research is so critically important. When you consider that some 17 percent of our gross domestic product comes from the production and sale of food and fiber in America, it is a major industry in the economic fabric of our country. Yet when you look at the research dollars from the Federal level that are dedicated to this industry, they are very small, $1.1 billion roughly given by this Government out of a $1.5 trillion budget for research purposes. Quite honestly, when you look at money invested in the Pentagon or other areas of research, the amount given here is minuscule. What we ask of the people involved in research here is substantial, to come up with new ways to grow crops, to do it in a safe way.  One of the issues that we got involved in in this committee, a debate which was resolved on the floor of the House, was over the new standards for meat and poultry inspection in America. It has been my experience to meet one woman in Chicago who lost her 6-year-old son to contaminated meat. E. coli bacteria, literally in the course of 4 or 5 days, took the life of her son. It is still devastating, this long afterwards, for her to speak of it. But she understands, as all of us must, that modernizing meat and poultry inspection is in the best interests of America.  We have got to get beyond the old days, the 1908 days of Upton Sinclair's jungle where the Federal inspectors stood by and if they did not smell something funny or it did not look odd, they approved the meat. We are in a new era and our meat and poultry inspection has to come of age with it. I am glad we are dedicated to that happening.  Also the market promotion program, that was a big hassle and one that went late into the night. We finally, I think, came to a good conclusion. This is a good program. We are going to dedicate resources where they are needed the most. We have to maintain our competitive edge around the world.                              {time}  1100  Now there is one provision in the bill which I disagree with, and it relates to chickens, and I do not know if we will get into this debate today over frozen and fresh chickens. If we do, I will have my opportunity to speak to it, but I think quite honestly that we have taken the wrong course when it comes to this important issue.  When a consumer goes in a store in America and sees a chicken labeled as fresh, that consumer should, of course, be confident that they are buying a fresh chicken, but unfortunately the poultry industry has decided that they can freeze a chicken down to zero degrees and still call it fresh.  My colleagues, all of us know by common sense that is not the case. A fresh chicken tastes differently than one that has been frozen, and a fresh chicken may cost a little more than one that has been frozen, but the poultry industry, in order to protect their profit margins, want to continue to basically hoodwink consumers in this country and not tell them the true story about whether or not that poultry product has ever been frozen. Most people, men and women, who work in the kitchen at home know that once a chicken is frozen it is not desirable to refreeze it, it is not a good idea, and yet consumers may not know any better based on how it is labeled.  So, the administration tried to move to a new category, one that I think is fairly bizarre, called hard-chilled, whatever the heck that means, hard enough to be a bowling ball, but they called it hard-chilled. I think it is frozen, and I think we ought to just level with consumers.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, in this bill we basically say we are not going to, we are going to continue to play the game. The poultry people are going to put the label ``fresh'' on something that has been frozen as hard as a bowling ball, and the consumers will not know any better, and, quite honestly, I think that is a mistake, and I voted against it in committee.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if that issue will come up today in deliberation, but, if it does, I hope that we have a chance to rectify that.  But, having said that, I will not make of that wart the whole face. I will say that in fact this is a great bill. It is one that was worked on long and hard by staff and Members, and I congratulate my chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
