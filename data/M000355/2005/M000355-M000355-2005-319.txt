 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the voice of Kentucky agriculture, Mr. Sam Moore. Mr. Moore is retiring as president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau after 7 successful years and will be forever remembered as the Kentucky farmer's greatest advocate.  Mr. Moore, a native of Butler County, first became involved with the Kentucky Farm Bureau in the late 1960s when he joined the Bureau's Young Farmer Program. By 1973 he was selected as Outstanding Young Farmer by the Kentucky Jaycees, and he knew he had found his calling in working with and for his fellow Kentucky farmers.  Mr. Moore has served on the Kentucky Farm Bureau's board of directors since 1975, and will continue to serve in an at-large capacity after his term as president ends. He is also a member of the American Farm Bureau's board of directors, and holds positions on the boards of the Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company and Farm Bureau BanCorp. He has also served as president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company.  Mr. Moore has been a leader of the Butler County Farm Bureau and is a member of the American Soybean Association, the Kentucky Beef Cattle Association, and the Kentucky Corn Growers Association. He also serves on the boards of the Kentucky Grain Insurance Fund and the Kentucky Council on Agriculture.  Mr. Moore was elected as the bureau's president in December 1998 after 7 years of service as its first vice president. Immediately upon assuming office, he was faced with a major change in the tobacco farming industry: the leading tobacco companies and the State governments had reached an agreement called the Master Settlement Agreement, which would place significant funds into the various States' treasuries.  Mr. Moore was the driving force behind a bill in Kentucky to allocate half of Kentucky's proceeds from the Master Settlement Agreement--$3.6 billion over 25 years--into a new State fund that would dedicate the money to projects that develop the State's agriculture market, encourage environmental stewardship, support family farms, and fund agricultural research and development.  The whole process is overseen by the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board, which Mr. Moore has served on since its inception. Thanks to Mr. Moore and the board's efforts, Kentucky's agriculture industry is transforming to meet the needs of more Kentuckians.  But perhaps Mr. Moore's crowning achievement is his pivotal role in engineering the tobacco buyout of 2004. I worked side by side with Mr. Moore in that effort, and can testify that his hard work and dedication to moving that project through was critical to our success.  Thanks to Mr. Moore's efforts, Congress passed and the President signed a tobacco buyout bill that will guarantee $2.5 billion to Kentucky farmers and their families over the next 10 years. Farmers now have the opportunity to explore other areas of agriculture, free from the restraints the government placed on tobacco farming for so long. Nothing was more important to Sam's Kentucky Farm Bureau members--and so Sam worked long and hard, until he delivered.  Sam is the co-owner of the Green River Feed Mill and also serves as a director of Morgantown Bank & Trust. He farms over 4,300 acres, producing corn, soybeans, wheat, and cattle. He and his gracious wife Helen have six wonderful children.  Sam has dedicated decades of his life to farming and his fellow farmers because he loves farming so much. He has made a lot of friends across the State over the years, and I am proud to be one of them. Any friend of Sam Moore will tell you he spent his entire career with the Kentucky Farm Bureau thinking only of what was best for his members.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Mr. Sam Moore for his years of service to Kentucky.                          ____________________[Page S12123]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          TRIBUTE TO SAM MOORE  Mr. McCONNELL.
