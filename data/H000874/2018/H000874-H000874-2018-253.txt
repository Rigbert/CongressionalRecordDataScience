Speaker, on Friday I attended the funeral of a hero. Prince George's County lost a dedicated Corporal last Wednesday, who was shot and killed while off duty but still doing his duty. Corporal Mujahid Ramzziddin, a fourteen-year veteran of the force, stepped in to protect a neighbor from an abusive spouse. As Chief Hank Stawinski said: `He saved her life by giving his own.' He is the thirtieth Prince George's County police officer to die in the line of duty. Corporal Ramzziddin's courage is an example of the kind of devotion to duty that our law enforcement officers in Prince George's County and across Maryland and the United States demonstrate each day they serve.  At the funeral in Lanham, I joined state and county officials in comforting Corporal Ramzziddin's wife Tammi and his four children as they paid their final tributes to him and laid him to rest according to traditional Muslim rites. I was honored to present Tammi with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in memory of her husband, and I was deeply moved by the outpouring of support and love from the community to the Ramzziddin family. They are in my thoughts at this difficult time, as is Corporal Ramzziddin' s heroic example.  Corporal Ramzziddin was not only a dedicated law enforcement officer; he was also a volunteer in the community. He served in several ways with the Nation's Mosque, including as a leader for its Boy Scout Troop 1517, on its safety and security committee, and with the men's group that engaged in neighborhood litter removal projects. Corporal Ramzziddin was a man of faith and service, a patriot and a hero to his community. It surprised no one who knew him that he gave his life while trying to protect someone else.  I hope all of my colleagues in this House will join me in paying tribute to Corporal Mujahid Ramzziddin for his life of service and his ultimate sacrifice protecting the people of Prince George's County, Maryland.                          ____________________
