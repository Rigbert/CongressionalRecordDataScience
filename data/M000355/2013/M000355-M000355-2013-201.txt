 President, I rise today to congratulate the Whayne Supply Company, a leader in Kentucky businesses and one of the Nation's oldest and largest Caterpillar dealerships, for reaching the milestone of 100 years in operation. That is a full century of serving the needs of Kentucky's construction, mining, agriculture, and industrial markets; a full century of employing Kentuckians; and a full century of expanding opportunity across the Commonwealth.  Whayne Supply Company was founded in 1913 by Mr. Roy C. Whayne, Sr. At the time of the firm's founding, he was its sole employee, and the business consisted of selling light engines, pumps, wheelbarrows, and bicycles. In 1925, the company began its long and continued association with Caterpillar, one of the world's largest manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. Today Whayne is also the dealer for Thomas Built Buses, Challenger, Lexion, Trail King, Mirenco, Sullair, Allmand, and other lines of construction, industrial, mining, paving, and agricultural equipment.  Today Whayne is consistently ranked as one of the country's top Caterpillar dealerships. It also provides customers with an extensive parts inventory and broad service capabilities. Whayne Supply Company is currently owned by Monty Boyd, who became president of Whayne Supply in 2005 after working for the company in various roles for 25 years. Under Mr. Boyd's leadership, Whayne has grown to employ over 1,300 people and operate 15 facilities across Kentucky and southern Indiana.  Whayne's home office is in Louisville, and it operates other branches in Ashland, Bowling Green, Corbin, Dry Ridge, Elizabethtown, Hazard, Hopkinsville, Lexington, Owensboro, Paducah, Pikeville, and Somerset, as well as in Evansville, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, IN.  The Whayne Supply Company intends to mark its 100th anniversary throughout 2013 by recognizing its employees and customers and holding a series of community service projects. With the company's ties to all regions of the State, I am sure many Kentuckians will have occasion to note this anniversary and reflect on Whayne Supply's century of service.  Mr. President, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in commending the Whayne Supply Company for 100 years of operations and saluting them for their commitment to the people of Kentucky.                          ____________________
