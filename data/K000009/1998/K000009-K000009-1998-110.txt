Speaker, I rise today to give special recognition to the Third Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio. Beginning November 11, 1998 and concluding November 15, 1998, the church will celebrate its 130th anniversary with a host of celebration activities.  I am pleased to commemorate this anniversary. This milestone is a testament to faith, to the strength of community, and to the values of family and tradition. The 130 year long journey of Third Baptist Church has only come about through the faith and perseverance of its congregants. As their lives have been made richer by their faith, so, too, has our community been made richer by the church's presence. This church in the heart of one of Toledo's oldest neighborhoods has housed generations of souls uplifted by the strength of prayer and each other as God's Word was celebrated each Sunday for 130 years.  Third Baptist Church has been a cornerstone of the community, and is strongly supported by its members. Generations worship together, in the truest sense of church and community. Third Baptist's motto is ``Celebrating Our Goodly Heritage Through Worship and Praise.'' Its members live this testament, coming together to offer joyful songs, inspirational prayers, and deep, personal worship.  As 130 years are celebrated through several days, I know that the spirit of the church's ancestors will be felt, and they will join today's membership in the commemoration. As we look back on the past, may we also direct our vision toward the future.                          ____________________
