President, if you are one of the millions of rural school children who ride buses 2.9 billion miles every year, if you attend school in one of the thousands of rural schools that have no school library or no classroom computers, if one of the buildings at your school is in serious disrepair, or if you are sharing a few 30 year-old textbooks with the other students in your class, then you probably feel like you are going to school in an education sacrifice zone.  Our country spends less than a quarter of our Nation's education dollars to educate approximately half of our nation's students. You don't have to be a math whiz to know that the numbers just don't add up. The students who are short-changed often live in rural areas.  Thousands of rural and small schools across our nation face the daunting mission of educating almost half of America's children. Increasingly, these schools are underfunded, overwhelmed, and overlooked. While half of the nation's students are educated in rural and small public schools, they only receive 23 percent of Federal education dollars; 25 percent of State education dollars; and 19 percent of local education dollars.  We all grew up thinking that the ``three R's'' were Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. Unfortunately for our rural school children, the ``three R's'' are too often run-down classrooms, insufficient resources, and really over-worked teachers.  The bill I am introducing with Senators Frist and Sessions, the Rural Education Development Initiative, REDI, would provide funding to 5,400 rural school districts that serve 6.5 million students--a short-term infusion of funds that will allow rural schools and their students to make substantial strides forward.  Local education agencies would be eligible for REDI funding if they are either ``rural'', school locale code of 6, 7, or 8, and have a school-age population, ages 5-17, with 15 percent or more of the kids are from families with incomes below the poverty line; or ``small''--student population of 800 or less and a student population, ages 5-17, with 15 percent or more of the kids are from families with incomes below the poverty line. In Oregon, among the schools eligible for REDI funding would be Jewell High School in Seaside, Burnt River Elementary in Unity, Gaston High School in Gaston, and Mari-Lynn Elementary School in Lyons, Oregon.  Like the Education Flexibility Act of 1999, Ed-Flex, I authored with Senator Frist last Congress, REDI is voluntary--states and school districts could choose to participate in the program. Both Ed-Flex and REDI are designed to provide states and districts with flexibility they need so they can target their local priorities.  Rural school districts and schools also find it more difficult to attract and retain qualified teachers, especially in Special Education, Math, and Science. Consequently, teachers in rural schools are almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more subjects than their urban counterparts. The History teacher may be teaching Math and Science without any formal training or experience. Rural teachers also tend to be younger, less experienced, and receive less pay than their urban and suburban counterparts. Worse yet, rural school teachers are less likely to have the high quality professional development opportunities that current research strongly suggests all teachers desperately need.  Limited resources also mean fewer course offerings for students in rural and small schools. Consequently, courses are designed for the kids in the middle. So, students at either end of the academic spectrum miss out. Additionally, fewer rural students who dropout ever return to complete high school, and fewer rural higher school graduates go on to college.  On another note, recent research on brain development clearly shows the critical nature of early childhood education, yet rural schools are less likely to offer even kindergarten classes, let alone earlier educational opportunities.  To make matters worse, many of our rural areas are also plagued by persistent poverty, and, as we know, high-poverty schools have a much tougher time preparing their students to reach high standards of performance on state and national assessments. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress consistently show large gaps between the achievement of students in high-poverty schools and students in low-poverty schools.  Our legislation will provide rural students with greater learning opportunities by putting more computers in classrooms, expanding distance learning opportunities, providing academic help to students who have fallen behind, and making sure that every class is taught by a highly qualified teacher. I've heard it said that this will be the Education Congress, but we have much to do before we earn that title. It's time to show that we when it comes to education, we won't leave anyone behind, and REDI will give children from rural and small communities more of the educational opportunities they deserve.  I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 339       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Education Development      Initiative for the 21st Century Act.''     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school students      in the United States with increased learning opportunities.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) While there are rural education initiatives identified      at the State and local level, no Federal education policy      focuses on the specific needs of rural school districts and      schools, especially those that serve poor students.       (2) The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES)      reports that while 46 percent of our Nation's public schools      serve rural areas, they only receive 22 percent of the      nation's education funds annually.       (3) A critical problem for rural school districts involves      the hiring and retention of qualified administrators and      certified teachers (especially in Special Education, Science,      and Mathematics). Consequently, teachers in rural schools are      almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more      subjects than teachers in urban schools. Rural schools also      face other tough challenges, such as shrinking local tax      bases, high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited      course offerings, and limited resources.       (4) Data from the National Assessment of Educational      Progress (NAEP) consistently shows large gaps between the      achievement of students in high-poverty schools and those in      other schools. High-poverty schools will face special      challenges in preparing their students to reach high      standards of performance on State and national assessments.     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
