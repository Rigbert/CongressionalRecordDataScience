 President, I rise today to express my deep condolences to the family and friends of the 15 men who were aboard the Arctic Rose, which was lost at sea on April 2, 2001. On March 31, 2001, the trawl vessel left St. Paul Island, AK to fish for flathead sole in the Bering Sea. The boat was supposed to be at sea for about two weeks.  Sometime during the early morning of April 2, however, something happened that caused the Arctic Rose to go down. We still don't know why the fishing vessel sank, but we know that 15 men lost their lives in pursuit of their livelihoods. Nine of these men were from Washington state, and all of them leave behind families, friends and coworkers. My thoughts are with the crewmen's loved ones, who are only beginning to cope with this tragedy. I also extend my condolences to the owner of the vessel, Mr. David Olney, to the employees of Arctic Sole Seafood, Inc., and to everyone who is part of this important industry.  Most people are aware that fishing in the seas off Alaska is a dangerous occupation, but it still is a major shock when lives are lost at sea. We must continue our efforts to improve the safety of crews fishing in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. One of the ways to improve safety is to allow the creation of individual fishing quotas, which guarantee catch to fishermen. This allows fishermen to wait for better weather before going out to sea. I have consistently supported using quotas as one tool to manage fisheries.  Many of the Alaskan fishing seasons take place during the fall, winter and spring, when the weather is often severe. This business is inherently dangerous. The Arctic Rose had survival suits on board, but it seems the ship went down too quickly for most crewmen to even put them on. Nor were they able to get to the life raft. We should continue our efforts to improve the safety of commercial fishing in Alaska, and throughout the country, but I doubt we will ever be able to completely eliminate the hazards.  The loss of the Arctic Rose reminds us of the risks commercial fishermen take every day to provide seafood enjoyed by so many people throughout the Northwest and world. Let's not take their work for granted. While we mourn the loss of the Arctic Rose, we should also thank the men and women who face these dangers every day to bring food to families across our country.                          ____________________
