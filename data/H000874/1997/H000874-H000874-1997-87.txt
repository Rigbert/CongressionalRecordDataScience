Speaker, obviously salaries and expenses for Federal employees are in every bill that deals with every agency, as the gentleman knows.  The gentleman is correct that this bill deals with the Office of Personnel Management. He is further correct that from time to time this bill has been used as a vehicle to stop the COLA adjustment. It could be effected in any bill, I tell the gentleman. So the gentleman's comments are as relevant to any bill that we consider as they are to this one.
