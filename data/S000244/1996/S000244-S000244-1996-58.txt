Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to the gentleman from Indiana, the Honorable Andy Jacobs, who has loyally served the residents of Indiana's Tenth District for 30 years as their Representative in the U.S. Congress.  Andy's service to our country began during the Korean war, when he served in the Marine Corps. In 1964, he was elected as a Representative from Indiana, a duty which he has honorably fulfilled for 30 years.  Throughout his service, Andy has been a frugal and prudent guardian of Federal spending. He has supported the balanced budget amendment and the ``A to Z'' spending cuts. Furthermore, he played a key role in converting the Social Security Administration to an independent agency and in limiting employer's need to pay Social Security taxes for part-time domestic workers.  Andy is a straightforward and unassuming leader who continually has demonstrated the ability to vote for what he believes is right. Political winds and pressure have not affected his decisions. Andy's humor in the dining room and other places will be sorely missed. This body will be losing a great Representative and American when Andy leaves here.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth district, I thank the Honorable Andy Jacobs for his outstanding service to the people of the United States.                          ____________________
