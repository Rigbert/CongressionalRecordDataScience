President, I agree with what the Democratic leader said. We have waited far too long.  I would like to give some history. Eleven years ago this week, following the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Senate confirmed John Roberts to the Supreme Court and as Chief Justice. He had his Judiciary Committee hearing in September and was given full and fair consideration by the Senate. He was confirmed about 2 weeks later, September 29. All of us, whether or not we supported John Roberts, felt it was important to get this done so that the Supreme Court was not missing a Justice when it began its term on the first Monday in October, as it always does. The Senate acted responsibly. That was 11 years ago. There was a Republican in the White House. I was one of those who voted for Chief Justice John Roberts. There are others who voted against him, but he was confirmed. That is what we did then with a Republican President but not today. In fact, under Republican leadership, the Senate is deliberately leaving the Supreme Court shorthanded. None of us, whether for or against Justice Roberts, felt we should delay and have the Court come into session with a four-four makeup.  I believe Chief Judge Merrick Garland deserves the same consideration that Chief Justice Roberts received 11 years ago. What is the difference? There was a Republican President then, a Democratic President now. This is playing politics with the U.S. Supreme Court, and it hurts the credibility of our whole Federal court system.  Like Chief Justice Roberts, Chief Judge Garland is eminently qualified. Like Chief Judge Roberts, he hails from the Midwest. He is a D.C. Circuit judge who has earned the respect and admiration of those who work for him. But, unlike Chief Justice Roberts, who was confirmed in about 2 months, Chief Judge Garland has been pending before the Senate for more than 6 months. I mentioned that to my colleagues. I went back and checked the history. No Supreme Court nominee in the history of our country has waited that long. There has been no hearing, no vote, no consideration at all by the Senate because the Senate refuses to do its job--the job we are required to do under the Constitution.  Maybe the Republicans feel this somehow benefits their party. It doesn't. Our independent judicial branch is fundamental to our constitutional system of government. The Senate's duty to consider judicial nominations under the Constitution is not a political game. This Republican obstruction has consequences for all Americans. Because Senate Republicans refuse to do their jobs, the Supreme Court has been repeatedly unable to uphold its essential constitutional role as a final arbiter of the law. The uncertainty in the law has been harmful to businesses, and it has been harmful to law enforcement and to families and children across our country.  I don't know if the American people realize how much this refusal of the Republican leadership to do their jobs has hurt them. This term, the Supreme Court will consider cases that will impact our voting rights--all of us--ourreligious rights, our access to fair housing, even the ATM fees we pay. The Court may also decide to hear important cases on the right of transgender students to be treated equally, environmental protection and climate change, women's reproductive health, and money in politics. The Supreme Court should be at full strength and provide the American people certainty and clarity of our rights under the Constitution.  The same Republicans who expedited consideration of Chief Justice Roberts have since February used the excuse of the election year to justify their unconstitutional, prolonged obstruction. Yet there is no election-year exception in the Constitution for the President's duty to nominate Supreme Court Justices. The Constitution says the President shall nominate. The President did that. It also says that every one of us who held up our hand and took a solemn oath to uphold the Constitution--it says that we shall give advice and consent on these nominations. There is no election-year exception in the Constitution. None of us hold up our hands and say we will uphold the Constitution, so help me God, except in an election year. There is no election-year exception in the Constitution for the Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of the law. Our history proves this case.  There have been more than a dozen vacancies in election years--in fact, most recently, Justice Kennedy. I was here. We had a Democratic-led Senate. It was President Reagan's last year in office. It was a Presidential election year, and it took a Democratic Senate just over 2 months to confirm Justice Kennedy.  President Obama's nominee, Chief Judge Garland, has been pending in the Senate with no action for 195 days; 195 days and we haven't done one solitary thing. When we had a Democratically controlled Congress and a Republican President's last year in office, we confirmed him in 65 days.  The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in the examination of Supreme Court nominees, reviewing the nominee's records and holding public hearings so that the American people can hear from that individual. Ever since the Judiciary Committee started holding public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees more than a century ago, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. The current Republican leadership has broken with this century of practice to make its own shameful history.  Even when a majority of the committee has not supported a Supreme Court nominee, the committee has still sent the nomination to the floor so that all 100 Senators can fulfill their constitutional role of providing advice and consent on Supreme Court nominees. When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001 during the Bush administration, I and Senator Hatch--who was then the ranking member--memorialized in a letter this agreement regarding President Bush's Supreme Court nominees.  This is an important point. Senators are free to make their own decision to vote against a Supreme Court nominee, but that does not justify the complete refusal to provide any process whatsoever. I have heard the other side offer the example of some Republican Senators pledging to vote ``no'' on Justice Fortas's nomination to replace Chief Justice Warren in an election year as justification for their obstruction today. That example does little to prove their point. In 1968, there was no current vacancy on the Court, as Chief Justice Warren's resignation was conditional upon the confirmation of his successor. That meant that there was never any fear that the Supreme Court would be operating at less than full strength. Just as importantly, public hearings went forward and the full Senate was able to consider the nomination. Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader who also served as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee at the time, did not sign on to that pledge and proceeded to work with the chair of the committee to move forward with hearings.  We worked across the aisle to ensure that the Supreme Court would be fully functioning with Chief Justice Roberts' nomination 11 years ago. Thirty years ago, the Senate voted to confirm both Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist. More than a dozen Supreme Court justices have been confirmed in the month of September. That is not surprising given that the Supreme Court begins its terms on the first Monday in October.  By the standards the Democrats gave to Republicans, Chief Judge Garland should have been confirmed by Memorial Day. We have had more than 6 months to examine his record. It is not as though the Senate has been consumed and overworked considering other nominees; the last time we confirmed any judicial nominee was on July 6.  Republicans refuse to allow votes even on uncontroversial district court nominees who have been pending more than a year, even those supported by Republicans in their States, and our independent Federal judiciary is suffering as a result of this unprecedented obstruction, as a result of the Senate not doing its job. It is long time past for the Senate to do its job. We have to treat our coequal branch of government with respect. There is no reason the Senate should not do its job in an election year. There is much work to be done.  Senate Republicans are calling for another very long recess. The resolution introduced today by the senior Senator from Connecticut would keep the Senate here to do its job for Chief Judge Garland's nomination. It should not require a resolution to keep us accountable to the oath we all swore to uphold the Constitution. The Senate majority leader should let us get to work for all American people. We have had more recesses than anytime since I have been here. Why not take a few days and immediately consider Chief Judge Garland for the Supreme Court of the United States? Our highest Court should not be diminished further by Republican obstruction in the Senate. When the Supreme Court comes into session on the first Monday in October, the American people deserve to have nine members on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court deserves to have nine members, and the American people deserve to have us do our job.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to from myself and Senator Hatch be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2001.       Dear Colleague: We are cognizant of the important      constitutional role of the Senate in connection with Supreme      Court nominations. We write as Chairman and Ranking      Republican Member on the Judiciary Committee to inform you      that we are prepared to examine carefully and assess such      presidential nominations.       The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to      report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the      Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true      even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a      majority of the Judiciary Committee.       We both recognize and have every intention of following the      practices and precedents of the Committee and the Senate when      considering Supreme Court nominees.           Sincerely,     Patrick J. Leahy,       Chairman.     Orrin G. Hatch,       Ranking Republican Member.
