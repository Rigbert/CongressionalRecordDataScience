It is instructive that this Hispanic nominee to such a high court is opposed by the Hispanic caucus. They have sat down with Mr. Estrada in private and asked him questions about his views on issues, and they have come out in opposition to his nomination. There are many--myself included, and I have appointed Hispanics to the Federal bench in Chicago--who believe there should be more Hispanic nominees. Under the Clinton administration, quite a few nominees were brought before the committee, and many were approved. That should continue. But doesn't it tell you something that this high level, high profile appointment is opposed by the Hispanic caucus?
