Chairman, I would remind my colleagues that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required that consumers of nuclear-generated electricity pay a fixed fee to the Nuclear Waste Fund for the government to manage for this program. Of the $13 billion that has been committed to the fund since 1983, about $6 or $7 billion in fact has been used for other activities not relating to this one.  In 1982, I worked for President Reagan. I can remember his signing statement in 1982 when Congress passed that bill. Some of us here, not me, but some of the Members here voted for that bill, and President Reagan thought that in a few years this thing would be done. Here it is, 1997, 15 years later, we are debating a bill that, when enacted, still will not see this thing completed for another 10 or 15 years.  We do not need this amendment. The ratepayers are paying already tooth and nail for this program. Not all of the money has been spent for the program as it was originally intended. To lift the cap on this program is not necessary. I would urge my colleagues to vote no.
