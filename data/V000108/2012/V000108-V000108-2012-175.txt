Speaker, it is with immense gratitude and deep sadness that I wish to commend United States Army Sergeant Brian Leonhardt for his bravery and his willingness to fight for his country. Sergeant Leonhardt, a member of the Indiana National Guard assigned to the 713th Engineer Company, 81st Troop Command out of Valparaiso, Indiana, was killed in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan, along with three other members of the Indiana National Guard, when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device on Friday, January 6, 2012. The sacrifice of Sergeant Leonhardt, as well as that of his fellow Guard members, will be forever remembered by those they fought to protect.  Born in Crown Point, Indiana and a resident of Merrillville, Indiana, Brian graduated from Hammond Baptist High School in Hammond, Indiana. Friends and family remember him as an athlete who loved to play basketball and an avid fan of the Miami Heat. A man of faith, Brian attended services at First Baptist Church of Hammond.  After his graduation, Brian joined the Indiana Army National Guard and completed his basic training and advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood, where he was recognized as the honor graduate of his class. One of eight children, it is evident that Brian was raised with a deep sense of patriotism. In fact, three of his brothers are also military veterans. For Sergeant Leonhardt's unwavering love for his country, as well as his extraordinary skill and commitment as a member of the Indiana National Guard, he received numerous military awards and honors.  Sergeant Leonhardt leaves behind a loving family that will forever cherish his memory. He is survived by his devoted wife Dianne, adoring parents Marie and Robert, brothers Charles, Randall, Robert III, Anthony, and Trevor, and sisters Theresa and Jacqueline. He also leaves behind many other friends and family members, as well as a saddened but proud community and a grateful nation. While the loss of Sergeant Leonhardt is a tremendous tragedy, and there is much sadness for a brilliant future cut far too short, the impact he has had on his family, friends, and community will leave a lasting impression.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Sergeant Brian Leonhardt. Sergeant Leonhardt sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his passing serves as an unfortunate, yet all too familiar reminder of the realities of war. Sergeant Leonhardt will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
