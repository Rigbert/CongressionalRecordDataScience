Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to an exceptionally dedicated and benevolent member of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. James L. Danderand, of Dyer, Indiana. After thirty-nine years of continuous service with the institution, Jim retired on March 3, 1998 as Chairman of the Board and President of the Merrillville Branch of Bank One.  Jim graduated from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After graduating, he served his country as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in the United States Army. Beginning his employment with the bank in February of 1959 as a Management Trainee, Jim started his extraordinary rise through his office's employment ranks. Jim was quickly promoted to President on July 18, 1969 and Chairman of the Board on March 14, 1985. Though employed and serving the community through various civic organizations, Jim continued his education through enrollment and completion of American Institute of Banking courses in Chicago, the Harvard Business School's Senior Bank Officers Seminar, Indiana University's Management Course. In addition, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin's Graduate School of Banking.  Jim's remarkable climb up the corporate ladder was accompanied by an ever-increasing group of civic, religious, and philanthropic organizations in which he participated. Jim served in a leadership role as Director of the Lake Area United Way, Director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana, Honorary Director of the American Red Cross, Lake County, Indiana Chapter, Director and Chairman of the Northwest Indiana Forum, Director of the Northwest Indiana Local Initiatives Support Corporation, Director of the Hospice of the Calumet Area, Inc., and Director of the Gary Educational Development Foundation, Inc. He also gave his time to the Lay Advisory Board for Catholic Charities, Diocese of Gary, Indiana University Northwest Chancellor's Associate, Purdue University Calumet Chancellor's Associate, Robert Morris and Associates, and the University Club.  While serving the community has always been an extremely important part of Jim's life, there can be no comparison to the dedication Jim has for his family. Jim and his loving wife, Prudy, have four wonderful, grown children, Lisa, Jeff, Jill, and John. Their seven grandchildren are an eternal source of joy and love for Jim and Prudy. Now that he is retired, Jim plans to visit and spend much of his time with his family. Jim's future plans include extensive traveling with his wife, many rounds of golf, and visiting his children and grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Jim Danderand for his lifetime of service, success, and dedication to Indiana's First Congressional District. Jim serves as an excellentexample of a true American. His unending service to his country, community, and family has rewarded the people of Indiana's First Congressional District with one of the real heroes of our time.                          ____________________
