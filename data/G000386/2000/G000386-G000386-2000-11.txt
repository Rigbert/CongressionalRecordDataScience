 I would like to have permission to interrupt the Senator, and for him not to lose the right to the floor. I would like to say something for 30 seconds on the bill, if I could.  There has been a report since early today about the White House, or personnel at the White House, calling Democrats who have always supported this bill to vote against it. I am not sure I know exactly why the White House is calling and saying that, but I presume it is because they would like to have fewer folks than the two-thirds we had on the cloture to override a veto, if the President would veto this bill. I don't know that the President would veto it. I know there are a lot of people at the White House who would like to have him veto it.  I say to those Democrats who have voted and supported this legislation so much over the last 3 years, particularly on that 83-14 vote by which it passed, I hope they will not respond to that kind of pressure from the White House. I hope they know Chuck Grassley well enough to know that if I had voted for a bill in the Reagan administration or the Bush administration, three or four times, and a President Reagan or his staff, or a President Bush or his staff, called me up and asked me to change my mind just to protect the President, if I would do it--I would not do it. I hope they would not do it.  I return the floor to the Senator from Alabama.
