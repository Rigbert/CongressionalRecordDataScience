 President, I rise today to recognize the service of one of the Senate's most dedicated, loyal and capable employees, James J. Molinari.  Jim has served as my State director for more than a decade, but his public service began many years ago.  In 1967, Jim began his 45-year career in public service when he became a patrol officer with the San Francisco Police Department.  For 27 years he rose through the ranks of the police department, and he did it all. From street patrol to investigations, undercover assignment to a Federal liaison, Jim was given the responsibilities.  From 1977 through 1986, during my tenure as mayor of San Francisco, Jim was a senior staff member in the mayor's office. He was responsible for security for both the mayor and visiting dignitaries, and he served as my advisor on law enforcement matters.  Jim was at my side for many of the most significant moments of my service as mayor.  We hosted two Super Bowl parades in 1982 and 1985, the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and even visits by the Pope and the Queen of England.  I still remember those days, and I am happy that Jim was there to share them with me.  In 1992 he became a captain and commanding officer of the Planning and Research Division.  I have no doubt that Jim would have kept climbing the ladder in the Police Department, but in 1994 I helped convince him that his talents were suitable for a larger stage and that he would make a fine U.S. Marshal.  On February 11, 1994, President Clinton appointed Jim the United States Marshal for the Northern District of California.  Jim served as a Marshal for 7 years, during which time he was responsible for the administration of Federal law enforcement for 15 northern California counties, or about 12 million people.  He oversaw a $35 million budget and had a staff of about 130.  In 2001, Jim decided to focus his experience on counternarcotics and became director of the San Francisco Bay Area High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. As executive director, he oversaw coordination and implementation of the agency's programs and initiatives.  In 2002, I convinced Jim to return to my office as State director.  As State director, Jim advises around 30 employees and oversees operations in my four State offices, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Fresno.  It is an understatement for me to call Jim one of my most trusted public policy and legislative advisors.  I don't know if it's his roots as a police officer or his Italian sensibilities, but Jim is practical, he cuts through the red tape and he calls it how he sees it.  Jim is a real 10.  Mr. President, I ask that you and all of our colleagues join in thanking Jim Molinari for his years of service, not only to the Senate but to the State of California and the Nation.  We wish him a wonderful retirement and want him to know we all appreciate his service and friendship.                          ____________________
