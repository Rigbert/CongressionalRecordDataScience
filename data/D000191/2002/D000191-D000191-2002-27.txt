Henry Ford sort of figured out the formula for success in this country back early in the last century. He said, I want to produce aproduct on an assembly line with a large number of workers, and I want my workers to be able to buy it.  And we did phenomenally well as a country. The managers, the owners of capital, and the workers all kind of came up together. Sure, the managers always did better, and the owners even did better yet, but there was some proportionality. The workers could afford to buy the products, and it created tremendous wealth for our Nation. It created an industrial base that won World War II and was the envy of the world. We rebuilt the world after World War II, led the race to space, and everything else, all those things. That was American technology based on sort of this formula of equality.                              {time}  1845  But now greed has taken over as we have seen in so many ways in corporate America, and if they can get the labor, desperate labor somewhere else a little cheaper, and avoid environmental restrictions, that is where they want to manufacture. And their vehicle is these free trade agreements. They cannot do it without the imprint and the approval of the President of the United States secretly negotiating deals that favor the export of their capital and their manufacturing jobs to these other countries.  The problem is ultimately it is going to collapse; but they will not care, like the managers of Enron who had already looted the company and are living in their six, seven or eight mansions, and they may have to sell one of their mansions.
