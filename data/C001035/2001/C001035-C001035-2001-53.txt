I appreciate their fully funding the administration's request for $597,000 in the Fish and Wildlife Management Account as well as their willingness to make $1.1 million available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to carry out a competitively awarded grant program to fund on-the-ground recovery efforts for Maine's Atlantic salmon.
