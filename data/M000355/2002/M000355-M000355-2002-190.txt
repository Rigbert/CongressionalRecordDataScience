 This is the first time in the history of this debate, over all of these years, that the three of us have actually agreed to something.  Regrettably, it has now been objected to by someone else on that side of the aisle. I say to my friend, the assistant majority leader, I hope at sometime during the course of the day tomorrow we can get that objection cleared up and hopefully Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and I will offer a unanimous consent agreement tomorrow related to this technical package which the three of us have agreed to and hopefully we can work out some way tomorrow to clear that as well.  But I have no objection to this package as far as it goes. The only caveat I issue is that we hope to be able to achieve yet another consent agreement tomorrow, to move a technical package out of the Senate.
