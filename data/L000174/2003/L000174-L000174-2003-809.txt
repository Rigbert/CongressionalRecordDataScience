There are 10 Hispanics on the circuit court of appeals today. Eight were nominated by President Clinton. There would actually be 13 on the circuit courts of appeals today except the Republican leadership in the last couple of Congresses blocked three of President Clinton's nominees for the court of appeals. President Clinton does have, by far, the record of having successfully appointed the highest number of Hispanics for circuit courts of appeals of either President of either party. As I said, it would be even larger if the Republican Party had not refused votes in committee on three nominations.  Madam President, in the wake of the tragic events of this week, all Americans are grieving with the families of the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia and with the entire NASA community. The President acknowledged that loss with a prayerful statement Saturday afternoon and with his presence, and his eloquent words yesterday in Houston were joined by a number of Senators of both parties. Our Nation mourns the loss of another crew, the crew of the Black Hawk helicopter that went down east of Baghram Afghanistan last Thursday.  Both were connected to important national missions, one the scientific quest into space, and the other part of the continuing struggle to secure Afghanistan from those who have made it a haven for international terrorism. These actions remind us all of the courage and sacrifice of those who serve the Nation in our armed services and on the frontiers of space. This week the Nation mourns, and much of the world grieves with us.  This morning, Secretary of State Powell spoke to the Security Council of the United Nations on the situation in Iraq as the administration moves forward with preparations for war, war that appears now inevitable. We know how precious to their families are each of the members of the Reserves and Armed Forces who may be about to take assignments in harm's way. In light of all these events, this week is really a poor time for the leadership of the Senate and the administration to force the Senate into an extended debate on the administration's controversial, divisive plan to pack the Federal court with activists. I had hoped the administration and the Republican leadership would reconsider that plan and the timing of this debate. I know the Democratic leader raised the matter with the Republican leadership. I thank Senator Daschle for having done so.  I thought the Senate was right to begin the week with unanimous Senate action on S. Res. 41, commemorating the devotion and regretting the fate of the Columbia space shuttle mission. Both the Republican leader and Democratic leader joined to put together that resolution. I commend both of them for doing it.  In fact, memorials are taking place around the country this week, in our hometowns and small towns, as well as the one in Houston yesterday, and here at the National Cathedral in Washington tomorrow, at Cape Canaveral in Florida, and elsewhere. Of course, there are memorials in other countries affected, especially Israel and India.  So this is not the time I would have chosen for this debate. The Senate should be finding matters of consensus on which we can all work together in unity in these difficult days of grieving. It would be good, just for once, to have things that could unite us rather than things that divide us.  Under Democratic Senate leadership in the difficult days following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, that is what we did. We joined together, Democrats and Republicans alike. We worked hard toput aside divisive issues. We focused exclusively on what America needed most in the aftermath of those attacks. I recall how hard some of us devoted ourselves to what became the USA Patriot Act; the hours, the days, the weeks we spent trying to forge consensus.  We also saw how the administration worked to demean that bipartisanship, and how during the election season it denigrated the work of Democrats trying to help the security of this country and began, once again, to divide, not unite.  It would be good to see national leaders in national campaigns seek to unite us and not to divide us. But it has been sometime since we have seen that.  So in the new 108th Congress, as we begin this initial nominations debate in the Senate Chamber, we see an emboldened executive branch wielding its rising influence over both Houses of Congress, and ever more determined to pack the Federal courts with activist allies, to turn this independent judiciary into a political judiciary.  That would be one of the greatest tragedies this Nation could face. Throughout the world, when people come to America they look at our Federal judiciary and say: This is a truly independent judiciary. Shouldn't we be working to do that?  In upholding our constitutional oath, shouldn't we, as Senators, be doing that? Shouldn't whoever is President be doing that?  I recall when the Soviet Union collapsed, Members of the new Russian Duma came here to the United States to see how we do it in a democracy. I recall sitting in my conference room with a number of people. I remember the Members of the Duma coming to my office. There were those who were going to have to oversee the new judiciary. One of the things that struck me is one of them said: We have heard that there are instances where American citizens go into a court and they bring suit against the American Government. Is that true?  I said: Yes, it happens all the time.  They said: We have also heard there were times when Americans bring suit against their Government and the individual citizen wins, the Government loses.  I said: That happens all the time.  And they said: You don't replace the judges if they rule with one of the citizens and rule against the U.S. Government?  I said: If the U.S. Government is in the wrong, of course they do, that's their duty. That is what we mean by judicial independence. That is how the same American citizen could come in on another issue and lose. The fact is, American citizens can come into our Federal courts and know they are going to be independent. They are going to know it doesn't make any difference whether they are Republicans or Democrats, whether they are rich or poor, no matter what their color, no matter what their religion, no matter whether they are liberal, conservative, moderate, or whatever part of the country they are from, when they go to the Federal courts they can see they are independent.  Now, in this attempt to change the ideology of all the Federal courts into one narrow ideological strata, we see a attempt not to unite Americans but to divide them. But worse than that, because these are lifetime appointments, we see an attempt to irrevocably damage the integrity and the independence of the Federal judiciary.  With unprecedented speed--certainly unprecedented in the last 15 or 20 years--the Democratic-controlled Senate moved through and, in 17 months, confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees. The vast majority of them were conservative Republicans, and I voted for almost all of them because I thought, having listened to them, at least we knew enough about them to know that they could be impartial on the bench. There were some we did not take up because it was so obvious from their statements that they were there to take a political, ideological view. Then we find some, of course, who will not tell us at all what they are there for.  The fundamental checks and balances of our Federal system are at risk of being sacrificed to a one-party rule with the coequal branches of our Government collapsing into one.  The Senate should not abandon its critical role. I wish more people--I wish 100 Members of the Senate--would sit down and read history books and determine how we got here and what our advice and consent rule is. Look at the fact that even President George Washington had judges who were turned down by the Senate at that time.  This is a great institution. I have given 29 years of my life here. It is the main place of checks and balances in our Federal Government, especially when it comes to advising and consenting to appointees. We are not talking about an appointment to an assistant secretaryship, or administratorship somewhere in a job that may last for a couple of years, important though it may be; we are talking about lifetime appointments, appointments of judges who will be there long after all of us have left.  Defending and upholding the Constitution is what we Senators are sworn to do. I can remember every time I walked down the aisle of this Senate and up to the Presiding Officer and raised my hand to take my oath of office to begin another 6-year term. I can remember each one of those times as though it was in crystal, as though time stopped, because what I remember is not the fact that I have become a Senator again, or that my family may be in the Gallery, or that my friends are happy. What I remember is I am taking a very awesome oath. This oath says that I will uphold the Constitution, and I will uphold my duties as a U.S. Senator--not as a Democrat or as a Republican, and not even as a Vermonter but as a U.S. Senator. We are a nation of 275 million Americans. Only 100 of us get the opportunity to represent this country at any given time. And it is an awesome responsibility.  I see the administration trying to pack the Federal court with activists. I take that very seriously. I have voted against nominees of Republican Presidents and of Democratic Presidents if I believed it would not be upholding my duties as a Senator to vote for them. But, unfortunately, this debate will be contentious, and it may be split largely along party lines.  Already, Republicans have charged those who have spoken or voted against this nomination as motivated by racism. I do not know any racist in this body in either party, and I resent the fact that some Republicans have said those who have voted against this nominee in the committee were motivated by racism. There are none in this body.  The Associated Press reports that Republicans, last Thursday, charged those who opposed this nomination of doing so ``because of ethnicity'' and with wanting ``to smear anyone who would be a positive role model for Hispanics.'' Those who made such statements should begin this debate by withdrawing those statements and disavowing that divisive rhetoric.  It is wrong for anybody to be declaring that Members of this body in either party are racists. I think it is wrong what has happened here.  Those who have done so should apologize to Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee who voted against this nomination, and also to the Hispanic leaders--very respected Hispanic leaders--in this country who showed the courage to examine this nomination, and, having examined the nomination of Mr. Estrada, decided to oppose it.  Last year, some Republicans made an outrageous and slanderous charge that religious bigotry motivated votes by the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee--even going so far as to say no Christians should get a vote, and basically made it very clear because there are four Catholics and four Jews on that committee. As one of those Catholics, I resent that, and I resent that more than anything I have heard in 29 years in the U.S. Senate. We have not seen that outrageous and slanderous charge withdrawn.  Again, I have never met a Senator in either party who showed religious bigotry. But I have heard Senators accuse Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee of that. It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong--and just as wrong to say if you vote against somebody it is out of racism. That is wrong.  I have voted on thousands upon thousands of nominees for Presidents of both parties. For most of them I hadabsolutely no idea what their race or religion was. And when I did, it never once entered into my thought. It may cause fundraising letters or cheap applause lines when speaking to different groups, but I must admit as a member of a religious minority that I find that it is something which I resent greatly.  I had hoped the administration and the Republican leadership would not do something so controversial and divisive with this nomination--not with all this Nation has gone through and continues to go through, with the tragedy of last weekend, and not knowing that we are coming to the final decision on going to war.  Just as the President has, once again, chosen to divide rather than unite by sending controversial judicial nominations in an effort to pack the courts, the Republican leadership in the Senate has chosen this time to force that controversy forward.  I made efforts over the last 2 years to try to work with the White House to confirm and appoint judges to the judicial vacancies, including a very large number of vacancies that are there because Republicans refused to allow a vote on nominations by President Clinton--moderate nominations by President Clinton. The vacancies remain year after year after year because the Senate does not allow a vote on the nominee.  As I said, during the last 17 months of the last Congress under Democratic leadership, the Senate confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Actually during that time, even though the Republicans were in charge for 6 months, they did not confirm a single one of President Bush's judicial nominees--but Democrats did, 100 of them. We worked at a rate almost twice that averaged during the preceding years when a Republican-led Senate was considering nominees of a Democratic President.  Consensus nominees were considered first and relatively quickly. Controversial nominees took more time but we considered many of them as well.  The last judicial nominee considered by the Senate last December was from the neighboring State of the distinguished Presiding Officer, Judge Dennis Shedd of South Carolina. Judge Shedd's nomination was chiefly supported by Senator Strom Thurmond. Despite his record--and certainly a record with which I disagree--in civil rights cases and his record on the bench, we proceeded. His record raised serious concerns among many--especially among African Americans living in the Fourth Circuit and across the Nation. But we brought the nominee forward. I do recall when we did that some Republicans said it would bring adversity to the bench. I am not sure what they meant by that. But we brought it forward, nonetheless, as I had agreed to. The Senate vote was 55 to 44 to confirm him.  Shortly thereafter, the Nation and the Senate were confronted by the controversy over the remarks of the former Republican leader, and people openly speculated whether the President would renominate that Senator's choice, Judge Charles Pickering. The nomination was defeated in our committee.  I do not know of any precedent for a President renominating a judicial nominee who was voted on and rejected by the Judiciary Committee. Yet this President has chosen to renominate--to go against precedent--both Judge Pickering and Justice Priscilla Owen, who both had been voted on by the Judiciary Committee and whose nominations were rejected last year.  I am over the fact that we haven't seen them on the agenda, in case Senators have second thoughts. But we will see. But now we have a different nomination before the Senate.  As I have said for some time, the Senate and the American people deserve to have an adequate record and strong confidence about the type of judge Mr. Estrada would be in order to support a favorable vote on this nomination. But we don't have that in the sparse record before the Senate on his nomination to the second highest court of the land, and as a Senator I certainly don't have confidence to support this nomination when basically all I can say about him is he is a pleasant person to be with. We have seen different sort of constantly changing biographies of him in the press--all impressive, whichever one is the latest one being used. But what I want to know is what is he going to be like in a court? You have to be concerned. Will he be an activist on the DC court?  Throughout our earlier proceedings, I repeatedly urged Mr. Estrada and the administration to be more forthcoming--certainly to be forthcoming at least to the extent that the five previous administrations I served with have been. But neither the nominee nor the administration has shown any interest--any interest whatsoever--in being more forthcoming.  So what do we have? We have before us for consideration a nominee with no judicial experience, and little relevant practical experience related to the jurisdiction of this court. He counts Justice Scalia, Kenneth Starr, and Ted Olson among his friends and mentors, but any information about how his decisionmaking would go or what he thinks is not there.  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, asked him: Well, we are not going to ask you about a case that may actually be before the court. Senator Schumer said: We are not going to ask you how you would vote on the WorldCom case because that may well be there. But if you look at Supreme Court cases, for example, can you name any you disagree with? And that was just to get some idea of what he thinks. He asked him: Can you name any cases you disagree with? And he could not.  Even if you did not want to look at some very recent cases, I would think somebody would think of a case, such as the Dred Scott decision, or Plessy v. Ferguson. These are a couple cases that would come to mind that you might disagree with. I certainly would disagree with the court upholding, what everybody now realizes is unconstitutional, the locking up of Japanese Americans during World War II, the locking up of loyal American citizens absent any due process just because of where their ancestors came from, which was upheld by a very political Supreme Court. I could have disagreed with that.  There has to have been some cases--over all these years. Upholding slavery? Upholding separate but equal? Upholding the internment of Americans for no other reason than the color of their skin and where their parents or grandparents came from? That was a softball toss. We are not even going to be allowed to know what he thinks about that. Maybe he thinks those were good cases. But if that is the case, then say they are good cases, which actually is what he did. He said there were none he disagreed with.  So you have to think that maybe one of the reasons for the controversy over Mr. Estrada is because he appears to have been groomed to be an activist appellate judge and groomed by well-connected, ideologically driven legal activists.  For example, those who he declares are his friends--you can have friends whenever you want. I have friends who range across the political spectrum. But I think I also would be willing to state what my political philosophy is, or certainly what my judicial philosophy is if I am going to ask for a lifetime appointment to the bench, just as I have to state what my political philosophy is when I ask the people of Vermont to elect or reelect me.  Last week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus restated their concerns, and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project reiterated their concerns.  Some of the most respected Latino labor leaders, including Maria Elena Durazo of HEAR, Arturo S. Rodriguez of the UFW, Miguel Contreras of L.A. County Fed., Cristina Vazquez of UNITE, and Eliseo Medina of SEIU have indicated their strong opposition to this nomination.  Let me quote from the letter from Antonia Hernandez and Antonio Gonzalez:       As a community, we recognize the importance of the      judiciary, as it is the branch to which we have turned to      seek protection when, because of our limited political power,      we are not able to secure and protect our rights through the      legislative process or with the executive branch. This has      become perhaps even more true in light of some of the actions      Congress and the executive branch have taken after 9/11,      particularly as these actions affect immigrants.       After an extensive review of the public record that was      available to us, the testimony that Mr. Estrada provided      before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the written      responses he provided to the committee, we have concluded at      this time that Mr. Estrada would not fairly review issues      that would come before him if he were to be confirmed to the      D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As such, we oppose his      nomination and urge you to do the same.  Two of the Nation's most respected Hispanic leaders.  They go on to analyze an array of issues that affect not only the Latino community but all Americans on which they find this nomination wanting. Of course, MALDEF outlined its concerns in advance of the hearing last fall in a memorandum to the White House. As their recent letter says:       [T]he Judiciary Committee gave Mr. Estrada ample      opportunity to address [their concerns]. Ultimately, Mr.      Estrada had the affirmative obligation to show that he would      be fair and impartial to all who would appear before him.      After reviewing the public record, the transcript and the      hearing, and all written responses submitted by Mr. Estrada,      we conclude that he failed to meet this obligation. He chose      one of two paths consistently at his hearing and in his      written responses: either his responses confirmed our      concerns, or he chose not to reveal his current views or      positions.  My view of the record is similar to theirs. It is also shared by the respected Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.  Senator Schumer chaired a fair hearing for Mr. Estrada last September. Every Senator--Republican and Democrat--had ample time to ask whatever questions they wanted. I was hoping that the hearing would allay concerns because I have been impressed with Mr. Estrada as a person in meeting with him. But what I wanted to know was not Mr. Estrada the person, somebody who lived next door to you, but what would a Judge Estrada--the person sitting up at the bench when you appear there--how would that person be?  When he avoided answering question after question after question, then I ended up with more questions than answers.  The recent statement from Latino labor leaders makes the following point:       Mr. Estrada is a ``stealth candidate'' whose views and      qualifications have been hidden from the American people and      from the U.S. Senate. Since his nomination, Mr. Estrada has      consistently refused to answer important questions about his      views and his judicial philosophy.  These Latino leaders went on to say that it would be ``simply irresponsible for the Senate to put him on the bench.''  After a thorough review, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund concluded that Mr. Estrada was not sufficiently qualified for a lifetime seat on the Nation's second highest court and said that his ``extreme views should be disqualifying; that he has not had a demonstrated interest in or any involvement with the Hispanic community or Hispanic activities of any kind; and that he lacks the maturity and judicial temperament necessary to be a circuit judge.''  PRLDEF said Mr. Estrada has ``made strong statements that have been interpreted as hostile to criminal defendants' rights, affirmative action and women's rights.'' They expressed concern about his temperament. People they interviewed about Mr. Estrada described him as ``arrogant and elitist'' and that he ```harangues his colleagues' and `doesn't listen to other people,''' that he is not even tempered and he is ``contentious, confrontational, aggressive and even offensive in his verbal exchanges'' with them.  As I said before, some of his supporters have said, if a Senator opposes him, that Senator is racist or anti-Hispanic.  These claims are offensive and absurd. Well-respected leaders of the Hispanic community itself have raised very serious objections and concerns about his nomination. In fact, to say that those who vote against him are racist or anti-Hispanic is as false as the statements made last fall that those who voted against Judge Pickering were anti-Christian.  No one has worked harder to increase Hispanic representation on our courts than PRLDEF, MALDEF, and the congressional Hispanic caucus. In fact, they didn't begin their review of Mr. Estrada's record with the expectation of opposing his nomination. Instead, they started with their strong record of supporting more diversity on the Federal bench, something they have done for years, President after President, urging more diversity on the Federal bench. This was before the 10 Hispanics on the court of appeals. I know President Clinton listened to them because he appointed eight of those 10. They actually would have had three more had the Republican-controlled committee allowed them to come to a vote.  Now there is all this talk about how can we possibly be stopping President Bush when he is trying so hard to have Latinos on the bench. There are 42 vacancies that have existed in the 13 circuit courts of appeal during President Bush's tenure. Mr. Estrada is the only Hispanic he has nominated. Unlike the eight that were confirmed of President Clinton's and the other three that he had in there, 11 that he nominated, President Bush has nominated one, and he had 42 chances to nominate. Out of those 42 chances, the only one he nominates is not somebody who could form a consensus within the Hispanic or non-Hispanic community, but he has one that is rejected by much of the Hispanic community, is guaranteed to be divisive. And one more time--one more time but consistent as always--the administration seeks to divide, not to unite, something that has been their hallmark.  They didn't find any Hispanics to nominate for the four vacancies on the Tenth Circuit. That includes New Mexico and Colorado, both States with large Hispanic populations. They didn't find any Hispanics to nominate for the three vacancies in the Fifth Circuit, which includes Texas, certainly a State with a large Hispanic population, or the six vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. They couldn't find any Hispanics to nominate there, but that includes California and Arizona, certainly States with large Hispanic populations. There are three vacancies on the Second Circuit, no Hispanics, even though that includes New York and Puerto Rico. Certainly, they should have found some there. Or the Third Circuit, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they couldn't find any Hispanics there to appoint.  And we know that there are some outstanding Hispanic lawyers in each of those circuits. Some are sitting on the State courts doing a superb job where there is a record and where there would be a consensus and where you would have somebody who would unite rather than divide.  In fact, there are more than 1,000 local, State, or Federal judges of Hispanic heritage, and out of those 1,000, for these 42 vacancies, the President finds one, and that one is there with no experience, no background as a judge, and is there solely because he has been put forward to carry on a particular judicial ideology.  I don't want to leave the impression that the President sent nobody up here of Latino descent. He did. And a Democratic-controlled Congress confirmed them all. Judge Christina Armijo of New Mexico, Judge Phillip Marinez, and Randy Crane of Texas, Judge Jose Martinez of Florida, Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, and Jose Linares of New Jersey--they were all nominated. We confirmed every one of them. In fact, we just held a hearing on Judge James Otero of California. I told him at the end of the hearing that I assumed we would be confirming him very quickly. Actually, we would have, had the nominee had his hearing last year, had his paperwork been completed.  But also, as I have said before, there are 10 Latino appellate judges currently seated in the Federal courts. Eighty percent of them were appointed by President Clinton. Even there, a number of them were denied Senate consideration for years while the Republicans controlled the Senate.  For example, the confirmation of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit took more than 1,500 days, even though he was strongly supported by both his home State Senators. And after Republicans delayed Judge Paez for 5 years, 39 voted against him.  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is in the Second Circuit, my circuit; everybody agreed that she was a superb candidate, but then for month after month after month--we wanted to bring her up for a vote--an anonymous hold on the Republican side of the aisle blocked consideration--anonymous hold after anonymous hold.  The irony there is that she had a strong court record. She had first beenappointed to the Federal bench by the first President Bush. He appointed her. She had this record. She had a unanimously well qualified, the highest rating possible. They stalled her and stalled her with an anonymous hold. Finally, the embarrassment got too much. And when it came to a vote, 29 Republicans voted against her.  Now a number of the circuit court nominees President Clinton sent up here never even received a hearing or vote. Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno of Texas were both nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. President Clinton was able to find qualified Hispanics for the Fifth Circuit, but the Republican leadership would not allow them to come to a vote. And Christine Arguello of Colorado was nominated to the Tenth Circuit. An awful lot of President Clinton's judicial nominees were never even given hearings or votes. Many of them were qualified Hispanics, African American, or women.  That is why during the past Congress, in the year and a half the Democrats were in control, we tried to restore fairness to the confirmation process. We tried to address the vacancies we had inherited. Even though those vacancies were caused because Republicans would not allow votes on Democratic nominees, we brought forward Republican nominees for the same places. Diversity has been the greatest strength of our Nation. That diversity of backgrounds should be reflected in our Federal courts, not just on the streets of our cities and towns. We also should accept the fact that race or ethnicity or gender are no substitute for the wisdom, experience, fairness, and impartiality that qualify someone to be a Federal judge--especially a Federal judge--entrusted with a lifetime appointment.  No potential candidate for a lifetime appointment to the Federal courts should get a presumption of competence or entitlement. You are not automatically competent or entitled simply because you are appointed. It makes no difference which party the President is from. If it were otherwise, we should do away with the advise and consent clause of the Constitution and change it to advise or rubber stamp, or something like that.  Nominees should be treated fairly, but the proof of suitability for a lifetime appointment rests on the nominee and on the administration. The Senate is not required to prove they are qualified for a lifetime appointment. We have to satisfy ourselves as individual Senators, as 100 Senators, that they are qualified and suitable for this lifetime appointment. It is up to the nominee himself or herself and the administration to make the case that allows us to reach the conclusion that they are qualified.  We have to look at their records, listen to their answers to the questions--if they will answer the questions--and if they refuse to answer the questions, I don't know why any Senator would think that he or she has an obligation to vote for this person if they will not even answer the question of why they are qualified, beyond a political connection, to a lifetime appointment on what is supposed to be an independent, nonpolitical Federal bench.  Certainly, we know the benefits of diversity and how it contributes to achieving and improving justice in America. That is fine. We should look at that and the President should. All of these questions should be looked at, and the answers to the questions should be looked at. But if all we have are questions and no answers, where do we go?  As Antonia Hernandez wrote in the Wall Street Journal:       The fact that a nominee is Latino should not be a shield      from full inquiry, particularly when a nominee's record is      sparce, as in Mr. Estrada's case.  She continued:       It is vital to know more about a nominee's philosophies for      interpreting and applying the Constitution and the laws.  It was in connection with the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd, a white male and former staffer to Senator Thurmond, that Republicans argued he would bring diversity to the Fourth Circuit. Maybe that is their sense of diversity. I suspect it is not the sense of many others. Be that as it may, each Senator has to make up his or her mind about the qualifications. I defy any Senator to make up his or her mind satisfactorily when they don't have a record before them or answers to questions.  The Fourth Circuit was a Federal circuit court that had the longest history without an African-American judge, speaking of diversity. It wasn't until President Clinton's recess appointment of Judge Roger Gregory that the Fourth Circuit was finally desegregated.  The reason we were not able to get him through before was the Republican majority used blue slips and secret objections to block the integration of that court for years during the Clinton administration as the Clinton administration nominated one qualified African American after another. He was accorded a hearing, but they did say Judge Shedd would bring diversity to that court. In that regard, I am glad that common sense came out, and I applaud the two Senators from Virginia--Republican Senators--for convincing the President to renominate Judge Gregory, this outstanding African-American jurist. I commend both Senator Allen and Senator Warner for standing up for him. When he came to the Senate floor and we had a rollcall vote on him, every Senator, except one, voted for him. It shows the quality of the nominee, but also it is a strong signal to that court that here is a judge who has been looked at by both Republicans and Democrats in 1990, and 100 Senators came to the conclusion that he was qualified.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a CHC civil rights task force scorecard.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Congressional Hispanic      Caucus (CHC), we wish to inform you that the CHC has decided      to oppose Miguel Estrada's nomination to the United State      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After      reviewing Mr. Estrada's record and meeting with him in      person, we have concluded that he fails to meet the CHC's      evaluation criteria for endorsing judicial nominees.       As you know, the judicial nomination process is important      to the CHC because we believe that our nation's courts should      reflect the diversity of thought and action that enrich      America. Earlier this year, we launched the Hispanic      Judiciary Initiative to further formalize our involvement in      this issue by establishing a set of evaluation criteria and      an internal process for endorsing nominees. We hope that this      initiative will allow us to continue our work to ensure fair      treatment of Latino judicial nominees and tackle the lack of      diversity in the federal judiciary.       In evaluating Mr. Estrada, we considered not only his      honesty, integrity, character, temperament, and intellect,      but also his commitment to equal justice and advancement      opportunities for Latinos working in the field of law.      Because of the nature of the CHC's mission and the important      role that the courts play in achieving that mission, in order      to support a judicial nominee the CHC requires that he or she      has a demonstrated commitment to protecting the rights of      Latinos through his or her professional work, pro bono work,      and volunteer activities; to preserving and expanding the      progress that has been made on civil rights and individual      liberties; and to expanding advancement opportunities for      Latinos in the law profession. On this measure, Mr. Estrada      fails to convince us that he would contribute under-     represented perspectives to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit.       As stated by Mr. Estrada during his meeting with us, he has      never provided any pro bono legal expertise to the Latino      community or organizations. Nor has he ever joined,      supported, volunteered for or participated in events of any      organization dedicated to serving and advancing the Latino      community. As an attorney working in government and the      private sector, he has never made efforts to open doors of      opportunity to Latino law students or junior lawyers through      internships, mentoring or other means. While he has not been      in the position to create internships or recruit new staff,      he never appealed to his superiors about the importance of      making such efforts on behalf of Latinos. Furthermore, Mr.      Estrada declined to commit that he would be engaged in      Hispanic community activities once appointed to the bench or      that he would pro-actively seek to promote increased access      to positions where Latinos have been traditionally under-     represented, such as clerkships.       Mr. Estrada shared with us that he believes being Hispanic      would be irrelevant in his day-to-duties on the court, which      leads us to conclude that he does not see himself     as being capable of bringing new perspectives to the bench.      This is deeply troubling since the CHC's primary objective in      increasing ethnic diversity of the courts is to increase the      presence of under-presented perspectives.       Mr. Estrada's limited record makes it difficult to      determine whether he would be a forceful voice on the bench      for advancing civil rights and other protections for      minorities. He has never served as a judge and has not      written any substantive articles or publications. However, we      did note that in responding to inquiries about case law, Mr.      Estrada did not demonstrate a sense of inherent      ``unfairness'' or ``justice'' in cases that have had a great      impact on the Hispanic community.       The appointment of a Latino to reflect diversity is      rendered meaningless unless the nominee can demonstrate an      understanding of the historical role courts have played in      the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and      rights; has some involvement in the Latino community that      provides insight into the values and mores of the Latino      culture in order to understand the unique legal challenges      facing Latinos; and recognizes both the role model      responsibilities he or she assumes as well as having an      appreciation for protecting and promoting the legal rights of      minorities who historically have been the victims of      discrimination.       Based on the totality of the nominee's available record and      our meeting with him, Miguel Estrada fails to meet the CHC's      criteria for endorsing a judicial nominee. In our opinion,      his lack of judicial experience coupled with a failure to      recognize or display an interest in the needs of the Hispanic      community do not support an appointment to the federal      judiciary. We respectfully urge you to take this into account      as you consider his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Gonzalez,       Chair, CHC Civil Rights Task Force.                                  ____ CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS HISPANIC JUDICIARY INITIATIVE--SCORECARD                FOR CIRCUIT COURT NOMINEE MIGUEL ESTRADA------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Mr. Estrada's       Evaluation criteria              record            Conclusion------------------------------------------------------------------------Commitment to equal justice for   No record.........  ..................
