 President, I am extremely pleased that today the Senate is giving advice and consent to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, and approval to the related implementing legislation.  The Senate's approval of these measures will send both of them to the President for his signature. This is good news for American parents looking to adopt overseas, and good news for the thousands of orphaned children overseas looking for loving homes.  This treaty is important for a very simple reason--it will help facilitate international adoptions and provide important safeguards for children and adoptive parents. It is a good thing when the government can make things easier for its citizens--in this case, adoptive parents. An adoption is a joyous occasion, but the current system can be confusing and present uncertainties.  The Hague Convention establishes a uniform system for adopting children from other countries--so that both adoptive parents and biological parents have the assurance that an adoption is being done right. The Hague Convention and the implementing bill also establish mechanisms for improved governmental oversight for international adoptions--in order to guard against fraud and other problems associated with such adoptions.  The implementing legislation is the product of compromise between a number of people--the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, Senator Landrieu, Senator Brownback, and myself, and several people in the other body, including Chairman Ben Gilman, and Representative Sam Gejdenson, Bill Delahunt, and Dave Camp. None of us got all that we wanted. But I believe we have a good product here. I want to express my appreciation to them and their staffs for the hard work that went into the drafting of this bill. Several people in the executive branch, too numerous to mention, also contributed greatly to this bill.  Now the hard work of putting the promise of the Hague Convention into reality begins. The executive branch will have much to do in implementing this treaty, and Congress will have a duty to oversee this work closely. But today we are taking an important step for parents and children--a step about which we can all be proud.                          ____________________
