 President, if I could have the attention of all Senators. At the rate we are going, we could be here until 5 a.m. in the morning, so I think it is a good time to seek some cooperation.  We have a number of amendments lined up here where sponsors will take a voice vote in the tranche we are working on now. If there are any Senators who are not in the current tranche and would like to be considered, I recommend that those Senators come over here and talk to the budget staff and see if we can't take some of them and do it by a voice vote and see if we can move through this process so we can get out of here at a reasonable hour.  I ask my friend the Democratic leader to give us a view of the status on the Democratic side.
