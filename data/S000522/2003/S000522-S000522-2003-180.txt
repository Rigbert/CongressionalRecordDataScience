Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 49) expressing the sense of the Congress that the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic violence within many participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is of profound concern and efforts should be undertaken to prevent future occurrences.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 49       Whereas the expressions of anti-Semitism experienced      throughout the region encompassing the participating States      of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe      (OSCE) have included physical assaults, with some instances      involving weapons or stones, arson of synagogues, and      desecration of Jewish cultural sites, such as cemeteries and      statues;       Whereas vicious propaganda and violence in many OSCE States      against Jews, foreigners, and others portrayed as alien have      reached alarming levels, in part due to the dangerous      promotion of aggressive nationalism by political figures and      others;       Whereas violence and other manifestations of xenophobia and      discrimination can never be justified by political issues or      international developments;       Whereas the Copenhagen Concluding Document adopted by the      OSCE in 1990 was the first international agreement to condemn      anti-Semitic acts, and the OSCE participating States pledged      to ``clearly and unequivocally condemn totalitarianism,      racial and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and      discrimination against anyone as well as persecution on      religious and ideological grounds'';       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly at its meeting in      Berlin in July 2002 unanimously adopted a resolution that,      inter     alia, called upon participating States to ``ensure aggressive      law enforcement by local and national authorities, including      thorough investigation of anti-Semitic criminal acts,      apprehension of perpetrators, initiation of appropriate      criminal prosecutions and judicial proceedings'';       Whereas Decision No. 6 adopted by the OSCE Ministerial      Council at its Tenth Meeting in Porto, Portugal in December      2002 (the ``Porto Ministerial Declaration'') condemned ``the      recent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the OSCE area,      recognizing the role that the existence of anti-Semitism has      played throughout history as a major threat to freedom'';       Whereas the Porto Ministerial Declaration also urged ``the      convening of separately designated human dimension events on      issues addressed in this decision, including on the topics of      anti-Semitism, discrimination and racism and xenophobia'';      and       Whereas on December 10, 2002, at the Washington      Parliamentary Forum on Confronting and Combating anti-     Semitism in the OSCE Region, representatives of the United      States Congress and the German Parliament agreed to denounce      all forms of anti-Semitism and agreed that ``anti-Semitic      bigotry must have no place in our democratic societies'':      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) officials of the executive branch and Members of      Congress should raise the issue of anti-Semitism in their      bilateral contacts with other countries and at multilateral      fora, including meetings of the Permanent Council of the      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)      and the Twelfth Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary      Assembly to be convened in July 2003;       (2) participating States of the OSCE should unequivocally      condemn anti-Semitism (including violence against Jews and      Jewish cultural sites), racial and ethnic hatred, xenophobia,      and discrimination, as well as persecution on religious      grounds whenever it occurs;       (3) participating States of the OSCE should ensure      effective law enforcement by local and national authorities      against criminal acts stemming from anti-Semitism,      xenophobia, or racial or ethnic hatred, whether directed at      individuals, communities, or property, including thorough      investigation and prosecution of such acts;       (4) participating States of the OSCE should promote the      creation of educational efforts throughout the region      encompassing the participating States of the OSCE to counter      anti-Semitic stereotypes and attitudes among younger people,      increase Holocaust awareness programs, and help identify the      necessary resources to accomplish this goal;       (5) legislators in all OSCE participating States should      play a leading role in combating anti-Semitism and ensure      that the resolution adopted at the 2002 meeting of the OSCE      Parliamentary Assembly in Berlin is followed up by a series      of concrete actions at the national level; and       (6) the OSCE should organize a separately designated human      dimension event on anti-Semitism as early as possible in      2003, consistent with the Porto Ministerial Declaration      adopted by the OSCE at the Tenth Meeting of the OSCE      Ministerial Council in December 2002.
