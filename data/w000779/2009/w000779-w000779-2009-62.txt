President, along with my friend, Senator Barrasso, I am introducing legislation to keep rural America from becoming a health care sacrifice zone. Our legislation, the Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act, will make it more financially attractive for doctors and other providers to treat patients in rural areas. Both Senator Barrasso and I have heard from the folks back home about how hard it is to get doctors and mid-level practitioners in rural areas. My constituents have had to travel hours to get treatment when they need it. This bill takes major strides to ensure access to health care by building on the successes of the rural health clinic program. When it comes to health care, rural residents should not have to accept second-class status.  As the Senate takes up comprehensive healthcare reform, this Congress must not lose focus on the health needs of folks in rural areas. Too many Oregonians cannot get the kind of affordable and comprehensive coverage or access to care their Members of Congress receive. In addition, many patients in rural Oregon, even those with good health benefits, do not have access to providers or have to travel long distances to get medical care.  Meanwhile, providers lack incentives to go to--or stay in--rural areas. It is a lot more lucrative for them to work in big cities where they can work in state-of-the art facilities and earn top dollar. According to the Oregon State Office of Rural Health, a major obstacle facing Oregon's rural health clinics is the severe shortage of health care providers willing or able to work in a rural area. One out of three Oregon rural health clinics was recruiting in 2008.  That is why Senator Barrasso and I come here to introduce the Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act. Simply put, our bill would help improve access for patients in rural areas, while increasing reimbursement rates and giving incentives to providers in rural areas.  The Rural Health Clinic Patient Access and Improvement Act increases the all-inclusive Medicare payment rate for rural health clinics by more than 20 percent per visit from an average of $76 to $92. This bill would provide an additional $2 bonus for rural health clinics that participate in a quality improvement program. Quality of care should be a focus for all providers.  The bill will allow for better collaboration between community health centers and rural health clinics. It also creates a 5-state demonstration project to recruit and retain providers in rural communities by subsidizing a portion of the provider's medical liability costs if they practice in a rural health clinic. These reforms will help ensure rural residents have access to the same level of quality care as those in other parts of the country.  This bill builds upon the success of Oregon's 54 rural health clinics that serve 26 out of 36 counties across the state. These rural health clinics help to ensure access to primary care for the underserved elderly and low-income populations. Ninety-eight percent of Oregon's rural health clinics are willing to see Medicare and Medicaid patients as well as patients with no insurance. Not only are they willing to see these patients, but 96 percent are currently accepting new patients. Many rural residents--whether they are uninsured, publically insured or have private insurance--would have nowhere to go to receive primary care without rural health clinics.  When it comes to health care, people want to go to a provider they know and trust. One of the reasons rural health clinics have been so successful is that they have become an integral part of their communities. A great example of this is Gilliam County Medical Center. Gilliam County hosted a succession of short-term physicians placed in the community through the National Health Service Corps. In the 1970s, the community, in conjunction with the State, sought a more permanent, stable health care provider situation. The Oregon legislature appropriated $20,000 as seed money to attract a team of health professionals to the community and the residents of Gilliam County created the South Gilliam Health District to support Gilliam County Medical Center, a certified rural health clinic.  Two physician assistants, David Jones and Dennis Bruneau who were on the faculty at the University of Washington PA program at the time they heard about the opportunity with the clinic were hired. Dave, Dennis, their spouses, who also work at the clinic, and supervising physician Dr. Bruce Carlson created a team that continues to sustain one of the most stable and long-term small rural primary care clinics in the state.  Dr. Carlson visits the clinic one day every 2 weeks to see those patients in need of his services and provide overall medical direction. Otherwise, the clinic is staffed full-time by physician assistants Jones and Bruneau. David's wife is a medical technician who works in the clinic and Dennis' wife serves as the clinic manager. When Dr. Carlson is not in Condon, he has his own medical practice 70 miles away in Hermiston, OR, which is also the location of the nearest hospital to Condon.  Not all rural areas are alike and the rural health clinic program gives these providers the flexibility they need to be the regular source of care of primary care in their communities. Regular access to primary care, as you know, is one of the key tests of whether or not you will receive the preventive health screenings that can mean the difference that could save your life. They allow for health problems to be caught early on so that they can be headed off for just a little money, instead of at later stages, which require costly specialty care that runs up the bill for the patient and the taxpayer.  Oregonians in rural areas have the same right to quality, affordable medical care as those living in urban areas, but they do not have it under our current system. This bill will expand access to health care for folks in rural areas and level the playing field for rural health clinics by giving them the tools they need to attract and retain quality medical providers.  I want to thank Senator Barrasso and his staff for their hard work in bringing this important bipartisan legislation before the Senate.  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Barrasso and me, and support this much needed and bipartisan bill.                                 ______                                       By
