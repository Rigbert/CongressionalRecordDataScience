Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that information.  Mr. Speaker, I might say that that may be the most expensive birthday present anybody ever has gotten, when you mentioned Mr. Thornberry. The chairman has done very well, and I congratulate him on his work and onhis bipartisan working together with his committee members.  The majority leader and I have talked about this briefly, but, obviously, we now have on the schedule 2 weeks left to go to do our business. There is some discussion in the Senate, as the gentleman knows, about them meeting into August.  Obviously, one of the problems with that is for, particularly, younger Members. A lot of Members here have children who go back to school the third week in August, so the first 2 weeks are not available to them.  Can we give them some direction on whether or not we expect to be here past the scheduled adjournment date of July 31?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  As of now, I have no scheduled changes to what has been announced. I do want to notify the Members, though, when the Senate sends us a healthcare bill, if we are still in session, we will move to the healthcare bill. If we are out, back in our districts, I would give them a notified time appropriate to come back and begin our work. We would not wait until the recess is over. We would begin work.
