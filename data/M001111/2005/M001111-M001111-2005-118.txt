 President, I rise today to join Senator Bond in strongly opposing the Coburn amendment and the numerous other amendments he has filed with the same type of philosophy, as he calls it, in the Senate.  I join with my colleague from Missouri, the chairman of this committee. I, like him, go home every single weekend to Washington State, which is 2,500 miles away from the Nation's Capital. I, like the Senator from Missouri, do not believe the bureaucrats sitting in Washington, DC, know what is happening on the ground in my home State 2,500 miles away from here. I am out there. I am out in every community, talking to people, listening to them, knowing what their concerns are, knowing what they are developing within their own communities, within their own cities, within their own capabilities, to help stimulate the economy and to do good things. It is my job to be their partner in that. I tell them that all the time. You get it going on the ground here, you develop the projects, you get the consensus within your own communities, and I will do what I can to get some small part of help from the Federal Government. That is how I, like most Senators in the Senate, am sent projects.  Last year, I was in Yakima Valley and talked to our farmers out there. This is a remote community.
