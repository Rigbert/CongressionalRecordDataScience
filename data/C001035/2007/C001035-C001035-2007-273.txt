Lieberman, Mr. Carper, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Akaka) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs:                               S. Res. 22       Whereas all Americans depend on the United States Postal      Service to transact business and communicate with friends and      family;       Whereas postal customers have a constitutional right to      expect that their sealed domestic mail will be protected      against unreasonable searches;       Whereas the circumstances and procedures under which the      Government may search sealed mail are well defined, including      provisions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of      1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and generally require prior      judicial approval;       Whereas the United States Postal Inspection Service has the      authority to open and search a sealed envelope or package      when there is immediate threat to life or limb or an      immediate and substantial danger to property;       Whereas the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act      (Public Law 109-435) expressly reaffirmed the right of postal      customers to have access to a class of mail sealed against      inspection;       Whereas the United States Postal Service affirmed January      4, 2007, that the enactment of the Postal Accountability and      Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) does not grant Federal      law enforcement officials any new authority to open domestic      mail;       Whereas the signing statement on the Postal Accountability      and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) issued by President      Bush on December 20, 2006, raises questions about the      President's commitment to abide by these basic privacy      protections; and       Whereas the Senate rejects any interpretation of the      President's signing statement on the Postal Accountability      and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) that in any way      diminishes the privacy protections accorded sealed domestic      mail under the Constitution and Federal laws and regulations:       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate reaffirms the constitutional and      statutory protections accorded sealed domestic mail.
