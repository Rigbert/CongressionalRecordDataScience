 But I just want to let Senators know that too often our Nation's students show up to school hungry or lacking adequate school supplies. Many of our teachers, as we know, are really struggling to provide students with an education, while they are also dealing with the compounding problems brought on by poverty.  Site resource coordinators, which this amendment addresses, operate through a community school model, are able to bolster the number of resources in schools, and increase the number of services offered to students and their families.  So what this amendment does is that it would further that goal by allowingtitle IV funds to be used for site coordinators.  I thank Senator Brown for offering this amendment.
