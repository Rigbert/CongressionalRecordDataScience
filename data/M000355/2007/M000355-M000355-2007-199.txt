 McCarthy notes the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, after upholding Judge Mukasey's work, took the highly unusual step of praising his handling of the case. Here is what the court of appeals wrote:       The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, presided      with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to      the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the      jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of      challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial      judge.  Judge Mukasey has earned the deep respect and admiration of the lawyers who have appeared before him and of the many other public servants who have observed and studied his work. His intelligence, experience, and fairmindedness would seem to make him an ideal candidate to lead the Justice Department.  At the very least, these qualities warrant timely and fair consideration of his nomination by the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, recent press reports, including a Roll Call article from just a couple of hours ago, indicate that at least some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are more interested in dragging out this nomination than in installing new leadership at the Justice Department.  They have said they might hold Judge Mukasey's nomination hostage in order to extract still more administration documents in the U.S. attorneys matter.  This would be extremely unfortunate. By injecting politics into the confirmation process, committee Democrats would be turning their backs on earlier public comments that installing new leadership at the Department was of critical importance. They would be turning their backs on earlier public assurances that they would not obstruct or impede--again their words--a nominee with Judge Mukasey's qualities.  Now is the chance for our Democratic colleagues to prove they were serious when they cried out for new leadership at the Justice Department by following Senate precedent, weighing the nominee's qualifications, and voting in a timely fashion.  I would hope they would not hold him hostage, forgetting the words of the senior Senator from New York, who has told us:       This Nation needs a new Attorney General and it cannot      afford to wait.  In these times, it is especially important that the Senate act promptly. We are at war, and as the distinguished ranking member has noted: Apart from the Defense Department, no department of the executive branch is more important to defending our Nation than the Department of Justice.  We need to act. Now, I understand that Judge Mukasey will begin his courtesy visits tomorrow with Members of the Senate. I am hopeful my colleagues will be able to meet with him so the Senate can begin considering his nomination as soon as reasonably possible.                               Exhibit 1 Judge Mukasey Would Make a Stellar Attorney General; A Gifted Former       Prosecutor and Renowned Jurist Could Be Just the Right Fit.                        (By Andrew C. McCarthy)       It is not exaggeration to say that the United States      Department of Justice is among the handful of our nation's      most important institutions. It is the fulcrum of our rule of      law.       The department must be above reproach. It must enforce our      laws without fear or favor. It must be the place the courts,      the Congress and the American people look to without      hesitation for the most unflinching recitation of fact and      the most reliable construction of law. Creativity is      welcome--it is the department's proud boast always to be home      for some of the world's most creative legal minds. Defense of      executive prerogatives is also essential--for the department      is not the servant but the peer of the judges and lawmakers      before whom it appears, with its first fidelity to the      Constitution. Creativity, however, is not invention, and      prerogative is not partisanship.       The department must foremost be the Department of Justice.      Its emblem is integrity. We can argue about where the law      should take us, in what direction it should evolve. We must      first, however, be able to know what it is. For that, we must      be able to rely without question on the department and its      leader, the attorney general.       President Bush is about to select a new attorney general at      a particularly tempestuous time. In today's Washington, even      national security has not been spared from our fulminating      politics. In the cross-fire, we need stalwart leadership of      incontestable competence and solid mooring in the      department's highest traditions. Without it, a growing crisis      of confidence will grip not only the courts but field      prosecutors across the nation.       To address such a crisis, the President is fortunate to      have several able candidates. One I know particularly well,      though you may not, would instantly restore the department's      well-deserved reputation for rectitude, scholarship, vision      and sober judgment. He is Michael B. Mukasey.       I had the privilege of appearing before Judge Mukasey for      nearly three years, from 1993 into 1996, when, as an      Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York,      I led the prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven      other jihadists who had waged a terrorist war against the      United States--bombing the World Trade Center, plotting to      strike other New York City landmarks (including the United      Nations complex, the FBI's lower Manhattan headquarters, U.S.      military installations, and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels),      and conspiring political assassinations against American and      foreign leaders.       The case was bellwether for 9/11 and its aftermath,      presenting all the complex and, at times, excruciating issues      we deal with today: the obscure lines a free society must      draw between religious belief and religiously motivated      violence, between political dissent and the summons      to savagery, between due process for accused criminals      with a right to present their defense and the imperative      to shield precious intelligence from incorrigible enemies      bent on killing us.       The trial was probably the most important one ever      witnessed by . . . nobody. In an odd quirk of history, our      nine-month proceeding began at the same time as, and ended a      day before, the infamous O.J. Simpson murder trial. While      Americans were riveted to a televised three-ring circus in      California, Judge Mukasey, in his meticulous yet decisive      way, was demonstrating why our judicial system is the envy of      the world: carefully crafting insightful opinions on the      proper balance between national security and civil liberties,      permitting the government to introduce the full spectrum of      its evidence but holding it rigorously to its burden of proof      and its ethical obligations; managing a complex litigation      over defense access to classified information; and developing      jury instructions that became models for future national-     security cases.       All the defendants were convicted, and the sentencing      proceedings, complicated by the need to apply novel federal      guidelines to a rarely used, Civil War era charge of      seditious conspiracy, ended in the imposition of      appropriately lengthy jail terms. No one, however, could      contend that the case had not been an exemplar of our system      at its best. Indeed, in an unusual encomium, the Second      Circuit Court of Appeals, upon scrutinizing and upholding the      judge's work, was moved to observe:       ``The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey,      presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring      fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and      helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement      in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured      by a trial judge.''       No one should have been surprised. By the time the Blind      Sheikh's trial was assigned to him, Judge Mukasey had already      forged a reputation as one of America's top trial judges. (In      my mind, he is peerless.) That was so because he was also one      of America's most brilliant lawyers. From humble beginnings      in the Bronx, he had earned his bachelor's degree at Columbia      before graduating from Yale Law School in 1967. As a judge,      he tolerated nothing but the best effort from prosecutors      because he had, himself, been a top prosecutor. He well      understood the enormous power in the hands of young assistant      U.S. attorneys, the need to temper it with reason and sound      judgment. He grasped implicitly and conveyed by example that      the great honor of being a lawyer for the United States      Department of Justice is that no one gets, or should expect      to get, an award for being honest and forthright. It is a      realm where those attributes are assumed.       In 1988, Michael Mukasey left a lucrative private law      practice when President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the      federal bench. He was exactly the credit to his court and his      country that the President had anticipated. Quite apart from      terrorism matters, he handled thousands of cases, many of      them high-stakes affairs, with skill and quiet distinction.      In his final years on the bench before returning to private      practice, he was the Southern District's chief judge, putting      his stamp on the court--especially in the aftermath of the      September 11th attacks. Through the sheer force of his      persistence and his sense of duty, the court quickly reopened      for business despite being just a few blocks away from the      carnage. Indeed, it never really closed--Judge Mukasey      personally traveled to other venues in the District to ensure      that the court's vital processes were available to the      countless federal, state and local officials who were working      round the clock to investigate and prevent a reprise of the      suicide hijackings.       Characteristically, the judge ensured that the Justice      Department was able to do its vital work in a manner that      would withstand scrutiny when the heat of the moment had      cooled. Judges, himself included, made themselves available,      day and night, to review applications for warrants and other      lawful authorization orders--no one would ever claim that in      his besieged district, crisis had trumped procedural      regularity. And as investigators detained material witnesses      and scrambled to determine whether they were mere information      sources or actual terror suspects, Judge Mukasey made certain      that there was a lawful basis for detention, that detainees      were represented by counsel fully apprised of that basis, and      that the proceedings were kept on a tight leash--under strict      judicial supervision, with detainees promptly released unless      there was an independent reason to charge them with crimes.       Judge Mukasey's mastery of national security issues,      reflecting a unique fitness to lead the Justice Department in      this critical moment of our history, continued to manifest      itself after 9/11. He deftly handled the enemy-combatant      detention of Jose Padilla (recently convicted of terrorism      crimes), forcefully endorsing the executive branch's wartime      power to protect the United States from an al Qaeda operative      dispatched to our homeland to conduct mass-murder attacks,      but vindicating the American citizen's constitutional rights      to counsel and to challenge his detention without trial      through habeas corpus. Later, in accepting the Federal Bar      Council's prestigious Learned Hand Medal for excellence in      federal jurisprudence, Judge Mukasey spoke eloquently of the      need to maintain the Patriot Act's reasonable national      security protections. More recently, he has written      compellingly as a private citizen with unique insight about      the profound challenges radical Islam presents for our      judicial system.       At this moment in time, the nation would be best served by      an attorney general who would bring the department instant      credibility with the courts and Congress, provide a needed      shot in the arm for prosecutors craving a reminder of the      department's proud traditions, and reassure the public of the      administration's commitment to the department's high      standards. There are precious few people who fit that bill,      and of them, Michael Mukasey may be the least well known      nationally. But he is as solid as they come. Our country      would be well served if he were asked, once again, to answer      its call.                          ____________________
