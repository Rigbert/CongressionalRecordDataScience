 President, somewhere out there in our countrytoday walks the next Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Very soon, this Senate will begin to debate that person's confirmation. We don't know yet the nominee's professional background or experience, but sadly, if the past is any guide, we do know what kind of reception that nominee is likely--likely to receive. That is why I rise to speak today.  No one would argue that some recent Supreme Court confirmation debates have been less than ennobling. But it doesn't have to be that way.
