 I am going to propound that now.  I ask unanimous consent that the Environment and Public Works Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2414, the Coal Country Protection Act and the Senate proceedto its immediate consideration. I further ask consent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
