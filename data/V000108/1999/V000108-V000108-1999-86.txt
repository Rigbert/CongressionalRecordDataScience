Speaker, I appreciate, first of all, the support of the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) for the legislation, as well as his expression of concern.  The issue of short supply is an issue that we have considered from the inception of the original legislation and do believe that it is covered under the bill itself. The fact is, the administration, following enactment of H.R. 975, will have 60 days in which to fashion a comprehensive program that will still allow one out of every four tons of steel sold in the United States to be exported from another country.  Additionally, the reason we wanted to give the administration that flexibility and to put all of the countries and all of the products on one table is to make sure that companies such as the gentleman's in the State of Washington, earlier we had a gentleman on the other side, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), indicate he had a problem as far as possible short supply, that those can be addressed.  The reason we have looked at quantitative restrictions is, again, to make sure that we do not have people who are trading illegally under our trade laws following in behind someone else who is now obeying the law. That would be the responsibility of the administration, and I do appreciate very much the concerns the gentleman raised.
