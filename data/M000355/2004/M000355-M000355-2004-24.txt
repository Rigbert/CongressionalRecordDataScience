 Lugar):  S. 3016. A bill to promote freedom, economic growth, and security in Asia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my good friend from Indiana, the ``Asia Freedom Act of 2004''.  We offer this bill with the full knowledge that it will neither be considered nor voted upon by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations before the 108th Congress ends. Rather, we intend today's introduction to mark what we hope is the start of broader discussion between our respective offices and the Administration on America's foreign policy toward Asia.  The Act is based on the Freedom Support Act for the Former Soviet Union and provides an integrated and coherent framework for U.S. policy toward North and Southeast Asia. It creates 10 broad development activities for the region--ranging from democracy to security and the environment--and endorses the establishment of a coordinator of assistance to the region at the State Department, and a deputy coordinator at USAID.  The Act defines eligibility requirements for U.S. foreign assistance for central governments in the region based on their respective commitments to, among other things, the advancement of freedom and justice and efforts to crack down on international terrorism. It requires the State Department to judge central governments of countries in the region not by what they say, but rather by the concrete actions they undertake to further democracy, security and stability in the region.  The Act requires a number of annual reports, including a description of democracy building activities conducted by the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and other countries and institutions, and a listing on a country-by-country basis of known political prisoners.  Taking a cue from President Bush's January 12, 2004 proclamation denying current and former corrupt public officials entry into the United States, the Act provides authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to deny visas to those officials in the region whose actions have had an adverse impact on the advancement of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and economic freedom in the region.  The Act is necessary to ensure that appropriate and continuous attention is paid by the U.S. Congress and the Administration to the march of political and economic freedom across Asia. Much ground has been gained over the past year, particularly with successful presidential and parliamentary elections in Indonesia, but more must be done, whether in Burma, Cambodia or Thailand.  In short, the Asia Freedom Act guarantees America's focus, foreign policy and foreign assistance are targeted toward an increasingly important region of the world.  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3016       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
