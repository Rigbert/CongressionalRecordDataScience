Mr. Speaker, I am confident the Navy would not be interested in beaches in Alaska.  Mr. Speaker, I again stress for my colleagues to vote for this legislation. It is long overdue.  I am very concerned, as the gentleman from Hawaii has mentioned, that at this late date that these questions might arise. It is an example, I think, of some incompetency down in the department, and I say that with some reservation in the sense I cannot blame everybody, maybe just one enthusiastic individual. I know Secretary Dalton has been talked to. I had hoped that there would be a total turndown of this and I expect that before we do vote on this legislation, if we vote on this legislation.
