Speaker, it is with great pride that I congratulate Mr. John Wingate Griffin on his retirement from the Federal Government after 32 years of dedicated service to this great country. His career exemplifies selfless public service at its best and is a model for existing and future Federal employees. He retired at the end of May 2003.  A fifth generation native Californian, Mr. Griffin was born on December 2, 1946. After graduating from high school in Ojai, California, he later continued his studies at Ventura College earning an Associate Degree in economics. He received his bachelor's degree of International Relations and Economics in June 1973 from California State University.  Mr. Griffin served his country honorably in the military for over 3 years with the United States Army. He continued his Federal career for an additional 28 plus years as an economist with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Sacramento and San Francisco, California. When he retired from the Corps, he was serving as Chief of Civil Works Program Development for the South Pacific Division where he had been employed since September 1986. In addition to leading a staff of economists and program analysts, Mr. Griffin presided over the largest Corps' Civil Works General Investigations program covering all or part of ten of the Nation's largest States and was a special advisor to the Division Commander. He provided regional oversight to four district program development activities located in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles, California and Albuquerque, New Mexico. His knowledge of the General Investigations program, coupled with his analytical capabilities, placed him in a class by himself as a program expert. He maintained a personable attitude that contributed to overcoming numerous challenges and made even the most difficult tasks doable. As he is fond of saying, ``one can disagree without being disagreeable.'' His advice was always on the mark.  Mr. Griffin will retire to his hometown of Auburn, California where he and his beloved wife, Daniela, had been active in their community for well over 30 years. Individually or together, they touched the lives of many in the community by serving on the planning commission, teaching in the public schools, contributing to fine dining experiences in Auburn through operation of their elegant restaurant, enjoying ballroom dancing, or helping others with expert mechanical advice on automobiles. They were the perfect couple and we express our deepest sorrow at Mr. Griffin's loss of Daniela earlier this year. We wish him a healthy, happy, and well-deserved retirement.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. John Wingate Griffin on his retirement as he concludes a successful Federal career. We thank him again for a job well done, and for his many contributions to the Corps, the Army, and the Nation.                          ____________________
