 President, the purpose of this amendment, as I understand it, is to prevent American jobs from being moved overseas. I think if we are serious about this, we may want to change our disastrous trade policies, which have led to the shutdown of thousands of factories in this country and millions of decent-paying jobs. In my view, at a time when we have an $18 trillion national debt, the last thing we need to do is to cut corporate taxes on profitable corporations that in many cases pay little or nothing in Federal taxes.  We have major corporation after major corporation making billions of dollars. They pay zero in Federal income taxes. I don't quite know how you can lower their taxes below zero. We need real tax reform in this country that ends corporate loopholes that is costing us well over $100 billion a year.  So I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
