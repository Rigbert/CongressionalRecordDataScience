Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support measures in their States to designate the Sunday before the Memorial Day Weekend each year as ``Neighbor Day.''  The neighborhoods we once knew as places of peace and harmony are now engaged in the fight against a rising tide of crime and violence. One of the saddest results of this increasing crime is that neighbors fear for their safety and become alienated from one another.  Four years ago, my constituents in Westerly, RI, came up with the idea of celebrating ``Neighbor Day'' as a way to reach out to one another, introduce themselves to new neighbors and renew old friendships. With parties and open house gatherings, Neighbor Day in Westerly gave people a sense of neighborhood pride and positive community spirit. Two years ago, the entire State celebrated this spirit of good will.  I believe that by celebrating ``Neighbor Day'' nationally, we can bring people closer together and overcome the atmosphere of fear and mistrust found too often in our neighborhoods. This effort is not solely confined to Rhode Island. Indeed, Boys Nation passed a resolution in July 1994 to make the Sunday before Memorial Day weekend each year ``National Neighbor Day.''  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in this unique endeavor by supporting measures to create ``Neighbor Day'' in their States.                          ____________________
