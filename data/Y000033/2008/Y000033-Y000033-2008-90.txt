Let's follow this train a little bit further. If we don't increase our supply, Mr. and Mrs. America, instead of $4 a gallon, it is going to be $10 a gallon by January 1.  We must act in this Congress, and if you do not, may the wrath come down on you and may you be punished for what you have not done. We must address this issue in this Congress. I urge my colleagues to consider the supply side. Consider it. And this legislation itself has its weak points, too.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.
