Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) for his consideration. Frankly, I did not stand up in time, we all know that, and that was my fault. But the issue that has been raised is a serious one. The gentleman is correct, we have discussed it at length. There is an emergency situation as it relates to making sure that in the year 2000 that our computers in the Federal Government whether they be FAA comptrollers or whatever else they may be, are ready to make that transition from this century to the next. The Senate has obviously tried to accommodate that and ensure that both the Defense Department and all other departments of government have sufficient resources to accomplish that objective. We believe the Senate was correct, and we would urge the House to agree with the Senate's position and so instruct the conferees.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe).  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                             General Leave
