We know some of the giants of our health care system would probably like this legislation to go through so they can make higher profits. Much of our health care system is in crisis. That is what we ought to attack.  Dramatically rising medical malpractice insurance rates are forcing some doctors to abandon their practices or to cross State lines to find more affordable situations. Patients who need care in high-risk specialties, such as obstetrics, and patients in areas already underserved by health care providers, such as many rural communities, are too often left without adequate care.  But this bill does nothing to actually reduce medical malpractice insurance rates. Of course, each State has a different experience. Insurance remains largely a State-regulated industry because the States found that is the way it works best. But each State ought to look at and be left to solve their own unique problems. We should not tell their Governors and legislatures we are not going to let them solve their own problems because we will take it over for them.  We don't have the kind of crisis in Vermont that others do. We have worked very well with our legislature, and we are still working hard to find answers, as other States have. You know, it is funny. We hear so many speeches that we want to get power out of Washington. We want States to be able to do what they want. We don't want Washington dictating everything. Well, not exactly. When you get some very wealthy contributors and very powerful PACs and say, Yes, but if you don't let Washington take care of our special interests, nobody will--suddenly it changes.  This is an attempt to tally points on some election year political scoreboard for powerful special interests at the public's expense. I am looking at the big picture.  Some States, such as my own, Vermont, while experiencing problems, do not face as great a crisis as others. Vermont's legislature is considering legislation to find the right answers for our State, and the same process is underway now in other States. In contrast, in States such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New Jersey, doctors have walked out of work in protest over the exorbitant rates being extracted from them by their insurance carriers.  Instead of letting States find solutions that are best for their citizens, the Republicans prefer this attempt to tally points on some election year political scoreboard for powerful special interests, at the public's expense. Instead of looking at the big picture--at overly broad antitrust immunity, ways to reduce medical errors, and at other real issues that could make a real difference--the majority has chosen to coddle big insurance companies instead of to cure the problem.  Instead of letting the States continue to find solutions that are best for their citizens, they would take a chainsaw to the legal rights of the American people and to the prerogatives of each of the 50 States we represent here in the United States Senate.  Thoughful solutions to the situation will require creative thinking, a genuine effort to rectify the problem, and bipartisan consensus to achieve real reform. Unfortunately, these are not the characteristics of the bill before us. Indeed, S. 2207 is a partisan bill that was introduced only a few days ago without any committee consideration.  Ignoring the central truth of this crisis--that it is a problem in the insurance industry, not the tort system--themajority has proposed a plan that would cap noneconomic damages across the Nation at $250,000 in medical malpractice cases.  The notion that such a one-size-fits-all scheme is the answer runs counter to the factual experience of the States. Most importantly, the majority's proposal does nothing to protect true victims of medical malpractice and nothing to prevent malpractice in the first place.  We are fortunate in this Nation to have many highly qualified medical professionals, and this is especially true in my own home State of Vermont. Unfortunately, good doctors sometimes make errors. It is also unfortunate that some not-so-good doctors manage to make their way into the health care system as well. While we must do all that we can to support the men and women who commit their professional lives to caring for others, we must also ensure that patients have access to adequate remedies should they receive inadequate care.  High malpractice insurance premiums are not the direct result of malpractice lawsuit verdicts. They are the result of investment decisions by the insurance companies and of business models geared toward ever-increasing profits as well as the cyclical hardening of the liability insurance market. In cases where an insurer has made a bad investment, or has experienced the same disappointments from Wall Street that so many Americans have, it should not be able to recoup its losses from the doctors it insures.  The insurance company should have to bear the burdens of its own business model, just as the other businesses in the economy do. And a nationwide arbitrary capping of awards available to victims--as the majority has proposed again and again--should not be the first and only solution turned to in a tough medical malpractice insurance market.  The problem at hand deserves thoughtful and collaborative consideration in committee to achieve a sensible solution that is fair to patients and that supports our medical professionals in their ability to practice quality health care. One aspect of the insurance industry's business model requires a legislative correction: Its blanket exemption from Federal antitrust laws. Insurers have for years--too many years--enjoyed a benefit that is novel in our marketplace. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits insurance companies to operate without being subject to most of the Federal antitrust laws, and our Nation's physicians and their patients have been the worse off for it.  Using their exemption, insurers can collude to set rates, resulting in higher premiums than true competition would achieve--and because of this exemption, enforcement officials cannot investigate any such collusion. If Congress is serious about controlling rising premiums, we must objectively limit this overly broad exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  More than a year ago, I introduced the ``Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2003,'' S. 352. I want to thank Senators Reid, Kennedy, Durbin, Edwards, Rockefeller, Feingold, Boxer and Corzine for cosponsoring this essential and straightforward legislation.  Our bill modifies the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to medical malpractice insurance, and only for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations. Only those anticompetitive practices that most certainly will affect premiums are addressed. I am hard-pressed to imagine that anyone could object to a prohibition on insurance carriers' fixing prices or dividing territories. After all, the rest of our Nation's industries manage either to abide by these laws or pay the consequences.  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within the power they are accorded in their own laws, and some States have antitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive activities in the insurance industry. Our legislation is a scalpel, not a chainsaw. It would not affect regulation of insurance by State insurance commissioners and other State regulators. But there is no reason to continue, unexamined, a system in which the Federal enforcers are precluded from prosecuting the most harmful antitrust violations just because they are committed by insurance companies.  Our legislation is a carefully tailored solution to one critical aspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance rates. I had hoped for quick action by the Judiciary Committee and then by the full Senate to ensure that this important step on the road to genuine reform is taken before too much more damage is done to the physicians of this country and to the patients they care for. But our legislation to narrow this loophole in the Nation's anti-trust laws for medical malpractice insurers has languished for more than a year in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Instead of conducting hearings and a markup on our bill, the majority now rushes a ``tort reform'' agenda item to the floor without any committee consideration.  If Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice insurance premiums, then we must limit the broad exemption to Federal antitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance industry, as well as attack this problem at its core by reducing medical errors across our health care system. Unfortunately, the partisan bill before us is not designed for creating a solution to a serious problem. Instead, it is designed purely for politics, and that is not only a waste of the Senate's time and of the public's trust; it is also a shame.  Overly broad antitrust immunity, which the insurance companies have, allows them to fix prices any way they want, whether it is justifiable or not. Antitrust immunity allows them to take their failed investments and try to make it up by charging doctors higher malpractice insurance. We ought to find ways to reduce medical errors. But the big thing is we end up coddling these insurance companies. We don't call them to task. We don't get them to say whether they are spending out this money on malpractice awards. Of course, they are not. A lot of their losses came because they speculated wrong in the stock market. Suddenly, we have to bail them out. Get rid of their antitrust immunity, something that makes no sense in today's day and age with conglomerates. Make them actually say what they base it on. You will find that they are not beginning to pay out the amounts their malpractice claims say they are.  We are fortunate in this Nation to have so many highly qualified medical professionals. This is especially true in Vermont. But you have to know sometimes good doctors make mistakes, just as sometimes a good engineer will make a mistake. But it is also unfortunate that sometimes not-so-good doctors manage to make their way into the health care system. I think we should do all we can to support the men and women who commit their professional lives to caring for others, but we also ought to have some way of responding when somebody gets highly inadequate medical attention.  When you have a case, as I said before, like the Levine case in Vermont, when you have somebody whose livelihood was playing musical instruments and they lose an arm because Wyeth Pharmaceuticals made a mistake, then there should be some way to respond. Under this legislation, they would not be able to.  The bottom line is, we have a piece of legislation that is designed to be introduced not to improve the question of medical malpractice insurance, it is designed not to make hospitals safer, it is designed not to make patients safer, it is designed not to save money. It is designed to raise money. I guarantee you after the vote on this issue, all the fundraising letters will go out: Isn't it terrible, isn't it terrible, the Senate is standing in the way of much-needed malpractice reform?  It will not say: There were some in the Senate who were willing to stand up and not let the Senate run roughshod over our State legislatures.  It will not say: There are some in the Senate who were willing to stand up and say the insurance companies are not telling the truth on this issue.  It will not say: Some in the Senate were saying the very powerful contributors to the Republican Party with their $1 million ads are wrong and somebody had to say no. It won't say that.  But what it will say is the Senate would have wasted another week and a whole lot of fundraising letters will go out.                          Judicial Nominations
