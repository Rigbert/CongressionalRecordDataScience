 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from AASHTO dated February 3, 2004 to Senator Murkowski be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Association of State Highway and Transportation            Officials,                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2004.     Hon. Lisa A. Murkowski,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murkowski: It has been brought to our      attention that motorcycle safety issues are of great concern      to you and your constituents. As you know, motorcycle      fatalities have gone up dramatically in the past several      years, rising from 2,112 fatalities in 1997 to 3,244 in 2002.      The State transportation agencies share your commitment to      addressing this public safety problem.       Motorcycle riding has special needs and concerns.      Currently, the American Association of State Highway and      Transportation Officials (AASHTO), through the National      Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), is developing      guidance for the State transportation departments on      motorcycle issues as part of the implementation of our      Strategic Highway Safety Plan. Part of this multi-million-     dollar research effort is focused on improving motorcycle      safety and increasing motorcycle awareness. Targeted areas in      which I understand you may share a strong interest include:       Increasing the awareness of motorcycles on the road through      a ``share-the-road with motorcycles'' campaign and stressing      the importance of motorcycle awareness information in driver      training courses, driver handbooks or manuals, and licensing      tests;       Expanding comprehensive motorcycle rider education and      skill testing in all States for novice riders; and       Reducing drinking and driving by motorcyclists through      alcohol awareness messages and targeted enforcement.       As part of this effort, a workshop is being planned for      June 2004 to identify strategies that can be used to reduce      motorcycle fatalities and injuries. You and/or your      constituents are welcome to participate in, and contribute      to, this workshop. The result of this research project will      be the development of a guide for highway officials on      practices than can improve safety for motorcyclists      throughout the transportation system.       Also as part of the implementation of our Strategic Highway      Safety Plan, ASSHTO has committed to the creation of a joint      task force to identify hazards/areas of concern to      motorcyclists, as well as highway practices that can help      minimize these concerns. Examples include the longitudinal      expansion joints on bridges, the slickness of material used      to fill asphalt pavement cracks, and the safety of various      types of guardrail including traditional steel W-beam      guardrail and the newer cable barriers. This joint task force      will consist of members from the State transportation      departments, the American Motorcyclist Association, the      Motorcycle Riders Foundation, the National Highway Traffic      Safety Administration, and the Federal Highway      Administration. Additional input may also be sought from      other noted experts in the areas of motorcycle and highway      safety both here and abroad. The information developed by      this special committee will be used as input into the      revision and update of the various AASHTO manuals and guides.       We are very pleased that you have an interest in this area      and we are committed to working with you over the next year      to ensure that these issues are addressed and that the      resulting recommendations are successfully implemented.      Please contact my office at (202) 624-5800 if you have any      questions regarding this information.           Sincerely,                                                  John C. Horsley,                                               Executive Director.
