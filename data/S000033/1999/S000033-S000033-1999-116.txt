 Speaker, it has always seemed to me that the major crisis that we face as a country is not that we do not know the answers to the most serious problems that we face but rather, for a variety of reasons, we refuse to ask the right questions.  As the only independent in the Congress, I want to raise some issues that are usually ignored by most of my Democratic colleagues and most of my Republican colleagues and are often ignored by the mass media, as well.  Let me start off with one question that I think is the most important of all; and that is, why is it that tens and tens of millions of people in our country, most especially the young people, are giving up on the political process? Why is it that virtually every day we become a less and less democratic and participatory society? Why is it that in the last election, in November of 1998, only 36 percent of the American people bothered to vote, which was the lowest turnout that we have had in many years? And this compares, as my colleagues know, Mr. Speaker, with the recent election that took place in Israel, where 90 percent of the eligible people voted, compared to 36 percent in the United States.  It is not uncommon in Canada, in Europe, in Scandinavia to have elections in which 70 or 80 or 90 percent of eligible voters participate.  Why is that? Why is that that so many people say, ``oh, democracy, oh, voting, oh, participating in the political system, do not be silly. I would not think of doing that.''  Now, as bad as the general situation is, as bad as a 36-percent voter turnout is, what is even worse and more frightening is that, in the last election, if my colleagues can believe it, only 18 percent of the young people under 24 years of age voted. That means 82 percent of people 24 years of age or younger did not vote. And that in itself is a very serious situation.  But what is even more frightening is that we know that, by and large, if people do not vote and participate when they are young, they are much less likely to vote as they age. So that means that, everything being equal, as low as our voter turnout is right now, it is likely that in years to come it will become even lower.  Now, not only is the voter turnout among young people distressingly low, but what is also very frightening is that polls indicate that young people know very little about the politicalprocess. There was a poll recently done by the National Association of Secretaries of State, and what they discovered when they asked young people three questions. They said, very hard question, ``Can you name the vice president of the United States?'' Pretty hard question. ``Can you name the governor of your States?'' Pretty hard question. And lastly they said, ``How long is a congressional term?'' ``How long do Members of Congress serve?''  Those are not very hard questions. Those are questions that we would hope that kids in the sixth grade would know. And yet, three-quarters of the young people 24 years of age and younger were unable to answer that question.  Poll after poll shows not only that young people but people of all ages have very little understanding of what our budget is about, of how appropriations are made, of how they can participate in the political process.  I go to many, many schools in the State of Vermont because I think it is important for a Member of Congress to do that. What we find is that people in Vermont, young people, and people all over this country, they know the rules of basketball. They know that when you throw a ball through a hoop you make two points. They know all about football. You score six points when you make a touchdown, one point an extra point, two points if you throw a pass. They know all about that. Field hockey. They know hockey. They know all of these things.  And yet they say, ``Tell me something, young people. Are you concerned about the high cost of college?'' And young people say, ``Oh, yeah. Twenty, thirty thousand dollars. My family cannot afford that.'' And then you say to them, ``Okay. From a democratic political perspective, how do you change that? How do you make your voice heard? How do you make sure that the Federal Government helps middle class and working families better able to go to college and to pay for college tuition?'' ``Gee, I do not know. I have not got a clue. How do you do that? We do not know how to do that.''  Well, the reason is, if young people came together on this issue and they said to the United States Congress, ``get your priorities right, put more money into Pell grants, put more money into higher education so that middle class and working families can afford to get to college, and if you do not do that, Members of Congress, we are not going to vote for you,'' and that if a few million young people said, ``you know what,'' just like that suddenly Members of Congress would wake up and say, ``Oh, golly gee. College education is very expensive. We are going to deal with that. Maybe we are going to cut back on corporate welfare. Maybe we are going to cut back on tax breaks for the rich.''  But that is not going to happen unless young people participate in the political process. So the first point that I want to make is that I consider the most serious problem facing this country is the growing alienation of the American people and especially the young people from politics and government. And not only does that alienation mean that working people and young people are going to be less able to achieve their goals through the political process, it means something else.  In my view, it is an insult to the men and women who have put their lives on the line defending American democracy that people are not utilizing our democratic system. Clearly, we are not going to have a democratic system if people do not utilize it and participate in it. And if ordinary folks, if working people, if low-income people, if young people do not participate in the political process, who do you think is going to fill the gap?  The answer is quite clear. The people who have the money. The people who have the power want nothing more than for the American people and for working people and young people and elderly people, they want those people not to participate in the political process. Why is that? Well, because then their money can have an even greater impact over the political process than it has right now.  Today we have the outrageous situation that the wealthiest one-quarter of one percent of the American population makes 80 percent of the campaign contributions. And then we combine that with the fact that only 36 percent of the people vote and we end up with a Congress that does exactly what this Congress does, and that is to represent the interests of the wealthy and the powerful.  It seems to me, if young people are serious about education, what do they think education is? It means learning how to participate, learning how to use their ideas to make this country and their community and this world a little bit better place. So they are cheating themselves and they are demeaning the education that they have received if they are not participating.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that I am being joined this evening by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). I am proud that I chaired the Progressive Caucus here in Congress, which now has some 55 members, for 8 years. I am delighted that the gentleman from Oregon is now chair of the Progressive Caucus, and he has been a valiant fighter for working people and the elderly and people who do not make the $50,000 contributions to both political parties. I am delighted that the gentleman is with us this evening.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, just to expand on the point of my colleague. I think it is a statistic the American people need to pay attention to. It is one-quarter of one percent. One-quarter of one percent of the people in America gave more than $200 to a political campaign last year and yet constituted 80 percent of the contributions.  So who do we think are in the Republican leader's office when the decisions are being made on tax relief or reforming Social Security or on whether or not we are going to have HMO reform that gives patients rights? Guess what, the insurance company executives are in the office, not the patients, not the people who desperately need access to health care and cannot get it because their HMO is more interested in profits than in their health care. Guess who is in those offices when we are talking about tax reform?  Now, we could do some tax reform around here that would benefit the majority of the working people in America. In fact, I have introduced some legislation to reform Social Security that would vouchsafe Social Security for 75 years, certified by the board of trustees, and it would give tax relief to 95 percent of the wage earning Americans in this country.  It is simple. Right now we pay Social Security tax on the first $72,600 of income. After that, we do not pay Social Security tax. If we earn a million dollars a year, our tax rate under Social Security is less than one percent. If we earn $15,000 a year, our tax rate on Social Security, which is part of the FICA, is six percent. We make six times more out of a meager income on which we cannot make ends meet.                              {time}  1830  So if we just lifted the cap and said, fair is fair, all these people want to talk about a flat tax, well, let us make Social Security a flat tax on all income, not a regressive, super-regressive flat tax which is only on the first $72,600 of income. That would vouchsafe Social Security into the indefinite future. But you can also use some of that money to give a $4,000 exemption from FICA tax. Forty percent or 45 percent of Americans pay more in taxes to Social Security than they pay in income taxes. Ninety-five percent of Americans would benefit under that system. Everybody who earned less than $76,000 a year would get a tax break. But guess what? The same people are sitting in the leaders of the office of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Republican leader's office when I talk about a progressive Social Security reform, something to make this vital program safe, and saying, ``You better worry about your campaign contributions here if you raise my taxes.'' They want to tax the little people, and they want tax relief at the top.  It is time to change this system. But it is not going to change, as the gentleman from Vermont pointed out, until more people who have more on the line choose to vote, and that is the majority of the American people, who are losing under the current system. Often I give speeches like this on the floor and I have had colleagues andfriends from the Republican side of the aisle say, ``You're talking about class warfare. We don't want class warfare around here.'' That is what they say. That is not the truth. What they want is they want to continue the current class warfare, which is winning warfare against middle-income and working families and the poor in America to the advantage of that one-half of 1 percent at the top. That is what they want to perpetuate. They do not want to talk about it. They do not want the truth out there. It goes to so many issues. It goes to Social Security reform. It could be progressive. It goes to trade. I hope the gentleman does not mind if I switch to trade for a moment.
