President, Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans are an important part of America. Like other ethnic and religious groups, they and their ancestors came to this country seeking political freedom and economic opportunity. They have flourished, making great contributions to our society every day. They arearmed service-members, law enforcement officers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, and businesspeople. They are leaders in American society, including members of Congress and Cabinet members.  Tragically, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, some misguided bigots turned against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, singling them out as targets for violence and threats of violence. Hate crimes against these communities, including violent physical assaults, sharply increased. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that the number of anti-Muslim incidents rose 1600 percent from 2000 to 2001, largely due to this post-9/11 backlash.  In response, countless Americans came to the support of Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans, condemning the attacks and embracing the affected communities. At that time, I submitted a resolution, which was unanimously approved, condemning bigotry and violence against Sikh Americans.  Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans are suffering again, and it is again time to express our support for them. Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, hate crimes against these communities have spiked. For example, a man who law enforcement believe was motivated by anti-Arab sentiment allegedly shot four people to death in New York City during February and March. President Bush has declared that major combat operations in Iraq have ended, but hate crimes against Arab Americans, Muslims, South-Asian Americans, and Sikhs continue. For example, at the University of California Los Angeles, someone recently poured pig's blood on Muslim prayer rugs in an interdenominational chapel. The FBI is investigating the incident as a bias-motivated crime.  Hate crimes against these communities are wrong and un-American. We must condemn them in the strongest terms, and law enforcement must investigate and prosecute vigorously the perpetrators.  Sadly, Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South-Asian Americans are also increasingly concerned that the Federal Government views them with suspicion, and that they are being subjected to heightened government scrutiny as a result of their national origin or religion. Our counterterrorism efforts must not discriminate on the basis of national origin or religion or violate the civil liberties of innocent Americans. The government's efforts to combat terrorism must focus on criminal or terrorist behavior, not ethnicity or creed.  I believe that discriminatory counterterrorism tactics, or those that violate civil liberties, are not only wrong, but they do not make our country any safer. Our country's history demonstrates that respect for individual rights enhances our stability and security. Singling out a large group of mostly innocent Arabs, Muslims and South Asians squanders precious law enforcement resources and alienates communities whose cooperation we need. It runs counter to basic principles of community policing, which reject the use of racial and ethnic profiles and focus on building trust and respect by working cooperatively with community members.  The resolution I submit today recognizes that Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, and South Asian Americans, greatly contribute to American society and serve honorably in the military or law enforcement, urges respect for civil rights and civil liberties, condemns bias-motivated crimes against members of these communities, and calls upon Federal and local law enforcement to prosecute such crimes vigorously. I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
