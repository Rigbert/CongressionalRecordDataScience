President, ``Show me your papers.'' Those are words that you should never hear once inside the United States. Unless a government agent has a legitimate reason to stop and search you--a reasonable suspicion or probable cause--Americans should not be subject to questioning and detention for merely going about their daily lives. This is a fundamental tenet of the Fourth Amendment. Yet Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations are effectively immune from the Fourth Amendment within a broadly defined ``border zone.''  And this so-called border zone need not be near the border at all: Seventy-year-old regulations define it as up to 100 miles from any border, land or sea. According to the CBP, southern Vermont is in the border zone, as is the entire State of Florida, and even Richmond, Virginia. In fact two-thirds of the entire U.S. population is in the border zone.  In Vermont, under the Trump administration, the border zone has resulted in highway checkpoints and bus boardings. In May, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents set up the first highway checkpoint in a decade. The checkpoint was set up miles from the Canadian border in South Hero, Vermont. It was in operation for hours. We do not know how many hundreds of cars were stopped, but we do know that it did not lead to a single arrest or seizure. Last month, the CBP established a second checkpoint in the same location. This time nearly 900 cars were stopped, and only one individual was detained--for a visa overstay. Border Patrol agents have also boarded Amtrak trains in White River Junction and boarded a Greyhound bus at the Burlington airport, demanding to know whether passengers were citizens.  Today, I am joining with Senator Murray in reintroducing the Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act of 2019. Our legislation would establish critical privacy protections by reducing the unjustifiably large border zone from 100 miles to 25 miles.  I find it difficult to believe that these checkpoints are an effective use of law enforcement resources. Border Patrol stations in Vermont are already stretched thin, And just last month the Senate passed a bipartisan $4.6 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill to address the humanitarian crisis on the southern border. The Department of Homeland Security's limited resources should be focused on improving conditions of detention and providing food, appropriate shelter, and medical care to families fleeing violence and dire poverty, not conducting pointless vehicle checkpoints miles from the northern border in Vermont.  The Border Zone Reasonableness Restoration Act is based on an amendment that Senator Murray and I successfully attached to comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2013. The 100 mile ``border zone''--and the similar 25 mile zone where many types of warrantless property searches are permitted--predates this current administration, but the actions of this administration have shown just how much we need it. That bill passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote of 68 to 32.  Americans' right to privacy does not end simply because you are within 100 miles from our land and sea borders. I hope all members of Congress will join us and support this commonsense legislation to ensure that every person in this country receives the constitutional protections to which they are entitled.                                 ______                                       By
