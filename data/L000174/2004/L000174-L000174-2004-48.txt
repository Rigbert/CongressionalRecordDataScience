President, back in June the Senate took a strong step to support intellectual property on the Internet by updating the Government's most important tool in the fight against piracy: its enforcement authority. Unfortunately, the Bush administration, which likes to talk a good game, is apparently not interested in having the tools it needs to do the job. This administration has done nothing, as far as I know, to help enact important intellectual property legislation. As a consequence, congressional Republicans are holding up and resisting important legislation.  The Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act, S. 2237, allows United States Attorneys' Offices to bring a civil action against a large-scale copyright infringer. For some unimaginable reason, the Justice Department, which cannot issue enough press releases about its newly-minted Intellectual Property Task Force, has taken no interest in or action on this legislation. Apparently, the Ashcroft Justice Department rejects having the law enforcement authority to stop large-scale infringers and protect America's intellectual property from piracy. A Justice Department that has reinterpreted treaties and contorted the law to claim vast and unfettered authorities for this executive has little interest in assembling legislatively enacted tools for copyright protection and to stop piracy.  For a number of reasons having to do with law enforcement priorities, resources and other considerations, prosecutors rarely decide to bring criminal charges even against flagrant infringers. I have encouraged the Department to be more aggressive both internationally and here at home and have praised them when they have acted against infringers. I have worked hard to provide additional resources to our international efforts.  The PIRATE Act is another important effort in this fight. It provides alternative civil enforcement, authority. When a U.S. Attorney's Office sees a need for enforcement, but determines that a criminal case is not justified, the PIRATE Act would afford the Government a civil law route and civil law remedies. There are times when civil proceedings and remedies are more appropriate. Until we enact the PIRATE Act, they are unavailable. Presently, very few criminal cases are brought and no civil cases can be brought by the Government for these violations of Federal law. When you consider that the copyright industry employs over 11 million people in the United States, hamstringing the Federal Government by limiting it to criminal enforcement is unthinkable.  The Justice Department has appropriately refocused many resources of the FBI and the Criminal Division on preventing and investigating terrorism cases, leaving even fewer resources for protecting the intellectual property that is such a critical economic engine in this country. The PIRATE Act will enable other resources, outside the Criminal Division of the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney's Offices, to help protect intellectual property. This bill removes legal obstacles to the Justice Department's effective use of the resources it has at its disposal to fight piracy. The Attorney General should be fighting for this initiative. Unfortunately, the Bush administration and its Attorney General are missing in action.  The logic of the PIRATE Act and the reasoned approach it takes to Government enforcement of intellectual property rights is compelling. Consider that during this divisive session of Congress in which partisanship was pervasive, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate passed the PIRATE Act without a single dissenting voice.  I urge the Bush administration to get with the program. If you want to talk the talk and pretend to support the protection of intellectual property rights, then walk the walk and work to clear the Republican opposition so that Congress can enact the PIRATE Act. Then use that authority as appropriate to help end the theft of intellectual property that is an enormous drag on our economy and so unfair to the artists who created the works by which others illegally profit.  The Ashcroft Justice Department issued a veto threat to the SAFE Act before a single hearing and before any markup of that legislative proposal. The PIRATE Act has passed the Senate and we still await the first word from the Justice Department providing its views on this legislation. The lack of support for enactment of civil enforcement tools by the Department of Justice is most revealing.                          ____________________
