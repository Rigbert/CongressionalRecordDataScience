 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the deficit reduction bill. I remind my colleagues that we will have a full week ahead considering this measure, and we will complete action on it this week. Senators should anticipate long days with many votes. I ask Senators to plan their schedules accordingly and to work with the bill managers in offering amendments to this bill.  As a reminder, the Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2 p.m. to accommodate the weekly policy luncheons.                          ____________________
