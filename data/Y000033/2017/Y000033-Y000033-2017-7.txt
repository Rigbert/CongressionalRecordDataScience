You know, I rarely do this, but I'm deeply disappointed in my good lady from Washington. * * *  This was a preserve, and we were guaranteed this in the Alaska National Lands Act. No more. No more. And the State, under the Constitution, has the right to manage fish and game.  Now, I know your side doesn't believe in State's rights. You don't; I do. My job is to protect my State, not your State--my State.  And what you said a while ago was really nonsense. It was written by an interest group, not yourself. Maybeyour staff is affiliated with the Humane Society or some other group, and I'm disappointed.  My Native people support this amendment. You talk about natives. Alaskans, our first Americans, support this amendment. And I really am disturbed. * * *  I am still talking.
