President, this was very frustrating to me. I asked a key question, and I could not get a straight answer. It also demonstrates many of the problems associated with employer mandates.  I believe the sponsor of this amendment is completely sincere. I want to make that clear. But this issue has become yet another sad example of election-year politics. I believe a good compromise could have been reached and should have been worked out. For example, in Maine, State law requiring contraception coverage includes a specific exemption for religious employers, such as churches, schools, and hospitals. Surely we could have reached a similar accommodation. Unfortunately, what we are left with is another example of the political pandering that has so tested Americans' patience.  Since I could not and did not receive a straightforward answer to my question about protecting self-insured faith-based organizations, I feel that I have to vote for Senator Blunt's amendment, with the hope that its scope will be further narrowed and refined as the legislative process proceeds.  Critics of the Blunt amendment have charged that employers could use it as an excuse to deny coverage for services simply as a means to reduce their insurance costs. As Senator Blunt, however, has pointed out, the amendment includes specific language to require that the overall cost of the coverage remains the same even though an employer excludes certain services because of their religious beliefs. As a consequence, under this amendment, employers would have no incentive to exclude coverage of items or services simply because of financial considerations.  Mr. President, while I plan to support the amendment, I do so with serious reservations because I think the amendment does have its flaws. But when the administration cannot even assure me that self-insured faith-based organizations' religious freedoms are protected, I feel I have no choice.  I hope that the Senate will now be able to move forward to address the many important and pressing issues facing our Nation such as job creation, energy and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2012.     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Sebelius: Like many Americans, I was very      concerned when, on January 20, 2012, the Department of Health      and Human Services issued a final regulation to require      religious universities, hospitals, charities and other faith-     based organizations to pay for health insurance that covers      contraceptives and sterilizations regardless of the      organization's religious objections. I believe that such a      broad mandate poses a threat to our religious freedom and      presents the Catholic church and other faith-based      organizations with an impossible choice between violating      their religious beliefs or violating federal regulations.       I was somewhat reassured when, on February 10, the      President announced an ``accommodation'' that would require      insurance companies rather than religious organizations to      provide these services. According to the White House      statement, ``religious organizations will not have to provide      contraceptive coverage or refer their employees to      organizations that provide contraception,'' and ``religious      organizations will not be required to subsidize the cost of      contraception.''       While the President has announced some changes in how the      new preventive coverage mandate will be administered, many of      the details remain unclear. A very important issue is how the      rule would treat self-insured faith-based institutions. For      example, there are many Catholic hospitals that are self-     insured, and therefore act as both the employer and the      insurer. The final rule simply states that the ``Departments      intend to develop policies to achieve the same goals for      self-insured group health plans sponsored by non-exempted,      non-profit religious organizations with religious objections      to contraceptive coverage.''       I would therefore like further specific clarification of      how self-insured faith-based organizations will be treated      under the rule to ensure that their rights of conscience are      protected.       Thank you for your prompt assistance on this important      issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Susan M. Collins,     United States Senator.                                  ____                                           The Secretary of Health                                           and Human Services,                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter regarding      the August 2011 Guidelines on Women's Preventive Services. On      February 15, 2012, related final rules were published      exempting group health plans sponsored by certain religious      employers (and any associated group health insurance      coverage) from any requirement to cover contraceptive      services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act      and corresponding provisions in the Employee Retirement      Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code, and      related guidance.       As you know, in August 2011, the Health Resources and      Services Administration (HRSA) published Guidelines that      operate to require non-grandfathered health plans to cover      certain preventive services for women, including Food and      Drug Administration-approved contraceptive services, without      charging a co-pay, co-insurance, or a deductible. HRSA based      the Guidelines on recommendations from the Institute of      Medicine, which relied on independent physicians, nurses,      scientists, and other experts, as well as evidence-based      research, to formulate its recommendations. Evidence shows      the use of contraceptives has significant health benefits for      women and their families, significantly reducing health costs      for women and society.       With the Departments of Labor and the Treasury, the      Department of Health and Human Services also published in      August     2011 an amendment to the July 2010 Preventive Services      Interim Final Rules authorizing an exemption for certain      religious employers' health plans from any requirement to      cover contraceptive services. Twenty-eight states already      require health insurance coverage to cover contraception, and      the exemption in the amendment to the Interim Final Rules was      modeled on one adopted by some of these states. After      considering the many comments received in response to the      amendment to the Interim Final Rules, the Departments      published final rules on February 15, 2012, retaining the      exemption.       At the same time, we released guidance providing a one-year      enforcement safe harbor for group health plans sponsored by      certain nonprofit employers that, for religious reasons, do      not provide contraceptive coverage and do not qualify for the      exemption (and any associated group health insurance      coverage). Such nonprofit employers could include religious      universities, hospitals, and charities.       In his recent announcement related to these issues, the      President committed to rulemaking to ensure access to these      important preventive services in fully insured and self-     insured group health plans while further accommodating      religious organizations' beliefs. We are engaging in a      collaborative process with affected stakeholders including      religiously affiliated employers, insurers, plan      administrators, faith-based organizations, and women's      organizations as we develop policies in this area. Our      preliminary discussions with a number of religiously      affiliated employers and faith based organizations have been      very productive. And, of course, the future rulemaking      process will afford a full opportunity for public input.       The Administration remains fully committed to its      partnerships with faith-based organizations to promote      healthy communities and serve the common good.       Again, thank you for your letter. I appreciate your input      on this matter.           Sincerely,                                                Kathleen Sebelius.
