 President, today I pay tribute to James B. Grimmer, a business pioneer in Birmingham, AL, and a dedicated community leader and family man. He was responsible for developing over thirty shopping centers throughout the Southeast, which helped to spur business and economic development in the region. Mr. Grimmer died in Birmingham on March 12 at the age of 81. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the life ofa man who brought opportunity to many in the Southeast and lived a life committed to family, friends and community.  James Grimmer was born on March 23, 1920 and raised in East Lake, AL. He attended Ramsay High School and graduated from Woodlawn High in Birmingham. Upon finishing high school and unable to join the armed forces due to age restrictions, James joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1937 before he turned eighteen. However, with America's imminent entrance into World War II, James dutifully returned to the United States to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He eventually retired from the military as a Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Air Force.  After the war, James embarked on a long and stellar career in real estate development. In 1955, he joined the firm of Moulton, Allen & Williams. It was with this firm that he developed the Eastwood Mall, which was the Southeast's first enclosed mall. It had such a positive impact on the community that other developers soon followed James' lead and established numerous shopping centers in the Birmingham area. This led to new jobs, economic growth and was instrumental in Birmingham's expansion during the fifties and sixties. In 1962, James decided to build on his success and founded the Grimmer Realty Company. With his new independence, James went on to develop numerous other malls, including: the Western Hills Mall, the Montgomery Mall, Quintard Mall in Oxford, AL, and Jackson Mall in Jackson, MS. In fact, James Grimmer developed over eight and a half million square feet of retail space throughout the Southeast.  James was also closely involved with the Birmingham community and had close ties to real estate developers around the nation. He enjoyed scouting, golfing and fishing with family and friends, and was a member of the Independent Presbyterian Church. He was a member of the International Council of Shopping Centers, The Club, Summit Club; Vestavia Country Club and the New York Real Estate Board.  It is with sincere respect that I pay tribute to James Grimmer. He will be remembered as a pioneering businessman not only in the Birmingham community but the entire Southeastern region. He will be missed by the community as well as by his many close friends and relatives. My thoughts and prayers extend to his wife, Rose, children, Park and Susan, grandchildren, Leslie, Shelly and Jamie, and his sister, Evelyn Williams.                          ____________________
