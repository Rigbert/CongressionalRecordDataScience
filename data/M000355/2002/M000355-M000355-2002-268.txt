 President, I was listening to what he said. I do not know if the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has left the Chamber or not. I think the Senator said also it prevents people from being wrongfully removed from a list. I hope the Senator from New York, who obviously is concerned about the broader franchise, listened carefully to what the Senator from Arizona had to say: that it would also prevent wrongful removal. Did I hear that correctly?
