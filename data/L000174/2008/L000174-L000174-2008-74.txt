President, I am pleased that the Senate will unanimously pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, H.R. 923, a bipartisan bill to provide critical tools and resources for the Department of Justice and FBI to expeditiously investigate and prosecute decades-old unsolved civil rights cold case crimes.  This bill overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives last year and unanimously passed the Senate on two previous occasions, in the 108th and 109th Congresses. Its consideration in the Senate has been needlessly delayed due to a Republican objection. Finally, this bipartisan legislation will be sent to the President.  This legislation includes the Missing Child Cold Case Review Act, a critical measure which I sponsored last Congress. It allows inspectors general of Federal law enforcement agencies to authorize staff to provide much needed assistance to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children--NCMEC--inactive case files. In order to bolster their efforts to solve these heart-wrenching cases, NCMEC needs the assistance and the cooperation of inspectors general. I am pleased that this legislation will help the men and women at NCMEC carry out this important mission.
