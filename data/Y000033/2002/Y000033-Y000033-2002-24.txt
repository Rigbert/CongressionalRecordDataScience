Reclaiming my time, it has been fixed with this letter, which I include for the Record.         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 2002.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportion and Infrastructure,          Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: OMB has reviewed section 137 of Public      Law 107-240, Making Further Continuing Appropriations for      Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, which passed the House on October 11,      2002. The enactment of section 137 will have no impact on the      level of highway jobs or the level of highway spending for      states.       The effect of section 137 is to retain the FY 2002 rate of      operations for the Federal aid highway program at $31.8      billion for the duration of the continuing resolution by      requiring OMB to apportion funds at an annualized rate of      $31.8 billion during that period. As of today, OMB has      apportioned funds in accordance with section 137.       Much confusion has surrounded the language in section 137      that limits total annual obligations for this program while      operating under continuing resolutions to no more than $27.7      billion. This provision, as many of the terms of the current      resolution, is subject to section 107(c) of P.L. 107-229,      which establishes the date of expiration of the continuing      resolution. H.J. Res. 122 sets that date of expiration at      October 18, 2002. Consequently, it is mathematically      impossible for the highway program, spending at an annualized      rate of $31,8 billion, to reach the $27.7 billion cap on      total obligations prior to mid-August 2003, well beyond the      expiration date of this or any other continuing resolution      that is expected in the future.       Therefore, the effect of section 137 is to provide that the      highway program continue at the FY 2002 enacted level of      $31.8 billion until the final FY 2003 funding level is      determined in the context of House, Senate and Administration      negotiations of the FY 2003 Transportation Appropriations      bill.           Sincerely,                                         Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.,                                                         Director.
