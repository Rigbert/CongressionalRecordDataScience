 President, I wish to clarify where we are right now. It is my understanding in the unanimous consent agreement with respect to morning business that the next 15 minutes belongs to the Republican side; that Senator DeMint has 10 minutes reserved of that time, and then the remaining 5 minutes of that time can be accorded however the Republican side wishes to do; and that the majority leader is coming back on the floor at 11:30 a.m.
