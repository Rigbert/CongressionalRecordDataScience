 President, I want to take 1 minute to get the attention of my colleagues on an argument that was made last night, and hopefully not many were here.  That was this suggestion that my friend from Louisiana made that a Senator could go out every night for a whole year and rack up $18,000 in bills under this amendment. That is technically true. Of course, as the Senator from Louisiana pointed out, it is technically true that under the alternative Members could rack up $7,000 in bills.  The point I want Members to know is that anybody who did that would have a serious case before the Ethics Committee. The fact that it might not be a technical violation of the rule does not mean that it is proper conduct. It would be clearly improper conduct.  Some of the major cases that we have had here in the Senate in the last few years have not been technical violations of the rules. They still have been major cases. That was the case in the Keating case. It is the case with some of the charges against the Senator from Oregon--not technical violations of the rules, but still a very serious case.  I want Members to know that anybody who tried to exploit this rule, in this way, would be in very, very, serious trouble.
