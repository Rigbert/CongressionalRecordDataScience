Mr. Chairman, let me thank my friend for yielding to me.  As the gentleman knows, the days and years roll by and more money continues to flow into Washington, hundreds, thousands, millions of dollars into campaigns, into political parties, and the Speaker of the House, the Speaker of the House, of the people's House, continues to say that it is not that it is too much money, it is not enough. He wants more money, unlimited amounts, to come into the House, into campaigns and to political parties.  Our present system is polluting the political process. It stinks. This is not the way to conduct the people's business, with hundreds, thousands and millions of dollars coming in. And the Speaker refuses to do anything; refuses to allow us to have a vote, a debate on campaign finance reform.  It is time, I think, my colleagues, that we say to the Speaker, ``How long will you wait?'' This is not in keeping with the democratic process. Let us have a vote. Let us have a clean debate on campaign finance reform. That must take place if we are going to restore a sense of faith and trust and confidence in the democratic process in America.
