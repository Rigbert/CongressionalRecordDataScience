President, I am honored to share a Vermont community's tribute to the stout hearts and brave souls of the service men and women serving overseas.  This year, in recognition of Vermont's largest military deployment since World War II, the townspeople ofClarendon, VT, sought a way to show their support for Americans stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the town's elementary school, 39 children of the ages of 7 to 10 recorded a song called ``Box of Kisses'' for our troops in the National Guard. With the help of two local musicians, James Mee and Michael Mugrage, the students of Clarendon Elementary School devoted their lunch and recess time to this project. Students also spent their free time handcrafting more than 500 paper boxes filled with brief personal messages and pieces of candy as tokens of their thanks for the sacrifices being made by these Vermonters serving abroad.  Although Box of Kisses is being sent to hundreds of soldiers, this community's project is a highly personal act for many families in Clarendon. Within this school community of only 198 students, 12 people have family members serving in Afghanistan. Marcelle and I are so proud of and grateful for our Nation's servicemembers and their families. So are Vermonters in every community throughout our State, who are showing support for our soldiers' families in ways small and large every day--by mowing lawns, babysitting, shoveling sidewalks, and through many other small kindnesses. Clarendon's story is another example of why I am proud to be a Vermonter.  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record an article, published in the Rutland Herald, in which reporter Cristina Kumka tells this heartening story from Clarendon.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, July 14, 2010]      Love in a Box: Vermont Residents Send Kisses to Afghanistan                          (By Cristina Kumka)       All it took was one small Vermont community and one song to      connect troops overseas with home.       Shortly after Vermont's largest military deployment since      World War II occurred this January, residents of Clarendon      and students from the town's elementary school wanted to do      something for 10 families in their community with loved ones      sent off to battle in Iraq and Afghanistan.       Children in grades 2-6, some of whom with mothers or      fathers serving overseas, recorded a song by Rutland musician      James Mee and fellow artist Michael Mugrage called ``Box of      Kisses'' and made 200 CDs.       Then they crafted boxes using simple white paper and      crayons and filled each one with a note and red, white and      blue candy donated by the Vermont Country Store.       The children wrote what they knew--a simple ``thank you,''      ``I love you'' or other thought--to remind 500 troops      individually what their purpose there was and how much their      sacrifice meant to the children.       Most of the project was documented--the song posted on      Internet and aired on public access television and student      fundraisers for materials and support filmed on DVDs.       The CDs and the boxes are in the process of being airlifted      or parachuted in to troops in populated or desolate areas of      the Middle East until each gift is gone.       What began as simple gestures intended to remind troops of      home has caught the attention of Americans across the      country.       Mee said that in all in his 30 years in the music industry      no other tune or project has drawn so much attention.       On Tuesday, Mee said he's been contacted by a major candy      company looking to invest in the children's idea, a top music      industry professional from New York and a Texas-based radio      station serving a million military personnel and other      listeners in more than 177 countries.       ``I feel like I'm in a Disney movie,'' Mee said.       The song he originally created 10 years ago as a love      ballad with the lyrics, ``When you're far from home, Feeling      like you're all alone, Don't be afraid . . . cause you're      always with us, When you open up your box of kisses,'' has      never been so popular.       But the exposure is mere icing on a larger cake, Mee said.       ``The kids are singing their hearts out, many who skipped      recess and lunch, and there's something about that,'' Mee      said. ``No matter how skeptical and cynical you may be, kids      singing like that just melts your heart.''       Clarendon's Maria Stephan is hand-delivering one of the      boxes and a copy of the song to First Sgt. Francisco Herrera,      for his three children. Two of his children, Abigail and      D.J., attend Clarendon Elementary School and were key members      of the volunteer project.       The project was a way for them to keep their dad close to      home even when he's away.       Stephan, a strategic planner with the Office of the      Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization who directly      reports to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said the      troops need reminders of home and America needs a reminder of      them.       ``People (some troops) have a sense when they come back      that it's a forgotten war,'' Stephan said.       ``With the whole McChrystal (former Gen. Stanley      McChrystal) thing . . . sometimes the dangerous stuff gets      forgotten,'' she said. ``It's nice to know people do care.''                          ____________________
