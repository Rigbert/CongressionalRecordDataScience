President, this will be set aside in a moment. First, I wish to note that my amendment is simply to make sure that if people have appeals on actions under this law, they be able to appeal in the courts within their jurisdictions and not have to trundle their way to Washington, DC. Too many people think Washington has the answers to everything.  My amendment simply says it is a States rights issue. It says the appeals will be in courts within their districts. That is a simple explanation. I spoke earlier on the floor, and I will speak more when the amendment comes up.
