President, I would like at this time to pay my respects to FBI Special Agent John Joseph Truslow. John Truslow, an FBI agent stationed in Providence, was more than ``just an agent.'' He was a brave man, a Rhode Islander who cherished his home state and served its people with courage and distinction.  John grew up in Central Falls, Rhode Island and attended the University of Rhode Island, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1972 and a master's degree in 1978. In 1980, he joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York, where he was assigned for eleven years.  In 1991, John Truslow transferred back home to Rhode Island, with his wife, Diane, and their two children, Catherine and David.  During the next nine years with the Bureau, John Truslow distinguished himself by leading several federal probes that attacked corruption in our cities and towns.  In 1996, when the North Cape barge ran aground at Moonstone Beach, spilling over 800,000 gallons of home heating oil into Narragansett Bay and killing millions of fish and wildlife, John Truslow was hard at work. Throughout that year and the next, he led a methodical investigation, which uncovered the corporate negligence that contributed to the disaster. Because of his work, a groundbreaking agreement was reached in which the owner of the North Cape agreed to pay $9.5 million in criminal damages. Today, despite one of the worst environmental accidents in Rhode Island's history, Narragansett Bay is recovering, due, large part, to the work of Mr. Truslow.  Described by friends and co-workers as a man of substance and a man of honor, John continued to report to work each day, even after having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in August 1999. In fact, on April 5, one day after his twentieth anniversary with the FBI and after months of being physically ravaged by cancer and the effects of chemotherapy, John testified before a federal grand jury to present evidence which lead to the indictment on bankruptcy fraud charges of a Rhode Island traffic court judge. Twelve days later, on April 17, he was in court for that indictment.  John was a dedicated agent, working up until his final days. We are humbled by his courage, allegiance to duty andhis perseverance in the face of adversity. He served with honor and distinction, for the people of his home state of Rhode Island as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Unfortunately, John lost his battle with cancer on May 5. To his family, I offer my sincerest condolences.  I need not tell them that they can be proud of John; they already know that. But, I would like them to know what John's work meant to so many in our state. He made a difference in our criminal justice system and has left a lasting impression on friends, co-workers and colleagues in law enforcement.  While he is gone, John's legacy of duty and courage lives on, and his record of service to his country and Rhode Island will not soon be forgotten.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Providence Journal-Bulletin on the life of Mr. Truslow be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, May 14, 2000]        Remembering a Man Who Had the Courage of His Convictions                (By Mike Stanton; Journal Staff Writer)       Despite the ravages of brain cancer, FBI agent John      Truslow, whose cases included the North Cape oil spill and      Operation Plunder Dome, worked up until the final days of his      life.                                  ____       When two dozen FBI agents prepared to raid Providence City      Hall last spring, a lanky, bespectacled agent named John      Truslow was put in charge.       ``We specifically chose him because we wanted someone who      was low-key and decisive,'' recalls Daniel Knight, the head      agent in Providence.       Later that afternoon, while top federal prosecutors and FBI      officials held a news conference to announce Operation      Plunder Dome, Truslow was back in his familiar post behind      the scenes, poring through the arcane documents and tedious      tax records that would help the government build criminal      cases against corrupt Providence officials.       If John Truslow toiled in obscurity, his efforts were not      in vain. He worked on some of the most prominent criminal      cases in Rhode Island over the past decade from public      corruption in Johnston to criminal negligence in the 1996      North Cape oil spill to the ongoing corruption probe of the      administration of Providence Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr.       Truslow kept working even after he was diagnosed with      terminal brain cancer last year.       As the cancer ravaged his body and the chemotherapy failed      to arrest the disease's advance, Truslow would say that he      was ``on top of the world'' and keep showing up for work.       Although his gait was unsteady and he was unable to drive,      Trusklow was still on the job in April, putting in a nine-     hour day as a federal grand jury indicted retired Rhode      Island traffic-court judge John F. Lallo on fraud-related      charges after an 18-month investigation.       On May 5, Truslow died, with his wife of nearly 22 years,      Dianne, and their daughter Catherine and son David nearby. He      was 50.       ``John would never, ever give up,'' says his friend and      colleague, Special Agent W. Dennis Aiken. ``He wasn't given a      lot of time by the doctors, but he had things that he wanted      to finish. He met every goal he set.''       That sense of purpose was evident at Truslow's wake last      Monday, a celebration of his life that drew an overflow crowd      of friends, family and colleagues from throughout the      Northeast.       Patting his friend's hand, Aiken talked about Truslow's      love of his family and his job, and vowed that his work would      continue:       ``There's still a lot of people we need to put in jail.''       EVEN AT 6-FOOT-5, John J. Truslow was a man who, with his      crumpled raincoat and mild personality, ``could easily fade      into the background,'' says friend and federal prosecutor Ira      Belkin.       ``He was all substance, no show,'' says Belkin. ``No task      was too small or too big. If I had 10 John Truslows, there      would be no crime in Rhode Island.''       Truslow grew up in Central Falls, one of four children. His      father worked for a local gas company; his mother worked in a      mill.       As a student at the University of Rhode Island in the early      1970s, Truslow met a high-ranking FBI official the father of      a classmate and ``became fascinated with the bureau,''      recalls his wife, Dianne L. Truslow.       The FBI official told him that there were two paths to      becoming an agent accounting or law school. Truslow chose      accounting.       He joined the bureau in 1980, in New York, and within a few      years began specializing in white-collar crime. In 1991, he      transferred to Rhode Island, moving to East Greenwich.       Before long, Truslow was leading a federal corruption probe      of the Town of Johnston, involving bribes by developers to      town officials.       One official was charged with demanding a $10,000 bribe,      which he described as ``coffee money.'' Ultimately, eight      people were convicted. Long-time Johnston Mayor Ralph aRusso,      who wasn't charged, was voted out of office.       ``The people in Johnston Town Hall hated to see him,''      recalls Dianne Truslow. ``He knew their records better than      they did.''       Other Johnstonians cheered him on. One was Rosie Cioe,      proprietor of the downtown Providence deli Amenities, where      Truslow would stop in every morning for a cranberry muffin.       ``John kept my hopes up that Johnston would turn itself      around,'' she recalls. ``I'd say, `You're doing a hell of a      job, John. Keep going.' He'd just smile.''       Peter DiBiase, a Providence criminal-defense lawyer who      represented people investigated by Truslow, calls him ``a      worthy adversary and an honorable man.''       ``He played hard and he played fairly,'' recalls DiBiase.      ``He's the most diligent FBI agent I ever met.''       ON JAN. 19, 1996, the tug Scandia caught fire in a storm      and ran aground at Moonstone Beach with the barge North Cape,      causing the worse oil spill in Rhode Island history.       Truslow led a team of state and federal investigators in      piecing together hundreds of boxes of ship records and      interviewing crew members who had concealed problems with the      boats.       The result was a groundbreaking 1997 agreement in which the      boat owner, Eklo Marine Corp., agreed to pay $9.5 million in      damages.       ``Some agents are good with paper and some are good with      people there aren't many agents like John who are good with      both,'' says Belkin.       Truslow had a patient, methodical style of interviewing      that broke down many a target into confessing criminal      wrongdoing, associates say. In one fraud case, Belkin      recalls, a suspect being questioned by Truslow raised his      hand and, to the dismay of his lawyer, said, ``Guilty.''       Last Aug. 11, while delivering subpoenas to Newport,      Truslow suffered a seizure and blacked out, crashing his car      into a tree in Middletown. He came to in an ambulance.       Hospital tests found seven tumors in his brain and three      more in his lungs. Following 10 days of radiation treatment,      doctors at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston found      that the tumors had grown. Last October, they estimated that      he had six months to live.       ``We were beside ourselves,'' recalls Dianne Truslow. ``We      sat there and wept.''       Agents continued to drive Truslow to Boston for treatment.      His hair fell out, his body grew gaunt, and he suffered      painful side effects from the chemotherapy. Still, he kept      working. His job helped distract him from the cancer, and the      cancer drove him to push hard to finish cases.       Truslow worked on a Plunder Dome case involving lawyer and      long-time State House insider Angelo ``Jerry'' Mosca Jr. In      January, Mosca pleaded guilty to delivering $25,000 in bribes      to city tax officials; one of the bribes involves allegations      that $10,000 was intended for an unidentified high-ranking      city executive.       Truslow also sat at the table with a federal prosecutor in      March, when Providence tax collector Anthony E. Annarino      pleaded guilty to taking bribes in another Plunder Dome case.       Truslow's wife says that he set milestones to keep himself      going: his 50th birthday in November, which was marked by a      surprise party attended by about 75 FBI agents and other      friends; Christmas, his children's birthdays, his 20th      anniversary with the FBI.       On April 5, the day after marking his 20th anniversary,      Truslow was back before a federal grand jury, presenting      evidence that led to the indictment of former Rhode Island      traffic-court judge John Lallo on bankruptcy fraud charges.       In the preceding months, Truslow had continued to build the      case, interviewing witnesses at Foxwoods casino in      Connecticut, where Lallo had piled up gambling debts.       On April 17, Truslow appeared in court for Lallo's      arraignment. One week later, on April 24, he came to work for      the last time. After a few hours, however, it became apparent      that he had taken a turn for the worse: he struggled to speak      in complete sentences, and had to be taken home.       He died nearly two weeks later. On Thursday, Truslow's wife      and children, following his wishes, scattered his ashes from      an airplane over a favorite spot overlooking Narragansett      Bay.       Dianne Truslow recalls her husband's pride back on April 4,      when he was honored for his 20 years of service in the FBI.      Barry W. Mawn, the head of the FBI's Boston office, hailed      Truslow as ``a profile in courage.''       As the 200 people there wept openly, a sobbing Truslow      thanked them.       ``I don't know how much longer I have,'' said Truslow,      ``but I will continue to work every day and do my best.''                          ____________________
