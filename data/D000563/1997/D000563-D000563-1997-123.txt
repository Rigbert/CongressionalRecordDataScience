President, I rise today in order to engage the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, in a brief colloquy regarding the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation--Metra. I commend both Senators Shelby and Lautenberg for their tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's transportation systems. And I congratulate them on bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr. President, as Senator Shelby knows, Metra is the second largest commuter rail system in the country, carrying over 270,000 riders a day. Metra's 12 rail lines serve more than 100 towns and municipalities with 238 stations and a stop at O'Hare International Airport. It maintains a 97 percent on time performance while operating over 500 route miles. In short, Metra is an effective, first-class transit system that fills an enormous commuter need in the Northern Illinois/Chicago region.  Metra anticipates that by the year 2020, the population of its service territory will grow by 25 percent and employment in that area will increase 37 percent. In order to prepare for this growth and meet additional needs, Metra plans to expand and upgrade service on three lines. Specifically, Metra plans to upgrade and expand North Central Service and the Metra Milwaukee West Line; upgrade and extend the South West Service to Manhattan, Illinois; and upgrade and extend the Union Pacific line to LaFox and Elburn, IL. The total cost of this project is $301 million over 6 years.  The House included $5 million in the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill for engineering and design on tracks, signals, bridges, and earthwork associated with this project.  Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Shelby if he considers Metra to be a priority new start transit project and if he and Senator Lautenberg would be willing to work to include the House language in conference.
