President, I wish to compliment the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana for his parting words about our colleague. I agree with him. It will come as no surprise that there are those on this side of the aisle, like myself, who also will miss Dan Coats and who are most impressed by the way that he and his distinguished colleague work together.                          ____________________
