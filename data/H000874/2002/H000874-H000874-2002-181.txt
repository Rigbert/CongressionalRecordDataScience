Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I did not know this resolution or this bill was on the floor, but the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) mentioned the Helsinki Commission. I had the opportunity to co-chair the Helsinki Commission. I chaired the House side while Senator D'Amato chaired the Senate side of the Helsinki Commission for a number of years.  I rise simply to observe that Al D'Amato was, of course, a vigorous partisan and proponent of his party, but at the same time, he was a supporter of making sure that we did the business in the Senate and the House in a way that did credit to America and to its principles.  I say that because he was the Chair of the Helsinki Commission when the Senate was taken over by the Republicans in the 1980s; specifically, in 1985 and 1986. There was a real effort, frankly, to change a nonpartisan professional staff to a staff that reflected party affiliation more than professional ability.  Senator D'Amato, as I said, was chair of the Commission. Because it goes between the House and Senate, it was the Senate's opportunity. Senator D'Amato, I know, received many suggestions about changes in staff. The staff to this day remains a professional staff, unrelated to partisan politics, serving not only this country's interests but the interests of so many citizens around the world who look to the Helsinki Commission to raise issues of human rights and political rights. For that alone, I would have great respect for Senator D'Amato.  I wanted to make that observation, that he saved, frankly, the Helsinki Commission's professional staff from being politicized at a time when that could very well have happened.  I am pleased to rise in support of the legislation, Mr. Speaker.
