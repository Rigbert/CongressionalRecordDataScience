Mr. Speaker, as we reach the end of the first 100 days of the session, it is fitting that the grand finale of the Contract With America honors our senior citizens by easing the burdens older Americans now face.  For instance, the comprehensive tax bill, which we approved by a substantial margin yesterday evening, includes a substantial reduction in the Social Security earnings test, which unfairly penalizes seniors for working to supplement their Social Security benefits.  If the November elections taught us anything it was that the American people want to see their fellow citizens begin to take more responsibility for their personal circumstances. Many seniors want to do just that, but have been hindered from doing so by the Social Security earnings test.  The earnings test was instituted during the Great Depression when the Federal Government wanted to encourage older Americans from remaining in the national work force and occupying much-needed jobs. Despite the fact that this provision is clearly obsolete, it continues to be an unfair penalty to industrious seniors.  Essentially, seniors who earn more than $11,280 a year face a supplemental tax of 33 percent on that income. This is in addition to the 7.65-percent FICA withholding tax and a 15-percent Federal income tax, bringing a hard-working, low-income senior's tax burden up to nearly 56 percent.  How many times have we all heard from constituents who acknowledge that they cannot survive on the meager Social Security benefits they are due? We cannot earnestly encourage these people to work to supplement these benefits while simultaneously taxing them at a highly unfair rate.  Furthermore, the earnings test deprives the American workplace of the talents and knowledge of our most experienced laborers.  The Contract With America, through H.R. 1215, increases the threshold at which the earnings test kicks in to $30,000 in annual income over a 5-year period.  While this does not represent perfect resolution on this issue, it is a step toward equity in the workforce. In fact, I would encourage my colleagues to continue to work toward a full repeal of the earnings test, such as that represented by Representative Howard Coble's H.R. 201, of which I am a cosponsor.  In addition, the tax relief bill includes a full repeal of the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits over a 5-year transitional period. In the mid-eighties, Congress instituted a tax on 50 percent of the Social Security benefits received by seniors earning $25,000 as individuals or $32,000 as couples.  Many of you voted against this tax--as I did--recognizing it as a double taxation on seniors who had taken the initiative to plan and save for their retirement. However, instead of repealing this unfair and counter-productive tax, President Clinton pushed through Congress in the first months of his administration--and over the vote of every House and Senate Republican, I might add--an increase in this tax.  The Clinton tax package allowed 85 percent of the Social Security benefits received by seniors making only $34,000 per year to be counted as taxable income. This runs entirely contrary to the pact between the Federal Government and seniors which the Social Security program is supposed to represent.  Seniors involuntarily turned over portions of their hard-earned paychecks to the Federal Government as a safety net for their retirement. They should not be taxed on this meager nest egg when they most need it and when many of them are living on fixed incomes.  I immediately introduced legislation to repeal the Clinton Social Security tax, but it was unfortunately stonewalled. I am very pleased that the Republican Contract With America includes a full repeal of President Clinton's unfair tax and that we have had the opportunity to relieve seniors of this burden.  The tax cut bill also makes great strides toward improving the provision of long-term care for seniors. Specifically, the bill provides a $500 non-refundable eldercare tax credit to families caring for a dependent senior in their home.  Currently, 12.5 percent of our Nation's population is aged 65 and older. By the year 2030, when baby boomers peak in their golden years, fully one-fifth of our population will be in this age bracket. Already, American families nationwide have been faced with the difficult decision of how to best care for an aging parent or relative within their financial means. As society ages, more and more families will face this dilemma.  Many aging adults, particularly those suffering from Alzheimer's and other dementia, cannot lead a quality life without assistance and constant care. Often the full-time attention and individualized care these men and women require can only be found in a nursing home facility or in the privacy of their family home.  Providing the care at home can be costly and time-consuming. However, this sort of personalized care is preferable to many families, especially since it affords a terrific opportunity to solidify the family unit. Children can learn so much from the knowledge and experiences of their grandparents. And having a loving family around does a world of good for an ailing senior.  Last year, the Alzheimer's Association reported that more than one-half of all working Americans have either provided long-term care for their friends or relatives or believe that it is likely in the near-future. The Contract With America's eldercare tax credit will go a long way to help these well-intentioned people meet the needs of their loved ones.  The tax cut bill includes other improvements in the long-term care market as well to make it easier for seniors and their families to purchase long-term care insurance. In 1990, seniors aged 65 and older faced a 43 percent lifetime risk of requiring nursing home care. By 1992, the cost of such care was approximately $30,000 per year.  Too frequently, seniors are caught between a rock and a hard place as they get older and need this more constant medical attention. Private long-term care insurance as it currently exists is often too costly to be comfortably within reach and Medicaid assistance is only available if they spend down their savings.  This measure provides seniors and their families with the financial incentives they need to save for quality long-term care. For instance, it: First, gives long-term care insurance the same preferable tax treatment as accident and health insurance, second, excludes up to $200 per day in long-term care benefits from taxable income, third, excludes employer-provided long-term care coverage from taxable income, fourth, allows long-term care expenses to be treated equal to medical expenses as an itemized tax deduction, fifth, excludes withdrawals from IRAs and other pension plans for the purchase of long-term care [[Page E834]] insurance from tax penalties, and sixth, allows the accelerated payment of death benefits from life insurance for the terminally or chronically ill to be paid tax-free.  These are common-sense approaches to a problem faced by more and more families every day and they are long overdue.  Finally, the tax relief bill increases the current estate and gift tax exemption over a 3-year period of time from $600,000 to $750,000. Through this modest change, seniors will be able to pass along their family business or family farm to their children and grandchildren without passing along an unmanageable tax burden as well.  In addition to these pro-senior provisions in the tax cut bill, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 660--which I am cosponsoring--to ensure that seniors will not be unfairly discriminated against for living in senior housing communities. These communities allow seniors to live amongst their peers and often provide access to services of particular need to seniors--such as periodic blood pressure screenings by local medical personnel.  Despite their increasing popularity amongst the senior population, vague language in the Fair Housing Act has left these communities vulnerable to litigation claiming that they discriminate against younger families. Furthermore, proposed HUD interpretations of this language have placed an insurmountable financial burden on these communities, requiring extravagant services and facilities to quality for Fair Housing Act exemptions.  The language of H.R. 600 clarifies the definition of an ``adult-only'' housing community as a residential area consisting of a population of at least 80 percent seniors aged 55 and older. With this clarification, seniors will be able to form neighborhoods which conform to the unique needs of their retirement years without fear of unfair litigation or retribution.  I am proud to have supported each of these measures over my tenure in Congress and to have cosponsored them as part of the Contract With America as well. It is a credit to these past 100 days that we have soundly approved these proposals as the crowning achievement of the contract. America's seniors deserve no less.                          ____________________
