On July 29, 2010, the patrons of Northwest Indiana will come together in East Chicago to celebrate, learn, and understand one another's differences through festivities of the diverse ethnic heritage. Through the variety of Puerto Rican showcases and spotlights, people will learn the history, heritage, culture, and much more about the commonwealth.  La Presencia Puertorriquena, which embarks on its 29th celebration, is done in coordination each year with a significant event: Puerto Rico's unification to the United States through a commonwealth, which occurred on July 25, 1952. Each year, as over 5,000 people flock to line the streets of East Chicago, the initiation of Puerto Rico as a part of the United States is celebrated. With this celebration, the entire history and culture of Puerto Rico is presented to the people of Northwest Indiana for a memorable experience.  In an array of ways, families and folk who attend can share an educational and warm Puerto Rican influenced experience. During the festivities, Puerto Rican ethnic heritage is put on display. Relics, traditional instruments, drawings, paintings, and a variety of other items representative of Puerto Rican culture fill the East Chicago library. Many talented individuals find themselves performing for these festivities through music and dance. Each year, people reminisce about native regalia, delectable food, stylistic art, and the notorious island coqui, a tiny frog known throughout the island of Puerto Rico for its relentless chirping. It is an educational experience the whole family can enjoy. People are left with memories and knowledge about the culture, heritage, and diverse values of the Puerto Rico.  For the past twenty-nine years, La Presencia Puertorriquena has brought together thousands, including an assortment of local sponsors, business and civic leaders, politicians, non-profit organizations, and people of a variety of heritages to appreciate the Puerto Rican presence in Northwest Indiana and come together.  Madam Speaker, at this time, let us pay tribute to the Puerto Rican people and their influence in the Northwest Indiana area. As we celebrate the welcoming of Puerto Rico as a commonwealth, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Puerto Rican contributions and culture in the Northwest Indiana area. Their efforts in the community to educate and serve the people are to be commended.                          ____________________
