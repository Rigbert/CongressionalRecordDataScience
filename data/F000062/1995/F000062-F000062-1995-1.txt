 President, the welfare reform conference report before us today should be defeated. It should be defeated because it does not adequately address our Nation's needs and particularly the needs of my State; it endangers the Nation's children; it does not help people move from welfare to work.              Inadequate Attention to Unemployment, Growth  Compared to the bill we previously passed, this bill gives short shrift to my State's needs.  First, the Senate bill created a contingency fund of $1 billion to help States with high unemployment. This conference agreement reduces this fund to $800 million. California had an unemployment rate stood of 8.8 percent in November, while the national rate was 5.6 percent. In the last 5 years, my State's unemployment rate has never dropped below 7 percent, reaching 10 percent in 1994.  Second, the bill's underlying funding formula fails to recognize high growth rates in poverty. I offered an amendment to redistribute funds by the change in poverty population each year. The conference agreement does not rectify this problem. California's population is expected to grow from 30 million in 1990 to 42 million in 2010 and 49 million by 2020.  Third, under this bill, States will contribute less. The Senate bill required States to maintain 80 percent of their 1994 funding of cash assistance [AFDC]. Under this bill, States can drop their funding to 75 percent. Thus, they can reduce their funding by 25 percent. This would allow States to reduce State spending by $5 billion.                Protecting Neglected and Abused Children  Programs providing services to neglected and abused children are an important part of this bill. These are services that have removed children from unsafe homes, placed them in protective settings, provided periodic reviews of their status, and trained child protection staff.  Child protection services are included in a block grant and cut by $1.3 billion over 7 years. These are services like training for foster parents, child abuse emergency response, and other services that try to keep families together and protect children in foster homes.  There are at least half a million of these children in California.  From 1988 to 1993, nationally, the rate of reported child abuse and neglect rose 25 percent. The foster care caseload grew 50 percent. From 1983 to 1993, the number of children in child protection grew by two-thirds. Los Angeles last year responded to more than 165,000 reports of abused and neglected children.  This bill will weaken support for these, our most vulnerable children.                     Not Helping Mothers Be Mothers  The Senate bill allowed States to limit the work requirement to 20 hours a week for mother with children under age 6. This bill requires mothers of small children to work at least 35 hours a week.  While work requirements are appropriate for many people, mothers are the most important influence in a young child's life. Work requirements should be compatible with raising a family and guiding young children. I believe a 20-hour work week requirement for mothers with young children, rejected by this bill, is reasonable.                           No Health Coverage  The conference version, unlike the previous Senate bill, ends the guarantee of health insurance or Medicaid for women on AFDC and their children over age 13.  In California, 290,000 children and 750,000 parents would lose coverage, according to the Children's Defense Fund. This represents 18 percent of all children in the United States losing coverage.  By ending this health insurance, we will add to our State's uninsured population which is already the third highest in the Nation at 22 percent. Without health insurance or the ability to purchase it, sick people end up in hospital emergency rooms and we all pay through tax dollars or our private policies.                   Work Requirements, Resources Weak  The bill's goal, a goal I endorse, is to move welfare recipients from dependency to work. The bill requires States to have 50 percent of recipients participating in work by 2002. But the bill falls short in several ways.  First, the conference agreement, unlike the Senate bill, does not require personal responsibility contracts, agreements that obligate the recipient and move him or her toward self-sufficiency.  Second, the conference agreement deletes the Senate provision giving bonuses to States for job placements.  And third, and most importantly, the bill does not provide adequate funds for child care programs to support the requirements that States put welfare recipients into work.                               Child Care  Child care is the linchpin to self-sufficiency for mothers on welfare. The fact is that mothers cannot go to work without child care programs for their children. There are two serious problems in this bill, the first is funding and the second is standards.  Currently in California, 80 percent of eligible AFDC children are unserved. The bill before us exacerbates this already dire situation. To support the work requirements of the bill, the bill falls short from $6 billion to $13 billion.  Child care experts in California tell me that this means our State would be $1.3 billion short of what is needed to meet the increased demand caused by the work requirements of the bill.  Under current law, to qualify for Federal child care funds, States must set quality standards that address things like caregiver to child ratios, sprinkler systems, plumbing standards, hygiene.  The Senate bill retained this requirement, but the conference agreement before us eliminates it. This means that there is no guarantee that young children will be in safe and healthy environments.                          Innovative Programs  California has some of the most innovative welfare programs in the country.  We have the GAIN program--Greater Avenues for Independence--in Riverside, that has returned $2.84 to the taxpayers for every $1 spent.  In Los Angeles, the GAIN program has a job placement rate of 34 percent.   San Mateo and San Diego Counties have successful job-search programs.  San Mateo, last year, put 85 percent of the people in the program to work.  The Senate adopted my amendment to allow HHS to negotiate directly with large counties to establish innovative programs. Unfortunately, the conferees deleted this provision.                               Conclusion  No one has a right to welfare. Welfare was never intended to be a permanent way of life. It was intended to be a lifeboat for people in temporary emergency situations. In my State, there are almost 2.6 million people receiving welfare or 18 percent of the U.S. caseload in a State that has 12 percent of the population. I want to reform welfare. I want families to be secure and self-sufficient. But this bill does not do it. I cannot support it.
