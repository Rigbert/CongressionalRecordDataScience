  I ask unanimous consent the next amendments in order to be called up will be the following: Flake amendment No. 225, Graham amendment No. 329, Heller amendment No. 293, Boozman amendment No. 527, Portman amendment No. 153, and Ayotte amendment No. 136; that there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes in relation to any of these amendments, but notwithstanding all time having expired on the resolution, there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote, and that all votes be 10-minute votes; that upon the disposition of Ayotte amendment No. 136, the next amendment be an amendment from the majority.  I ask the amendments be called up en bloc.
