President, in the 104th Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to overhaul our country's outdated export rules and bring some sense to our country's encryption policy. We are back at it again in this Congress. I am pleased tointroduce with Senator Burns, and others, two encryption bills, the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act [ECPA] and Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era [PRO-CODE] Act.  This legislation bars government-mandated key recovery, or key escrow encryption, and ensures that all computer users are free to choose any encryption method to protect the privacy of their online communications and computer files. These bills also roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demands of customers--both foreign and domestic--for strong encryption.  As an avid Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individual privacy and encouraging the development of the Internet as a secure and trusted communications medium. As more Americans every year use the Internet and other computer networks to obtain critical medical services, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with their friends, maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer communications both here and abroad has only grown in importance.  Strong encryption also has an important use as a crime prevention shield, to stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computer files and stealing valuable proprietary information. We should be encouraging the use of strong encryption to prevent certain types of computer and online crime.  We made progress in the last Congress on encryption. The attention we gave to this issue in classified briefings and public hearings helped the administration recognize the need for reform. In fact, in the waning days of the last Congress, the administration took steps to adopt one element proposed in these bills by transferring export control authority for certain encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The administration also loosened export controls on 56-bit key length encryption--at least for 2 years. Although the administration is moving in the right direction by loosening some export controls, its unilateral regulatory reforms are not enough.  Even under the current regime, popular browser software, such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, may not be exported in the form generally available here, since both software packages use 128-bit encryption. Lotus Notes shareware, which uses 64-bit encryption, cannot be exported in the same version sold domestically.  We need to loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that American companies are able to export any generally available or mass market encryption products without obtaining Government approval. ECPA would allow our companies to do that.  We are mindful of the national security and law enforcement concerns that have dictated the administration's policy choices on encryption. Both bills contain important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military end-uses, or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba or North Korea. This is not enough to satisfy our national security and law enforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong encryption will undercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals, or decipher computer files containing material evidence of a crime.  Administration officials have made clear that they seek nothing less than a world-wide key recovery encryption scheme in which the U.S. Government is able to obtain decryption assistance to decipher encrypted communications and stored electronic files. I have significant concerns about the administration conditioning the export of 56-bit key encryption on companies moving forward with key recovery encryption systems. In aggressively promoting a global key recovery scheme the administration is ignoring the conclusion of the National Research Council in its thorough CRISIS report issued last year. Specifically, the report warned that ``Aggressive government promotion of escrowed encryption is not appropriate at this time.''  The administration is putting the proverbial cart-before-the-horse by promoting key recovery without having in place privacy safeguards defining how and under what circumstances law enforcement and others may get access to decryption keys. Many users have legitimate concerns about investing in and using key recovery products without clear answers on how the law enforcement here, let alone other countries, including those with bad human rights records or a history of economic espionage, will get access to their keys.  ECPA provides those answers with clear guidelines on how and when law enforcement and foreign countries may obtain decryption assistance from key holders, who are voluntarily entrusted with decryption keys or have the capability to provide decryption assistance.  It is time for Congress to take steps to put our national encryption policy on the right course. Both the PRO-CODE bill and the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act reflect a bipartisan effort to reform our nation's cryptography policy in a constructive and positive manner.  I ask unanimous consent that the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act and a section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 376       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Encrypted Communications      Privacy Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that Americans have the maximum possible      choice in encryption methods to protect the security,      confidentiality, and privacy of their lawful wire and      electronic communications and stored electronic information;      and       (2) to establish privacy standards for key holders who are      voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt such      communications and information, and procedures by which      investigative or law enforcement officers may obtain      assistance in decrypting such communications and information.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the digitization of information and the explosion in      the growth of computing and electronic networking offers      tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live,      work, and are entertained, but also raises new threats to the      privacy of American citizens and the competitiveness of      American businesses;       (2) a secure, private, and trusted national and global      information infrastructure is essential to promote economic      growth, protect privacy, and meet the needs of American      citizens and businesses;       (3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of      their communications and in the conducting of personal and      business affairs should be preserved and protected;       (4) the authority and ability of investigative and law      enforcement officers to access and decipher, in a timely      manner and as provided by law, wire and electronic      communications and stored electronic information necessary to      provide for public safety and national security should also      be preserved;       (5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal,      medical, financial, and other information to computers and      computer networks unless the security and privacy of that      information is assured;       (6) business will not entrust their proprietary and      sensitive corporate information, including information about      products, processes, customers, finances, and employees, to      computers and computer networks unless the security and      privacy of that information is assured;       (7) encryption technology can enhance the privacy,      security, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of      wire and electronic communications and stored electronic      information;       (8) encryption techniques, technology, programs, and      products are widely available worldwide;       (9) Americans should be free to use lawfully whatever      particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or      products developed in the marketplace they desire to use in      order to interact electronically worldwide in a secure,      private, and confidential manner;       (10) American companies should be free--       (A) to compete and to sell encryption technology, programs,      and products; and       (B) to exchange encryption technology, programs, and      products through the use of the Internet, as the Internet is      rapidly emerging as the preferred method of distribution of      computer software and related information;       (11) there is a need to develop a national encryption      policy that advances the development of the national and      global information infrastructure, and preserves the right to      privacy of Americans and the public safety and national      security of the United States;       (12) there is a need to clarify the legal rights and      responsibilities of key holders who are voluntarily entrusted      with the     means to decrypt wire and electronic communications and      stored electronic information;       (13) Congress and the American people have recognized the      need to balance the right to privacy and the protection of      the public safety with national security;       (14) the Constitution permits lawful electronic      surveillance by investigative or law enforcement officers and      the seizure of stored electronic information only upon      compliance with stringent standards and procedures; and       (15) there is a need to clarify the standards and      procedures by which investigative or law enforcement officers      obtain assistance from key holders who--       (A) are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt      wire and electronic communications and stored electronic      information; or       (B) have information that enables the decryption of such      communications and information.

(b) Certain Conduct.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments      made by this Act shall affect the conduct, by officers or      employees of the United States Government in accordance with      other applicable Federal law, under procedures approved by      the Attorney General, of activities intended to--       (1) intercept encrypted or other official communications of      United States executive branch entities or United States      Government contractors for communications security purposes;       (2) intercept radio communications transmitted between or      among foreign powers or agents of a foreign power as defined      by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50      U.S.C. 1801 et seq.); or       (3) access an electronic communication system used      exclusively by a foreign power or agent of a foreign power as      so defined.                                  ____         Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1997--Summary       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the      ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1997.''       Sec. 2. Purpose. The Act would ensure that Americans have      the maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect      the security, confidentiality and privacy of their lawful      wire and electronic communications and stored electronic      information. Americans are free to choose an encryption      method with a key recovery feature, in which another person,      called a ``key holder,'' is voluntarily entrusted with a      decryption key or with the means to decrypt, or has      information that would enable the decryption of, encrypted      communications or information. The Act would establish      privacy standards for the key holder, and procedures for law      enforcement officers and foreign countries to follow to      obtain assistance from the key holder in decrypting encrypted      communications and information.       Sec. 3. Findings. The Act enumerates fifteen congressional      findings, including that a secure, private and trusted      national and global information infrastructure is essential      to promote citizens' privacy and meet the needs of both      American citizens and businesses, that encryption technology      widely available worldwide can help meet those needs, that      Americans should be free to use, and American businesses free      to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and      products, and that there is a need to develop a national      encryption policy to advance the global information      infrastructure and preserve Americans' right to privacy and      the Nation's public safety and national security.       Sec. 4. Definitions. The terms ``decryption key'',      ``encryption'', ``key holder'', and ``State'' as used in the      Act are defined in section 6 of the Act.       Sec. 5. Freedom to Use Encryption.       (a) Lawful Use of Encryption. The Act legislatively      confirms current practice in the United States that any      person in this country may lawfully use any encryption      method, regardless of encryption algorithm, key length or      implementation selected.       The Act further makes clear that it is lawful under U.S.      law for by any United States persons in a foreign country to      use any encryption method. This provision is consistent with,      though broader than, the Commerce Department's license      exceptions published in the Federal Register on December 30,      1996, for temporary encryption exports that effectively      replace the Department of State's personal use exemption.      This personal use exemption that permits the export of      cryptographic products by U.S. citizens and permanent      residents who have the need to temporarily export the      cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief      periods of time. For example, under this exemption, U.S.      citizens traveling abroad are able to take their laptop      computers containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many      versions of which contain an encryption program otherwise      not exportable.       (b) Prohibition on Mandatory Key Recovery or Key Escrow      Encryption. The Act expressly bars the government from      mandating that encryption technology or products be sold in      interstate commerce with a key recovery feature.       (c) General Construction. Nothing in the Act is to be      construed to require the use of encryption, the use of      encryption with or without a key recovery feature, or the use      of a key holder if a person chooses to use encryption with a      key recovery feature.       Sec. 6. Encrypted Wire or Electronic Communications and      Stored Electronic Information. This section of the act adds a      new chapter 125, entitled ``Encrypted Wire or Electronic      Communications and Stored Electronic Information,'' to title      18 of the United States Code to establish privacy standards      for key holders and to set forth procedures that law      enforcement officers, governmental entities and foreign      countries must follow to obtain release of decryption keys or      decryption assistance from key holders.       (a) In General. New chapter 125 has six sections.       Sec. 2801.  Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the      new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap      statute, 18 U.S.C. 2510. Definitions are provided for      ``decryption key'', ``decryption assistance'', ``encryption''      and ``key holder''. A ``key holder'' is a person located      within the United States who is voluntarily entrusted by      another independent person with the means to decrypt, or who      has information that would enable the decryption of, that      person's encrypted wire or electronic communications or      stored electronic information. A key holder may, but is not      required to be, a Federal agency.       This chapter applies to wire or electronic communications      and communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18      U.S.C. 2510, and to stored electronic data. Thus, this      chapter describes procedures for law enforcement to obtain      assistance in decrypting encrypted electronic mail messages,      encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile      transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted      file transfers over the Internet that are lawfully      intercepted pursuant to a wiretap order, under 18 U.S.C.      2518, or obtained pursuant to lawful process, under 18 U.S.C.      2703, and encrypted information stored on computers that is      seized pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful process.       Sec. 2802.  Prohibited acts by key holders       (a) Unauthorized Release of Key.--Key holders will be      subject to both criminal and civil liability for the      unauthorized release of decryption keys or providing      unauthorized decryption assistance.       (b) Authorized Release of Key.--Key holders are authorized      to release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance      (1) with the consent of the key owner, (2) as may be      necessarily incident to the provision of the key holder's      service in possessing or controlling the key, or (3) to      investigative or law enforcement officers authorized to      conduct wiretaps and intercept wire or electronic      communications, governmental entities authorized to access      stored wire or electronic communications and transactional      records, and governmental entities authorized to seize or      compel production of stored electronic records, and upon      compliance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c).       (c) Requirements for Release of Decryption Key or Provision      of Decryption Assistance.--Generally decryption keys may be      released and decryption assistance provided only pursuant to      a court order issued upon a finding that the key or      assistance is necessary to decrypt communications or stored      data lawfully intercepted or seized. The standard for release      of the key or provision of decryption assistance is tied      directly to the problem at hand: the need to decrypt a      message or information that the government is otherwise      authorized to intercept or obtain. This will ensure that key      holders need respond to only one type of compulsory process--     a court order. Moreover, this Act will set a single standard      for law enforcement, removing any extra burden on law      enforcement to demonstrate, for example, probable cause for      two separate orders (i.e., for the encrypted communications      or information and for decryption assistance) and possibly      before two different judges (i.e., the judge issuing the      order for the encrypted communications or information and the      judge issuing the order to the key holder).       (1) Wire and electronic communications.--To obtain access      to a decryption key or decryption assistance from a key      holder, an investigative or law enforcement officer must      present to the key holder a court order (or a certification      issued under the emergency situation procedures in 18 U.S.C.      2518(7)) issued upon a finding that the decryption key or      decryption assistance is necessary for the decryption of a      communication that the officer is authorized to intercept.      The order or certification shall specify the key or      assistance being sought and identify the termination date of      the period for which the release or assistance is authorized.      Released keys or other decryption assistance may only be      used in the manner and for the purpose and duration      expressly provided by the court order.       The Act reinforces the principle of minimization. A key      holder may only provide the minimal key release or decryption      assistance needed to access the particular communications or      information specified by court order. Under some key recovery      schemes, release of a key holder's private key--rather than      an individual session key--might provide the ability to      decrypt every communication or stored file ever encrypted by      a particular key owner, or by every user in an entire      corporation, or by every user who was ever a customer of the      key holder. The Act protects against such over broad releases      of keys by requiring the court issuing the order to find the      keys or decryption assistance being sought are necessary.       A key holder who fails to comply with the court order to      provide a decryption key or decryption assistance may be      penalized under current contempt or obstruction laws.       (2) Stored wire and electronic communications and stored      electronic information.--       (A) A key holder is authorized to release a decryption key      or provide decryption assistance to a governmental entity      when directed to do so by a court order issued upon a finding      that the key or assistance sought is necessary for the      decryption of stored wire and electronic communications and      transactional records, which a governmental entity is      authorized to obtain under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703. The notice      required to be given to subscribers or customers, under 18      U.S.C. Sec. 2703(b), shall include notice of the receipt of      the key or assistance, as the case may be, by the      governmental entity.       (B) A key holder is authorized to release a decryption key      or provide decryption assistance to a governmental entity      when directed to do so by a court order issued upon a finding      that the key or assistance sought is necessary for the      decryption of stored electronic information, which a      governmental entity is authorized to seize or for which the      governmental entity is authorized to compel production.       (C) A court order issued under either (A) or (B) must      specify the decryption key or decryption assistance being      sought, and the key holder may provide only such release or      assistance as is necessary for access to the communications,      records or information covered by the court order.       (3) Use of key.--An investigative or law enforcement      officer or governmental entity to which a decryption key has      been released may use the key only in the manner, for the      purpose and for the period expressly provided for in the      court order or certification authorizing the release and      use. At the end of the period for authorized release of      the decryption key, the investigative or law enforcement      officer or governmental entity must destroy and not retain      the key and certify this has been done to the issuing      court, if any.       (4) Nondisclosure of Release.--A key holder may not      disclose the release of a decryption key or provision of      decryption assistance unless otherwise ordered to do so by      law or legal process and then only after prior notification      to the Attorney General or principal prosecuting attorney of      a State or of a political subdivision of a State, as      appropriate.       (d) Records or Other Information Held by Key Holders.--Key      holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other      information (not including decryption keys or the contents of      communications) pertaining to key owners, except with the      owner's consent or to an investigative or law enforcement      officer, pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other lawful      process. Investigative or law enforcement officers receiving      such information are not required to notify the person to      whom such information pertains. Key holders who violate this      section are liable for civil damages as provided in      subsection (f).       (e) Criminal Penalties.--Key holders who violate this      section for a tortuous, malicious or an illegal purpose, or      for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private      commercial gain, will be subject to a fine and up to 1 year      imprisonment for a first offense, and fine and up to 2 years'      imprisonment for a second offense. Other reckless and      intentional violations would subject the key holder to a fine      of not more than $5,000 and not more than 6 months'      imprisonment.       (f) Civil Damages.--Persons aggrieved by key holder      violations may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages      or statutory damages of $5,000, whichever is greater. A civil      action must be commenced not later than 2 years after the      date on which the plaintiff first knew or should have known      of the offense.       (g) Defense.--A complete defense against any civil or      criminal action is provided if the defendant acted in good      faith reliance upon a court order, warrant, grand jury or      trial subpoena or other statutory authorization.       Sec. 2803.  Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is      required to include in his or her report to the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2519(2), the number of orders and extensions served on      key holders to obtain access to decryption keys or decryption      assistance. The Director of the Administrative Office of the      U.S. Courts is required to include this information, and the      offenses for which the orders were obtained, in the report to      Congress under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3).       Sec. 2804.  Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice       Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for      the purpose of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the      communication of information in furtherance of a federal      felony crime to a law enforcement officer, would be subject      to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first      offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or      subsequent offense.       Sec. 2805.  Freedom to sell encryption products       (a) In General.--The Act legislatively confirms that it is      lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption      algorithm, key length or implementation used, domestically in      the United States or its territories.       (b) Control of Exports by Secretary of Commerce.--     Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of      Commerce with control of exports of hardware, software and      technology for information security, including encryption for      both communications and other stored data, except when the      hardware, software or technology is specifically designed or      modified for military use. Under the Act, the Secretary must      grant export license exceptions to computer software,      computer hardware and technology with encryption capabilities      if the Secretary determines that a product with comparable      security is commercially available from a foreign supplier      without effective restrictions, is generally available in a      foreign country, or if the product employs encryption from a      foreign source that otherwise would be the sole basis for      restriction.       The Secretary of Commerce would be required to grant a      license exception for the export of computer software with      encryption capabilities that is generally available,      including mass market products (i.e., those generally      available, sold ``as is'', and designed for installation by      the purchaser) or in the public domain and generally      accessible. For example, no license would be required for      encryption products commercially available without      restriction and sold ``as is'', such as Netscape's      commercially available World Wide Web Browser with strong      encryption, which can not be exported. Similarly, a license      exception would be granted to export encryption software      placed in the public domain and generally accessible, such as      Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy program, which has been      distributed to the public free of charge via the Internet.       The Secretary of Commerce would also be required to grant a      license exception for the export of computer hardware that      would otherwise be restricted solely on the basis that it      incorporates computer software with encryption capabilities      described above, or so-called ``crypto-ready'' computer      software or hardware incorporating an interface mechanism for      interaction with encryption hardware or software. Finally,      the Secretary     of Commerce would be required to grant a license exception      for the export of encryption technology related or      ancillary to the items described above, to enable American      companies to license their technology for production, use      and sale abroad.       Significantly, the government is authorized to continue      export controls on countries that pose terrorism concerns,      such as Libya, Syria and Iran, or other embargoed countries,      such as Cuba and North Korea, pursuant to the Trading With      the Enemy Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers      Act.     Sec. 2806.  Requirements for release of decryption key or          provision of decryption assistance to a foreign country       The Act bars investigative or law enforcement officers and      key holders from releasing a decryption key or providing      decryption assistance to a foreign country except when      certain conditions are satisfied. First, the foreign country      must have entered into a treaty or convention to provide      mutual assistance with respect to decryption. Second, the      foreign country must make a formal request to the United      States for such assistance. Third, the Attorney General or      the Attorney General's designee must obtain an order from the      district court in which the key holder resides directing the      key holder to release the decryption key or provide      decryption assistance. Finally, the order may only be issued      if the judge finds that (1) the decryption key or decryption      assistance being sought is necessary for the decryption of a      communication or information that the foreign country is      authorized to intercept or seize pursuant to its own domestic      law; (2) the law of the foreign country provides adequate      protection against the arbitrary interference of privacy      rights; and (3) the decryption key or decryption assistance      being sought is in connection with a criminal investigation      for conduct that would constitute a violation of a criminal      law of the United States if committed within the jurisdiction      of the United States.       The grounds for issuance of the court order ensure that a      U.S. court will examine the quality of legal protections in      place in the foreign country on whose behalf of request for      decryption assistance is made and that the United States does      not facilitate the provision of decryption assistance to      legal system that do not meet minimum international human      rights standards or in cases that would violate American      constitutional standards.       (b) Technical Amendment.--The Act adds new chapter 125 and      the new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the      United States Code.       Sec. 6. Intelligence Activities.--The Act does not      authorize the conduct of intelligence activities, nor affect      the conduct by Federal government officers or employees in      intercepting (1) encrypted or other official communications      of Federal executive branch or Federal contractors for      communications security purposes; (2) radio communications      between or among foreign powers or agents, as defined by the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or (3)      electronic communication systems used exclusively by foreign      powers or agents, as defined by FISA.                                 ______                                       By
