 President, on October 20th, a significant event took place that I am afraid was lost in the crush of events. Deputy Sheriff Keith Flink was recognized by the National Order of Benevolent Elks' Drug Awareness Program and the Drug Enforcement Administration with the first ever Enrique Camarena Award. His efforts to educate the young people of Iowa deserve to be highlighted.  The Enrique Camarena Award honors law enforcement officials who perform above and beyond the call of duty in drug enforcement. Enrique Camarena was a DEA agent who was kidnaped, tortured, and murdered by drug traffickers while working undercover in March of 1985. Agent Camerena believed that one person could make a difference.  The memory of his sacrifice made for his country has been memorialized through the celebration of National Red Ribbon Week, and now through the National Enrique Camarena Award that was established by the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. The award was established to recognize and honor an individual who has made a significant contribution in the field of drug prevention and who personifies Agent Camarena's belief that one person can make a difference.  Last fall, Deputy Sheriff Keith D. Flink from Odebolt, IA, was the winner of the first Enrique Camarena Award. Deputy Sheriff Flink has spent over 30 years working in law enforcement, and working with young people to teach them the dangers of drugs and alcohol, mostly on his own time. I think the time and commitment that Deputy Sheriff Flink has given to his community is best reflected in a letter his children sent the Award Selection Committee. I would like to have printed the full text of the letter in the Record following this statement, and add my praise to theirs for the hard work their father has done in Sac County.  It is important that each of us remembers that it is the activities of people like Deputy Sheriff Flink that really make a difference. The people of Odebolt, the citizens of Sac County, are aware of this. The Elks recognized the value of his contributions by giving him this award. And we, as a nation, should always remember that while the ``big things'' that was as a country stand for are important, it is the everyday activities that make a difference. We should never forget, never become too busy to recognize the accomplishments of everyday heros like Deputy Sheriff Keith Flink.  The letter follows:                                                  October 1, 1999.     Enrique Camarina Award Selection Committee.       Dear Selection Committee: My brothers and I heard our      father, Keith Flink, has been nominated for the Enrique      Camarina Award. After hearing this, we wanted his dedication      and achievements to be known. He has achieved many great      things in life by doing tasks above and beyond what is      expected. He is so concerned with the safety of all people      that he has no problem teaching about ``the war on drugs''      while not on duty. There are so many times he will work the      night shift, sleep for 3 or 4 hours, and get up to give a      presentation on his own time. He does this with no complaints      because it is very important to him to get everyone to ``say      no to drugs''! He has also done a lot of research to give      great, effective presentations to the citizens in the area.      As you can see, he is very dedicated to his job on and off      duty!       Our father has taught us a lot about life. While growing      up, we always saw him practicing what he truly believed. He      still does this through all the volunteering he does for the      safety of the community. He is a true leader by the work that      he does and the positive example that he sets for society.       My brothers and I are very proud of our father and would be      honored if he was the recipient of the Enrique Camarina      Award. He definitely deserves it!       Thank you for your time.           Sincerely,     Jeana Boyd,     Justin Flink,     Jory Flink.                          ____________________
