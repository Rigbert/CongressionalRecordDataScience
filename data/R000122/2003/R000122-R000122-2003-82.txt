President, I join Senator Collins in urging the adoption of an amendment that would add $300 million to the LIHEAP contingency fund. This fund will be available in cases of severe weather or severe economic circumstances during this heating season and next year's cooling season. We already know that residential natural gas prices are scheduled to rise at least 15 percent. We also understand poor economic times may force more people into requirements to need this program. This is a vital program. This contingency fund would be necessary so that States could meet the needs of heating for seniors, for a whole range of people who need heat and need cooling in the summertime in a hot climate. I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. The underlying bill does have $2 billion for the basic grant program, but without this contingency funding, we will not have the flexibility to respond to spikes in heating costs or in economic downturns in different parts of the country.  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Maine.
