President, today joined by colleague Senator Fitzgerald, I am introducing a bill that will make two temporary federal judgeships in Illinois permanent. The Southern District of Illinois, and the Central District of Illinois each have 3 permanent judgeships and one temporary judgeship.  The Judicial Improvement Act of 1990 created these temporary judgeships to respond to a sharply increasing caseload, especially in the area of drug related crimes. President Bush appointed Judge Joe Billy McDade to fill the temporary judgeship in the Central District of Illinois and he was confirmed by the Senate in November of 1991. In September of 1992 the Senate confirmed another Bush nominee, Judge J.Phil Gilbert to fill the temporary judgeship in the Southern District of Illinois.  In 1997, Congress extended the temporary judgeships until 10 years after the confirmation of the judge appointed to fill the vacancy. As a result, the temporary judgeship in the Central District is due to expire in November of 2001 and the temporary judgeship in the Southern District will expire in September of 2002. Since the judges that serve in these positions are Article III judges with lifetime appointments, they will not be affected, but the next vacancy within each district after the expiration date will not be filled.  The Central District and the Southern District of Illinois are small courts and the loss of even one judgeship will have a dramatic impact on the caseload of the remaining judges. The statistics on this issue are compelling.  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts keeps statistics on the average amount of time that it takes a civil case to come to trial. Even with 4 judgeships, the Central District of Illinois has a substantial wait for civil litigants--24 months, which is five months longer than the national average. In the Southern District of Illinois, the numbers are equally convincing--22 months on average for a civil case to go to trial, which is three months longer than the national average.  If these courts lose one judgeship, which is the equivalent of 25% of their judges, justice for federal court litigants will be substantially delayed. This delay will be felt most by civil litigants because judges will give priority to criminal cases. At a time when Congress is seeking to expand Federal court jurisdiction, a loss of judgeships, even temporary ones is a step in the wrong direction.  Again, the numbers tell the story. Assuming court filings remain at the 1998 level, the number of cases per judge in the Central District would increase by 33% from 383 to 511. In the Southern District, the remaining judges would be expected to take on an extra 135 cases a year, an increase of 33% from 406 cases per judge to 541 cases per judge.  The two temporary judgeships in the Central and Southern Districts of Illinois must be converted into permanent positions. This measure will prevent judicial overload and ensure the continued smooth functioning of the federal court system in Illinois.  Our independent judiciary is the envy of the rest of the world. The strength of our judiciary is a unique and distinctive characteristic of our government. We must ensure that our courts have the judges they need to perform their vital functions.  I encourage my colleagues to support me in this effort and ask that the Senate consider this bill without further delay.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1583       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
