Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend and colleague from the State of Georgia for those kind words and for his brilliant statement. He is a native of the State of Alabama. We both left the State of Alabama and moved to Georgia and now we both represent the State of Georgia in the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I think tonight we have tried to say why we marched from Selma to Montgomery 30 years ago and why we come tonight to commemorate, to celebrate the great progress we have made as a Nation and as a people down that road toward a truly interracial democracy.
