 President, I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey, who has given us such a compelling reason to remind all of us why we are here at almost midnight and why we all intend to keep talking and keep working and keep trying to convince one more Senator to say no to this nominee. He reminds us of the basic principle in this country that our forefathers dreamed of and that they put into our Constitution and that we have fought for, which is that every child should have dignity and every child should have a public education. That is why it is so important that we have someone who leads this agency who shares that conviction. I really want to thank Senator Booker for his tremendous words tonight.  As the ranking member on this committee, who has been here throughout the Friday debate and through the 12 hours of debate we have had tonight and we will continue to have up until the vote tomorrow, I have had the opportunity to hear many Senators speak passionately. Senator Tester was here on Friday. He is from a very rural State, and he was speaking about how important it is to not have funds robbed away from the public education systems in those small little school districts to go to students with vouchers for private schools that don't exist in those rural communities. He talked about the importance of our public schools and our public school institutions in a slightly different way than the Senator from New Jersey did. He talked about how, when his grandparents settled in Montana, instead of being ranchers like those before them, they were wheat farmers. There were cattlemen and wheat farmers who were fighting and at odds with each other in the community, and where they came together was in their schools, because both cattlemen's kids and ranchers' kids were in the same school, and they played basketball together, and it healed the wounds of that community.  The Senator from New Jersey just talked about the Office of Civil Rights and why it is so important--that no matter what we look like or what this country stands for, this country says you have a right to an education. It is in our public schools where kids from all strata and all economic lives, with different backgrounds and different colors and different religions and different thoughts come together and heal our communities.  That is what is at risk with this nominee, and that is why so many Senators on our side have said: To one more Republican Senator, send this nomination back to the President who campaigned saying: Let's heal this Nation; let's bring people together; send us a nominee who actually does that.  Again, I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey and all of the Senators who have been here to speak about how important it is to have a public education.  I wouldn't be in the Senate tonight without a public education. I come from a family of nine, and my father, who was a World War II veteran, got sick when I was in junior high. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. My mom had been at home taking care of seven kids. She didn't have a job. She didn't have skills. We didn't know what was going to happen to us. But we had a public education system that was there for us. Our country was there for us with a public education system--not with a voucher that said you can go to a private school that we couldn't afford even with it or to be able to get one, but a public education school in our community that gave the education to each one of those kids in my family--all seven of us. Then it allowed us to go on to college with Pell grants and student loans, because our government was there for us, even though my dad was sick and my mom had to stay home and take care of him. We had food stamps for a while, and it was tough, but we made it because this country had a commitment to public education for every student, no matter where you lived or where you came from or what challenges you had at home.  That is why I am here in the Senate, and that is why many of us are here in the Senate. It is why this nominee has sparked such an interest across this country. Like many Senators--I think, like all Senators--my office has been inundated with mail and phone calls and emails and rallies and people saying: Please, stop this nominee, and send us someone who can actually work for all of us, because education is a critical piece for each one of us. It is across the country.  I want to share some of the letters that I have received about this nominee. I have received 48,000 pieces of mail opposed to Mrs. DeVos; the number of pro-DeVos emails and letters is in the teens. I have 48,000 pieces, and they are all personal. These aren't rote emails and letters; these are personal pleas. Why and how? Because these people saw this nominee at this hearing, and their expectations for our education system in this country are high. They want someone leading the Department of Education who knows the issues, who believes in public education. They were appalled at what they heard, and they said no.  Mrs. Mary Ann Whittaker, a woman from Longview, WA, a small rural community:       Dear Senator Murray,       As an educator of 30 years and a mother who has helped to      raise and educate five children, I was shocked and dismayed      by the lack of knowledge and depth of understanding that Ms.      DeVos has about education. Our education system needs a      leader who can be a true leader in this arena, with the      background and backbone to do what is in the best interest of      the children of this great country--please do everything in      your power to make sure this woman is not allowed to gain      this position. Thank you--on behalf of thousands of children      and educators in the state of Washington!!  I heard from Joel Puchtler of Seattle, WA. He said:       Please do everything in your power to stop DeVos from      becoming Secretary of Education. She is transparently      incompetent, and will be destructive to the nation's      education system through both intent and ineptitude. Demand a      competent appointee from the president-elect.       I am an educator. My wife is an educator. My grandfather      was the first Commissioner of Education (so called at the      time) under the Johnson administration. He would be thrilled      to see a competent woman in this appointment, but      categorically horrified at the possibility of DeVos, just as      I am.  These are the kinds of reactions I am hearing from my constituents. Why? Because we had this nominee come before our committee. We were allowed 5 minutes each to ask her questions. She has a very complex financial background. We were not allowed to look at those financial background papers before we had a chance to talk to her, so we only had some information. The only thing we could do was ask her questions about what she believed in. Her answers were astounding, and many people saw them, whether it was about IDEA and the ability of children with disabilities in this country to get an education, whether it was about policy debates we are having on education, or what she saw as her drive and her ambition. People in this country want someone who feels passionate about public education, not someone who has used her vast amounts of wealth and her experience to go after what she calls an education system that is incompetent and, in her opinion, needs to go away. Her drive has been to take the funds out of public education and go for private, for-profit education.  I can understand that a woman who is a billionaire with a lot of money invested in companies wanting companies to succeed, but our public education system is not a company. Our public education system is something that is derived from the communities that it is in, from the teachers who are there, from the parents who participate as school board members and teacher volunteers. It is the driving passion of our communities. It is not something people want ripped away, torn apart, or degraded. That is why this nominee has touched a nerve across the country.  I heard from Mrs. Rebecca Blankenship. She lives in Gig Harbor. She said:       Dear Senator Murray,       I am writing to urge you to oppose the nomination of Betsy      DeVos as the Secretary of Education. As a certified teacher      who has taught for many years in Public schools and as a      parent of two young girls in the Peninsula School District, I      find DeVos to be completely unqualified for the position as      she has no public school experience, has actively funneled      money away from schools in need and lacks the fundamental      educational background to make decisions that impact millions      of students.       There is no issue more important to me than our education      system.  I heard from Ms. Carol Pelander, a former teacher, from Tacoma, WA:       As a retired public school teacher, who continues to work      part-time training new teachers, I am extremely concerned      about the potential damage that will be done to public      education if Betsy DeVos is confirmed as the Secretary of      Education. Our mission as educators includes teaching our      kids how to live and work together effectively in a diverse      community, and the proposals brought to the table by Ms.      DeVos to privatize education will further divide us as a      community and significantly reduce our already limited      resources. She is not qualified for this important leadership      position.  I have been in the Senate for a long time. I have gotten a lot of emails, a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of constituents, and been to a lot of community meetings. These thousands of letters that we are getting are not form letters. These are letters of people telling stories. They are passionate about their public schools. They have spoken louder about this nominee than any other, saying: This is not what I want for my country.  I have heard from many people in our rural communities who are so concerned about privatizing our public education system because they don't have a private school to send their kids to, even if the voucher that she espouses were enough to put them into one.  I grew up in a rural community. I grew up in the small town of Bothell. Coming in to town, I remember the sign that said 998 people, and I remember the day it said that 1,000 people lived in Bothell. Our schools were the heart and soul of our community. It is where your met your neighbors. It is where you sent your kids to play basketball. Everybody showed up for the football games and the music concerts. It was our community. We loved it, and we owned it. Did we say it was perfect? Did my parents say it was perfect? No. But it was the heart and soul of that community, and they did not want to lose it, just as so many other parents in this country want a Secretary ofEducation who wants all kids to have a good education.  I have so many letters here. I have one from Adam Brickett, from McClure Middle School in Seattle. He says:       Thank you for your years of service representing our state.      I have never contacted an elected official before--  By the way, many of my letters start with that.       I have never contacted an elected official before but with      the changes happening in our country I feel the need to now.      I'm writing specifically to you today about the nominee for      Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.       As a middle school teacher for Seattle Public Schools I      work hard every day to ensure that my students get the best      education possible to be successful in their future careers      and lives. I am concerned that Ms. DeVos does not have the      experience necessary nor the best intentions for our nation's      students and schools to be our Secretary of Education. I      believe she would put profits and money ahead of students,      schools and teachers. I felt this way before her nomination      hearing and feel even more strongly after her hearing. I am      worried about the damage she could do to an already fragile      public education system. I know I am not alone as virtually      all the colleagues I have spoken with have expressed similar      dismay with her nomination.       Her record of attacking public schools and funneling money      to charter and parochial schools with little to no oversight      is troubling. Her lack of experience whatsoever with public      education is also very disturbing. Not only has she never      been an educator or administrator but she has never even      attended or enrolled her children in public education.       A high quality, public education is one of the most      powerful tools a society has. Please don't allow someone with      no experience and who is fundamentally against public      education to become the person in charge of it. I      respectfully ask you and your colleagues in the senate to do      what is right by our nation's students and reject Ms. DeVos      as Secretary of Education.       Thank you again for your tireless service to the residents      of Washington.  I have 48,000 letters. My staff handed me a pile of them. They are all very similar. They are very heartfelt. They are not just writing a rote letter to us. They watched the hearings, they listened, they care about our public schools, and some of them are Trump supporters. They want this President to support our public schools.  They did not in this past election have a debate about whether we should privatize public schools. We talked about the debate--and I know my candidate didn't win. But in this country, I never heard a debate about taking public education away, about voucherizing our public schools, about having someone who is the top person--the Secretary of Education--espouse positions that are so fundamentally opposed to what I grew up with and obviously to so many parents, teachers, students, family members, superintendents, people involved in schools, and business leaders. They are writing to us now because they saw the same thing we did in this hearing.  Let me read a letter from Trina Whitaker from Mukilteo Schools. She says:       This is my 16th year of being a teacher in our public      school system in WA State. I am an advocate of public schools      as I feel strongly that all our students deserve the right to      free and quality education.       I am opposed to the nomination of Betsy DeVos for the      Secretary of Education system. Her past actions and beliefs      clearly demonstrate that she is not an advocate for our      public schools. It would be so damaging if we move in the      direction of privatizing public education.       Please consider opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos in      the best interest for our public school system.  Let me read another letter from Rachel Guim of Seattle. She says:       As a committed public school teacher, I believe in our      neighborhood public schools, which open their doors to all      children, because unlike Betsy DeVos, I see them work for      children and their families every single day. We as a      community are being undermined by charters, vouchers, for-     profit schools and online schools. Precious tax dollars are      being wasted creating a parallel school system (when we're      already underfunded and not meeting the legal requirements)!      Our democratically governed schools--we, the people you have      vowed to represent--need your commitment and support. Choice      is a disguise for school privatization, nothing more. Stop      the takeover of our democratically governed schools. . . . Do      not vote to confirm Betsy DeVos.  And she goes on. Again, there are so many letters from so many people from so many different walks of life, all concerned about having a Secretary of Education who doesn't represent the best values and the best beliefs of our country.  Ms. Amanda Smith, a Kindergarten teacher, wrote to me and said:       Hello,       I am a kindergarten teacher in a public elementary school.      I am very concerned about Betsy DeVos' potential nomination      as secretary of education. As someone who never attended      public school, didn't send her kids to public school, does      not have an education degree and has never taught, she hardly      seems like a fitting candidate for secretary of education.      Can anything be done to stop this nomination?  From Gina McMather, a teacher in Port Townsend, WA:       Dear Patty Murray,       As a recently retired public school teacher, I especially      urge you to fight against Betsy DeVos's nomination for      education secretary. She is not in any way qualified for the      job. Her commitment to charter schools combined with a lack      of experience with public schools could destroy our nation's      educational system.       Public school teachers provide an education for all of our      students. Teachers need more respect and remuneration. We      need the very best college graduates to be attracted to the      profession. I have known so many dedicated and effective      public school teachers during my 25-year career and those of      us retiring baby boomers need the best successors possible.      They need your support. Don't let this undermine our efforts.       Thank you again for all your [work].  What I hear from people over and over again is that they want somebody leading our public school system in this country who actually believes in public schools, who has the education, the experience, the compassion, the willingness to understand what our forefathers did when they created this country and said: We are going to have a country--a democracy--that has a public education system paid for by all taxpayers to assure that everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from, is not denied a public education. They can learn to read and write and communicate and get the skills they need to be successful. They can dream who they want to dream to be and be there.  We do not want to go backward, and we are one vote away from changing where we are on this nomination, sending this back to the President, and asking him to please send us a Secretary of Education who can get the votes in the Senate, who will be an Education Secretary for all people, from all walks of life, from our rural communities and our urban communities, no matter who they are or where they come from. That, I think, is a great possibility and would be a great outcome.  I know that my colleague is on the floor and is ready to speak as well. Again, I have so many letters from so many people--48,000--who have voiced their opinion on this, more than I have ever had with any other nominee in my memory or any other issue in my memory. I thank all those who have written in and spoken out and stood up for public education. It is the foundation of our democracy, and it is our responsibility, our goal to continue that for them.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
