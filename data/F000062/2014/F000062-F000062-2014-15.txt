 President, the Affordable Care Act made great strides in improving access to health insurance for millions of Americans. Unfortunately, especially in high-cost geographic areas, some in the middle class are facing high insurance premiums.  If you make a penny over $45,960 you lose all Federal assistance for purchasing health insurance through the new exchanges. This is especially hard for individuals between the ages of 50 and 64, who are facing higher premiums but do not yet qualify for Medicare.  I have received thousands of calls and emails about access to health insurance. The high costs are a real problem. For example, Dave, one of my constituents from Livermore, CA, wrote to me to share how this policy has affected him. Dave is 60 and self-employed, making $65,000 per year. He signed up for a plan through the new health insurance exchange to cover both himself and his wife. If they made just $3,000 less per year they would have qualified for a subsidy and paid $491 for the second lowest cost silver plan. Since they are just over the threshold, the full cost of this plan is $1552. They decided to go with less robust coverage and still pay $1147 for a bronze plan. Under this legislation, Dave and his wife could get a better plan for less than half of what they pay now.  Another constituent, Dan, lives in Riverside, CA, and is 62 years old. He wrote to me and explained that his pension is just barely too high to receive help with his health insurance premiums and that he just can't afford it. Currently, the second lowest cost silver plan for Dan and his wife would be $1141 per month. Under this legislation, they would be able to afford health insurance.  The way the law is currently designed, there is a steep subsidy cliff.This should gradually reduce, in a way that provides some help for more middle-income Americans so they pay no more than 9.5 percent their income in health insurance premiums.  The Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act would do just that. This legislation extends the current subsidy up to 600 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is $68,940 for an individual. As an individual makes more, their subsidy goes down.  I am particularly concerned about older individuals who need medical care but face premiums they simply cannot afford. In California, it is estimated that approximately 360,600 individuals between the ages of 50-64 who do not qualify for Medicaid or have employer-based coverage would see premiums greater than 9.5 percent of their income. Nearly 98,000 of these are expected to remain uninsured due to the cost. This is a simple fix to improve the law that will further increase access to coverage.  The bill is paid for by a nominal increase in the federal cigarette tax, which amounts to five cents per pack.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Affordable Health Insurance for the Middle Class Act. It is commonsense to have a gradual decline in the federal assistance for health insurance and help those who are just out of reach of affording it on their own.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.                          ____________________
