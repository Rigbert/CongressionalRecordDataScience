President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up the nominations of Justice Kermit Lipez to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Mrs. Johnnie Rawlinson to the District Court for the District of Nevada and Mr. Robert T. Dawson to the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.  Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the Senate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent possible. Certainly the confirmation of these outstanding nominee, which the President sent to us back in October and November last year and earlier this year, are a step in the right direction. I have been urging the Majority Leader to move judicial nominations through the Senate and I thank him for doing so with respect to these nominees.  As the Senate prepares to recess, eight judicial nominations still remain on the calendar awaiting Senate action. With these three additional confirmations, the Senate will still have confirmed less than 20 judges for the year. This, at a time when we have already witnessed 100 vacancies so far this year and we see another 10 on the horizon. So, while I thank the Senate for its actions today, I must note that we have not closed the vacancies gap or ended the crisis of which the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned in his most recent year end report.  Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second Circuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to date to vote upon the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or to provide hearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub. I will redouble my efforts to end the emergency that currently exists in the Second Circuit due to the five vacancies on that 13-member court.  I look forward to prompt action on all of the 36 judicial nominees still pending before the Senate. In addition, I urge the President to make good use of the next several days and to continue to send to the Senate qualified nominees for each of the judicial vacancies.                          ____________________
