 President, as I think everyone on this side of the aisle has made perfectly clear, we do not oppose moving forward with an FAA modernization bill. In fact, we would be more than happy to move forward on the aviation provisions of the Commerce Committee and Finance Committee titles of the bill that are on the Senate floor.  The ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, has been on the Senate floor for a week flagging the extraneous, nonaviation-related provisions in the Finance Committee package as a problem. She has called repeatedly on the majority bill manager to join her in seeking to remove these extraneous controversial provisions and move forward with a clean FAA bill. Unfortunately, the majority has not accepted her offer to date, and so we find ourselves in a stalemate. I think this is unfortunate and unnecessary. But there is a way to pass this bill in a bipartisan way if our colleagues will only take yes for an answer.  So bearing that in mind, I have indicated to the other side that I would propose a unanimous consent agreement.  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2972, a bill to reauthorize and modernize the Federal Aviation Administration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.
