Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I understand that we have taken a lot of shots at the EPA for their overreach, and I am one of them; however, this amendment reaches just a little too far. We may not always agree on where it is appropriate to draw the line on environmental laws and regulations. Some think standards are too stringent; others will say they are not tough enough. That is a fair policy debate, and we have it.  Back in 1968 when the Environmental Protection Agency was created, we had rivers that would light on fire. We had air that was so thick, back when I played football, you couldn't see the other goalposts on the other end of the football field. So we have made a lot of gains.                              {time}  2000  At the same time, as it has been discussed, I think the EPA has gone way too far. We get to the point where we start regulating smaller and smallernumbers and making it very difficult; for instance, when we start talking about 70 parts per billion versus 60 parts per billion, we have gone a long ways.  However, we do know that no matter where the line is ultimately drawn, there are individuals out there that are willingly and knowingly trying to find ways around the law. As such, EPA needs to have the ability to look into criminal activity, whether it is illegal dumping of waste, which unfortunately happens; negligent dumping of toxics or oil, which unfortunately happens; and the illegal transportation or importation of products from other countries by those who would choose to ignore U.S. law.  We can debate the laws and what is appropriate, but we can't give criminals a free pass to ignore the law or the laws that are on the books.  Again, I'm sorry. I must oppose the amendment and strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.  I reserve the balance of my time.
