President, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking member in a colloquy regarding letters of intent for the installation of airport security equipment.  The bill before us includes $309 million for the installation of Electronic Detection Systems, also known as EDS, at our Nation's airports, which is an increase of $309 million over the President's request.  I applaud the inclusion of these funds as our Nation's airports face increased security demands and limited growth in passenger traffic revenues in the wake of September 11. My State's airport authority, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, RIAC, was amongst the first airports to have EDS screening of all passenger bags. However, RIAC was forced to place these large machines in the terminal waiting area at my State's main airport, T.F. Green, causing significant disruption. Since that time, RIAC and my office have worked to make sure that the TSA and FAA are aware of this situation and the need for Federal assistance to modify the terminal at T.F. Green to increase the efficiency of the facility, the security of the EDS machines, and ease of passenger movement.  I would ask my colleagues, the Senators from Mississippi and West Virginia, if it is their understanding from the Transportation Security Administration that the level of funding included in this bill is sufficient to meet the needs of airports such as T.F. Green which are far along in the planning process and that the TSA believes that it cannot expend more than the $309 million in fiscal year 2004?
