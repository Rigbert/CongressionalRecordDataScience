President, these tragic incidents involving students bringing guns to school have taught us that we must proceed on two tracks. Government's first responsibility is to protect our citizens, particularly our young people, from violence. The only way to do that when a student brings a gun to school is to get them out of the classroom, off the streets, and in front of someone who is in the best position to determine what steps to take. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Gordon Smith will help that happen.  Mr. President, all over my state people are calling out for help. The Springfield Chief of Police and the Governor both recognize that the way we currently deal with kids and guns is not working. These kids are slipping through the cracks--only to resurface in deadly and dangerous ways. Mr. President, our current policies are not working. They are not serving anyone. Simply put, when it comes to kids bringing guns to school, we can and must do a better job. We must stop the violence before it spreads across one more school yard. The memorial fence at Thurston High School is the last memorial fence I ever want to see--in Springfield, Oregon, in Pearl Mississippi, in Jonesboro, Arkansas--or anywhere else in the country. Let it end here.  Today, Senator Smith and I are introducing legislation that encourages states to pass laws to require a student who brings a gun to school to be held for up to 72 hours and undergo a psychological evaluation. If a state adopts such a law, the state would be eligible for an increase of 25% in the Juvenile Justice funds that would enable it to provide the type of psychological evaluation and other treatment that such a student needs.  Bringing a gun to school is a warning sign that must be taken seriously. And while so-called ``zero tolerance policies'' that mandate a student be expelled for bringing a gun to school may adequately punish the behavior, they are clearly not enough. We must offer services to this student--see what is going on in that student's head and help them through the rough spots. We must find a balance between preventing these crimes from occurring and punishing them once they do.  Voters in Oregon are tough on juvenile crime, especially serious crimes. We have the minimum sentences. We have the prisons. We do not allow juveniles probation or parole. We do not release juveniles early for good behavior. What Oregon needs is a system that works from the beginning--when the warning signs appear, not just at the end, when harm has been done. Oregon needs resources to identify these kids and help them before there's an arrest to be made. Across the country the message is spoken loud and clear: punishment, while important, is only part of the solution. It does not save lives. Prevention does.  Mr. President, my bill will help communities better identify and service students at-risk of endangering themselves or others with a firearm. My bill gives everyone involved--teachers, public school administrators, law enforcement, police officers and juvenile justice professions--the tools they need to get a troubled student the help he or she needs. Under the State laws my bill would promote, when a student brings a gun to school, the public school must report this behavior to law enforcement and the juvenile authorities immediately. Police must then come to the school and determine if there is probable cause to take action. If there is cause to take action, the police must bring the student into the station for two purposes: first, the student must have a mental health professional give him or her a psychological evaluation, and second, the student must immediately be scheduled for a judicial hearing. The State has up to 72 hours to complete these intervention measures. States pass a law following these parameters will receive a significant bonus: they will receive 25 percent more money to spend on juvenile prevention and intervention services.  Mr. President, no one wishes to see the tragedy at Thurston High School repeated. It is my hope that this legislation will give States the incentive they need to enact tough preventative detention laws to assure that this doesn't happen again. I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2169       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. HOLDING PERIOD FOR STUDENTS BRINGING A GUN TO                    SCHOOL.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 222 of the      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42      U.S.C. 5632) or any     other provision of law, for fiscal year 2000 and each fiscal      year thereafter, the amount that would otherwise be allocated      to a State under that section for a fiscal year shall be      increased by 25 percent, if the State has in effect a State      law described in subsection (b) by not later than the first      day of that fiscal year. Any additional amount made available      to a State under this subsection may be used by the State for      prevention and intervention programs related to school      violence.       (b) State Law Described.--A State law is described in this      subsection if it requires that--       (1) any administrator or employee of a public or private      school who has reasonable cause to believe that a student is      or has been in possession of a firearm while in or on the      premises of a school building in violation of Federal or      State law, shall immediately report the student's conduct to      an appropriate law enforcement agency and to an appropriate      juvenile department or agency of the State;       (2) upon receipt of a report under paragraph (1), the      appropriate law enforcement agency shall immediately cause an      investigation to be made to determine whether there is      probable cause to believe that the student, while in or on      the premises of a public building, possessed a firearm in      violation of Federal or State law;       (3) if a determination of probable cause is made under      paragraph (2)--       (A) the student shall immediately be detained by the      appropriate law enforcement agency for not more than 72 hours      in an appropriate juvenile justice setting for purposes of      psychological evaluation and for a judicial determination      (pursuant to a hearing) regarding whether the student is a      danger to himself or herself or to others; and       (B) a parent, guardian, or other adult with responsibility      for the student shall be notified of that detention and the      purposes of that detention; and       (4) if the court makes a determination under paragraph      (3)(A) that the student is a danger to himself or herself or      others, the student shall be placed in an appropriate      juvenile justice setting to receive professional      psychological counseling.       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out      this section.                          ____________________
