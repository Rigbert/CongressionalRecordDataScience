Mr. Chairman, I wasn't going to rise in opposition until I heard about Maine and how beautiful and the free-running streams and all the tourists and the king crab and all those other things. I do admit, I have been to Maine, and I would agree with him, but his is just a little tiny one. We are a great big thing with bigger streams, bigger fish, bigger crab, but no lobsters, though.  I have no lobsters, and I am going to ask Mr. Poliquin why we haven't seen more lobsters from Maine. I am not sure why, but I yield to the gentleman from Maine.
