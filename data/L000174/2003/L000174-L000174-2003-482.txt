President, Washington is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful cities in our country. It is also a city rich in history and cultural advantages.  Many people have, over the years, added to Washington's achievements and glories. One very special person who has done that is Betty Brown Casey. I have had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Casey because my wife, Marcelle, serves on the Board of the Washington Opera. Mrs. Casey has been one of the greatest supporters the Washington Opera has ever known  On Sunday, April 13, Mrs. Casey threw a party for the Washington Opera. This will go down as one of the greatest and most memorable parties thrown in this city. Marcelle and I were fortunate to attend, and when we left Washington before dawn the next morning, we had the joy of reading Roxanne Roberts' article about Mrs. Casey, titled ``Phenom of the Opera.''  I hope my fellow Senators will enjoy this as much as I did, and I ask unanimous consent that this article about this extraordinarily generous woman be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 2003]      Phenom of the Opera; Patron Betty Brown Casey Gives a Party                          (By Roxanne Roberts)       As fairy godmothers go, Betty Brown Casey is pretty nice to      have on your team.       The low-key philanthropist has a passion for the Washington      Opera, a passion that has translated into millions in      donations and support for the organization. Last night Casey      threw a gala concert for 2,500 fellow lovers of the opera--     and picked up the entire tab herself.       ``We're here to say thank you to all of you for all the      years in the Washington Opera family,'' she told the      audience. Casey ticked off a list of the thankees:      Volunteers, staff, board members, subscribers and ``those of      you who sat--year after year--quietly, patiently and      resignedly, in seats next to those who loved opera--and you      didn't. ``Long-suffering husbands in tuxedos broke into huge      grins as knowing laughter rippled through DAR Constitution      Hall.       The program included mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, soprano      Veronica Villarroel, bass Rene Pape, conductor Valery Gergiev      and the Three Mo' Tenors. (Artistic Director Placido Domingo      was scheduled to conduct and sing at the gala, but was      sidelined by stomach flu.)       ``Tonight is wonderful,'' said Betty Vertiz, a Washington      Opera subscriber since the 1960s. ``We even like our seats!''       Three generations of her family attended the gala: husband      Oscar Vertiz, his daughter Virginia Cameron and granddaughter      Carrie Gouskos. ``It's nice for people who are faithful to      the opera to feel they're appreciated,'' she said.       All because Casey wanted to do ``something nice'' after the      risky move to Constitution Hall, the Washington Opera's      temporary home this year while the Kennedy Center Opera House      undergoes renovations. The cost of last night's soiree?      ``It's a private party,'' she demurred, but a savvy eye would      chalk up seven figures.       ``She's been the absolute soul of the company,'' Domingo      said last week. ``She always wants to do more and thank      anybody who's been involved with the company in any      capacity.''       Casey, sitting nearby, flushed with embarrassment. The      philanthropist shrinks from anything that smacks of self-     promotion, and agreed to speak to a reporter only to      highlight the contributions of everybody else.       ``It's just that this company went through some hard times      and there were many, many people who worked very hard to not      only keep us going and to make us better and better over the      years. I just felt it was a good time to say thank you to      Placido--who has been the real spark plug for everything that      has happened to us--and to everybody. We really feel like a      family, so I felt we should have a family reunion.''       Casey, 75, has had a soft spot for opera since she was a      teenager. ``I just love the music,'' she said with a smile.      ``I get into the music and I'm just there. Terrible as it may      seem, Placido, there are times when I don't care who's      singing. I just love the music.''       Luckily for the opera, Casey is in a position to nurture      that love. After 31 years of marriage to legendary Maryland      developer Eugene Bernard Casey, she inherited an estate of      more than $200 million when he died in 1986. She has led a      very private life since then, quietly doling out donations to      her pet projects.       ``I just think that everybody in life does what they can      do,'' she said. ``I'm naturally shy, and I'm just more      comfortable when people don't think I do anything--because I      don't feel like I do. I only do things that I really believe      in, I only do things that I can afford, and I don't do things      I ask other people to give to. I don't start something and      then ask other people to give me money to do that project. So      I don't try to bother anybody, so to speak.''       ``Betty knows, and some of us, we know it,'' said Domingo.      ``And that's enough.''       Her support is funneled through the Eugene B. Casey      Foundation to the Salvation Army, Suburban Hospital, George      Washington University and Georgetown University and its      hospital. She generated more than a few headlines when she      offered to build an official residence for the District's      mayor on a 17-acre estate in Northwest Washington, and      created a $50 million endowment to plant and tend the city's      trees.       Casey has a special affection for the Washington Opera. She      joined the board in 1974 and has been a member ever since;      she now holds the title of life chairman. In 1996, she spent      $18 million to buy the Woodward & Lothrop building with the      idea of converting it into a state-of-the-art opera house in      the heart of downtown Washington. When the opera decided to      remain at the Kennedy Center instead, the company was allowed      to sell the building and keep the profits.       ``She's terrific,'' said Opera President Michael      Sonnenreich. ``She's stepped up and exhibited a leadership      role for the opera beyond financial. She's setting examples      for others to follow.''       Last night's gala comes after the company's successful move      to Constitution Hall--an artistic experiment that, so far,      has generated praise from critics and subscribers alike.       The evening began with a standing ovation for Casey, who      thanked everyone who had contributed to the success of the      47-year-old company. She asked for whistles, bravos and      bravas for two individuals who had carried the opera during      the tough times: former general director Martin Feinstein and      longtime board member Christine Hunter.       The program was full of familiar material--and a few      surprises. The strongest applause came for Pape, who sang two      arias for     his Washington debut: ``Le veau d'or'' from Gounod's      ``Faust,'' and ``Ella giammai m'amo'' from Verdi's ``Don      Carlo.'' Tenor John Matz had his role unexpectedly expanded      when he filled in for Domingo in ``Granada.'' Washington      native Graves had the widest repertoire, with a French aria      and an American spiritual, and the Three Mo' Tenors were also      all over the map with the classic ``La donna e mobile''      followed by ``Let the Good Times Roll.''       The good times kept rolling after the concert, when 300      guests joined Casey for dinner and dancing at the      Organization of American States across the street. The grand      ballroom was lavishly decorated with spring bouquets, Peter      Duchin kept the dance floor hopping, and the speeches were      short but sincere. ``I am so impressed by Betty,'' said      Washington Opera Chairman Jim Kimsey. ``Without her the opera      would not be what it is today.''       The hostess was characteristically low-key about the      evening. ``I thought it was wonderful, really great,'' she      said, ``Perfect, really, except for Placido'' not being here.
