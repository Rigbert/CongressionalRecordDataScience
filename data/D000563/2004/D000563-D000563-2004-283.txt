President, I rise today to share with my colleagues news of a truly historic conference of Middle Eastern chemists held December 6 through 11, 2003, in Malta. Chemists from Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates gathered in Malta to attend the conference, which was entitled: ``Frontiers of Chemical Sciences: Research and Education in the Middle East.'' The conference was chaired by Dr. Zafra Lerman of Columbia College Chicago. The purpose of the conference was to bring scientists from Middle Eastern countries together under the same roof to work on different issues of common concern.  The Malta Conference was a phenomenal success. The multinational exchange of ideas and information led to the creation of new partnerships in the areas of science and education. The conference was so effective that all the participants involved agreed upon the need for a second conference, tentatively scheduled for 2005.  The Malta Conference permitted participating scientists to address important scientific issues pertinent to the future of the Middle East, but it did more than that. All areas within the Middle East were represented, demonstrating there are some issues that can bring everyone together around a common goal of improving our world and society. This meeting reinforced the fact that the advancement of scientific research and education are vital forces for all nations of the world, and it demonstrated that science and education can help nations that are distrustful of each other to reach across borders and work cooperatively to address common concerns.  The conference chairperson, Dr. Lerman, is the distinguished Professor of Science and Public Policy and head of the Institute for Science Education and Science Communication at Columbia College Chicago. Dr. Lerman received her Ph.D. in chemistry from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. She founded and chaired the Department of Science and Mathematics at Columbia College, where she developed an innovative approach to teaching science to non-science majors which received international recognition. Dr. Lerman is active professionally with national and international associations in the fields of science, science education, and scientific freedom and human rights. For 15 years, she has chaired the national American Chemical Society Subcommittee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights. She also serves as Vice-Chair for Chemistry for the Board of the Committee of Concerned Scientists and chairs the International Activities Committee of the American Chemical Society, in addition to numerous other positions.  Dr. Lerman has received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring and is a 1998 Kilby Award Laureate for extraordinary contributions to society through science, technology, invention, innovation, and education. In February 2001, she was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Lerman and the organizers and delegates of the conference for their superb work. This event serves as a shining example of the progress available to nations that make the effort to promote understanding and cooperation.  I ask that Dr. Lerman's summary of the conference be printed in the Record.  The summary follows.                       Summary of Malta Conference        From 6 to 11 December, 2003, chemists from Egypt, Iran,      Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Authorities,      Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates gathered in      Malta to attend the conference ``Frontiers of Chemical      Sciences: Research and Education in the Middle East.''        The success of this conference tells us that science and      scientific research are not just methods of improving the      human condition but can also be ways of crossing illusive      national and political barriers that bar effective      collaboration among neighbors. The invited participants      included presidents of universities, members of the      respective countries' national academies of science, and a      former minister of science. By engaging a stunning array of      world-class scientists from the Middle East, as well as      selected scientists from England, France, Germany, South      Africa, Taiwan, and the U.S., the resulting discussion      broadly enriched our understanding of specific scientific      issues important to the area's future. The fact that all      segments of the Middle East were represented suggests that      there are fundamental scientific issues that connect us all.        Six Nobel Laureates served as working group leaders on      subjects of common interest to Middle Eastern countries. The      subjects of these working groups included: ``Environment,      Water and Renewable Energy,'' ``Research and New      Methodologies in Science Education,'' ``Cultural Heritage and      Preservation of Antiquities,'' ``The Use of the Synchrotron      to Facilitate Research in the Middle East (SESAME Project),''      among others. Participants committed themselves to continue      working together after the conference via e-mail and through      smaller regional meetings. Among suggestions offered for      future topics were: nanotechnology, computational chemistry,      and solar energy.        All participants wrote that the conference organization      was excellent, that the conference exceeded their      expectations, and that the opportunity to work with the Nobel      laureates was especially appreciated and it led to      stimulating and informed discussion. 100% of the participants      felt that a second conference, probably in 2005, would be      needed. All indicated that they would want to attend and that      they would recommend it to their colleagues. Most expressed      willingness to participate in the organization of such an      event.        A joint proposal between Israeli and Palestinian      participants in the Malta conference was written on water      purification and submitted to USAID-MERC.        One of the conference working groups, which concentrated      on the synchrotron being built in Jordan (supported by      UNESCO) for all the Middle East scientists, raised the urgent      need for scientists trained in the use of a synchrotron.      Dr. Yuan T. Lee, the Nobel Laureate who is science advisor      to     the President of Taiwan, offered during the conference      three full scholarships for scientists from the Middle      East to spend a year learning to use the synchrotron in      Taiwan. An agreement is already signed, and the selection      of the three Middle Eastern scientists is in progress.       The President of the Technion (Israel Institute of      Technology) offered to provide three full Technion      scholarships for any interested student from an Arabic      country.       A group of Palestinian participants met in February with      their Israeli colleagues in the Weizmann Institute of      Science. As a result, an agreement was signed for Palestinian      students to study for MSc and PhD at the Weizmann Institute      of Science; a committee is now working on financial      arrangements needed to run the program.       One of the Israeli participants has been invited to present      a lecture in Egypt. All the Egyptian participants expressed      their interest in attending his lecture; some extended      additional invitations for him to visit and present seminars      at their institutions.       Dr. Roald Hoffmann, one of the American Nobel laureates,      offered to run an intensive workshop in a Middle East      location for graduate students from all the participating      countries. This idea was accepted quite favorably by the      participants; the location is now being discussed.       Ultimately, all the participants agreed that science is,      indeed, a shared language between them all, and that the      things they have in common are more numerous than the      differences that separate them. The desire among the      participants to continue the collaborations and to meet again      is proof that the conference succeeded in overcoming barriers      heretofore perceived as insurmountable.                          ____________________
