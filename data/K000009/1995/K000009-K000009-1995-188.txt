And we effectively, the other 432 Members of this body, had nothing to say about it, and it is amazing to me how few people are even raising their voices. And yet $5 billion is out the door, another $15 billion is ready to go, and who knows how much more, because three banks in Mexico collapsed a week and a half ago.  They are having difficulty refinancing their tesobono offerings, and yet our Government could find $20 billion basically to give to Mexico so she could pay her Wall Street creditors, the speculators who are earning 66 percent interest on bonds that they had bought. They should have eaten their losses, as they ate their earnings over the last 5 years. But they have a special call at the Treasury of the people of the United States, and yet the people from my district, 25,000 of them who got their heating assistance cut, they had no special call in Washington. No Washington miracle happened for them. For those millions of kids that will not get a summer job, there was no Washington miracle for them.
