 Right now there are 22 judicial nominations sitting on the judicial calendar: 17 district court and 5 circuit court nominees. These are appointments to Federal judgeships. In many instances they are appointments that are long overdue and desperately needed.  Twelve of these nominees were voted out of the Judiciary Committee last year--last year--two of them as far back as last October.  One would think they must be very controversial people to have made it this far but then stalled on the calendar. It turns out 17 of these 22 nominees received strong bipartisan support on the committee. Thirteen had blue slips, which is permission to go forward, from home State Republican Senators. Eleven of them would fill vacancies deemed as judicial emergencies.  I don't understand how we can do this to the Federal judiciary and to the men and women who are involved. The American people need these nominations to be confirmed in a timely fashion, and it is only fair to these men and women who are offering their lives in public service and sometimes jeopardizing their current jobs because of the uncertainty of their future.  All Americans want our Federal courts to be there to prosecute criminals, to make certain they have their day in court in civil proceedings, as well as to maintain the integrity of our judicial process.  There are only two ways to schedule a confirmation vote in the Senate: either a unanimous consent agreement or file cloture, which basically means force the issue. Forcing the issue takes time, and time isn't on our side. We have important things to do: finishing the Transportation bill today and moving forward on other important issues. But since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have routinely objected when we have asked for their consent to promptly schedule confirmation votes on judicial nominees.  When we take a look at the record President Obama has faced, the obstruction from the Republican side of the aisle is unprecedented. President Obama's district court nominees have been forced to wait on the floor more than four times longer on average than those confirmed under President Bush or under President Clinton. Overall, at this point in their terms, President Obama has had only 131 nominees confirmed while President George W. Bush had 172 and President Clinton had 183.  Right now there are 39 judicial nominees pending either on the JudiciaryCommittee or on the Senate floor. Promptly confirming these 39 would bring the President's overall numbers close to parity with President Bush. It wouldn't give him an advantage.  It is time to stop the delay. I think it is important for us to confirm these nominees as quickly as possible. We don't have to go through this painful and embarrassing charade of calling cloture vote after cloture vote on nominees who were accepted on a strong bipartisan vote, have been approved by Republican Senators, and are simply being held up on the hope by some Republican Senators that the day will come when there is a Republican President who can fill these vacancies. That isn't fair. Taking that approach is what gives our Chamber a bad name.  Ten of these nominees were reported out of committee last year. Why continue to delay them? I know during President Bush's first term the Senate confirmed 57 district court nominees within 7 days. These nominees languished on the calendar for months--months. If there is a legitimate objection to any nominee, step forward and state the objection. If a Member opposes the nominee, when the vote comes vote no. But for, goodness' sake, to let these names and nominations languish on the calendar isn't fair to the nominees, and it isn't fair to the courts that are in many instances facing judicial emergencies because of these vacancies.  I urge my colleagues--among these nominees are two for Illinois. Senator Mark Kirk and I had an agreed-to bipartisan approach. We put together bipartisan committees, we each found our favorite nominees, and we submitted the nominee to one another. We asked for approval; we got the approval. We have two extraordinarily good people: John Lee, proposed by me, and Jay Tharp, proposed by Senator Kirk. Both came out of committee without controversy--two excellent nominees sitting on the calendar.  For goodness' sake, I ask my colleagues, why would they do this? It isn't fair to these individuals. It isn't fair to Senator Kirk, and it isn't fair to this process. Let's move these names forward as quickly as possible.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
