Chairman, the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that prevent covered jurisdictions from enacting discriminatory voting changes and allow Federal observers to monitor elections in covered jurisdictions are crucial provisions that are protected and should continue to protect minority voters.  Further, covered jurisdictions can cost effectively remove themselves from coverage under the Voting Rights Act, as 11 counties in Virginia have done, if they can show a clean record on voting rights for 10 years.  However, this amendment would turn the Voting Rights Act on its head by requiring the Voting Section of the Department of Justice to conduct an annual, once a year, review of nearly 900 jurisdictions, and thus, drain all of its resources away from preventing voting discrimination.  The amendment would require travel to nearly 900 jurisdictions every year for the review of voluminous records, the interviewing of thousands of people to determine whether all the jurisdictions' voting changes have been submitted for preclearance, as required by the Voting Rights Act, and that all other bailout criteria have been met.  This would require not just a review of all the materials that covered jurisdictions may have submitted to the Department of Justice, but also a review of all the materials a covered jurisdiction may not have submitted to the DOJ. Placing this burden on the Federal Government does nothing to make the Voting Rights Act more constitutional, but it does everything to make the Voting Rights Act hopelessly incapable of effective administration, to the detriment of minority voting rights.  J. Gerald Hebert, a former Justice Department Voting Section lawyer, and the attorney who represented all 11 counties in Virginia that successfully bailed out of the Voting Rights Act, has written the following regarding what the Justice Department would have to do at all 900 covered jurisdictions under the Westmoreland amendment. And remember, this means each and every one of those jurisdictions:  ``It has been my experience that to determine eligibility for bailout takes a rather comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the voting election process in a State or political subdivision. This would include, for example, a description of the opportunities afforded minority voters to become registered voters, the extent to which minorities participate in the political process, including their success as candidates, whether they have worked in the registration office, the extent to which they have served as poll officials in the jurisdictions, et cetera.  ``Moreover, to assess bailout eligibility, it is usually necessary to review voter turnout numbers to determine the extent to which the electorate is participating in national, State and local elections.  ``Views of the minority community are also routinely sought in bailout cases. The Attorney General would need to contact minority leaders in every jurisdiction to obtain their views on bailout.  ``In addition, in order to assess whether a jurisdiction has faithfully complied with section 5, usually a review of all the records of the jurisdiction is undertaken to study whether any voting changes have been implemented by the jurisdiction without the requisite preclearance.''  Now, clearly, requiring such an assessment every year by the Justice Department would prevent it from its primary responsibility of enforcing minority voting rights. In reality, there are only a handful of attorneys in the Voting Section of the Department of Justice, and this amendment does not include one penny of additional funding to hire the additional resources that would be necessary to conduct this annual assessment.  Further, under this amendment, the Department of Justice would be given the unprecedented authority to determine on its own whether the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that protect minority voters from discriminatory voting changes will remain in effect.                              {time}  1600  The amendment states: ``The Attorney General shall annually determine whether each State and political subdivision to which the requirements of this section apply meet the requirements'' that would remove a jurisdiction from coverage under the Voting Rights Act. That is an unprecedented voting rights policy that places far too much power in a single Department of a Federal executive agency, giving it the unfettered authority to remove entire States from coverage under one of the most important civil rights protections enacted in the last century.  Giving so much power to a single executive branch agency over the vastly important decision of whether a given jurisdiction is covered or not covered by the Voting Rights Act's temporary provisions invites abuse. And the protection of voting rights should never be made subject to a regime that invites incentives other than the protection of voting rights.  In addition, this amendment invites lawsuits against the Department of Justice itself for its alleged failure to adequately conduct a review that it would be required to conduct in all 900 jurisdictions. So the gentleman's amendment says that this has got to be done every year in 900 jurisdictions. He does not give the Justice Department a penny to hire any additional people to conduct the review. And then it invites lawsuits against the Justice Department because they failed to do so because they do not have enough money to be able to do it.  In addition, the amendment compels the Department of Justice to prospectively take a litigation position, that it ``shall consent to the entry of judgment'' based on a previous determination even if subsequently discovered facts render the previous decision unjust. Meaning it ties the Justice Department's hand from acting based on newly discovered evidence.  The amendment denies the Justice Department the ability to assert itself in litigation as it sees fit in court, based on its assessment of tactics and legal considerations. This directive affronts established executive litigation authority and upsets the separation of powers.  In sum, this amendment, far from being a reasonable clarification of theVoting Rights Act, will invite chaos. It will cripple the enforcement resources of the Voting Division of the Department of Justice. It would redirect limited resources away from voting rights enforcement, give the executive branch unprecedented and unfettered authority to remove crucial voting rights protections over large parts of the country, and impermissibly lock an executive branch agency into a litigation position.  Of all four amendments that have come before us today, this one is the worst. Please reject it.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
