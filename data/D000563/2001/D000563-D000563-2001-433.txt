President, this may be one of the most important debates we will have about this budget resolution because at issue in this debate, with the Durbin amendment and the Bennett amendment, is a very simple proposition. It is this: America's economy needs a shot in the arm. It needs help immediately--not a year from now, not 5 years from now, not 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years from now, but immediately.  What I am proposing with the Durbin amendment is to take from the surplus of some $97 billion, which we know we will have this year on the budget we are debating, $60 billion of that surplus and return it to the American people as quickly as we can prudently return it so we will give that spending power back to families in America immediately. That is what I am proposing.
