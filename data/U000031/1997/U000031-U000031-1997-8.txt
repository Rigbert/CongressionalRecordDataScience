Chairman, I did not want to leave my friend from Massachusetts' comments unresponded to with regard to the thousand years. Here is what it looks like. Looks like the moon.  I would like to propose that we might get a unanimous consent amendment to put a statue of Ed Markey out in front with some of the speeches that he has delivered. I can guarantee my colleagues that no one will be close to this thing for 2,000 years, let alone 1,000, and we will not need the Park Service to build a $330,000 commode for 950 years from now. I wonder if the gentleman would object to such a unanimous consent amendment?
