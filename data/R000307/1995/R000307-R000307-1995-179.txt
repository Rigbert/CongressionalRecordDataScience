Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would eliminate the requirement that all agricultural producers must buy a Federal crop insurance policy if they are to retain their eligibility for USDA programs. In return for this flexibility, producers will give up any possible Federal assistance for weather-related losses.  The one problem with the new catastrophic crop insurance program is it imposes a government program on someone who doesn't want it. Because any person who receives a USDA payment must purchase a catastrophic policy, we have seen landlords with a minimal interest in a farming operation faced with buying insurance coverage they do not want and do not need. As I cited in Subcommittee hearings recently, nine persons with an interest in three crops in two counties were required to buy three policies in the two counties costing $2700. This figure does not include the costs to the tenant farmer. I can assure my colleagues this implementation of crop insurance reform was not what the Committee intended and needs to be fixed.  The bill I am introducing will strike this onerous requirement and instead require the producer to sign a waiver acknowledging his refusal of crop insurance with the understanding there will be no disaster assistance provided in the event the producer suffers a weather-related disaster. In addition to the commonsense this brings to the program, the Congressional Budget Office estimates this provision will save nearly $180 million during the period 1996 through 2002. That is good news during these times of budget cuts.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill also deals with a problem summer-fallow farmers experienced this spring with failed wheat acres. Current law restricts a producer who intends to plant a substitute crop to do so only on those acres where the failed crop was planted. This does not work in high plains winter wheat country where a substitute crop will not grow on ground where the failed crop was growing. There is insufficient moisture to grow a substitute crop. The amendment I am introducing today would allow the crop to be planted on summer fallow ground where there would be moisture sufficient to grow a substitute crop so long as the producer maintained compliance with his conservation plan.  These amendments are necessary for the credibility of the crop insurance program and the flexibility producers need in order to plant substitute crops. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
