 President, on Tuesday, California lost one of its greatest jurists, Justice Stanley Mosk.  For more than a half century, and for 37 years on the bench of the State Supreme Court, Stanley Mosk served California with thoughtfulness, with honor, and indeed, with wisdom.  He was the longest-serving member in the court's 151-year history, issuing a total of 1,688 opinions over his career, including 727 majority rulings, 570 dissents, and 391 concurrences.  I knew Stanley Mosk well, and I respected him greatly. He's been a giant on the Supreme Court, and he will be missed deeply.  Justice Mosk began his political career as executive secretary to Governor Culbert L. Olson in 1938.  Following that, he was appointed to the Los Angeles Superior Court, where he served for 15 years.  And beginning in 1958, Mosk was elected California attorney-general, becoming the first Jewish man or woman to be elected to statewide office in the State.  Finally in 1964, weary of politics, Justice Mosk was appointed to the supreme court by Governor Pat Brown.  In this career which spanned more than 53 years, Justice Mosk broke new ground in the areas of the environment, the right to sue, and, perhaps most notably, in race discrimination, where he protected the right of all individuals, regardless of race, to be equally protected by the law.  As early as 1947, while on the superior court, Mosk issued his first ruling dealing with race, holding that whites-only restrictions on property were unenforceable.  Then in 1961, when serving as attorney-general, he persuaded the Professional Golfers Association to admit black golfers.  Later, on the supreme court, Mosk wrote perhaps his most famous decision of his career on the case of Allan Bakke, a white student who challenged racial quotas in the University of California admissions program.  Writing for the majority, Mosk held that the University's quota-based admissions program, that favored minorities over whites, was unconstitutional.  In each of these decisions, Mosk favored the right of the individual to be treated as an equal, with complete disregard to his or her race. It is a formulation which has stood the test of time.  In addition, Mosk wrote hundreds of decisions that have deeply impacted the State. Some of those include: An opinion written in 1980 allowing victims of the drug DES to sue all makers of the drug, on the basis of their market share, when the specific manufacturer was unknown to the victims; A 1972 decision that extended the restrictions of the California Environmental Quality Act to private developers; and A 1979 decision that held that a disabled parent could not be denied custody of a child solely because of a physical handicap.  Moreover, many of Mosk's opinions reflected his belief in the doctrine of ``independent state grounds,'' which holds that the Federal Constitution provides a minimum standard of individual rights upon which States can build.  Stanley Mosk's life was devoted to the law and to the State of California. His prolific careers illustrated his deep commitment to equality, and he leaves a legacy that will last for years to come.  He is survived by his wife, Kaygey Kash Mosk, and son Richard M. Mosk.                          ____________________
