President, my calculation is there are about 36 minutes remaining before the vote. I ask unanimous consent on the Democratic side that I be given 3 minutes, Senator Cardin 5 minutes, Senator Menendez of New Jersey 5 minutes, Senator Carper of Delaware 5 minutes--Senator Carper 3 minutes, and Senator Kaine 2 minutes.
