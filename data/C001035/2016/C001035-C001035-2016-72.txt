President, the Senate has completed its consideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential funding for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, related agencies, military construction programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and to combat Zika. I thank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and collaborative manner.  I would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40amendments. There were also recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the aisle included in the Transportation-HUD appropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the committee level. I thank all of my colleagues for giving us their suggestions, their requests, and their insights. It made for a better bill.  As I mentioned, I am particularly grateful to Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee, for his work.  I also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout this process. As Senator Reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but our staff worked even harder. So I thank Heideh Shahmoradi, Rajat Mathur, Jason Woolwine, Lydia Collins, Gus Maples, Dabney Hegg, Nathan Robinson, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone, and Mike Clarke on the subcommittee staff.  I also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who worked so hard. Without the help of Laura Dove and her team and the team on the Democratic side, we could not be where we are today. They did a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. They helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were included in this bill.  I would note that our Transportation-HUD portion of this bill recognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into our crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. It meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. I think most of our colleagues are unaware that 84 percent of HUD's budget goes to subsidized housing. When we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low-income families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from being at risk of homelessness.  We also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless populations, such as our veterans and our young people. We continued a program the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless veterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that we can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless veterans. Since we started this program, the number of homeless veterans has declined by about one-third. This program works, but we can't declare victory until the job is done. That is why both last year and this year we funded the program, even though the President's budget sought to eliminate it.  We have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable young people, and those are youth who have been in the Foster Care Program and then age out of that program. In some cases, they are aging out of the program before they have even graduated from high school, and they have nowhere to go. So through family reunification vouchers and other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall through the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping out of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. In particular, I am very proud of the work we have done in that area.  I am very pleased this bill funds the TIGER Grant Program at $525 million. This program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. It has funded projects in each and every State--projects that have led to job creation and economic development. When we think about it, at heart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our fellow citizens. If you don't have a place to live, it is very difficult to show up for work every day. If the infrastructure is crumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees who produce the products and get those products to market. The construction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. In many ways, I think of this as a jobs bill.  Let me give another example of a very popular program, the Community Development Block Grant Program. If you ask of the mayors and other town and city officials in your State, they will point to that program as one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to make investments that bring new employers to the region, to build affordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of that program. It is not dictated from Washington. It gives tremendous flexibility to States and communities to design the kinds of economic development programs that boost growth and create jobs.  In short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future economic growth, something I know the Presiding Officer has been a real leader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as Members of the Senate.  I am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor for Members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. The worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions temporarily funding the essential functions of government. They create such uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather than reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. Agencies are unable to enter into contracts. Businesses, because of the uncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. It is a terrible way to operate.  Equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations bills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is rushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the expiration of one of those continuing resolutions that I just deplore. We are not doing that this year. This is the third appropriations bill that the Senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation from both sides of the aisle. The Members of the Appropriations Committee and its two leaders, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, deserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping the process moving.  In fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more appropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate floor. That is the way the process used to work. That is the way the process should work, and that is the way the process is working this year. I believe it is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, and to Majority Leader McConnell, who has made it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the Appropriations Committee and brought to the Senate floor, individually or two or three combined, for full and open debate.  Again, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. Many of your requests are included in this important legislation. I feel fortunate to have worked with Senator Jack Reed on this bill. He is not only a great colleague and a terrific Senator but also a good friend.                          ____________________
