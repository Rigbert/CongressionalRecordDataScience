They had a few millions of dollars to accommodate American workers. Here now we have a $9 billion bailout that we are not even aware of. I am sure it is more than that when you count the $5 billion that the Federal Reserve is putting into that. It is amazing how quickly, how quickly our Government jumps to the tune of those who have a lot of money, investors and bankers, but when it comes to workers who need attention, he and she got no attention in the body of the agreement.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Further on that point is, those 30,000 who have applied, many are lost in the Federal redtape. They have to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can identify where their jobs moved to in Mexico. I believe the figure is 12,000 have been approved. That means that 18,000 are in need of special assistance. As the gentlewoman points out, out of a few hundred dollars a week for people whose jobs moved or were shifted back to Mexico, changed by United States policy, and yet at the snap of a finger, the Federal Reserve can spend billions of dollars with no Federal disclosure and the Treasury can pony up a $9 billion line of credit somehow, but the workers who are out of jobs are still waiting in line at the unemployment office, hoping, begging for a bit of help so they can get retrained.
