President, as always, the Senator from South Carolina has raised a number of important issues. I will take a minute or two to respond.  First, it needs to be understood by the Senate that, under the substitute offered by the chairman and myself, a plaintiff can file suit immediately for injunctive relief should they choose to go that route.  There have been all kinds of discussion raised and I gather it is always raised by the administration that somehow the rights of plaintiffs are being cut off. The fact of the matter is, under the substitute being offered by the Senator from Arizona and myself, it is possible for a plaintiff to move for injunctive relief immediately.  What we are saying is, we ought to look at ways to try to bring about corrections in the private sector by private parties coming together, trying to encourage the alternative dispute resolution, a process which is clearly laid out in our legislation.  Our substitute makes it very clear that if a plaintiff wants to file a suit on day one, they can. If they believe they are being jerked around in the marketplace, they can go out on that very first day and seek injunctive relief. We think it would be preferable and avoids causing this bedlam with everybody rushing to court. We think a lot of those approaches can be resolved by the parties coming together.  Second, it seems to me those who will look at the substitute will understand in the vast majority of instances private contract law is going to govern. In most other instances it will be State law. In this administration statement, the notion is that somehow we are federalizing everything, where the substitute clearly lays out in the vast majority of cases contract law is going to take the lead in this area. That, regrettably, is a part of the administration's position that simply is not accurate.  In fact, I and others raised that issue in the committee. We felt there wasn't a strong enough bias in favor of protecting private contract law. That was a change made after the bill left committee, because a number of consumer and other organizations thought it was very important.  I think what is especially troubling about the policy statement that has now been offered by the administration--and this Senator and others are going to continue to work with them--is that they are essentially telling the Senate that over in the Justice Department they know more about the technical issues of running computers and the software businesses than do those businesses that have to do it every single day.  The administration statement says this legislation is going to decrease the incentives, that these computer and software and other technology organizations have to be ready to assist customers to be ready for the transition of the next century.  The fact of the matter is, all of these groups that have to actually work with computers and software every single day believe this legislation is absolutely critical to their being ready for the transition to the next century. Essentially what we have is folks at the Justice Department on this issue saying they know a whole lot more about the technical issues of the computer business than the folks who actually have to work with these systems every single day.  I raise this issue again with respect to defendants who engage in truly outrageous, egregious action. There have been statements made on the floor by others and raised in the administration's letter as well with respect to the question of proportional liability and particularly what you are going to do about those defendants who engage in fraudulent activity.  Under the substitute before the Senate, if a defendant is engaged in fraud, it is very clear that joint and several liability stays in place. There are no changes whatever with respect to joint and several liability if, in fact, a defendant is engaged in an egregious type of conduct. We also ensure that joint and several liability is kept when a defendant is insolvent. We felt it was important to make sure the plaintiff would have an opportunity to be made whole in instances where there was an injured party who badly needed a remedy.  The fact is that there have been many, many changes made in this legislation since it left the committee. In order to be responsive to the consumer, the chairman of the committee reached out to a variety of parties--myself and others--in order to make those changes. I will take a minute or two to outline a couple of those.  Perhaps the most important is the fact that this is a bill with a strong sunset provision. Neither the original McCain legislation nor the Hatch-Feinstein legislation, which has many, many good features, nor the legislation that our colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, offered, which also has many good features in it--none of those bills had a sunset provision originally.  We felt it was important to make sure that this legislation was not producing a set of changes for all time but it was going to be legislation that specifically targets problems directly related to Y2K so we don't have an open-ended onslaught with respect to product liability issues.  I happen to think the Senator from South Carolina made a number of important points with respect to tobacco. I also happen to think there were other issues that were relevant on this debate. I and others in the other body were able to get the tobacco executives under oath to say that nicotine was addictive which certainly helped to open up this issue in order to protect consumers and injured parties. I think the Senator from South Carolina makes a number of important points with respect to the issue of lawyers who stand up for injured parties and consumers.  Make no mistake, colleagues, this is not an open-ended tort reform bill. It is not an open-ended product liability bill. It is essentially a 3-year bill to deal directly with a problem that, frankly, could not have been envisaged at the time. At the time many of these decisions were made, there was a real question as to whether there would be adequate space for disks and for memory, so there was an engineering tradeoff adopted a number of years ago to get more space for disks and memory. We find it hard today to believe that at one point disk and memory space was at a premium. It was at that time.  Now we are in a position where we have to come up with ways to ensure we make our computer and technology systems ready for the next century while at the same time providing a safety net when, in fact, there are real problems such as frivolous suits.  I hope our colleagues will look at the many changes that have been made: The fact that there is joint liability when a defendant knowingly commits fraud, there is joint liability when you have an insolvent defendant in order to make a plaintiff whole, that there are punitive damages when an individual acts in bad faith, that there are not new preemptive Federal standards for establishing punitive damages, that there has been an elimination of the vague Federal defenses for reasonable efforts.  I hope our colleagues will look at those changes that have been made. I, for one, am going to continue to work with the administration. I think thereare many in the administration who realize this is a very, very serious problem. But I really have to say to the Senate today, with respect to the policy statement issued today, that there simply are a number of statements in there that, to be charitable, are inaccurate. The fact is, this idea that under our substitute injured persons are having their rights to sue cut off is simply wrong. Under our substitute, a plaintiff, an injured consumer, can go out and file a suit immediately on the very first day.  Under the McCain-Wyden substitute, if you feel that you are a wronged party, you can file a suit the first day. We just do not think, as a matter of public policy, that is a particularly good idea. We would like to encourage parties to work together in the private sector. That is what we seek to do through the 90-day period. That is what we seek to do through the alternative dispute resolution system. But for those who think it is important to basically have the right to sue immediately, our legislation does that. We do it in a way that protects, first and foremost, contract law rather than writing whole new Federal standards to govern in this area.  Finally, and this is perhaps the area where I have the strongest disagreement with what the administration has offered today, I find it very, very far-fetched to believe that there are folks in the Justice Department who know more about the technical issues of helping those in the technology sector get ready for the 21st century; that those folks would know more about this technical job we have in front of us than people who have to do it every single day in my home State of Oregon and across the country. Those are folks who right now, every single day, come to work saying, What are we going to do about working with our suppliers? What are we going to do about individuals overseas who may have been slow to get ready for Y2K? Those folks know a whole lot more about the challenge of getting ready for the 21st century than do the folks in the Justice Department.  I hope we listen to those folks across the country in the small businesses, in the grocery stores and hardware stores, who, by the way, overwhelmingly support this substitute. We have had discussions about somehow the grocery stores and the hardware stores and others are ones that are not supportive of this legislation, who feel their rights are being cut off. The fact is they are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation.  A lot of my colleagues, I guess, are saying: Where do we go from here? Is it just going to be impossible to move forward? I am not one who shares that view. I think there is a centrist coalition in the Senate that very much wants to get a responsible bill that meets the needs of consumers and injured parties, and is also concerned about preventing bedlam in the private marketplace next January. We have been meeting on an ongoing basis for several days now. We have had some very thoughtful ideas presented. Senator Dodd has some important suggestions; Senator Hatch, Senator Feinstein, and others have made real contributions. I understand our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, continues to negotiate on several of the issues that are outstanding.  So I am very hopeful that with the continued leadership of Tom Daschle and Trent Lott on this issue that we can continue to work through some of the outstanding issues. I have tried to respond this morning to areas where I think the administration is simply off base with respect to what the McCain-Wyden substitute is all about, but I want to make it clear I remain open to working with them.  But I would say now is the time for the Senate to deal with this issue. If we let this go on, if we just let it fester and take months and months and months and arrive at no resolution of this problem, I happen to think we may well be back here early next January for a special session of the Senate having to deal with this problem. There is not a Member of this body who wants that result. Let us continue to work together.  I plan to continue to negotiate with all the Senators I have mentioned this morning, and will continue to try to be responsive to the concerns raised by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, although I think in the end it is quite clear we have a difference of opinion on this legislation. But this bill is too important to just say: This is it, the end, the administration has given its opinion and let's move on.  I think we have an opportunity to proceed under the McCain-Wyden substitute. We have made nine major changes that were requested by various organizations to be responsive to areas where they thought the committee bill was inadequate. We have made it clear we are open to a variety of other suggestions. Senator Dodd, in particular, has offered several which I think are very important and ought to be addressed. I hope the Senate will continue to work in a bipartisan way to deal with this issue, because the time to deal with it is now and not next January.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
