Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Domestic violence crimes account for approximately 15      percent of total crime costs in the United States each year.       (2) Violence against women has been reported to be the      leading cause of physical injury to women. Such violence has      a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional health      and financial security.       (3) According to a recent National Institutes of Health-     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, each year      there are 5,300,000 non-fatal violent victimizations      committed by intimate partners against women. Female murder      victims were substantially more likely than male murder      victims to have been killed by an intimate partner. About \1/     3\ of female murder victims, and about 4 percent of male      murder victims, were killed by an intimate partner.       (4) According to recent government estimates, approximately      987,400 rapes occur annually in the United States, 89 percent      of the rapes perpetrated against female victims. Since 2001,      rapes have actually increased by 4 percent.       (5) Approximately 10,200,000 people have been stalked at      some time in their lives. Four out of every 5 stalking      victims are women. Stalkers harass and terrorize their      victims by spying on the victims, standing outside their      places of work or homes, making unwanted phone calls, sending      or leaving unwanted letters or items, or vandalizing      property.       (6) Employees in the United States who have been victims of      domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or      stalking too often suffer adverse consequences in the      workplace as a result of their victimization.       (7) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault, and stalking are particularly vulnerable to changes      in employment, pay, and benefits as a result of their      victimizations, and are, therefore, in need of legal      protection.       (8) The prevalence of domestic violence, dating violence,      sexual assault, stalking, and other violence against women at      work is dramatic. About 36,500 individuals, 80 percent of      whom are women, were raped or sexually assaulted in the      workplace each year from 1993 through 1999. Half of all      female victims of violent workplace crimes know their      attackers. Nearly 1 out of 10 violent workplace incidents are      committed by partners or spouses. Women who work for State      and local governments suffer a higher incidence of workplace      assaults, including rapes, than women who work in the private      sector.       (9) Homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the      job. Husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 percent      of workplace homicides against women.       (10) Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of      employed battered women surveyed were harassed at work by      their abusive partners.       (11) According to a 1998 report of the General Accounting      Office, between \1/4\ and \1/2\ of domestic violence victims      surveyed in 3 studies reported that the victims lost a job      due, at least in part, to domestic violence.       (12) Women who have experienced domestic violence or dating      violence are more likely than other women to be unemployed,      to suffer from health problems that can affect employability      and job performance, to report lower personal income, and to      rely on welfare.       (13) Abusers frequently seek to control their partners by      actively interfering with their ability to work, including      preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their      partners at work, limiting the access of their partners to      cash or transportation, and sabotaging the child care      arrangements of their partners.       (14) More than \1/2\ of women receiving welfare have been      victims of domestic violence as adults and between \1/4\ and      \1/3\ reported being abused in the last year.       (15) Victims of intimate partner violence lose 8,000,000      days of paid work each year--the equivalent of over 32,000      full-time jobs and 5,600,000 days of household productivity.       (16) Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the      workplace, can impair an employee's work performance, require      time away from work, and undermine the employee's ability to      maintain a job. Almost 50 percent of sexual assault survivors      lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the      assaults.       (17) More than 35 percent of stalking victims report losing      time from work due to the stalking and 7 percent never return      to work.       (18)(A) According to the National Institute of Justice,      crime costs an estimated $450,000,000,000 annually in medical      expenses, lost earnings, social service costs, pain,      suffering, and reduced quality of life for victims, which      harms the Nation's productivity and drains the Nation's      resources.       (B) Violent crime accounts for $426,000,000,000 per year of      this amount.       (C) Rape exacts the highest costs per victim of any      criminal offense, and accounts for $127,000,000,000 per year      of the amount described in subparagraph (A).       (19) Violent crime results in wage losses equivalent to 1      percent of all United States earnings, and causes 3 percent      of the Nation's medical spending and 14 percent of the      Nation's injury-related medical spending.       (20) The Bureau of National Affairs has estimated that      domestic violence costs United States employers between      $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 annually in lost time and      productivity, while other reports have estimated the cost at      between $5,800,000,000 and $13,000,000,000 annually.       (21) United States medical costs for domestic violence have      been estimated to be $31,000,000,000 per year.       (22) Surveys of business executives and corporate security      directors also underscore the     heavy toll that workplace violence takes on women,      businesses, and interstate commerce in the United States.       (23) Ninety-four percent of corporate security and safety      directors at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a      high security concern.       (24) Forty-nine percent of senior executives recently      surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their      company's productivity, 47 percent said domestic violence      negatively affects attendance, and 44 percent said domestic      violence increases health care costs.       (25) Only 25 States have laws that explicitly provide      unemployment insurance to domestic violence victims in      certain circumstances, and none of the laws explicitly cover      victims of sexual assault or stalking.       (26) Only 6 States provide domestic violence victims with      leave from work to go to court, to the doctor, or to take      other steps to address the domestic violence in their lives,      and only Maine provides such leave to victims of sexual      assault and stalking.       (27) No States prohibit employment discrimination against      victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.      Five States provide limited protection to some victims under      certain circumstances.       (28) Employees, including individuals participating in      welfare to work programs, may need to take time during      business hours to--       (A) obtain orders of protection;       (B) seek medical or legal assistance, counseling, or other      services; or       (C) look for housing in order to escape from domestic      violence.       (29) Domestic and sexual violence victims have been      subjected to discrimination by private and State employers,      including discrimination motivated by sex and stereotypic      notions about women.       (30) Domestic violence victims and third parties who help      them have been subjected to discriminatory practices by      health, life, disability, and property and casualty insurers      and employers who self-insure employee benefits who have      denied or canceled coverage, rejected claims, and raised      rates based on domestic violence. Although some State      legislatures have tried to address these problems, the scope      of protection afforded by the laws adopted varies from State      to State, with many failing to address the problem      comprehensively. Moreover, Federal law prevents States from      protecting the almost 40 percent of employees whose employers      self-insure employee benefits.       (31) Existing Federal law does not explicitly--       (A) authorize victims of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work      to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or      assistance with safety planning activities;       (B) address the eligibility of victims of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for      unemployment compensation;       (C) prohibit employment discrimination against actual or      perceived victims of domestic violence, dating violence,      sexual assault, or stalking; or       (D) prohibit insurers and employers who self-insure      employee benefits from discriminating against domestic      violence victims and those who help them in determining      eligibility, rates charged, and standards for payment of      claims; nor does it prohibit insurers from disclosure of      information about abuse and the victim's location through      insurance databases and other means.
