President, I have been working with representatives of the aviation industry on legislation that will address a problem with the Federal Aviation Administration. Let me, first of all, say that back in real life I have been a professional pilot for some 40 years. I am a little bothered, too, at some of the things taking place in the aviation industry. I have seen great injustice done many, many times, having to do with the emergency revocation powers of the FAA. In a revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate immediately, without an intermediary review by an impartial third party. The result is that the certificate holder is grounded and, in most cases, is out of work until the issue is adjudicated. I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. A more reasonable approach, Mr. President, when safety is not an issue, would be to adjudicate the revocation on a nonemergency basis, allowing the certificate holder to continue use of his certificate.  Please don't misunderstand me. In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that the FAA can ground unsafe airmen and other certificate holders. However, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of this extraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency powers as standard procedure rather than an extraordinary measure.  Perhaps the most visible case is that of Bob Hoover, who happens to probably be the best pilot in America today. He is up in age. I have watched him and have been in a plane with him. He can set a glass of water on the panel of an airplane and do a barrel roll without spilling any of the water. He is highly regarded as an aerobatic pilot. In 1992, his medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions regarding his cognitive abilities. After getting a clean bill of health from four separate sets of doctors--just one of the many tests cost Bob $1,700--and over the continuing objections of the Federal air surgeon, who never even examined Bob Hoover personally, his medical certificate was reinstated only after then-Administrator David Henson intervened. And I want to take this opportunity to tell David Henson what a great job he did for aviation, and for one person.  Unfortunately, Bob Hoover is not out of the woods yet.  His current medical certificate expires on September 30, 1997. Unlike most airmen who can renew their medical certificate with a routine application and exam, Bob has to furnish the FAA with a report of a neurological evaluation every 12 months.  It is a very expensive and unnecessary process.  Mr. President, Bob Hoover's experience is just one of many. In a way, his wasn't as bad, because some of them do this--like professional airline pilots--for a living.  I have several other examples of pilots who have had their licenses revoked on an emergency basis. Pilots such as Ted Stewart who has been an American Airlines pilot for more than 12 years and is presently a Boeing 767 captain. Until January 1995, Mr. Stewart had no complaints registered against him or his flying. In January 1995 the FAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining authority as part of a larger FAA effort to respond to a problem of falsified ratings. The full NTSB board exonerated Mr. Stewart in July 1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the charges in this second revocation involved falsification of records for a flight instructor certificate with multiengined rating and his air transport pilot [ATP] certificate dating back to 1979.  Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17\1/2\-year-old violation could constitute an emergency; especially, since he has not been cited for any cause in the intervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA vigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its decision in this second revocation and found for Mr. Stewart. A couple of comments in the Stewart decision bear closer examination. First, the board notes that:       The administrator's loss in the earlier case appears to      have prompted further investigation of respondent . . .  I find this rather troubling that an impartial third party appears to be suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart. This is further emphasized with a footnote in which the Board notes:       [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the      Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency      certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in      this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no      legitimate reason is cited or appears for not consolidating      all alleged violations into one proceeding, subjecting an      airman in the space of a year to two emergency revocations,      and thus to the financial and other burdens associated with      an additional 60-day grounding without prior notice and      hearing, constitutes an abusive and unprincipled discharge of      an extraordinary power.  Joining with me today is John Breaux of Louisiana. John has a constituent, Frank Anders who has taken the lead gathering other examples of FAA abuses with regard to their emergency revocation authority. One in particular is Raymond A. Williamson who was a pilot for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Like Ted Stewart, he was accused of being part of a ring of pilots who falsified type records for vintage aircraft.  As in all of the cases received by my office, Mr. Williamson biggest concern is that the FAA investigation and subsequent revocation came out of the blue. In November 1994, he was notified by his employer--Coca-Cola--that FAA inspectors had accused him of giving illegal check rides in company owned aircraft. He was fired. In June 1995, he received an emergency order of revocation. In over 30 years as an active pilot, he had never had an accident, incident, or violation. Nor had he ever been counseled by the FAA for any action or irregularities as a pilot, flight instructor or FAA designated pilot examiner.  In May 1996, FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings, except his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case, it would appear that FAA found no real reason pursue an emergency revocation.  Mr. President, I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the NTSB board, but I believe a reasonable person would conclude that in the Ted Stewart case the Board, believes as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA.  This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989, emergency cases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more than doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, 66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases, of those 160 were emergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice.  In response, I and Senators Craig, Hutchinson, and Breaux are introducing legislation that would establish a procedure by which the FAA must show just cause for bringing an emergency revocation action against a certificate holder. Many within the aviation community have referred to this needed legislation as the Hoover bill.  Not surprisingly, Mr. President, the FAA opposes this language. They also opposed changes to the civil penalties program where they served as the judge, jury, and executioner in civil penalty actions against airmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that so that airmen can now appeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well because the NTSB has a clear understanding of the issues.  Our proposal allows an airman within 48 hours of receiving an emergency revocation order to request a hearing before the NTSB on the emergency nature of the revocation. NTSB then has 48 hours to hear the arguments. Within 5 days of the initial request, NTSB must decide if a true emergency exists. During this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect.  That means that the pilot does not have his certificate and cannot fly an airplane. In many cases, this is a means of a living. But that is for 7 days.  In other words, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate for a maximum of 7 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency does not exist, then the certificate would be returned and the certificate holder could continue to use it while the FAA pursued their revocation case against him in an expedited appeal process as provided for by the bill. If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then the emergency revocation remains in effect and the certificate holder cannot use his certificate while the case is adjudicated.  This bill is supported by: the Air Line Pilots Association, International; the Air Transport Association; the Allied Pilots Association, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; the Experimental Aircraft Association; National Air Carrier Association; National Air Transportation Association; National Business Aircraft Association; the NTSB Bar Association; and the Regional Airline Association.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 11, 1997, to me from the above mentioned organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 11, 1997.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: The undersigned associations and      organizations endorse and support your proposed legislation,      the FAA Emergency Revocation Act of 1997, to reform the      Federal Aviation Administration enforcement process in an      important respect.       It has become apparent to us in recent years that the FAA      has significantly increased its use of its emergency      authority to immediately suspend or revoke airmen, air      carrier, and air agency certificates, thereby avoiding the      automatic stay of such action provided by law pending appeal      to the National Transportation Safety Board. This legislation      will accord due process to certificate holders by providing a      more adequate forum for promptly adjudicating the      appropriateness of the FAA's use of this authority. The      forum, the same one which will adjudicate the merits of the      FAA action, will also adjudicate, on a more timely basis,      whether aviation safety requires the immediate effectiveness      of a certificate action. The effect will be that in an      appropriate case, a certificate holder will be able to      exercise the privileges of its certificate while an FAA      certificate action is on appeal, all without compromise of      aviation safety.       We thank you for introducing this legislation, and we look      forward to working with you toward its passage.           Sincerely,         Air Line Pilots Association, International; Allied Pilots            Association; Experimental Aircraft Association;            National Air Transportation Association; NTSB Bar            Association; Air Transport Association; AOPA            Legislative Action; National Air Carrier Association;            National Business Aircraft Association; Regional            Airline Association.
