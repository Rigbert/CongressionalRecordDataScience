I will begin.  I join with Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in urging passage of S. 151, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, a bill providing important new tools to fight child pornography. I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership and his unflagging efforts to protect our nation's childrenfrom exploitation by child pornographers.  When Senator Hatch and I introduced this bill last month, I supported passing a bill that was identical to the measure that we worked so hard on in the last Congress. That bill had passed the Judiciary Committee and the Senate unanimously in the 107th Congress. It did not become law last year because, even though the Senate was still meeting, considering and passing legislation, the House of Representatives had adjourned and would not return to take action on this measure that had passed the Senate unanimously or to work out our differences.  As I said when we introduced the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act and again as the Judiciary Committee considered this measure, although this bill is not perfect, it is a good faith effort to provide powerful tools for prosecutors to deal with the problem of child pornography within constitutional limits. We failed to do that in the 1996 Child Pornography Prevention Act--``CPPA'', much of which the Supreme Court struck down last year. We must not make the same mistake again. The last thing we want to do is to create years of legal limbo for our nation's children, after which the courts strike down yet another law as unconstitutional.  I also said at our Judiciary Committee meeting that I hoped we could pass the bill in the same form as it unanimously passed in the last Congress. That is still my position and I believe it would have been wiser to proceed in that manner. Since my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Administration have jointly decided not to follow this route, however, I have nevertheless continued to work with Senator Hatch to craft the strongest bill possible that will produce convictions that will stick under the constitution.  I urge the Senate to pass this legislation, and I strongly urge the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to take this second opportunity to pass this important legislation in the form that we send to them. I urge the Administration to support this bipartisan measure, instead of using this debate as an opportunity to add more changes that strive to make an ideological statement, but which may not withstand Constitutional scrutiny and may bog down the bill. If we act in a bipartisan manner, we can have a bill to the President that can begin working for America's children in short order.  I want to take a moment to speak again about the history of this important bill and the joint effort that it took to get to this point. In May of 2002, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition ``Free Speech''. Although there were some others who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I believed that unlike legislative language proposed by the Administration in the last Congress, it was a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment.  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect our children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be an easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law that will both do that and will produce convictions that stick. In 1996, when we passed the CPPA many warned us that certain provisions of that Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's decision last year in Free Speech has proven them correct.  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court's decision. It is just as important, however, that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the CPPA, this time we should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They deserve a law that will last rather than be stricken from the law books.  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of real children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law with real bite, not one with false teeth.  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act in the 107th Congress, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress, I convened a hearing on October 2, 2002 on the legislation. We heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children--``NCMEC'', and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill supported by the Administration would not.  I then placed the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I continued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was unable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my colleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation.  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in October, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute to the bill that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and state law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate floor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, every single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--so similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. Unfortunately, they did not. Facing the recess before the mid-term elections, we were stymied again.  Even after the last election, however, during our lame duck session, I continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through the Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called a meeting of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, 2002. In the last meeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th Congress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda yet again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee amended and approved this legislation. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the victim shield provision that I authored.  Although I did not agree with certain of Senator Hatch's amendments, because I thought that they risked having the bill declared unconstitutional, I nevertheless both called for the Committee to approve the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. That is the legislative process. I compromised on some issues, and Senator Hatch compromised on others. Even though the bill was not exactly as either of us would have wished, we both worked fervently to seek its passage.  I sought, the same day as the bill unanimously passed the Judiciary Committee, to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act as reported, and I worked with Senator Hatch to clear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased that the Senate did pass the bill by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch for all he did to help clear the bill for passage in the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, the House failed to act on this measure last year and the Administration decided not to push for passage. If they had, we could have passed a bill, sent it to the President, and already had a new law on the books.  Instead, we were forced to repeat the entire process again, and I am here again with Senator Hatch asking yet again that this bill be enacted. I am glad to have been able to work hand-in-hand with Senator Hatch on the PROTECT Act because, it is a bill that gives prosecutors and investigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious problem. Let me outline some of the bill's important provisions:  Section 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who distribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice children to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carries a 15 year maximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for repeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child pornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's recent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This provision isnarrower than the old ``pandering'' definition in at least one way that responds to a specific Court criticism. The new crime only applies to the people who actually pander the child pornography or solicit it, not to all those who possess the material ``downstream'' and it requires the government to demonstrate that the defendant acted with the specific intent that the material is believed to be child pornography. The bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing Commission which asks it to distinguish between those who pander or distribute such material and those who only ``solicit'' the material. As with narcotics cases, distributors and producers are more culpable than users and should be more harshly punished for maximum deterrent effect.  I would have liked for the pandering provision to be crafted more narrowly so that ``purported'' material was not included and so that all pandering prosecutions would be linked to ``obscenity'' doctrine. That is the way that Senator Hatch and I originally wrote and introduced this provision in the last Congress. Unfortunately, the amendment process has resulted in some expansions to this once non-controversial provision that may subject it to a constitutional challenge. Thus, while it responds to some specific concerns raised by the Supreme Court there are constitutional issues that the courts will have to seriously consider with respect to this provision. I will discuss these issues later.  Second, the bill creates a new crime that I proposed to take direct aim at one of the chief evils of child pornography: namely, its use by sexual predators to entice minors either to engage in sexual activity or the production of more child pornography. This was one of the compelling arguments made by the government before the Supreme Court in support of the CPPA, but the Court rejected that argument as an insufficient basis to ban the production, distribution or possession of ``virtual'' child pornography. This bill addresses that same harm in a more targeted and narrowly tailored manner. It creates a new felony, which applies to both actual and virtual child pornography, for people who use such material to entice minors to participate in illegal activity. This will provide prosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who prey upon children using such pornography B whether the child pornography is virtual or not.  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense in child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the Supreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to the prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly to criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally to those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those who actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, again responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense that no actual children were used in the production of the child pornography--i.e. that it was made using computers. At the same time, this provision protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of this affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give advance notice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are currently required to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity defense. As a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it effects the real way that these important trials are conducted. With the provision, the government will have sufficient notice to marshal the expert testimony that may be needed to rebut this ``virtual porn'' defense in cases where real children were victimized.  This improved affirmative defense measure also provides important support for the constitutionality of much of this bill after the Free Speech decision. Even Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would be a key factor for him. This is one reason for making the defense applicable to all non-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256. In the bill's current form, however, the affirmative defense is not available in one of the new proposed classes of virtual child pornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252B(b)(2). This omission may render that provision unconstitutional under the First Amendment, and I hope that, as the legislative process continues, we can work to improve the bill in this and other ways. I do not want to be here again in five years, after yet another Supreme Court decision striking this law down.  The bill also provides needed assistance to prosecutors in rebutting the virtual porn defense by removing a restriction on the use of records of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit conduct that are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, and expanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which will be helpful in proving that the material in question is not ``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography and obscenity prosecutions under this Act. The purpose of this provision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is important that prosecutors have access to this information in both child pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's recent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography laws, making more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be important tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, the Act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further deterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of the records.  Next, the Hatch-Leahy bill contains several provisions altering the definition of ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech case. One approach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' requirement to the child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene child pornography--real and virtual; minor and `youthful-adult;' simulated and real--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge because obscene speech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller obscenity test, such material (1) ``appeals to the prurient interest,'' (2) is utterly ``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and (3) has absolutely no serious ``literary, artistic or scientific value.''  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, like the new Sec. 2252B(b)(1) and, to a lesser extent the new Sec. 2252B(b)(2), which I crafted with Senator Hatch. Other provisions, however, take a different approach. Specifically, the CPPA's definition of ``identifiable minor'' has been modified in the bill to include a prong for persons who are ``virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor.'' This adopts language from Justice O'Connor's concurrence in the Free Speech case. Thus, while this language is defensible, I predict that this provision will be the center of much constitutional debate. Although I will explain in more detail later, these new definitional provisions risk crossing the constitutional line. I am not alone in this view and ask to have supporting letters from constitutional experts printed in the record.  This bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to increase jail sentences in cases where children are victimized by sexual predators. First, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of child sex offenses by expanding the predicate crimes which trigger tough, mandatory minimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to address a disturbing disparity in the current Sentencing Guidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually travels across state lines to have sex with a child are not as high as for child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight immediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual predators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to protect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and those who otherwise exploit children.  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also has several provisions designed to protect the children who are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy of the children must be paramount. It is important that they not be victimized yet again in the criminal process. This bill provides for the first time ever an explicit shield law that prohibits the name or other non physical identifying information of the child victim (other than the age or approximate age) from being admitted at any child pornography trial. It is also intended that judges can and will take appropriate steps to ensure that such information as the child's name, address or otheridentifying information not be publicly disclosed during the pretrial phase of the case or at sentencing as well. The bill also contains a provision requiring the judge to instruct the jury, upon request of the government, that no inference should be drawn against the United States because of information inadmissible under the new shield law.  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also amends certain reporting provisions governing child pornography. Specifically, it allows federal authorities to report information they receive from the Center from Missing and Exploited Children, (``CMEC''), to state and local police without a court order. In addition, the bill removes the restrictions under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, (ECPA) for reporting the contents of, and information pertaining to, a subscriber of stored electronic communications to the CMEC when a mandatory child porn report is filed with the CMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032.  While this change may invite rogue federal, state or local agents to try to circumvent all subpoena and court order requirements under ECPA and allow them to obtain subscriber emails and information by triggering the initial report to the CMEC themselves, it should be well understood that this is not the intention behind this provision. These important safeguards are not being altered in any way, and a deliberate use of the tip line by a government agent to circumvent the well established statutory requirements of these provisions would be a serious violation of the law. Nevertheless, we should still consider further clarification to guard against subverting the safeguards in ECPA from government officials going on fishing expeditions for stored electronic communications under the rubric of child porn investigations.  As I made clear when this bill was introduced, I continue to express my disappointment in the Department of Justice information sharing regulations related to the CMEC tip line. According to a recent Government Accounting Office, (GAO) report, due to outdated turf mentalities, the Attorney General's regulations exclude both the United States Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service from direct access to important tip line information. That is totally unacceptable, especially in the post 9-11 world where the importance of information sharing is greater than ever. How can the Administration justify support of this Hatch-Leahy bill, which allows state and local law enforcement officers such access, when they are simultaneously refusing to allow other federal law enforcement agencies access to the same information? I made this request in my statement when we introduced this bill, but once more I urge the Attorney General to end this unseemly turf battle and to issue regulations allowing both the Secret Service and the Postal Inspection Service, who both perform valuable work in investigating these cases, to have access to this important information so that they can better protect our nation's children.  The Hatch-Leahy bill also provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction where a defendant induces a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct outside the United States for the purposes of producing child pornography which they intend to transport to the United States. The provision is crafted to require the intent of actual transport of the material into the United States, unlike the House bill from the last Congress, which criminalized even an intent to make such material ``accessible.'' Under that overly broad wording, any material posted on a web site internationally could be covered, whether or not it was ever intended that the material be downloaded in the United States. Under the bill we consider today, however, proof of a specific intent to send such material to the United States is required.  Finally, the bill provides a new private right of action for the victims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including injunctive relief and punitive damages that will help to put those who produce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership on this provision and his recognition that such punitive damages provisions are important means of deterring misconduct. These provisions are important, practical tools to put child pornographers out of business for good and in jail where they belong.  As I mentioned previously, the PROTECT Act is a good faith effort to tackle the child pornography problem, and I have supported its passage from the outset. I am also glad that because of our bipartisan cooperation, Senator Hatch and I were able to offer a joint amendment in Committee that strengthened the bill further against constitutional attack. Here are some of the improvements that we jointly made to the bill as introduced.  The Hatch-Leahy amendment created a new specific intent requirement in the pandering crime. The provision is now better focused on the true wrongdoers and requires that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually intended others to believe that the material in question is obscene child pornography. This is a positive step.  The Hatch-Leahy amendment narrowed the definition of ``sexually explicit conduct'' for prosecutions of computer created child pornography. Although I continue to have serious reservations about the constitutionality of prosecuting cases involving such ``virtual child pornography'' after the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech Coalition v. Ashcroft, narrowing the definition of the conduct covered provides another argument that the provision is not as overbroad as the one in the CPPA. I had also proposed a change that contained an even better definition, in order to focus the provision to true ``hard core'' child pornography, and I hope we will consider such a change as the process continues.  The Hatch-Leahy amendment the saved the existing ``anti-morphing'' provision from a fresh constitutional attack by excluding 100% virtual child pornography from its scope. That morphing provision was one of the few measures from the CPPA that the Supreme Court did not strike down last year. I am pleased that we are avoiding placing this measure in constitutional peril in this bill.  The Hatch-Leahy amendment refined the definition of virtual child pornography in the provision that Senator Hatch and I worked together to craft last year, which will be new 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2252B. These provisions rely to a large extent on obscenity doctrine, and thus are more rooted in the constitution than other parts of the bill. I was pleased that the Hatch-Leahy amendments includes in new 2252B(2) a definition that the image be ``graphic''--that is one where the genitalia are actually shown during the sex act for two reasons.  First, because the old law would have required proof of ``actual'' minors in cases with ``virtual'' pictures, I believe that this clarification will remove a potential contradiction from the new law which pornographers could have used to mount a defense. Second, it will provide another argument supporting the law's constitutionality because the new provision is narrowly tailored to cover only the most ``hard core'' child pornography. I am disappointed that we could not include a similar definition in the S. 151's other virtual child pornography provision, which was included at the request of the Administration. I hope that will be considered as this bill moves forward.  The Hatch-Leahy amendment also clarifies that digital pictures are covered by the PROTECT Act, an important addition in today's world of digital cameras and camcorders.  These were important changes, and I was glad to work with Senator Hatch to craft them.  This law is not perfect, however, and I would have liked to see some additional improvements to the bill. Let me outline some of them.  First, regarding the tip line, I would have liked to further clarify that law enforcement agents may not and should not ``tickle the tip line'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). This might have included clarifying 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032 that the initial tip triggering the report may not be generated by the government's investigative agents themselves. A tip line to the CMEC is just that--a way for outsiders to report wrongdoing to the CMEC and the government, not for the government to generate a report to itself without following otherwise required lawful process. It was not the intent of any part of this bill to alter that purpose.  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to ensure that there is an affirmative defense for each new category of child pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in court that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child but only actual, identifiable adults. That will no doubt be a basis for attacking the constitutionality of this law.  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding all these problems were we to take the simple approach of outlawing ``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which we do in one new provision that I suggested. That approach would produce a law beyond any possible challenge. This approach is also supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which we all respect as the true expert in this field.  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions submitted after our hearing, which I will place in the record in its entirety and I quote:       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child      pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and      juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in      criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under      community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any      community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the      prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach      is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.  Based on this letter, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the approach that is least likely to raise constitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one. In short, the obscenity approach is the most narrowly tailored to prevent child pornography. New section 2252B adopts this obscenity approach, but because that is not the approach that other parts of the PROTECT Act uses, I recognize that it contains provisions about which some may have legitimate Constitutional questions.  Specifically, in addition to the provisions that I have already discussed, there were two amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress and one on this Congress to which I objected that are included in the bill as we consider it today. I felt and still feel that these alterations from the original way that Senator Hatch and I introduced the bill needlessly risk a serious constitutional challenge to a bill that provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their jobs, and that the bill would be even stronger than it is now were they changed. Let me discuss my opposition to these changes adopted by the Judiciary Committee in this Congress and the last.  Although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering provision in the PROTECT Act, I did not support two of Senator Hatch's amendments extending the provision to cover (1) ``purported'' material, and (2) material not linked to obscenity.  First, in the last Congress during our markup I objected to an amendment from Senator Hatch to include in the pandering provision ``purported'' material, which criminalizes speech even when there is no underlying material at all--whether obscene or non-obscene, virtual or real, child or adult. The pandering provision is an important tool for prosecutors to punish true child pornographers who for some technical reason are beyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or production statutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking dirty over the internet or the telephone when the person never possesses any material at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.  The original pandering provision in S. 2520 as introduced last Congress was quite broad, and some argued that it presented constitutional problems as written, but I thought that prosecutors needed a strong tool, so I supported Senator Hatch on that provision.  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First Amendment expert, testified at our hearing last year that he thought that the original provision was Constitutional, barely. Unfortunately, Professor Schauer has since written to me stating that this new amendment to include ``purported'' material ``would push well over the constitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of it'' I placed his letter in the record upon introduction of the bill in this Congress on January 13, 2003.  The second amendment to the pandering provision to which I objected expanded it to cover cases not linked in any way to obscenity. It would allow prosecution of anyone who ``presented'' a movie that was intended to cause another person to believe that it included a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, whether or not it was obscene and whether or not any real child was involved. Any person or movie theater that presented films like Traffic, Romeo and Juliet, and American Beauty would be guilty of a felony. The very point of these dramatic works is to cause a person to believe that something is true when in fact it is not. These were precisely the overbreadth concerns that led 7 justices of the Supreme Court to strike down parts of the 1996 Act. We do not want to put child porn convictions on hold while we wait another 6 years to see if the law will survive constitutional scrutiny.  Because these two changes endanger the entire pandering provision, because they are unwise, and because that section is already strong enough to prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I oppose those expansions of the provision and still hope that we can reconsider them.  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing this bill, even when it was introduced last year I expressed concern over certain provisions. One such provision was the new definition of ``identifiable minor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision might ``both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already upheld ``morphing'' section of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that it ``could present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later constitutional challenge.'' Unfortunately, this provision remains problematic and susceptible to constitutional challenge.  As the bill developed, a change to the definition of ``identifiable minor'' expanded it to cover ``virtual'' child pornography--that is, 100% computer generated pictures not involving any real children. For that reason, it presented additional constitutional problems similar to the Administration supported House bill. I objected to this amendment when it was added to the bill in the last Congress in Committee, and I continue to have serious concerns with it now.  The ``identifiable minor'' provision in the PROTECT Act may be used without any link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what potentially saved the original version we introduced in the 107th Congress was that it applied to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision was designed to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or altered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child involved.  The change adopted in the Judiciary Committee last year and supported by the Administration, however, redefined ``identifiable minor'' by creating a new category of pornography for any ``computer generated image that is virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor'' dislodged, in my view, that sole constitutional anchor. The new provision could be read to include images that never involved real children at all but were 100 percent computer generated.  That was not the original goal of this provision, and that was the reason it was constitutional. There are other provisions in this bill that deal with obscene virtual child pornography that I support, such as those in new section 2252B, which are linked to obscenity doctrine. This provision, however, was intended to ease the prosecutor's burden in cases where images of real children were cleverly altered to avoid prosecution. By changing the identifiable minor provision into a virtual porn provision, the Administration has needlessly endangered its constitutionality.  For these reasons, I was glad to work alongside Senator Hatch to narrow this provision before the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, I fear we did not do everything possible to strengthen it against constitutional attack. Let me explain.  Although the Hatch-Leahy amendment adopted in Committee included aslightly narrower definition of sexually explicit conduct and excluded cartoons, sculptures, paintings, anatomical models and the like, the virtual porn provision still sweeps quite broadly and is potentially vague. New section 2252A(2)(B)(i) lumps in such truly ``hard core'' sexual activities such as intercourse, bestiality, and s in with simple lascivious exhibition of the genitals and simulated intercourse where any part of a breast is shown. Equating such disparate types of conduct, however, does not mesh with community standards and is precisely the type of ``one size fits all'' approach that the Supreme Court rejected in the area of virtual pornography in the Free Speech case. The contrast between this broad definition and the tighter definition in new Section 2252B(b)(2), crafted by Senator Hatch and myself, is striking. In fact, I suggested that we include the same definition of ``graphic'' conduct found in new section 2252B in the new Section 2252A virtual child porn provision to better focus it on hard core conduct. Unfortunately, the Administration rejected that proposal and the provision may be open to overbreadth attacks.  I also believe that there is a vagueness concern in the new statute 2252A because, while it is clearly aimed at ``virtual'' child pornography (where no real children are involved), it still requires ``actual'' conduct. In the realm of computer generated images, however, the distinction between actual and simulated conduct makes no sense. It is so vague and confusing that I fear that clever defendants might seek to argue that this new provision still requires proof ``actual'' sexual acts involving real children. I hope that this language is further clarified in order to address these concerns.  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child pornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it involves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, whether or not we agree with it.  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. But regardless of our personal views, any law must be within constitutional limits or it does no good at all. The amended identifiable minor provision, which would include most ``virtual child pornography'' in the definition of child pornography, in my view, crosses the constitutional line, however, and needlessly risks protracted litigation that could assist child pornographers in escaping punishment.  Another new provision in the bill includes a mandatory directive to the United States Sentencing Commission to establish penalties for these new crimes at certain levels. In my experience, however, the non-partisan Sentencing Commission operates best when it is allowed to study an issue carefully and come up with a particular sentencing guideline based upon its expertise in these matters. In fact, in child pornography cases the Sentencing Commission has established appropriately high penalties in the past, and there is no reason to believe that it would not do so again with respect to these new laws.  While most all of the provisions of the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act are designed to withstand constitutional scrutiny, unfortunately legal experts could not vouch for the constitutionality of the bill supported by the Administration in the last Congress, which seemed to challenge the Supreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints spelled out by the Supreme Court. That proposal and the associated House bill from the 107th Congress simply ignored the Supreme Court's decision, reflecting an ideological response rather than a carefully drawn bill that would stand up to scrutiny.  I supported passage of the PROTECT Act as Senator Hatch and I introduced it and as it passed the Senate unanimously in the last Senate. Even so, I was willing to work with him to further amend the bill in the Judiciary Committee. Some amendments that we considered in committee I supported because they improved the bill. Others went too far.  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of making progress I support consideration and passage of the measure in its current form. I hope that we can work to further improve this bill so that it has the best possible chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more important to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media report on this legislation at the end of the last Congress reported the wide consensus that the Hatch-Leahy bill was more likely than the House bill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as stating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have created better legislation.''  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' right now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of litigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim period before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of Congress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what the PROTECT Act seeks to accomplish.  Even though this bill is not perfect, I am glad to stand with Senator Hatch to secure its approval by the Senate as I did in the last Congress. The floor statements, including my statement today and the statement and material I placed in the Congressional Record on introduction of this bill on January 13, 2003, will be important to the legislative history of this matter, and so I seek consent to place letters from experts in the record commenting upon aspects of the bill. Creating a comprehensive record is especially important for statutes that face constitutional challenges, as this law nearly certainly will.  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I have been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I do not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is how legislation is normally passed. I hope that the administration and the House do not decide to play politics with this issue and seek further changes that could bog the bill down. I urge swift consideration and passage of this important bill as it is currently written. It is aimed at protecting our Nation's children.  Just to further explain my support for this measure and to reiterate, let me continue. As I said when we introduced the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, again, as the Judiciary Committee considered this measure, although the bill is not perfect, and on this subject it is difficult to get a perfect bill, it is a good-faith effort to provide powerful tools for prosecutors to deal with the problem of child pornography within constitutional limits. We failed to do that in 1996 with the Child Pornography Prevention Act, much of which the Supreme Court struck down last year.  I hope we would not make the same mistake again. The last thing we want to do is to create years of legal limbo for our Nation's children, after which the courts strike down yet another law as unconstitutional.  I also said at our Judiciary Committee meeting that I hoped we could pass the bill in the same form as unanimously passed in the last Congress. That is still my position. I believe it would have been wiser to have proceeded in that manner. Since my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, at the request of the administration, have decided not to follow this route, I have nevertheless continued to work with Senator Hatch to craft the strongest bill possible to produce convictions that will stick under the Constitution.  In my years as a prosecutor, I learned that it was important to make sure that any cases we brought were based on legislation that was constitutional in the first place so the prosecution would stick.  I urge the Senate to pass the Hatch-Leahy bill, and I urge the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to take the second opportunity to pass this important legislation. As I said earlier, the Senate did pass it last year. The other body did not take up our bill.  I also urge the administration to support this bipartisan measure. It is not a partisan issue to be against child pornographers. We are all against child pornographers, Republican or Democrats. Those who are parents or grandparents feel very strongly the desire to pass this legislation. If we act in a bipartisan manner we can have a bill to the President that begins working toprotect America's children, and we can do it in very short order.  Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. It is easy enough for people to stand up and say they are against child pornographers, as though anyone here would be for them. But it is one thing to have a press conference and another thing to give to prosecutors tools they can use. Our children deserve a law that will last rather than one that is passed to make political points but will be struck down as unconstitutional.  Let me describe a few of the provisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill. Section 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who distribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice children to do illegal acts. The bill creates a new crime that I propose to take direct aim at one of the chief evils of child pornography; namely, its use by sexual predators to entice minors to either engage in sexual activity or other crimes. This 15-year felony will provide prosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who actually prey upon children in using such pornography.  Next, this bill revamps existing affirmative defense of child pornography cases, both in response to criticisms of the Supreme Court. As a former prosecutor, I made sure that the provision is drafted to protect prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of affirmative defense by requiring a defendant give advance notice of his intent to assert.  Frankly, what I did was put myself in the position of what prosecutors would have to do to get convictions. I tried to make sure by the provisions I put into this bill, that prosecutors would have the tools to give them the best chance to get such convictions.  Next, the Hatch-Leahy bill contains several provisions altering the definition of child pornography in response to the free speech case in allowing prosecution of virtual or computer-created child porn. Some such provisions take the traditional obscenity approach, like the new section 2252(b) which I crafted with Senator Hatch. Other provisions, however, take a broader approach as advocated by the administration last year. I predict this provision will be the center of much constitutional debate. I am afraid that some in the administration were more eager to have a debating point than they were to have something on which prosecutors could rely.  The bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to increase jail sentences in cases where victims are actually sexually victimized by sexual predators. The bill requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to address what I believe is a disturbing disparity in the current sentencing guidelines.  What is disturbing to me is that the current sentences for a person who actually travels across State lines to have sex with a child are not as high as they are for child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight immediately so prosecutors can take such dangerous sexual predators off the streets.  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also has several provisions designed to protect the children who are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy of the children must be paramount. Unfortunately, sometimes, if you drag the name of a child who has been the victim of a sexual predator out into the public, then they are victimized yet again, even as you go after the predator. The bill provides for the first time ever an explicit shield law that prohibits a name or other nonphysical identifying information of the child victim from being admitted at child pornography trials.  Finally, the bill provides a new private right of action for the victims of child pornography. This is something we have not done before in this arena. This provision has real teeth. It includes injunctive relief and punitive damages to help put those who produce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator Hatch for his recognition that punitive damage provisions are an important means for deterring misconduct.  Some of these people think if they just move from place to place and nothing happens to them, they are free. If they know that whatever profits they make are gone and they are going to have punitive damages assessed and still may face, on top of that, criminal action, then they will think twice. These are important, practical tools not only to put child pornographers out of business but to put them in jail.  The law is not perfect. As I said, I wish we had adopted the version that had unanimously passed the Senate last Congress, that all Republicans and Democrats supported. That was the decision made by the majority not to do that.  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding all problems if we were to take the simple approach of outlawing obscene child pornography of all types. The reason I say that is because of the experts in this area, and it is a very difficult area, agree. This approach is supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I think we all respect them as true experts on protecting the children. I wish we had followed their approach.  Following, again, is an excerpt from the answer to the Senator's written questions submitted after a hearing and I quote:       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100 percent) of all      child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges      and juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable      doubt in criminal cases. . . .       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the      prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach      is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited children, the approach least likely to raise constitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an effective one.  Because certain provisions do not follow this approach, I recognize that some may have legitimate constitutional questions about provisions in this act. These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interests of making progress, I support consideration and passage of the measure in its current form, and I hope we can work to improve the bill so it has the best possible chance of withstanding a constitutional challenge.  The bill is not perfect but I am glad to stand with Senator Hatch to secure its approval by the Senate, as I did in the last Congress.  I know I speak for the Senator from Utah that the thing both of us want is that we have a bill that can be used by those attacking pornographers, prosecutors attacking pornographers, that will stand up in court. It is not a case of there are people for or against child pornographers. We are all against them. But we want to make sure for the prosecutor, if you sue them, if you seek injunctive relief if you prosecute, that you win.  I believe this issue is so important that I have been willing to compromise and to support a measure, even though I do not agree with each and every provision it contains. I hope the administration, and the other body, do not decide to play politics with this issue and seek further changes that could bog down the bill. Had they allowed the bill to go forward last year, the one Senator Hatch and I brought to the floor of the Senate and passed unanimously, we would have a bill in law--a law on the books today. But I urge swift consideration and passage of this important bill as it is currently written. It is aimed at protecting our Nation's children.  It is important we do all we can to end the victimization of real children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass a law that will withstand first amendment scrutiny. We need a law with real bite, not one with false teeth.  I ask unanimous consent to have expert views on this legislation printed in the Record, in addition to the supporting letters and materials to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       National Center for Missing                                       and Exploited Children,                                                 October 17, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for the opportunity to      express the views of the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children on these critically important issues for      our nation's children. Your stewardship of the Committee's      tireless efforts to craft a statute that will withstand      constitutional scrutiny is wise and in the long-term best      interest of the nation. The National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children is grateful for your leadership on this      issue.       Please find below my response to your written questions      submitted on October 9, 2002 regarding the ``Stopping Child      Pornography: Protecting our Children and the Constitution.''       1. Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all      child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges      and juries, even under the standard of beyond a reasonable      doubt in criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person      under community standards model, it is highly unlikely that      any community would not find child pornography obscene.       There is a legitimate concern that the obscenity standard      does not fully recognize, and therefore punish the      exceptional harm to children inherent in child pornography.      This issue can be addressed by the enactment of tougher      sentencing provisions if the obscenity standard is      implemented in the law regarding child pornography. Moreover,      mere possession of obscene materials under current law in      most jurisdictions is not a criminal violation. If the      obscenity standard were implemented for child pornography the      legislative intent should be clear concerning punishment for      possession of child obscene pornography.       In the post--Free Speech decision legal climate the      prosecution of child pornography cases under an obscenity      approach is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.       2. Based on my experience all the images in actual criminal      cases meet the lawful definition of obscenity, irrespective      of what community you litigate the case. In my experience      there has never been a visual depiction of child pornography      that did not meet the constitutional requirements for      obscenity.       3. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports the correction of this sentencing disparity      and welcomes the provision of additional tools for federal      judges to remove these predators from our communities. These      types of offenders belong to a demographic that is the      highest percentile in terms of recidivism than any other      single offender category.       4. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports language that allows only ``non-government      sources'' to provide tips to the CyberTipline. The role of      the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing and      Exploited Children is to provide tips received from the      public and Electronic Communication Services communities and      make them available to appropriate law enforcement agencies.      Due in part to the overwhelming success of the system and in      part to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, federal law      enforcement resources cannot address all of the legitimate      tips and leads received by the CyberTipline. Allowing the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and      appropriate federal agencies to forward this valuable      information to state and local law enforcement while at the      same time addressing legitimate privacy concerns is fully      supported.       5. The victim shield provision is an excellent and timely      policy initiative and one that is fully supported by the      National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This      provision should allow the narrow exception to a general non-     disclosure clause that anticipates the need for law      enforcement and prosecutors to use the victim's photography      and other relevant information for the sole purpose of      verification and authentication of an actual child victim in      future cases. This exception would allow the successful      prosecution of other cases that may involve a particular      victim and still provide the protection against the re-     victimization by the criminal justice system.       6. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      fully supports extending the terms of authorized supervised      release in federal cases involving in exploitation of minors.      The evidence for extended supervision in such cases is      overwhelming. Without adequate treatment and continued      supervision, there is a significantly higher risk for re-     offending by this type of offender. Moreover, thee is a      significant link between those offenders who possess child      pornography and those who sexually assault children. Please      see the attached studies that the National Center for Missing      and Exploited Children has produced on these issues.       Thank you again for the opportunity to address these      important issues. Should you need further input or assistance      please contact us at your convenience.           Sincerely,                                                    Daniel Armagh,     Director, Legal Resource Division.                                  ____                                                     May 13, 2002.     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern      with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of      Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in      Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No.      00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed      legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene      nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly      targets images that do not involve real human beings at all).      Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same      infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at      issue in Ashcroft.       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel      toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate      efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in      Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act      within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the      bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.           Respectfully submitted,       Jodie L. Kelley, Partner, Jenner and Block, LLC,      Washington, DC.

Re S. 2520.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement      and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday,      October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to      comment on the constitutional implications of changing the      current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in      Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to      ``purported material.''       In my opinion the change would push well over the      constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against      that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of      it.       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme      Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling      decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in      2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be      an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the      offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child      pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition      in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five      years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision,      however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as      commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of      an unlawful product or service is not protected by the      Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made      clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press      v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is      important to recognize, however, that this feature of      commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial      speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is      fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not      applicable here, of immediate incitement.       The implication of this is that moving away from      communication that could be described as an actual commercial      advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to      defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if      advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all      (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a      substantial risk that the change moves the entire section      away from the straight commercial speech category into more      general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy.      Because the existing arguments for the constitutionally of      this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech      Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a      straight offer to engage in commercial transaction increases      the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including      ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks      less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and      thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlined in my      written statement and oral testimony.       I hope that this is helpful.           Yours sincerely,                                            Frederick Schauer,                                          Frank Stranton Professor                                           of the First Amendment.
