 Many Iraqis appear to have embraced the election and I, as so many others, was encouraged to see millions of them exercise their right to vote. But this past weekend's vote also really pushes to the forefront an important question back here, right here at home, about what we are doing to take care of the thousands of American soldiers who are serving us so honorably in this still very dangerous country.  Just before the elections, several news outlets reported that the Army had decided to keep our troops at their current level in Iraq for at least another 2 years. I have one of those stories here from the Tuesday, January 25, edition of the Washington Post. It is headlined, ``Army plans to keep Iraq troop level through '06.''  I want to read a portion of that story. It says:       With the Pentagon having relied heavily on reservists to      fill out deployments to Iraq, military officers have warned      recently that the pool of available part-time soldiers is      dwindling. By later this year, when the Army is scheduled to      begin its fourth rotation of troops since the invasion in      March 2003, all 15 of the National Guard's most readily      deployable brigades will have been mobilized.       Although other Guard troops remain and could be tapped for      Iraq duty, they belong to units that historically have not      received the same priority in equipping and training as the      brigades chosen to go in the rotations so far.       ``It doesn't mean that the cupboard is bare,'' Lovelace      said. ``It just becomes a challenge then for the National      Guard.''       As the Army reaches farther down in the reserve force,      Lovelace said, the amount of ``pre-mobilization'' time      necessary to get the troops ready to send to Iraq is likely      to increase.       ``We're not going to send anybody into combat who is not      trained and ready'' the three-star general said. But he noted      that already in each rotation, the amount of pre-mobilization      time required has increased.       To continue to be able to draw on the better trained      reservists, Army officials have said they are considering      petitioning Rumsfeld to extend the 24-month limit on the      total time a reservist could be caned to active duty.  Madam President, I ask that the full text of the story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2005]Army Plans To Keep Iraq Troop Level Through '06--Year-Long Active-Duty                        Stints Likely To Continue                          (By Bradley Graham)       The U.S. Army expects to keep its troop strength in Iraq at      the current level of about 120,000 for at least two more      years, according to the Army's top operations officer.       While allowing for the possibility that the levels could      decrease or increase depending on security conditions and      other factors, Lt. Gen. James J. Lovelace Jr. told reporters      yesterday that the assumption of little change through 2006      represents ``the most probable case.''       Recent disclosures that the Pentagon plans to beef up      training of Iraqi security forces and press them into action      more quickly has fueled speculation that the Bush      administration could be preparing to reduce the number of      U.S. troops significantly this year. As more Iraqi troops      join the fight, the thinking goes, U.S. troops could begin to      withdraw.       But Lovelace's remarks indicated that the Army is not yet      counting on any such reduction. Indeed, the general said, the      Army expects to continue rotating active-duty units in and      out of Iraq in year-long deployments and is looking for ways      to dip even deeper into reserve forces--even as leaders ofthe      reserves have warned that the Pentagon could be running out      of such units.       ``We're making the assumption that the level of effort is      going to continue,'' Lovelace said.       In a related development, Senate and House aides said      yesterday that the White House will announce today plans to      request an additional $80 billion to finance the wars in Iraq      and Afghanistan. That would come on top of $25 billion      already appropriated for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.      White House budget spokesman Chad Kolton declined to comment.       White House budget director Joshua B. Bolten is to describe      the package to lawmakers today, but the budget request will      come later, the aides said. Administration     officials have said privately for several weeks that they      will seek the additional funding, the result of continuing      high costs incurred battling an unexpectedly strong      insurgency in Iraq.       Lovelace, who assumed his post of deputy chief of staff for      operations in October, spoke to a small group of Pentagon      reporters in what had been billed as an informal ``meet and      greet'' session. The conversation quickly focused on the      Army's planning for Iraq.       The number of U.S. Army and other forces in Iraq rose to      150,000 last month in what Pentagon officials described as an      effort to bolster security ahead of Iraqi elections this      weekend.       Lovelace made it clear that the Army's assumption about      future U.S. force levels was not meant to prejudge likely      trends in either Iraq's security situation or development of      its security services. He said the planning is intended to      ensure that enough units would be ready if needed and to give      U.S. troops a basis on which to organize their own lives.       ``It's really about us providing the predictability to our      own soldiers,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with the      Iraqi army; it has everything to do with our own      institutional agility.''       Asked about the Army's assumption, Lawrence T. Di Rita, the      Pentagon's main spokesman, said he was ``not surprised'' to      hear that the Army has chosen such a number, noting the need      for service leaders to do such planning. ``But it's not going      to be the Army's determination,'' he said. ``Ultimately, the      determination will be made by the commanders'' in the field.       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's belief, Di Rita      added, ``is that we will continue to see Iraqi security      forces grow in capability. We will continue to see the need      for the foreseeable period ahead to have a significant      commitment of U.S. assistance as that capability develops.      But there isn't anybody who has made any determination about      timing or numbers.''       Rumsfeld and other senior officials are reviewing      recommendations from Army Gen. Gary Luck about measures to      accelerate the training and boost the performance of the      Iraqi security forces. Luck, who has returned to Washington      after visiting Iraq last week, has endorsed plans by field      commanders to increase the number of trainers substantially.      But this increase is to come by shifting the missions of U.S.      troops already assigned to Iraq rather than by deploying more      forces, officials said.       ``I don't think anyone has a notion that we're talking      about forces in addition to what's already out there,'' Di      Rita said. ``It's a question of how to use those forces in a      different way.''       With the Pentagon having relied heavily on reservists to      fill out deployments to Iraq, military officers have warned      recently that the pool of available part-time soldiers is      dwindling. By later this year, when the Army is scheduled to      begin its fourth rotation of troops since the invasion in      March 2003, all 15 of the National Guard's most readily      deployable brigades will have been mobilized.

As the Army reaches farther down in the reserve force,      Lovelace said, the amount of ``pre-mobilization'' time      necessary to get the troops ready to send to Iraq is likely      to increase.       ``We're not going to send anybody into combat who is not      trained and ready,'' the three-star general said. But he      noted that already in each rotation, the amount of pre-     mobilization time required has increased.       To continue to be able to draw on the better trained      reservists, Army officials have said they are considering      petitioning Rumsfeld to extend the 24-month limit on the      total time a reservist could be called to active duty.
