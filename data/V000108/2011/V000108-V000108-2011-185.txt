Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I stand before you today to honor Dr. Dennis C. Rittenmeyer and to wish him well upon his upcoming retirement from his position as President of Calumet College of Saint Joseph in Whiting, Indiana. Dr. Rittenmeyer's many years of service in the field of education have had a positive impact on numerous students and educators within the community of Northwest Indiana and across the nation. In honor of Dennis, a retirement reception will be held on Tuesday, June 7, 2011, at The Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  Dr. Dennis Rittenmeyer's true passion for education is reflected in his impressive 40 year career in higher education. Dr. Rittenmeyer received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Western Michigan University. He went on to earn his doctoral degree in Higher Education Administration from Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. In 1987, Dr. Rittenmeyer became President of Calumet College of Saint Joseph. At the time, the institution was in serious financial crisis. Dennis successfully restored the college's financial stability, utilizing the leadership skills for which he is well-known. Throughout his tenure, his perseverance to see the right thing done sustained his efforts to overcome obstacles in order to establish Calumet College of Saint Joseph as the exceptional resource it is today. Under Dr. Rittenmeyer's direction, the enrollment at Calumet College of Saint Joseph increased from 870 in 1987 to nearly 1,300 in 2010; educational programs were expanded to include not only associate's degree programs but also bachelor's and master's degree programs. Additionally, an athletic program was introduced; currently, more than 270 participate in intercollegiate sports. The physical development of the campus included extensive renovations to the main building and a new Student Activity/Community Center was completed in 2009. My good friend also established an endowment fund for the continuously growing institution. For his truly impressive commitment to Calumet College of Saint Joseph, Dr. Rittenmeyer is to be commended.  Perhaps more remarkable is Dr. Rittenmeyer selflessly giving of his time, intellectual skills, and power of persuasion to move the community of Northwest Indiana ahead. In 2009, he was honored by Governor Mitch Daniels with the Distinguished Hoosier Award for his efforts on behalf of public transportation in Northwest Indiana. Much needs to be done before we have a true regional transit system in our region, but it will occur because of Dennis Rittenmeyer's lone sojourn in the wilderness preaching the human value of developing such a system long before it became a fashionable topic of debate. There would be no debate and no hope of much an improvement for future generations if Dennis had not stepped forth before all others.  Dr. Rittenmeyer's commitment to education and the community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. He and his wonderful wife Leslie have five beloved children.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Dr. Dennis C. Rittenmeyer for his lifetime of leadership, service, and dedication. He has touched the lives of countless students and educators, as well as every one of us in Northwest Indiana. For his service and uncompromising dedication, Dr. Rittenmeyer is worthy of the highest praise, and I ask that you join me in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
