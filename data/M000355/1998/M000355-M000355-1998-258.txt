 President, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA) was intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct court-approved wiretaps on new digital networks. Implementation of this important legislation is currently two-and-one-half years behind schedule because industry and law enforcement have not been able to reach agreement on technical standards required under CALEA. In March of this year, the Department of Justice, the FBI, industry, and privacy groups all agreed that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should resolve the technical capability standards dispute as envisioned under CALEA. The latest information I have from the FCC is that the Commission does not expect to issue a final electronic surveillance capability standard until late this year.  Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that the FCC should make this decision?
