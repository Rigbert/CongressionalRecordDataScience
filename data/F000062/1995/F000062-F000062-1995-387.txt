 President, I compliment my colleague on the Judiciary Committee and the Senator from Alabama for his very thoughtful statement and constitutional amendment. I would very much appreciate being listed as a cosponsor of that amendment.  I thank the Senator for his words because I think they were cogent. I also believe they reflect the views of the American people.
