President, I know both sides are working on trying to get an arrangement for the vote.  Mr. President, I also want to tell my colleague from Texas that I listened very carefully to his remarks with respect to transparency in government. He has had a long interest in the Freedom of Information Act and the like. I noted that he made a comment about the Bay of Pigs, about which information is still classified, and I know something about this because my dad wrote a book about the subject. My hope is that my friend from Texas and his interest in transparency will also extend to some other areas.  As I indicated, I am very familiar with my colleague's record with respect to Freedom of Information Act issues, which really is impressive. Ihope to get him involved in some other areas of transparency--perhaps in campaign finance reform and the issue I am going to be speaking about today, that of getting the American people the information--after 6 years of stonewalling--on how many lawful Americans are getting swept up in what will be Dan Coats' top priority, that of the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  I want my colleague to know, in my being very much aware of his good work on the Freedom of Information Act issues, that we are going to try and conscript them into some other transparency issues as well.
