Speaker, I have today introduced in the House a concurrent resolution. That resolution renames the headquarters of the Capitol Police in the memory of Officers Christopher Eney, Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson. I am introducing this resolution along with Senator Paul Sarbanes, and I know that many Members on both sides of the aisle will want to cosponsor it as well.  Mr. Speaker, these men are fallen heroes of the Capitol Police. Officer Eney lost his life during a training exercise in August of 1984. He was the first Capitol officer to lose his life. As we tragically know, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were struck down in the line of duty just a few weeks ago on July 24. They were defending this Capitol, innocent citizens, staff and Members from a maniacal and senseless shooting spree at this Capitol.  Mr. Speaker, August 24, 1984, and July 24, 1998 will forever remind us that the risk is always present for those we ask to defend this free society. The Capitol police force, as a family who wish to honor the colleagues of the family who died while performing their duties by renaming their headquarters after them.  This resolution would rename the United States Capitol Police Headquarters as ``The Eney Chestnut Gibson Memorial Building.'' This was popularly selected by the Capitol police and reflects the order in which each man lost his life.  I am proud and honored on behalf of all of my colleagues to work with Senator Sarbanes and his colleagues in the Senate to honor these heroes and their families.  Mr. Speaker, these men and women of law enforcement, like those we ask to join the armed forces and defend freedom abroad, are responsible for us being able to meet in this body in a society that honors peace and order and law. The least we can do as a people is to honor our fallen officers by naming the headquarters where they served with dignity and pride.  I know that my colleagues will want to join me in cosponsoring this resolution.                          ____________________
