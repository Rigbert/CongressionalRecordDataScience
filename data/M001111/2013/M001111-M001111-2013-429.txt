 That means a balanced mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from those who can afford it most.  I remind all Senators every bipartisan group who has examined our budget situation has acknowledged that reality. Simpson-Bowls, the Gang of 6, Domenici-Rivlin--all recommend several times more revenue than the roughly $600 billion that was generated by the yearend deal. In fact, Simpson-Bowles and the Gang of 6 each recommend well over $2 trillion in new revenue. So striking this reconciliation instruction, which is what this amendment does, and reducing the revenue level, goes in exactly the wrong direction. I ask for a strong ``no'' vote and oppose this amendment.
