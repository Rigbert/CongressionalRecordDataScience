Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend for yielding and thank her for her strong leadership for human rights and for the unborn.  Mr. Speaker, pain--we all dread it, we avoid it, we even fear it, and we all go to extraordinary lengths to mitigate its severity and its duration; yet an entire age group of human beings are, today, subjected to a deadly, extraordinarily painful procedure, one of which is called the dismemberment method, the D&E.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a modest but necessary attempt to at least protect babies who are 20 weeks old and pain capable from having to suffer and die from abortion. Children, including children with disabilities, Mr. Speaker, deserve better treatment than pain-filled dismemberment.  One leading expert in the field of fetal pain, Dr. Anand, at the University of Tennessee, stated in his expert report, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Justice:       The human fetus possesses the ability to experience pain      from 20 weeks of gestation, if not earlier, and the pain      perceived by a fetus is possibly more intense than that      perceived by term newborns or older children.                              {time}  1245  Dr. Colleen Malloy, assistant professor, Division of Neonatology at Northwestern University, in her testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, said:       When we speak of infants at 20 weeks postfertilization, we      no longer have to rely on inferences or ultrasound      technology, because such premature patients are kicking,      moving, reacting, and developing right before our eyes in the      neonatal intensive care unit.  In other words, there are children the same age who, in utero, can be killed by abortion--and painfully--or who have been born and who are now being given lifesaving assistance. She went on to say:       In today's medical arena, we resuscitate patients at this      age and are able to witness their ex-utero growth.  Dr. Malloy concludes:       I could never imagine subjecting my tiny patients to      horrific procedures such as those that involve limb      detachment or cardiac injection.  Again, that is what the abortionists do.  Surgeons today, Mr. Speaker, are entering the womb to perform life-enhancing and lifesaving corrective surgeries on unborn children. They have seen those babies flinch, jerk around, move around, and recoil from sharp objects and incisions. As they seek to heal, surgeons are today routinely administering anesthesia to unborn children in the womb--a best medical practice--to protect them from pain. We now know that the child ought to be treated as a patient and that there are many anomalies, sicknesses, and disabilities that could be treated with a degree of success while the child is still in utero. The child ought to be seen as a patient. When those interventions are performed, again, anesthesia is given.  Last June, TIME Magazine's cover story, ``Saving Preemies,'' explored the preemie revolution and how cutting-edge medicine and dedicated caregivers are helping the tiniest babies to survive and thrive. TIME says:       Thanks to advances that had not been made even a few years      ago, the odds of surviving and thriving are improving all the      time.  Abortionists, on the other hand, Mr. Speaker, are in the business of ensuring that children neither survive nor thrive. Children, including children with disabilities, deserve better treatment than pain-filled dismemberment.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, I yield myself such time as I may consume as I want to respond to this issue about process.  When Speaker Boehner became the Speaker of this House, in his opening speech, one of the things he said was:       You will always have the right to a robust debate and an      open process that allows you to represent your constituents--     to make your case, to offer alternatives, and to be heard.  Clearly, we have not been granted that in any way, shape, or form.  While the gentlewoman may point to the sins of the past of Democratic majorities, nothing compares to what the Republicans did in the last Congress. The Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America.  I mean, you made history, and that is not something to be proud of.  When my friends talk about openness and transparency and about the desire to allow this to be a deliberative place where people of varying viewpoints can have a forum to debate, it is not reflective of reality. We are beginning this Congress just as my colleagues conducted the last Congress--in the most closed way possible. I regret that very much, especially on bills that have not even been through the committee hearing process in this Congress or that have not been marked up.  At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.
