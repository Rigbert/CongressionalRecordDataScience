I actually thought he got off to a good start. He invited Democratic Congressmen and Senators to the White House. They had a good time. They watched movies, he gave them all nicknames, and it looked as if it was going to be a great change in atmosphere.  In the last week or two, things have not improved. They have gone the other way: The decision in the House of Representatives by the Republican leadership on the tax cut vote they would not even allow amendments from Democrats or Republicans on the floor. They allowed one substitute vote. Their hearings in the Ways and Means Committee did not allow any bipartisan exchange.  Frankly, I do not think that is in keeping with the President's promise of more bipartisanship. It is going to occur over here. There will be a real debate on taxes in the Senate. Senator Grassley, as chairman of the Finance Committee, is going to provide an opportunity for amendments and discussion in his committee. We will have a chance to offer amendments on the floor, and a 50-50 Senate finally will debate this bill.  The last week has not been promising. The decision of the President to go to the home State of the minority leader, Tom Daschle, was an interesting choice. I do not think it was the best political decision for a President preaching bipartisanship, but it was his decision. I hope we can return to his promise of bipartisanship.  I guess the Senator from Nevada heard the comment of the Senator from Pennsylvania a few minutes ago about the decision in 1993 by the Clinton administration to put together a package to do something about our deficits. That package, which passed in the House and the Senate, did not have a single Republican in support of it. Many of the Republicans who are saying President Bush's tax cut is the best medicine for America also voted against President Clinton's plan in 1993.  That plan turned it around. We got out of the deficit mentality and deficit experience and started creating surpluses.  The Senator from Pennsylvania talked earlier about the unfair tax burden. I will read from the same New Yorker article I quoted earlier about that tax plan in 1993:       From 1992, the year before a supposedly onerous new      marginal tax rate kicked in, through 1998, the most recent      figure for which the IRS has information available, the      average after-tax income of the richest 1 percent in America      rose from $400,000 to just under $600,000--  That is in a 6-year period of time.     and from 12.2 percent of the national net income to 15.7      percent.  Our friends on the Republican side do not want to acknowledge that we not only put a plan in place that ended the deficits in this country but also created income, wealth, and prosperity, the likes of which we have not seen in modern history. Now comes President Bush saying I want to return to the concept that I tried in Texas, where I started with a surplus, put in a tax cut, and ended up with a deficit.  Excuse me if many Members of the Senate are skeptical of that approach.                          ____________________
