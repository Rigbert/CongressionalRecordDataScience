Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  I want to congratulate her and thank her for the extraordinary job that she has done over the last 18 months on this particular issue. She has been tireless in her efforts to promote the assurance that every American not only has the right to vote but that every American will have their vote counted correctly.  I also want to mention two of my very good friends and colleagues on the floor, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek), two members from Florida who firsthand experienced and their constituents experienced the difficulties of voting in November of 2000.  I also want to recognize the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), our chairman, who has done such an outstanding job getting us to this point. Without his measured and effective leadership, we would not be where we are.  I want to go back to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) because as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus and vice chair of the Democratic Caucus Special Committee on Election Reform she has tirelessly advocated that the 107th Congress keep its eye on the prize and pass meaningful, comprehensive election reform.  Mr. Speaker, in only 42 days this Nation will hold its first Federal election since November 2000. Nobody can predict with certainty how smoothly those elections will go. Certainly we experienced a primary in Florida that did not go well. After almost 2 years, studying what went wrong in November 2000, I am convinced that confidence in this Nation's election system will not be restored until this Congressenacts meaningful national standards and offers State and local authorities the resources to improve their election infrastructure.  I am pleased to report, as the chairman has said, that Congress is on the threshold of doing just that, thanks in large measure to my colleague and good friend from Ohio (Mr. Ney), whom I have already mentioned. We are closer than ever to enacting the most comprehensive package of voting reforms since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, reforms that will require States to offer provisional ballots to all voters; reforms that will require States to maintain state-wide computerized registration lists to ensure the most accurate, up-to-date rolls and minimize the number of voters who are incorrectly removed from the rolls; reform that will reward States for retiring obsolete voting machines, especially the notorious punch card machines and their dangling chads; reforms that will require voting systems to be accessible to all individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility for the blind; reforms that will allow voters to review and correct their ballots before they are ultimately cast. We call that second-chance voting. Every voter ought to be assured that their vote is correctly cast and will be accurately counted.  Reform that does not weaken, let me reiterate this, reforms that do not weaken any existing voting rights laws and includes meaningful enforcement; reform that ensures military and civilian voters who live and work overseas are able to vote and have their vote counted.  Mr. Speaker, this motion is intended to ensure that we on the conference committee complete our work prior to October 1, 2002. Given the extraordinary progress the conference committee has made in the past 14 days, there is no legitimate reason we cannot meet that deadline. I know the chairman shares my view on that. Indeed, given the larger context in which we operate, I would submit that this Congress has a moral responsibility and obligation to enact election reform before we adjourn the 107th Congress.  Mr. Speaker, over the last year, this country has committed vast resources to ridding the world of those who would employ the tools of terror to destroy systems of government that derive their legitimacy from the ballot box. In just the past few weeks, we in Congress have been challenged to contemplate the use of overwhelming military might to bring to heel one of the great despots of the past 50 years, a figure whose utter contempt for democracy and the people he rules is the only reason he has held power for so long.                              {time}  2000  As we consider such profound measures to extend democracy where it does not now exist and strengthen it where it is fragile, we have an urgent, moral responsibility to do the same at home. I urge adoption of this motion. I congratulate the chairman for his support of this motion and last week's motion to urge us to complete our work. This motion is timely. Passage is late, but it is never too late to do the right thing.
