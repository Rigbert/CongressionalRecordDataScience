President, the second attack on Senator Bob Dole by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts had to do with the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, implying that Bob Dole was opposed and had been opposed to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that one thing that Bob Dole was opposed to was a single payer Government-run system which the President had advocated earlier in his administration. In other words, socializing medicine, taking about 12 percent of the economy of this country and putting it in the hands of Government because they can do it so much better than the private sector can do it.  That is what Senator Dole was opposed to. He was not opposed to some of the reforms that were found in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. There were a couple of reforms that he wanted that ended up being in the bill. In fact, the President said that if the MSA's, medical savings accounts, were added to the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, at one point he said he would veto it. Many of those on the other side of the aisle said that if the MSA's are in, it would be vetoed.  Why were people concerned about the MSA's? They were concerned about them because those people who would want to have a socialized approach to health care delivery in this country know that once we have MSA's, we will never go back to that system.  What do MSA's do? They merely allow the choice of individuals so that if an individual wants to shop around for his health delivery services, and he can save money doing so, then he can benefit and have the rewards of what he has saved. I think that our health delivery in America is the only product or service known that actually has a built-in disincentive to save. And I am guilty like everyone else. You know, if I have my deductible and I go ahead and pay that, then I am inclined to go and get any kind of medical or health service that is out there because it no longer costs me any more money. That is human nature.  We finally got a modified medical savings account system put into the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. I say ``modified.'' It is only on a trial basis. It is going to prove itself. I heard estimates that we could actually reduce the total cost of health care in this country by as much as 50 percent just by having MSA's.  Mr. President, there is another thing we need to do that is not in this bill, and that is to have some kind of medical malpractice so we do not have such a high defensive cost. But anyway, the fact that MSA's are in there now--the President had said he would veto it if they were in there. He did not veto it. I am glad he did not veto it. But certainly it was never Bob Dole's intention to oppose the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill with the reforms in it that he feltwere in the best interests of the American people.  The third thing that Senator Kennedy said about Senator Dole that I think was misleading, and it was a misrepresentation of his position, was in reference to tax cuts. It is true that Senator Dole, if elected President, wants to come to Congress, which I believe will still be controlled by the Republicans, and come with tax cuts.  He outlined five major tax cuts. I am very supportive of all five of those tax cuts. People ask, how are you going to pay for them? I think people forget about the fact that three decades in the last 100 years Presidents have decided to have tax cuts, and in all three decades it has dramatically increased the revenues.  It is ironic that Senator Kennedy would be talking about tax cuts and all the damage that is being done when it was John Kennedy in 1962, when he was President of the United States, who said, and I quote:       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too      high today and tax revenues are too low. And the soundest way      to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut rates now.      The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget      deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding      economy which can bring a budget surplus.  That was what President Kennedy said in 1962. And that is exactly what happened during the 1960's with the massive tax reductions, and we were able to have revenue increases--revenue increases.  Look what happened. The marginal rates of our tax system in 1980 produced $244 billion. In 1990, it almost doubled to $466 billion, and that was during a 10-year period when we had the most massive cuts in our tax revenues.  So I think that it would be good to go back and look at history and see that this country, when it has been overtaxed in the past, that they reduced taxes and had the result of increasing revenues. Certainly, we are in an overtaxed posture right now.  I have often said there are three things that make this country nonproductive, on a global basis, and noncompetitive: One is our high tax rates; one is overregulation; the other is our tort laws. There is not time in this brief time to cover that.  I conclude, Mr. President, by saying when Senator Kennedy assailed Senator Dole for talking about tax cuts, that he start realizing those individuals--those of us who want to have tax reductions--are the same ones that were trying to stop the 1993 tax increase. In 1993, when President Clinton had control of both the House and the Senate, he passed a tax increase that was characterized not by Republicans but by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which was Senator Moynihan, who said it was the largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or any place in the world.  I think, essentially, what we--what Senator Dole, and what the Republicans and the conservatives in this body and in the other body--want to do is merely undo the damage that was done by that massive tax increase and actually repeal the taxes that were increased in 1993. Essentially, that is what Senator Dole wants to do. I believe that is an accurate characterization of his program.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 5, 1996]                               Medagogues       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard      Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the      Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems      to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about      everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to      cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out      of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance      program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program      to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other      than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . .      . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a      sacred trust.''       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress      has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular      basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the      program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years      the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which,      despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be      little more than accounting devices and possible warning      lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to      reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because      Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid      together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all      spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is      done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the      baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant.      Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive      up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out      other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes. Or      it can cut them back.       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step.      This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire      society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot      of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it      on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan      is still gauzy. It is not year clear how tough it will      finally be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on      grounds that it seeks to cut too much from the program and on      grounds that it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn      out to be true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to      have other flaws as well.       They have nonethless--in our judgement--stepped up to the      issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling      for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn      is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away      your Medicare. That's their only message. They have no plan.      Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the      Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their      tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the      right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong      one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not be a tax      cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the Republicans      propose. But that has nothing to do with Medicare. The      Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection      because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack      and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think      it's wrong.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.
