 President, the doctrine of joint liability permits an injured plaintiff to collect the full judgment from any defendant found liable for any part of the injury. It means that no matter how remotely connected a defendant is to the events leading to plaintiff's injury, a defendant could be required to satisfy the entire judgment.  The result is that lawyers for the plaintiffs add a whole host of defendants to a lawsuit in an effort to ensure the plaintiff can get the full judgment paid. With joint liability, it doesn't matter if you had anything to do with the events leading up to the plaintiff's injury. Instead, the chances of your getting sued depend upon how deep your pockets are. The deeper the pocket, the more likely to be sued.  I'll illustrate with a negligence case: if a drunk driver injures an individual on someone else's property, the property owner will be joined in the lawsuit. It happened to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, only it wasn't even the property owner. The accident happened near one of the orchestra's performance facilities. And the orchestra, a nonprofit entity, was needlessly dragged into a $13 million lawsuit and put at risk for the judgment.  Nonprofit organizations, municipalities and small businesses can be hardest hit by joint liability. Although we don't think of these defendants as wealthy or rich, they are usually adequately insured, which also makes them good candidates to be deep pockets. New York City spends more on personal injury awards and settlements--$270 million--than it spends on funding public libraries.  In securities litigation, accountants, bankers, and insurers are targets of abusive suits because of their deep pockets. One Big Eight accounting firm, Laventhol & Horwath, went bankrupt because the cost of fighting these suits became too prohibitive. The consequence of dragging these professional firms into these kinds of lawsuits is obvious: it becomes increasingly difficult for new businesses to get advice from business professionals. And, it gets harder to find people to serve on corporate boards due to the fear of lawsuits.  This litigation explosion burdens the economy, retarding economic growth. It is essentially a tax imposed on every American. And every potential defendant has to take account, in the prices they set, for the possibility of being dragged into a lawsuit.  During the product liability debate, I received a letter from the Institute for the National Black Business Council, an association of minority business owners. Mr. Lou Collier, the president of the council, wrote in support of expanding the product liability bill. Without an expansion of the joint and several liability reform, Mr. Collier states, ``Millions of small businesses--restaurants, gas station owners, hair stylists, nearly every small business you can think of, would still face the threat of bankruptcy. That includes most African-American firms.'' The latest census data shows that 49 percent of all black-owned firms are service firms, and Mr. Collier, on behalf of minority small business owners, asked us to improve the climate for small business, ``Small business owners and entrepreneurs have to overcome staggering odds to build a successful company. They shouldn't have to face a legal system where one frivolous lawsuit can force them to close their doors.''  The same arguments ring true in the context of securities litigation. This amendment must be defeated because restoring joint liability means little improvement in the litigation climate.  Injured plaintiffs will still recover their full economic loss. But for the subjective noneconomic loss, each defendant would be responsible only for his or her proportionate share of harm caused.  This bill is fair and consistent with principles of individual responsibility. It will put an end to the gamble takenby the trial bar when they join everyone in sight of an alleged harm. I urge that the amendment be rejected.                           Amendment No. 1469
