Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, many of us have heard or seen the phenomenal success of microenterprise programs around the world. These programs reach the poorest of the poor with small loans that help them to work their way out of poverty.  The record of these programs is impressive, with the poorest clients repaying their loans at rates between 95 and 98 percent. Unlike other assistance programs, we do not give funds away. We lend them to people once considered the worst credit risks on earth.  Microenterprise programs proved that with access to credit, the poor can repay their loans and work their way out of poverty.  The bill before the House is a result of almost 4 years of consensus building between the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and the ranking Democratic member, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson).  The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and many of us have worked for a number of years on microenterprise development programs from their first beginnings at the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to today when microfinancing institutions are some of the largest lenders in many developing countries.  The bill also builds on the work in the last Congress, the Houghton-Hall bill. The authors of that legislation will recognize that much of the language in this bill came directly from their bill.  This legislation started as a renewal of our bipartisan cooperative effort with the administration, including AID and the First Lady's office, to strengthen microfinance programs. We will recall the President's visit to Uganda where he visited a microfinance project and declared that this was one of the most successful ways to help the poor in developing countries to work their way out of poverty.  Mr. Chairman, this bill accomplishes several key goals. First, it contains the essential language that half of all microenterprise resources go directly to support programs that provide $300 loans or lower to the poorest of the poor.  This requirement traces back to the highly successful microcredit summit convened by Results to dedicate the international community to reaching half of the world's poor with credit programs by the year 2005.                              {time}  1215  The bill adds a new section to the Foreign Assistance Act governing grants to microfinance institutions, authorizing $152 million in appropriations for fiscal year 2000 and $167 million for fiscal year 2001.  I will note that these are consensus figures of the Microenterprise Coalition, advocacy and practitioners alike, and they are not strongly opposed by the administration.  The bill authorizes the micro and small credit program of AID that has helped many microentrepreneurs grow from small- to medium-sized businesses. The bill has also two major new sections that lay the foundation for the future growth of the microfinance sector.  First, at the suggestion of the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), the bill establishes a microfinance loan facility to help rescue institutions which the U.S. taxpayer has supported with liquidity and support to prevent collapse.  We have all witnessed the destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The destruction nearly caused the collapse of several key microfinance institutions that the U.S. helped to build from the ground up. The ad hoc rescue package assembled by Brian Atwood at AID rescued these institutions so they can now head to recovery.  We have also had other near collapses, and the facility will help address these emergencies in a more systematic way.  Secondly, the bill calls for a number of reports by the President to lay out the future growth of these institutions, including a Federal charter. Using these reports, we hope to lay out a road map for the growth of the microfinance section over the next 10 years.  This legislation has 26 original cosponsors and has been endorsed by the Microenterprise Coalition, including RESULTS and FINCA. It is my understanding that the administration has moved mightily and now has only some concerns with the legislation, and does not oppose its adoption today.  The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and I have one amendment that will make some technical changes to the bill, to its loan facility, that were worked out with AID. Other than that, I am not aware of any other amendments that will be offered today.  I urge the support of this legislation. It is a good bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
