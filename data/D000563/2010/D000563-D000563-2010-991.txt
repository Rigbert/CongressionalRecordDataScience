President, tonight we were able to reach agreement to complete action on the tax extenders legislation tomorrow afternoon. Under the agreement, at approximately 2 p.m. all postcloture debate time will expire and the question will be on the substitute amendment. Once the substitute amendment is agreed to, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the bill, H.R. 4213. If cloture is invoked, the Senate would then proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, as amended. Therefore, Senators should expect up to three rollcall votes beginning at 2 p.m.  The majority leader would like to begin consideration of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization legislation tomorrow.                          ____________________
