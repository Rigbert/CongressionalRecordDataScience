Mr. Chairman, I wish to call attention to the important action of the House in deleting the proposed ``refugee cap'' which would have made dramatic cuts in the number of refugees the United States accepts each year. In particular, the ``refugee cap'' would have necessitated the elimination of the in-country programs for Jews and Evangelical Christians in the former Soviet Union, and for pro-American political prisoners, religious dissidents and other people at risk of persecution by the Communist government of Viet Nam.          political and religious dissidents around the world  Make no mistake: the proposals for refugee cuts do not reflect a decline in the worldwide level of political, racial, and religious persecution. The dictatorship in Nigeria recently staged a public hanging of eight members of the Ogoni ethnic minority, including highly respected novelist and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa. Iran followed up by sentencing a member of its Baha'i religious minority to death for a crime it calls ``national apostasy.''             vietnamese political and religious dissidents  Nor is the upsurge in persecution limited to so-called ``pariah'' regimes. A week after Warren Christopher raised the flag on the new United States Embassy in Viet Nam, the government of that country staged two show trials--apparently to disabuse its own people of the idea that economic and diplomatic relations with the West would lead to greater respect for human rights. Six of the nation's top Buddhist leaders were sentenced to long prison terms for persisting in their refusal to join the state church. Nine people were convicted of ``using freedom and democracy to injure the national unity'' because they had requested permission to hold a conference on the subject of democracy. So this is no time to think about shutting down the Orderly Departure Program for people who have suffered for their pro-American, pro-freedom beliefs and associations. Nor is it a time to think about dumping thousands more high-risk political and refugees, currently long-time residents of refugee camps in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, back to persecution in the Workers' Paradise. Yet this is what the international refugee bureaucracy is about to do. The United States has traditionally stood against this sort of thing, even when our efforts were regarded as unhelpful by the governments of other nations and by officials of international organizations. We must recapture that proud American tradition of resistance to persecution and solace for the persecuted--and not just when it is convenient or popular.                          persecution of jews  The Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, of which I have the honor of serving as Chairman, recently heard expert testimony on the persecution of Jews around the world. Our witnesses testified about the continued survival, as we face the turn of the Twenty-First Century and celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the war that ended the Holocaust--of systematic and severe mistreatment of Jews, simply because they are Jews.  The recent firebombings in Jerusalem, which killed many innocent people, show that there is literally nowhere in the world where Jews are safe from hatred and violence. But the worst problems appear to be in places that have a history of anti-Semitism combined with an unstable present and an uncertain future.  The hearing on persecution of Jews was conducted with the active assistance of a number of organizations that have been instrumental in helping to keep the attention of Congress focussed on this issue, including the World Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, the National Jewish Coalition, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and the Council of Jewish Federations. Our witnesses--including academic experts, a former member of the Russian Duma, and several people who are themselves refugees from persecution--told us about the situation in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. We also heard accounts of persecution in Iran and Syria. These are certainly among the worst cases, but it is important to remember that anti-Semitism and the violence it brings in its wake are not confined to one or two regions of the world. The evidence is unfortunately all around us: the bombing of a synagogue in Argentina, the ``skinhead'' movement in Western Europe, resurgent ethnic politics in Central and Eastern Europe, even the desecration of a small Jewish cemetery by the dictatorship that rules Burma.  The situation of Jews in the former Soviet Union is particularly important, not only because the struggle for the freedom of Soviet Jewry was among the finest hours of the American people, but also because the story could still end badly. There has been a tendency in recent years, even among those of us who fought long and hard for the rescue of Soviet Jews, to feel that now we can relax. Unfortunately, the free world has a long history of relaxing too soon. In the case of Jews living in the former Soviet Union, what we must avoid is slamming the door too soon. It is true that the Twentieth Century totalitarian states based on ideologies that are anti-God and anti-human being, such as Nazism and Communism, may have had a capacity to do evil whose scope and degree was unique in all human history. Evil, however, takes many forms and respects no boundaries. The year in which Zhirinovsky begins his campaign for President is not the year in which we should decide that the coast is clear for ex-Soviet Jews.  This hearing also helped us to assess the performance of our government, and of international institutions such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in responding to the pleas of the Jewish communities that are at risk around the world. Our government had to be prodded for years before it made freedom of emigration for persecuted Soviet Jews a foreign policy priority. More recently, our foreign policy establishment was also slow to recognize and react to the persecution of Jews in Iraq.  We must remind ourselves, and then we must remind our government, that refugee policy is not just an inconvenient branch of immigration policy. Human rights policy is not just a subset of trade policy. The protection of refugees, the fight for human rights around the world, are about recognizing that good and evil really exist in the world. They are also about recognizing that we are all brothers and sisters. If we recognize these truths, we can build a coalition to preserve and strengthen United States policies designed to protect our witnesses today--and to protect all others who are persecuted because of their religion, race, nationality, or political beliefs--and to restore these policies to the place they deserve as a top priority in American foreign policy.  Mr. Speaker, the former Soviet refugee program has already been reduced from 35,000 refugees in fiscal year 1995 to 30,000 in fiscal year 1996. Although the governments of the newly independent states do not endorse the persecution of these groups, in many cases have been unwilling or unable to prevent it. Instability and resurgent ultra-nationalism and anti-Semitism counsel against a premature closing of the door to members of these historically persecuted groups.                       PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS  The Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights also recently heard expert testimony on the persecution of Christians around the world. To the best of my knowledge, it was the first hearing of its kind, ever. Our witnesses testified about the systematic and severe mistreatment--including but not limited to harassment, discrimination, imprisonment, beatings, torture, enslavement, and even violent death--meted out to believers simply because they are believers.  The subject of religious persecution is a familiar one for the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. This subcommittee and its members have held hearings, introduced resolutions, and otherwise helped to focus the attention of Congress and the nation on the persecution of Soviet Jews, of Bosnian Muslims, of Bahais in Iran, of Buddhists in Tibet and Viet Nam, and of others who have been oppressed for practicing their chosen faith. This, however, is the first hearing to focus specifically on persecuted Christians, and to do so in a way that makes clear this is not an isolated or occasional outrage, but one that is perpetrated every day upon millions of people around the world.  We held the hearing on worldwide persecution of Christians in order to advance several important goals. First, the very act of bearing witness is important in itself. Even if we could accomplish nothing else this afternoon, we would have an obligation to shed light on facts that need to be known, and to give a forum to voices that need to be heard.  We hope, however, to accomplish much more. In this age when human rights are always in danger of subordination to other objectives--whether the love of money, the feat of immigrants and refugees, or the desire to get along with governments that mistreat their own people--we need to be reminded that when people are persecuted in distant lands, it is often because they are like us. The victims we so often ignore, whether the issue is refugee protection or most-favored-nation status for China, are usually the very people who share our values. We need to see their faces, and to be reminded that they are our brothers and sisters.  It is also important that we assess the performance of our government, and of international institutions such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in responding to the pleas of persecuted Christians. In the past we have heard that these institutions have been reluctant to acknowledge the plight of persecuted Christians. Most of us can remember the Pentecostals who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during the 1980s, and who were finally rescued only after they had been pressured and cajoled for months to leave because they were cluttering up the courtyard. The so-called ``Comprehensive Plan of Action'' for Southeast Asian asylum seekers has returned thousands of Christians, including priests, nuns, ministers, and seminarians, to Viet Nam after they were callously labeled ``economic migrants.'' And applications for asylum or refugee status from Christians who have managed to escape from Islamic extremist regimes have typically been rejected, despite the draconian punishments often administered against them.  Finally, and perhaps most important, the hearing afforded an opportunity for a broad coalition of respected voices, from Amnesty International to the Southern Baptist Convention and the Family Research Council, to bear witness to their own recognition of the plight of persecuted Christians. This is an issue that should unite liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, even internationalists and isolationists. Whatever our differences, we are Americans. There are such things as American values, and there are some things Americans will not tolerate. We can build a coalition to restore the protection of these oppressed believers--and of all others who are persecuted because of their religion, race, nationality, or political beliefs--as a top priority in American foreign policy. The continuing persecution of Christian religious demonstrates--and too often the turning of a deaf ear by U.S. officials and others charged with refugee protection--is yet another reason that this is a terrible time to talk about reducing the scope of U.S. refugee programs.                    SLAVERY IN MAURITANIA AND SUDAN  The Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights also held a hearing on the practice of chattel slavery, which is still widespread in Mauritania and Sudan. Most of us had believed, until quite recently, that this horrible practice belonged only to the past. But several of our witnesses testified of having seen it first hand, having spoken with slaves and with slave masters.  According to accounts by anti-slavery activists, including some of our witnesses, chattel slavery in Mauritania and in the Sudan is substantially identical to slavery as it was practiced in other centuries. It represents the subjugation of one race by another, and often of members of one religious group by members of another. It frequently includes the grossest forms of degradation of women and children. Slavery is not to be confused with similar institutions, such as serfdom or indentured servitude: however wrong these institutions are, they involve only the ownership of one person's labor by another. In true slavery, the master owns the slave's body. He owns the right to decide whom the slave will marry. When babies are born, the master owns the babies, and can buy them and sell them. True slavery is about treating people as though they were not people, as though they were things without souls.  In the modern world, we often speak of ``fundamental human rights.'' Sometimes we say these words without thinking about what they mean. I believe that the idea of human rights has meaning only if rights are God-given, inalienable, and indivisible. Slavery is the ultimate denial of all these ideas. Toleration of slavery, even when it is far away and in another country, is the ultimate statement of radical cultural relativism. We must do whatever it takes to abolish slavery, not only because its victims are our brothers and sisters, but also because as long as there is anyone in the world who is a slave, none of us is truly free.          victims of forced abortion and forced sterilization  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I must point out that even at our current levels of refugee admission, the number of refugee spots we allocate for people fleeing the People's Republic of China--one of the most repressive regimes on Earth--is zero. This is particularly tragic in light of the continuing recurrence of one of the most gruesome human rights violations in the history of the world: forced abortion.  On Good Friday of last year, thirteen Chinese women in INS detention were moved to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, California. Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions. Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortion and/or sterilization. Their asylum claims were rejected. Some of them were deported to Ecuador. It appears that the deportation of the remaining women to the PRC is imminent.  These women and others like them may be forced back to China because of a novel and bizarre interpretation of U.S. asylum law, under which those who resist forced abortion or forced sterilization are regarded as common criminals rather than victims of persecution. After all, they did break the law--and never mind what kind of law they broke. Never mind fundamental human rights and broken lives. A law is a law, and people who break a forced-abortion law or any other law must be sent back to take their punishment. This is the kind of thinking we are up against. This is why we need section 522 of this bill, which would restore the humane policy of regarding victims of forced abortion and forced sterilization as refugees. It is also one of the reasons we need a resettlement program for Chinese refugees.  The anti-life, anti-woman interpretation of the refugee laws, which has resulted in denials of asylum to women fleeing forced abortion, was adopted by INS in August 1994. It reversed the long-standing policy of granting asylum to applicants who can prove a well-founded fear of forced abortion, forced sterilization, or other forms of persecution for resistance to the PRC coercive population control program.  Section 522 would restore the traditional interpretation and save these women. Such a provision should not be controversial. Almost all Americans, whatever their views on the moral and political questions surrounding abortion, regard forced abortion and forced sterilization as particularly gruesome violations of fundamental human rights.  Mr. Speaker, this provision is not about immigrants, it is about refugees. Contrary tosome of the scare tactics that have been used from time to time against protecting victims of forced abortion and forced sterilization, such protection has been tried in the past, and has not brought billions of economic migrants from China or anywhere else. This provision will protect a tiny handful of genuine refugees--the 13 Bakersfield women and a few others every year--who face a gruesome fate if we send them back, or who have already suffered such a fate.  It is important that we put aside myths and consider the facts:  The number of people involved is very small. Section 522 of this bill has a track record. It simply restores the law as it was interpreted from 1987 through 1993. It also imposes a statutory cap of 1,000 refugees and asylees. This statutory cap is unfortunate and unnecessary, but it probably will not make any difference. The number of people granted asylum on the ground of persecution for resistance to the PRC population control policy was between 100 and 150 per year--not 1.2 billion.  Each applicant would be required to prove his or her case. Section 522 does not enact a special rule for people who resist the PRC population control program. It merely gives each applicant an opportunity to prove his or her case under exactly the same rules as every other applicant. The only change this provision would make from current law is to restore eligibility for an applicant who can prove that he or she individually had a well-founded fear of forced abortion, forced sterilization, or other persecution for resistance to the population control policy--or has actually been subjected to such measures.  It's the right thing to do. Forced abortion, forced sterilization, and other severe punishments inflicted on resisters to the PRC program are persecution on account of political opinion. PRC officials have repeatedly attacked resisters as political and ideological criminals. The infliction of extraordinarily harsh punishment is also generally regarded as evidence that those who inflict such punishment regard the offenders not as ordinary lawbreakers but as enemies of the state.  Forced abortions often take place in the very late stages of pregnancy. Sometimes the procedure is carried out during the process of birth itself, either by crushing the baby's skull with forceps as it emerges from the womb or by injecting formaldehyde into the soft spot of the head.  Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on persons whose resistance is motivated by religion. According to a recent Amnesty International report, enforcement measures in two overwhelmingly Catholic villages in northern China have included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of resisters' relatives as hostages to compel compliance. The campaign is reported to have been conducted under the slogan ``better to have more graves than more than one child.''  The dramatic and well-publicized arrival of a few vessels containing Chinese ``boat people'' has tended to obscure the fact that these people have never amounted to more than a tiny fraction of the undocumented immigrants to the United States. The total number of Chinese boat people who arrived during the years our more generous asylum policy was in force, or who were apprehended while attempting to do so, was fewer than 2000. This is the equivalent of a quiet evening on the border in San Diego.  Nor is there evidence that denying asylum to people whose claims are based on forced abortion or forced sterilization will be of any use in preventing false claims. People who are willing to lie in order to get asylum will simply switch to some other story. The only people who will be forced to return to China will be those who are telling the truth--who really do have a reasonable fear of being subjected to forced abortion or forced sterilization. The solution to credibility problems is careful case-by-case adjudication, not wholesale denial.  Finally, we should be extremely careful about forcibly repatriating asylum seekers to China in light of evidence that a number of those sent back by the United States since 1993 have been subjected to extended terms in ``re-education camps,'' forced labor, beatings, and other harsh treatment.  Mr. Chairman, on the one hand we tell people not come here illegally to apply for asylum, not even if they are fleeing persecution. But then we fail to use the legal tools at our disposal, the programs specifically provided by law, to assist thee vulnerable people in escaping persecution in ways that do not violate immigration laws. It is a serious deficiency that should be addressed by the allocation of an adequate number of places for refugees from persecution at the hands of the totalitarian regime in Beijing.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, as the House of Representatives considered overhauling our nation's immigration policies, members had an opportunity to separate legal immigration from illegal immigration issues. I supported efforts to delete the legal immigration provisions from H.R. 2002, the ``Immigration in the National Interest Act.''  Some might question my motivation for doing this, however, it is my contention that just as the problems relating to legal and illegal immigration are different, so too are the solutions. You could argue that the work of a brain surgeon and a barber both involve the human head, yet no one would think of going to a barber for brain surgery or a brain surgeon for a haircut. This is precisely the type of ill-conceived logic we employ if we attempt to lump illegal and legal immigration into one reform package.  The two issues deserve separate consideration, and that is why I supported the measure to give each reform vehicle the attention it deserves. The U.S. Senate has already seen fit to separate legal from illegal immigration, again with the belief that our proposed reforms of legal immigration go too far. The legal immigration provisions contained in H.R. 2002 would drastically reduce legal immigration--up to 40 percent by some estimates. It also would reduce the potential for families to be reunited and would decimate the intake of refugees. History has not been kind to us as a nation when we have followed similar paths before.  During the 104th Congress, I have had the great pleasure of serving as a member of the Council for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. In my capacity on council, I have had been afforded the time and luxury to delve deeper into the history surrounding the Holocaust, and I have paid particular attention to the emigration of Jews from Germany in the 1930s. It strikes me that as we consider reforming our legal immigration policy, we should study this tragic period in history carefully, as there are many lessons to be learned.  In July 1938, delegates from 32 countries including the United States, France and Great Britain met at the Evian Hotel in Evian, France, for what has become known as the Evian Conference. The purpose of this conference was to determine what these countries should do in response to the thousands of Jewish refugees who were shunned both by their home country and abroad. Unfortunately, little was accomplished at the Evian Conference because no country was willing or had the fortitude to accept large numbers of Jews, including the U.S.  Since the early 1930s, Jews had been fleeing Germany for a variety of reasons. Initially, the German government encouraged those who could flee to do so, and to take whatever possessions they could with them. Eventually, however, the Nazis made this increasingly more difficult, slapping emigration taxes on Jews and making it impossible for them to survive elsewhere because their funds were tied up in German banks.  The anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany, as we all know, was oppressive. The Nazis wanted to make Germany a place devoid of Jews. As a result, Jews fled by the tens of thousands, often entire families at once. They sought refuge in Western Europe, the U.S., Central and South America, and even China. It is believed that as many as 90,000 Jews emigrated from Germany to the U.S. during this period in history, and many more would have come to our fair land had the U.S. been more willing to accept them. Unfortunately, we were not.  Our country's unwillingness to accept these Jewish refugees took a most tragic turn in May 1939, for it was at this time that the S.S. St. Louis, a German passenger ship, left Germany for Cuba. There were nearly 1,000 Jews on board the St. Louis as it headed toward Havana, yet when it finally reached its destination the ship was turned away by Cuban authorities. The St. Louis then pleaded with U.S. officials to let the nearly 1,000 refugees enter America, yet the U.S. denied the ship permission to land and denied entry visas to the refugees. In June 1939, the ship turned around and returned to Europe.  Fortunately for those on board the St. Louis, the countries of Great Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium agreed to accept the Jewish refugees, although this blessing would be brief and mixed. The following year, in 1940, German forces occupied the region. Many of the passengers aboard the St. Louis--those same passengers America turned away--were dealt the cruelest of fates. Many were subjected in their new homelands to the same horrors from which they had fled--the full wrath of the Holocaust--ghettos, concentration camps, deportations and death chambers.  Fear, prejudice and ignorance allowed America to turn its back on those who sought refuge here in May 1939, with the most tragic of outcomes. America is supposed to be a haven for those oppressed by other nations; it is supposed to be the land of hope and opportunity. Ours is a country that welcomes those who want to come here, contribute to society, and live the American dream.  It is regrettable that we as a nation have been unable to respond to the severe problems of illegal immigration in a sensible, meaningful way. It would be just as regrettable to gut a rich heritage of providing safe harbor for those who seek to come here legally because we cannot deal with a failed illegal immigration policy.  As a nation, we must take full responsibility for our generosity in welcoming others to our land, and full responsibility when that generosity backfires or fails. In separating legal from illegal immigration reform, we have our best chance to answer that call to responsibility. Just as we should not reward those who refuse to make a difference as Americans, we should not punish those who come here and strive to do so. Throughout history, legal immigrants have enriched our economy and the goodness of our country.  We will never know what kind of productive lives those aboard the St. Louis might have led on American soil because we did not give them the chance. It is a shame we will always bear. Legislative action or inaction in Europe and the United States contributed greatly to a tragedy we cannot repeat.  Ours is a country made up of immigrants, and the rich tapestry we enjoy is because so many people, including many of our own grandparents and great-grandparents, had the hear and the will to come here. More importantly, the United States had the heart and the will to welcome them, and it is not something to relinquish now.
