 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable Kentuckian who has been named 1994/95 ``Country Doctor of the Year.'' Dr. Claire Louise Caudill of Rowan County, KY, has unselfishly dedicated herself to the medical profession and the citizens of Rowan County for 46 years.  Dr. Caudill was one of two women to graduate from the University of Louisville Medical School in 1946. Since that time, she has devoted herself to ensuring that proper medical attention was given in her county. She and her faithful nurse assistant, Susie Halbieb, often went above and beyond the call of duty. The two trudged through streams and down impassible country roads to provide care to people. In 1957, Dr. Caudill and nurse Susie opened a maternity clinic in Morehead and delivered about 600 babies a year.  Dr. Caudill's clinic was essential to Rowan County, as the next closest facility was over 70 miles away. Her practice was largely comprised of Medicare/Medicaid patients in one of the nation's poorest areas. She only required payment if the patient could afford it.  She made the dream of a proper medical facility a reality when she initiated fundraising to build a hospital. She spearheaded the effort to raise over $250,000 and then sought the assistance of the Sisters of Notre Dame to assist with funding, management, and staffing. The hospital was built in the 1960's and was duly named the St. Claire Medical Center. The hospital has since emerged as a noted regional facility. It is equipped with a cancer treatment center, a maternity center, a hospice, and a home health care department.  Dr. Caudill has been responsible for delivering over 8,000 babies in her lifetime. Although she no longer delivers babies, she still sees around 20 patients a day. Dr. Caudill is a credit to her community and the medical profession. Mr. President, I ask the Chamber to join me in paying tribute to Claire Louise Caudill, MD, Country Doctor of the Year. Her commitment to the welfare of her community continues to be an example for us all.                          ____________________
