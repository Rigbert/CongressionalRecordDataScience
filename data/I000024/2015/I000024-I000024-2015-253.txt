President, I am introducing a bill to name the Federal courthouse serving the Western District of Oklahoma after the late Judge William J. Holloway.  This legislation has the support of the judges on the Western District, retired Judge Ralph Thompson who served on the bench in the Western District for from 1975 to 2007, and many in the legal community in the Western District of Oklahoma.  Judge Holloway was born in Hugo, OK, and his father was the eighth governor of the State of Oklahoma. He served in the U.S. Army during the height of World War II, received his law degree from Harvard University in 1950, and worked in private practice with a 2-year stint for the Department of Justice. President Lyndon Johnson nominated Judge Holloway to the 10th Circuit in August 1968, and the Senate confirmed him on September 13, 1968, where he served as chief judge from 1984 to 1991. Judge Holloway assumed senior status in May 1992 and passed away April 25, 2014, in Oklahoma City.  Judge Holloway was the longest serving judge on the 10th Circuit, and during his service, he authored over 900 opinions. He was well regarded by all who worked with him, appeared before him, and knew him. I have not found a person knowledgeable of Judge Holloway or his service who could not unequivocally tell you that Judge Holloway adhered to precedent when deciding cases. He did not proclaim any type of philosophy. As new 10th Circuit Judge Robert Bacharach described Judge Holloway, ``He simply decided cases by asking `What does the statute say? What does the Constitution say? What are the facts of this case?'' We know that is a high standard, and a standard lost sometimes in our judiciary.  When he passed away last year, 10th Circuit Judge Jerome Holmes said of Judge Holloway, ``The nation has lost a thoughtful, dedicated, and compassionate jurist, and, as a former law clerk of Judge Holloway, I have lost a mentor, dear friend, and colleague. I know that Judge Holloway was very honored to serve his nation as a judge on the Tenth Circuit, and he served with great distinction.''  On behalf of Judge Holloway and his family, I introduce this bill in his honor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 261       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. WILLIAM J. HOLLOWAY, JR. UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at      200 NW 4th Street in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, shall be known      and designated as the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United      States Courthouse''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall      be deemed to be a reference to the ``William J. Holloway, Jr.      United States Courthouse''.                                  ____                                              U.S. District Court,                                 Western District of Oklahoma,                         Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, August 14, 2014.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: We are writing to respectfully request      that the United States Courthouse in Oklahoma City be named      the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United States Courthouse.''      Judge Holloway died on April 25, 2014, at the age of 90. At      that time, he was the longest serving judge in the history of      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, having served for over 45      years. During his remarkable tenure on the court, Judge      Holloway authored over 900 opinions and participated in the      decision of thousands more.       Judge Holloway was a kind, compassionate man who quietly      and diligently spent his lifetime working for justice. He did      so without fanfare, seeking only to fulfill the great      responsibility given to him. Though Judge Holloway is      deceased, we can think of no more noble name for our      courthouse than the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United States      Courthouse.'' He embodied every trait that all federal judges      should strive to achieve.       This request is made by every federal judge in Oklahoma      City. Please do not hesitate to contact any of us if you have      any questions about our request.           Yours very truly,         Jerome A. Holmes, U.S. Circuit Judge; Vicki Miles-           LaGrange, Chief U.S. District Judge; Robert E.            Bacharach, U.S. Circuit Judge; Robin J.
