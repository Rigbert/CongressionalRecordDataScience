But it is pretty difficult when you have a Bush administration that vetoes everything that we try to do, or threatens it, and you have the kind of speeches that are occurring down here today.  We have got an oil man as the President of this country. His right-hand fellow over there from Wyoming, Mr. Cheney, ran Halliburton, an oil servicing company. So you pretty well know what you have got sitting over there in the White House.  Since they became President and Vice President, this country is importing 1 billion more barrels of oil every year, 1 billion barrels more under the Bush administration. This is not a recipe for energy independence in our country.  This week it was embarrassing to see Secretary Paulson over in Abu Dhabi asking them to, gee, you know, still believe in the dollar, and all of the investors over there made rich by these oil petro dollars, largely U.S. dollars, watching our Secretary give that set of remarks. Similarly, President Bush a couple of weeks ago went to Saudi Arabia and sort of drilled around in the Middle East to see if he could find any additional sources of supply, begging the oil barons.  You know, it wouldn't take that much for him to direct his limousine right up here to Congress, not the Middle East. We have got some rooms over here on this side; we could sit around and talk about what can we agree on in terms of energy independence, what can we agree on here in order to do together what we cannot do alone. Make America energy independent.  As the gentlelady from California said, the President even vetoed the farm bill where we put in a major new title dealing with biofuels. Rural America wants to help lift this country to energy independence.  We are trying to get additions to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve suspended for the moment in order to give some price relief to the American people. Gee, it would be great if President Bush would kind of help us out on that.  He hasn't supported any of our renewable energy bills down here on the floor. In fact, if you look at the energy bill that he produced up there, that big report in his first term, he doesn't even deal with renewables. When you have got an oil perspective at the head of the machine, the car doesn't go in the right direction.  And so it seems to me, look at the record. Look at what he has done and not done on these--The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, no support there. Trying to get OPEC and the big oil companies to have some accountability, he doesn't support us on that. Rather than the President taking trips over to the Middle East, he ought to just come right up Pennsylvania Avenue here to the Congress. Meet with the chairs of our committees who really do care about this, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Markey, Speaker Pelosi. We have got a lot of people here willing to talk. But the President is sending the Secretary of the Treasury over to Abu Dhabi and he himself over to Saudi Arabia. What does that tell the American people? A billion more barrels a year imported every year since he became President.  We don't have a partner to deal with over there at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. And that is why the American people are changing the people being elected here. They know America needs change. They want real leadership. They know they are not getting it.  So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it is time to deal. Get the President. Let's talk about something serious for the sake of the Republic.  Here's a list:  Democratic-Led Congress Taking Action To Bring Down the Cost of Gas                           PASSED THIS MONTH       Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer      Protection Act--Congress has enacted legislation to suspend      the fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the end      of the year, as long as the price of crude oil remains above      $75 per barrel. This is a critical first step for hardworking      families, businesses and the economy, which in the past has      brought gas prices down. The President, who was previously      opposed, suspended shipments and signed the bill because of      overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress.       Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act--This legislation      will extend and expand tax incentives for renewable energy,      retain and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs, spur      American innovation and business investment, and cut taxes      for millions of Americans. These provisions are critical to      creating and preserving hundreds of thousands of good-paying      green collar American jobs. A recent study showed that      allowing the renewable energy incentives to expire would lead      to about 116,000 jobs being lost in the wind and solar      industries alone through the end of 2009.       The OPEC and Big Oil companies accountability bill--This      bill will combat record gas prices by authorizing lawsuits      against oil cartel members for oil price fixing, and creating      an Antitrust Task Force to crack down on oil companies      engaged in anticompetitive behavior or market manipulation.      President Bush has threatened to veto this bill.                             RECENT ACTION       Energy Independence and Security Act in 2007--Historic      energy legislation with provisions to combat oil market      manipulation, increase fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon      in 2020--the first congressional increase in more than three      decades, and promote the use of more affordable American      biofuels. Signed into law on December 19, 2007, Under new      requirements in the Energy Independence Law and pressure from      Congress the FTC announced on May 1, 2008 it would      investigate allegations of market manipulation that may have      led to last year's record price spikes in gasoline prices.       Reduces our dependence on foreign oil--cutting our      consumption of oil by 2.9 million gallons per year in 2030--     more than what we currently import from all Persian Gulf      countries combined.       Lowers energy costs for consumers with oil prices projected      to decline from more than $100 per barrel to $57 per barrel      in 2016 (in 2006 dollars) in part due to the new energy law.       The new fuel standard for cars and trucks will save      American families $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump.       Reduces global warming emissions by 2030 by up to 24      percent of what the U.S. needs to do to help save the planet.       Building, appliance, and lighting efficiency standards will      save consumers $400 billion through 2030.       Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act--This      legislation would end unnecessary subsidies to Big Oil      companies, invest in clean, renewable energy and energy      efficiency, and help reduce global warming. The bill includes      provisions that will generate hundreds of thousands of green      jobs including an estimated 70,000 solar energy jobs, more      than 20,000 biodiesel jobs, and protect an additional 75,000      wind industry jobs. President Bush has threatened to veto      this bill.       Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act--This bill will provide      immediate relief to consumers by giving the Federal Trade      Commission (FTC) the authority to investigate and punish      those who artificially inflate the price of energy. It will      ensure the federal government has the tools it needs to      adequately respond to energy emergencies and prohibit price      gouging--with a priority on refineries and big oil companies.      President Bush has threatened to veto this bill.       No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels (NOPEC) Act--     Legislation to enable the Department of Justice to take legal      action against foreign nations for participating in oil      cartels that drive up oil prices globally and in the United      States. President Bush has threatened to veto this bill.       Energy Market Manipulation Prevention--The new Farm Bill      increases Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight      authority to detect and prevent manipulation of energy      prices. President Bush has vetoed this bill.                              {time}  1100
