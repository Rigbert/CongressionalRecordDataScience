President, I would say for the record that I have many more Democrats seeking time than I have time. I wish to alert those who are coming to the floor that they are going to have to accept an abbreviated time. We did not have all the time we hoped for this morning. I ask each of my speakers to also try to abbreviate their time in the interest of accommodating their colleagues.  I yield 15 minutes to Senator Feinstein and hope that she will yield back a sizeable portion of it.
