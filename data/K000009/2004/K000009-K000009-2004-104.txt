Speaker, following the election debacle in Florida in the 2000 Presidential race, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act to improve election systems across the country; but lately I have met with many election officials who are largely unaware of what that law actually says, and tonight I would like to clarify some of its provisions.  Importantly, HAVA will make money available to the Sates for new voting machines, but HAVA does not require States and localities to replace systems if they are satisfied with the ones that they have. All those jurisdictions have to do if they want to keep their equipment is just provide voters with instructions how to correct their ballot if they make a mistake before that ballot is cast and counted. So the law that Congress passed permits paper ballots if jurisdictions want to use them, it permits punch cards, it permits lever machines, it permits a central count voting system. Those are not outlawed. Indeed, I am putting in the Record tonight title III, section 301 from that act that explains to local election officials what the law actually says. They should not be afraid. There is no Federal pressure to do what they do not want to do.  Some States have decided to go ahead with replacing equipment before this year's Presidential elections even though there are no standards in place at the Federal level to guarantee if they purchase new machines, particularly electronic machines, that they will be secure. And 23 States, including Ohio, have thus received a waiver and are not required to have new systems in place until the first Federal election in 2006, nearly 2 years from now.  There are problems with new electronic voting machines that we did not know when this legislation was initially passed. Some, particularly the primary sponsors of this legislation, say we should leave it alone. They say let the Election Assistance Commission that was talked about in the law do its work. They say let the National Institute of Standards and Technology do its work, let us not have Congress ask any questions right now.  Well, that would be all well and good if those entities had the resources to carry out their job. But the Election Assistance Commission has been formed very late. In fact, a year late. Virtually every deadline that it was given for the issuance of voluntary guidelines to help our local election officials for reports to Congress and for assistance to State and local election authorities has been missed. Today, the commission had its first public meeting, despite the fact it has no permanent office, no equipment it can call its own, no staff beyond the four commissioners and its detailees, and not even enough money to pay for rent for its offices, nor money to pay for the publication tomorrow of State election plans in the Federal Register. It had to depend on the generosity of the General Services Administration for this step required by the Help America Vote Act. Election plans must be published, but the commission has no authority to require changes in them. Public comments will be directed to State election authorities who are free to certify themselves as having met the requirements of HAVA, which essentially at this point has no standards.  So in 45 days with their own certification and no input from the commission, they will begin to receive more than $2.3 billion to spend with no security standards and no guidance beyond the limited verbiage in the act itself. If this were any other Federal program, how many of our colleagues would be here condemning it? Testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on voting machines and its obligation to help develop tough standards for this new equipment was suspended for 2 months this year because of the lack of Federal money.  The commission is thankful that NIST has been able to identify $375,000 to help the technical guidance development committee get under way, but it is only getting under way. No recommendations are expected for another 9 months while the commissioners themselves recognize that State and local election authorities are looking for Federal guidelines to help them develop their own standards.  In fact, AP writer Robert Tanner said this weekend, and I will place the entire article in the Record, ``High-tech voting machines can miscount election results through a software bug or a crashing computer. What is even more troubling, they can be manipulated if someone hacks the computer software. And the biggest problem is without a paper ballot, there is nothing tangible to recount.''  To offer some level of guidance, the commission today voted to hold its own hearing on election voting technology within 35 days. I applaud the commission for doing so, but nothing is more important than our right to vote. We must take the time to get this right.  Mr. Speaker, I urge State and local election officials to read my remarks in the Record.    Election Fix Stymied by Delays, Computer Doubts, Confidence Gap       Editors Note--Problems with the election system in Florida      left the winner of the 2000 presidential race in doubt for      more than a month, and prompted widespread calls to reform      the way the nation elects its leaders. Yet nearly four years      since George W. Bush won in Florida by 537 votes, reform has      been spotty. This story is part of the AP's ongoing coverage      of electoral problems across the country.                 (By Robert Tanner, AP National Writer)       The discord of Florida 2000 is hard to forget. Angry crowds      yelling at local election officials, a paralysis that      virtually halted other political work, accusations of a      stolen presidential election that echo today.       But the many promises that followed the 36-day stalemate      have not produced a nationwide solution to the glaring flaws      exposed in the way we cast votes and count them--and another      presidential election is just months away.       There's blame enough to go around. Pick any of the      following, or all: President Bush and Congress; the voting      machine industry; local election officials. (You can add      computer scientists, the media, even mistake-prone voters.)       It's true some changes have been made: Roughly 50 million      registered voters, or slightly more than a quarter      nationwide, will be able to cast ballots on the latest      touchscreen equipment this year.       But that leaves the glass half-full, at best, especially      with the biggest reforms so far now coming in for criticism.      In particular, those ATM-style electronic voting machines--     once trumpeted as the solution to voting problems--are now      under fire from some computer scientists and lawmakers. That,      in turn, is slowing further reforms and weakening confidence      in the system even more.       ``You have resistance, sort of natural resistance, to      change,'' said Ken Blackwell, Ohio's secretary of state.      Legislators in his state, worried about security, want an end      to electronic machine purchases, even if punch cards remain      in many counties.       In critics' eyes, the problems have been worsened by      electoral officials blind to the dangers of a broken system      or influenced by political aims, and caring too little about      damage done to voters' trust. Others see the slow progress as      healthy--that's the way democracies work, they argue, by      publicly hashing out problems.       Either way, the bottom line is that another razor-thin      presidential election could again leave a victor unclear, a      system unable to smoothly resolve the problem, and a      skeptical and angry public.       The pitfalls break down into three broad categories: cash,      computers and confidence.       After the 2000 crisis, promises of electoral reform didn't      translate into quick action. It took nearly two years for      Congress to pass the law giving states money and direction to      buy new machines, and improve voter registration and      training.       The problem was the policy-makers were pulled in different      directions--minority and disabled voters sought federal      standards to ensure all had equal access to the polls, while      state election officials argued local control would best      serve widely different communities.       Experts produced nearly a dozen studies, including      recommendations from a Gerald Ford-Jimmy Carter commission      (some of its top ideas, like making Election Day a holiday      and giving all felons the right to vote after serving their      sentence, were promptly ignored).       Money for the states to implement reform took even longer:      Of $3.8 billion promised, states have only received $650      million so far.       The commission that was to be created to dole out money and      advice was delayed by arguments between the White House and      Congress. Members weren't appointed until December, less than      a year before the 2004 election.       ``I put the largest blame on Congress itself,'' said Kim      Brace, an elections expert who consults with states. ``They      built up a lot of hope in the rhetoric side and fell through      dramatically on the action side. And certainly on the      dollars.''                          the delays continue       Critical technical work on voting machines, tasked to the      National Institute of Standards and Technology, was suspended      for two months this year because of a lack of federal money.      The institute's job? Make sure standards are tough for      computerized touchscreen voting machines.       And that leads to the heart of the fight: Critics,      including some prominent Democrats, say the ATM-style      machines are a bigger danger than punch cards. Source of the      infamous ``hanging chad'' ballots that left Florida      election commissioners trying to divine voter intent from      bumps on the cards.       Laterly, those warnings have been heard: Besides Ohio,      officials are reconsidering or delaying the switch to new      machines in California, West Virginia, Utah, and more.       ``Why trade one imperfect system for another imperfect      system?'' David Wilde, a councilman in Salt Lake County,      asked when questions were raised there about switching to      touchscreen machines.              COMPUTER SCIENTISTS' WORRIES RUN MUCH DEEPER       The high-tech voting machines, they say, can miscount      election results through a software bug or a crashing      computer; what's even more troubling, they can be manipulated      if someone hacks the computer's software. And the biggest      problem is that, without a paper ballot, there is nothing      tangible to recount.       Because the voting machine industry keeps its computer code      secret, claiming competitive business concerns, no one can be      truly confident that the machines are as secure as they      promise, critics say.       ``If something can be stolen, eventually it will be,'' said      Barbara Simons, a retired IBM computer scientist. ``Our      democracy is much too valuable to trust them to this machine.      . . . If the election is close--or the opinion polls are      close--that means people aren't going to trust the outcome.      And there's no way to convince them that they are right.''       The solution, in this view, are ``voter verifiable paper      trails''--a paper ballot that the computer prints after a      vote is cast, that the voter can see to ensure their choice      was accurately recorded, and that will be locked away for any      recount.       A number of studies of the electronic machines have      confirmed the doubts including a harshly critical one from      Johns Hopkins University. Studies in Maryland and Ohio also      found flaws, but said they could be corrected.       The divide is deep, however, with exasperated election      officials and executives from the voting machine industry      arguing that critics are inflating small problems into      systemwide dangers and frightening voters unnecessarily.       ``I think touchscreen is the best voting system,'' said Pam      Iorio, the former elections supervisor in Florida's      Hillsborough County (Tampa), where touchscreens were      installed. ``Election officials have just not been able to      get their message out.''       The paper trail proposed would ``do more harm than good,''      said Dawn Williams, who oversees elections in Marshall      County, Iowa. The receipts will just confuse voters, add more      equipment to break down and more burdens for poll workers.       Primary elections so far this year have produced small      glitches--machines that failed to boot up in San Diego,      coding problems in Georgia and Maryland--but no outright      disasters. Supporters of the new technology say that proves      the wisdom of their confidence; doubters say it shows nothing      of the sort.       The suspicion of critics is compounded by the fact that      election officials and the voting machine industry are often      closely intertwined.       Washington state's secretary of state went to work in the      industry; so did several election officials in California.      Under scrutiny is a job change in California, when the former      state official in charge of evaluating voting machines took a      top job with Election Systems and Software, a large      manufacturer.       Those in the relatively small world of elections say that's      natural.       ``I personally don't see anything wrong with it,'' said      Ernie Hawkins, who retired last year as head of Sacramento's      election division. ``You know the business, you know the      problem, you know where the dangers are. I'd probably be more      inclined to listen to someone who was trying to sell me      something if they knew what they were talking about.''       And don't leave out the politics. The chief executive of      Ohio-based Diebold Inc., one of the largest voting machine      manufacturers and a top target of security critics, is a top      fund-raiser for the Bush campaign. In an August fund-raising      letter, Walden O'Dell sought $10,000 donations and declared      he was ``committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral      votes to the president next year.''       He later announced that he would ``try to be more      sensitive'' and would lower his political profile.       While errors are inevitable in a system recording tens of      millions of votes nationally, it's clear that scrutiny of the      voting system will be at an all-time high this year. A      greater-than-usual number of election officials have quit or      taken retirement. Others are just hoping for a presidential      blowout.       ``Every election official's prayer is, you hear many times,      they really don't care who wins,'' said Richard Smolka, an      elections expert and retired political science professor.      ``They just don't want the election to be that close.''                                  ____   TITLE III--UNIFORM AND NONDISCRIMINATORY ELECTION TECHNOLOGY AND                       ADMINISTRATION REQUIREMENTS                        Subtitle A--Requirements     SEC. 301.
