 I yield the floor.   Remarks by Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator, Drug Enforcement    Administration, Before the House Government Reform and Oversight    Committee, National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal                           Justice Subcommittee       Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee: I appreciate      this opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee today on      the subject of Mexico and the Southwest Border Initiative. My      comments today will be limited to an objective assessment of      the law enforcement issues involving organized crime and drug      trafficking problems with specific attention on Mexico and      the Southwest border. This hearing is extremely timely, and      during my testimony I will provide the subcommittee with a      full picture of how organized crime groups from Mexico      operate and affect so many aspects of life in America today.      I am not exaggerating when I say that these sophisticated      drug syndicate groups from Mexico have eclipsed organized      crime groups from Colombia as the premier law enforcement      threat facing the United States today.       Many phrases have been used to describe the complex and      sophisticated international drug trafficking groups operating      out of Colombia and Mexico, and frankly, the somewhat      respectable titles of ``cartel'' or ``federation'' mask the      true identity of these vicious, destructive entities. The      Cali organization, and the four largest drug trafficking      organizations in Mexico--operating out of Juarez, Tijuana,      Sonora and the Gulf region--are simply organized crime groups      whose leaders are not in Brooklyn or Queens, but are safely      ensconced on foreign soil. They are not legitimate      businessmen as the word ``cartel'' implies, nor are they      ``federated'' into a legitimate conglomerate. These syndicate      leaders--the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Colombia to Amado      Carrillo-Fuentes, Juan Garcia-Abrego, Miguel Caro-Quintero,      and the Arellano-Felix Brothers--are simply the 1990's      versions of the mob leaders U.S. law enforcement has fought      since shortly after the turn of this century.       But these organized crime leaders are far more dangerous,      far more influential and have a great deal more impact on our      day to day lives than their domestic predecessors. While      organized crime in the United States during the      1950's through the 1970's affected certain aspects of      American life, their influence pales in comparison to the      violence, corruption and power that today's drug      syndicates wield. These individuals, from their      headquarters locations, absolutely influence the choices      that too many Americans make about where to live, when to      venture out of their homes, or where they send their      children to school. The drugs--and the attendant violence      which accompanies the drug trade--have reached into every      American community and have robbed many Americans of the      dreams they once cherished.       Organized crime in the United States was addressed over      time, but only after Americans recognized the dangers that      organized crime posed to our way of life. But it did not      happen overnight. American organized crime was exposed to the      light of day systematically, stripping away the pretense that      mob leaders were anonymous businessmen. The Appalachian raid      of 1957 forced law enforcement to acknowledge that these      organized syndicates did indeed exist, and strong measures      were taken to go after the top leadership, a strategy used      effectively throughout our national campaign against the mob.      During the 1960's, Attorney General Bobby Kennedy was      unequivocal in his approach to ending the reign of organized      crime in America, and consistent law enforcement policies      were enacted which resulted in real gains. Today, traditional      organized crime, as we knew it in the United States, has been      eviscerated, a fragment of what it once was.       At the height of its power, organized crime in this nation      was consolidated in the hands of few major families whose key      players live in this nation, and were within reach of our      criminal justice system. All decisions made by organized      crime were made within the United States. Orders were carried      out on U.S. soil. While it was not easy to build cases      against the mob leaders, law enforcement knew that once a      good case was made against a boss, he could be located within      the U.S., arrested and sent to jail.       That is not the case with today's organized criminal      groups. They are strong, sophisticated and destructive      organizations operating on a global scale. Their decisions      are made in sanctuaries in Cali, Colombia, and Guadalajara,      Mexico, even day-to-day operational decisions such as where      to ship cocaine, which cars their workers in the United      States should rent, which apartments should be leased, which      markings should be on each cocaine package, which contract      murders should be ordered, which official should be bribed,      and how much. They are shadowy figures whose armies of      workers in Colombia, Mexico and the United States answer to      them via daily faxes, cellular phone, or pagers. Their armies      carry out killings within the United States--one day an      outspoken journalist, one day a courier who had lost a load,      the next an innocent bystander caught in the line of fire--on      orders of the top leadership. They operate from the safety of      protected locations and are free to come and go as they      please within their home countries. These syndicate bosses      have at their disposal airplanes, boats, vehicles, radar,      communications equipment and weapons in quantities which      rival the capabilities of some legitimate governments.      Whereas previous organized crime leaders were millionaires,      the Cali drug traffickers and their counterparts from Mexico      are billionaires.       It is difficult--sometimes nearly impossible--for U.S. law      enforcement to locate and arrest these leaders without the      assistance of law enforcement in other countries. Their      communications are coded. they are protected by corrupt law      enforcement officials, despite pledges from the Government of      Mexico to apprehend the syndicate leaders, law enforcement      authorities have been unable to locate them and even if they      are located, the government is not obligated to extradite      them to the U.S. to stand trial.       In Mexico, as is the case wherever organized crime      flourishes, corruption and intimidation allow the leaders to      maintain     control. These sophisticated criminal groups cannot thrive      unless law enforcement officials have been paid bribes, and      witnesses fear for their lives. Later in my testimony I will      discuss some of these problems in greater detail.       It is frustrating for all of us in law enforcement that the      leaders of these criminal organizations, although well known      and indicted repeatedly, have not been located, arrested or      prosecuted.               the cali group and traffickers from mexico       We cannot discuss the situation in Mexico today without      looking at the evolution of the groups from Colombia--how      they began, what their status is today, and how the groups      from Mexico have learned important lessions from them,      becoming major trafficking organizations in their own right.       During the late 1980's the Cali group assumed greater and      greater power as their predecessors from the Medellin cartel      was brash and publicly violent in their activities, the      criminals, who ran their organization from Cali, labored      behind the pretense of legitimacy, posing as businessmen,      just carrying out their professional obligations. The Cali      leaders-the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Santa Cruz Londono,      Pacho Herrera--amassed fortunes and ran their multi-billion      dollar cocaine businesses from high-rises and ranches in      Colombia, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela and his associates      composed what was until then, the most powerful international      organized crime group in history, employed 727 aircraft to      ferry drugs to Mexico, from where they were smuggled into the      United States, and then return to Colombia with the money      from U.S. drug sales. Using landing areas in Mexico, they      were able to evade U.S. law enforcement officials and make      important alliances with transportation and distribution      experts in Mexico.       With intense law enforcement pressure focused on the Cali      leadership by brave men and women in the Colombian National      Police during 1995 and 1996, all of the top leadership of the      Cali syndicate are either in jail, or dead. The fine work      done by General Serrano, who appeared before your      subcommittee only two weeks ago, and other CNP officers is a      testament to the commitment and dedication of Colombia's law      enforcement officials in the face of great personal danger      and a government whose leadership is riddled with drug      corruption.       Since the Cali leaders' imprisonment on sentences which      were ridiculously short and inadequate, traffickers from      Mexico took on greater prominence. The alliance between the      Colombian traffickers and the organizations from Mexico had      benefits for both sides. Traditionally, the traffickers from      Mexico have long been involved in smuggling marijuana,      heroin, cocaine into the United States, and had established      solid distribution routes throughout the nation. Because the      Cali syndicate was concerned about the security of their      loads, they brokered a commercial deal with the traffickers      from Mexico, which reduced their potential losses.       This agreement entailed the Colombians moving cocaine from      the Andean region to the Mexican organizations, who then      assumed the responsibility of delivering the cocaine into the      United States. In 1989, U.S. law enforcement officials seized      21 metric tons of cocaine in Sylmar, California; this record      seizure demonstrated the extent and magnitude of the Mexican      groups' capabilities to transport Colombian-produced cocaine      into the United States. This huge shipment was driven across      the Mexican/U.S. border in small shipments and stored in the      warehouse until all transportation fees had been paid by the      Calif and Medellin cartels, to the transporters from Mexico      are routinely paid in multi-ton quantities of cocaine, making      them formidable cocaine traffickers in their own right.       The majority of cocaine entering the United States      continues to come from Colombia through Mexico and across      U.S. border points of entry. Most of the cocaine enters the      United States in privately owned vehicles and commercial      trucks. There is a new evidence that indicates traffickers in      Mexico have gone directly to sources of cocaine in Bolivia      and Peru in order to circumvent Colombian middlemen. In      addition to the inexhaustible supply of cocaine entering the      U.S., trafficking organizations from Mexico are responsible      for producing and trafficking thousands of pounds of      methamphetamine, and have been major distributors of heroin      and marijuana in the W.S. since the 1970's.                     Major Traffickers from Mexico       A number of major trafficking organizations represent the      highest echelons of organized crime in Mexico. Their leaders      are under indictment in the United States on numerous      charges. The Department of Justice has submitted Provisional      Warrants for many of their arrests to the Government of      Mexico, and only one, Juan Garcia Agrego, because he was a      U.S. citizen has been sent to the U.S. to face justice. The      other leaders are living freely in Mexico, and have so far      escaped apprehension by Mexican law enforcement, and have      suffered little, if any inconvenience resulting from their      notorious status, I believe that in order to fully expose      these syndicate leaders, it is more beneficial to refer to      them by their personal names than by the names of their      organizations.                         Amado Carrillo-Fuentes       The most powerful drug trafficker in Mexico at the current      time is Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, who, as recently reported,      allegedly has ties to the former Commissioner of the INCD,      Gutierrez-Rebollo. His organized crime group, based in      Juarez, is associated with the Rodriguez-Orejuela      organization and the Ochoa brothers, from Medellin, as      well. This organization, which is also involved in heroin      and marijuana trafficking, handles large cocaine shipments      from Columbia. Their regional bases in Guadalajara,      Hermosillo and Torreon serve as storage locations where      later, the drugs are moved closer to the border for      eventual shipment into the United States.       The scope of the Carrillo-Fuentes' network is staggering;      he reportedly forwards $20-$30 million to Colombia for each      major operation, and his illegal activities generate ten's of      millions per week. He was a pioneer in the use of large      aircraft to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico and      became known as ``Lord of the Skies.'' Carillo-Fuentes      reportedly owns a fleet of aircraft and has major real estate      holdings.       Like his Colombian counterparts, Carillo-Fuentes is      sophisticated in the use of technology and counter      surveillance methods. His network employs state of the art      communications devices to conduct business. His organization      has become so powerful he is even seeking to expand his      markets into traditional Colombian strongholds on the east      coast of the United States.       Presently, Carrillo-Fuentes is attempting to consolidate      control over drug trafficking along the entire Mexican      northern border, and he plans to continue to bribe border      officials to ensure that his attempts are successful.      Carrillo-Fuentes, who is the subject of numerous separate      U.S. law enforcement investigations has been indicted in      Florida and Texas and remains a fugitive on heroin and      cocaine charges.                          Miguel Caro-Quintero       Miguel Caro-Quintero's organization is based in Sonora,      Mexico and focuses its attention on trafficking cocaine and      marijuana. His brother, Rafael, is in prison in Mexico for      his role in killing DEA Special Agent Kiki Camarena in 1985.       Miguel, along with two of his other brothers--Jorge and      Genaro--run the organization. Miguel himself was arrested in      1992, and the USG and GOM cooperated in a bilateral      prosecution. Unfortunately, that effort was thwarted when      Miguel was able to use a combination of threats and bribes to      have his charges dismissed by a federal judge in Hermosillo.      He has operated freely since that time.       The Caro-Quintero organization specializes primarily in the      cultivation, production and distribution of marijuana, a      major cash-crop for drug groups from Mexico. The organization      is believed to own many ranches in the northern border state      of Sonora, where drugs are stored, and from which drug      operations into the United States are staged. Despite its      specialization in marijuana cultivation and distribution,      like the other major drug organizations in Mexico, this group      is polydrug in nature, also transporting and distributing      cocaine and methamphetamine.       Miguel Caro-Quintero is the subject of several indictments      in the United States and is currently the subject of      provisional arrest warrants issued by the United States      government, yet in an act of astonishing arrogance he called      a radio station in Hermosillo, Mexico last May indicating      that he was bothered by statements I had made that he was an      innocent rancher and charges made against him by DEA were      untrue. He then had the audacity to give his address and      invite law enforcement officials from Mexico and the United      States to visit him--yet he remains at large.                      The Arellano-Felix Brothers       The Arellano-Felix Organization (AFO), often referred to as      the Tijuana Cartel, is one of the most powerful and      aggressive drug trafficking organizations operating from      Mexico; it is undeniably the most violent. More than any      other major trafficking organization from Mexico, it extends      its tentacles directly from high-echelon figures in the law      enforcement and judicial systems in Mexico, to street-level      individuals in the United States. The AFO is responsible for      the transportation, importation and distribution of multi-ton      quantities of cocaine, marijuana, as well as large quantities      of heroin and methamphetamine, into the United States from      Mexico. The AFO operates primarily in the Mexican states of      Sinaloa (their birth place), Jalisco, Michoacan, Chiapas, and      Baja California South and North. From Baja, the drugs enter      California, the primary point of embarkation into the      United States distribution network.       The AFO does not operate without the complicity of Mexican      law enforcement officials and their subordinates. According      to extradition documents submitted by the Government of      Mexico in San Diego, California, key family members      reportedly dispense an estimated one million dollars weekly      in bribes to Mexican federal, state and local officials, who      assure that the movement of drugs continues to flow unimpeded      to the gateway cities along the southwestern border of the      United States.       The Arellano family, composed of seven brothers and four      sisters, inherited the organization from Miguel Angel Felix-     Gallardo upon his incarceration in Mexico in 1989 for his      complicity in the murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique      Camarena. Alberto Benjamin Arellano-Felix assumed leadership      of the family structured criminal enterprise and provides a      businessman's approach to the management of drug trafficking      operations.       Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix, considered the most violent      brother, organizes and coordinates protection details over      which he     exerts absolute control. The AFO maintains well-armed and      well-trained security forces, described by Mexican      enforcement officials as paramilitary in nature, which      include international mercenaries as advisors, trainers and      members. Ramon Arellano's responsibilities consist of the      planning of murders of rival drug leaders and those Mexican      law enforcement officials not on their payroll. Also targeted      for assassination are those AFO members who fall out of favor      with the AFO leadership or simply are suspected of      collaborating with law enforcement officials. Enforcers are      often hired from violent street gangs in cities and towns in      both Mexico and the United States in the belief that these      gang members are expendable. They are dispatched to      assassinate targeted individuals and to send a clear message      to those who attempt to utilize the Mexicali/Tijuana corridor      without paying the area transit tax demanded by the AFO      trafficking domain.       The AFO also maintains complex communications centers in      several major cities in Mexico to conduct electronic      espionage and counter-surveillance measures against law      enforcement entities. The organization employs radio scanners      and equipment capable of intercepting both hard line and      cellular phones to ensure the security of AFO operators. In      addition to technical equipment, the AFO maintains caches of      sophisticated automatic weaponry secured from a variety of      international sources.       A Joint Task Force composed of the Drug Enforcement      Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has      been established in San Diego, California, to target the AFO;      the Task Force is investigating AFO operations in Southern      California and related regional investigations which track      drug transportation, distribution and money laundering      activities of the AFO throughout the United States.                             Jesus Amezcua       The Amezcua-Contreras brothers operating out of      Guadalajara, Mexico head up a methamphetamine production and      trafficking organization with global dimensions. Directed by      Jesus Amezcua, and supported by his brothers, Adan and Luis,      the Amezcua drug trafficking organization today is probably      the world's largest smuggler of ephedrine and clandestine      producer of methamphetamine. With a growing methamphetamine      abuse problem in the United States, this organization's      activities impact on a number of the major population centers      in the U.S. The Amezcua organization obtains large quantities      of the precursor ephedrine, utilizing contacts in Thailand      and India, which they supply to methamphetamine labs in      Mexico and the United States. This organization has placed      trusted associates in the United States to move ephedrine to      Mexican methamphetamine traffickers operating in the U.S.      Jose Osorio-Cabrera, a fugitive from a Los Angeles      investigation until his arrest in Bangkok, was a major      ephedrine purchaser for the Amezcua organization.                          Joaquin Guzman-Loera       Joaquin Guzman-Loera began to make a name for himself as a      trafficker and air logistics expert for the powerful Miguel      Felix-Gallardo organization. Guzman-Loera broke away from      Felix-Gallardo and rose to patron level among the major      Mexican trafficking organizations. Presently, he is      incarcerated in Mexico; however, Mexican and United States      authorities still consider him to be a major international      drug trafficker. The organization has not been dismantled      or seriously affected by Guzman-Loera's imprisonment      because his brother, Arturo Guzman-Loera, has assumed the      leadership role. The Guzman-Loera organization transports      cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the United States      for the Medellin and Cali organizations and is also      involved in the movement, storage, and distribution of      marijuana, and Mexican and Southeast Asian heroin. This      organization controlled the drug smuggling tunnel between      Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico and Douglas, Arizona through      which tons of cocaine were smuggled.       Guzman-Loera, who has been named in several U.S.      indictments, was arrested on June 9, 1993 in Talisman, Mexico      for narcotics, homicide, and cocaine trafficking and is      presently incarcerated at the Almoloya de Juarez Maximum      Security Prison in Toluca, Mexico.           Effect of Mexican Organized Crime on United States       Unfortunately, the violence that is attendant to the drug      trade in Mexico is spilling over the border into U.S. towns,      like San Diego, California and Eagle Pass, Texas. Last      summer, ranchers along the Texas/Mexico Border reported they      were besieged by drug organizations smuggling cocaine and      marijuana across their property--fences were torn down,      livestock butchered and shots were fired at the ranchers      homes at night. Ranchers reported seeing armed patrols in      Mexico with night vision equipment, hand-held radios and      assault rifles that protected a steady stream of smugglers      back packing marijuana and cocaine into the United States.      The problem became so acute that the State of Texas and the      Federal government sent support in the form of additional      U.S. Border Patrol Agents, DEA Special Agents, Officers from      the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas National      Guard. Life has returned somewhat to normal in that area, as      the drug gangs reacted to law enforcement pressure and have      moved their operations elsewhere.       DEA information supports widely reported press accounts      that the Arellano-Felix organization relies on a San Diego,      California gang known as ``Logan Heights Calle 30'' to carry      out executions and conduct security for their distribution      operations. Six members of ``Calle 30'' were arrested by      DEA's violent crime task force and the San Diego Police      Department for the murder of a man and his son in San Diego.      Since that time 49 members of ``Calle 30'' have been arrested      by the Narcotics Task Force in San Diego on a variety of      charges from trafficking to violent crimes.       On December 11, 1996, Fernando Jesus-Gutierrez was shot      five times in the face during rush hour in the then exclusive      neighborhood, the Silver Strand, in Coronado, California,      after his death was ordered by the Arellano-Felix      organization. In 1993, a turf battle over the methamphetamine      market between rival drug gangs from Mexico resulted in 26      individuals being murdered in one summer in the San Diego      area.     U.S. law enforcement strategy versus organized crime in mexico       The Southwest Border Initiative (SWBI) is Federal law      enforcement's joint response to the substantial threat posed      by Mexican groups operating along the Southwest Border. The      SWBI, now in its third year of operation, is an integrated,      coordinated strategy that focuses the resources of DEA, FBI,      the United States Attorney's Office, the Criminal Division,      the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service and state      and local authorities on the sophisticated Mexican drug      trafficking organizations operating on both sides of the      U.S./Mexican border.       Through this initiative we have identified the      sophisticated Mexican drug trafficking organizations      operating along the entire U.S. border. These groups are      transporting multi-ton shipments of cocaine for the Colombia      groups, as well as heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana.      Imitating the Colombian groups, the Mexican organizations are      highly compartmentalized, using numerous workers to      accomplish very specific tasks, such as driving load cars,      renting houses for storage sites, distributing cocaine, and      collecting profits. Through the compartmentalization process      each worker performs a distinct task and has no knowledge of      the other members of the organization.       We are attacking the organizations by targeting the      communication systems of their command and control centers.      Working in concert, DEA, FBI, U.S. Customs Service and the      U.S. Attorneys offices around the country conduct wiretaps      that ultimately identify their U.S. based organization from      top to bottom. This strategy allows us to track the seamless      continuum of cocaine traffic as it flows from Colombia      through Mexico, to its eventual street distribution in the      United States. However, even though this strategy is      extremely effective in dismantling the U.S. based portions      of the organizations, we are frustrated by not being able      to use this same information to reach the organization's      bosses in Mexico and their current counterparts in      Colombia. Criminals, such as Carillo-Fuentes and Arellano-     Felix, personally direct their organizations from safe      havens in Mexico and until we garner the complete      cooperation of law enforcement officials in Mexico, we      will never be truly effective in stopping the flow of      drugs from their country.       The Southwest Border Strategy is anchored in our belief      that the only way of successfully attacking any organized      crime syndicate is to build strong cases on the leadership      and their command and control functions. The long-term      incarceration of key members of these organization's command      and control will cause a steady degradation of their ability      conduct business in the United States and with the assistance      of foreign governments, the long-term incarceration of the      leadership will leave the entire organizations in disarray.      The Cali syndicate once controlled cocaine traffic in the      world from a highly organized corporate structure, with the      incarceration of the Cali leaders we see the cocaine trade in      Colombia has become far less monolithic and several      independent unrelated organizations are controlling the      exportation of cocaine to the U.S. and Mexico. This change is      a direct result of the incarceration of the Cali leaders and      their inability to fully control their organizations from      prison.       We spoke to you last year about the successes of Zorro II,      conducted under the auspices of the SWBI, during which both a      Colombian distribution organization and a Mexican smuggling      organization were dismantled and the infrastructure of both      organizations were destroyed. Ninety court authorized wire      taps resulted in the arrest of 156 people and the seizure of      $17 million dollars and 5,600 kilograms of cocaine. Most      importantly, neither the Colombian or Mexican organizations      have been able to reconstitute these distribution      organizations. Zorro II confirmed our belief that cocaine      distribution in the United States is controlled by the      foreign syndicates located in Colombia and Mexico.       Since Zorro II, we have continued to focus on the command      and control function of other transportation and distribution      cells operating along the Southwest Border and throughout the      U.S. These investigations are time and resource intensive,      but yield significant results. Additional investigations, of      similar significance and importance as Zorro II, have been      developed since that time, however due to the sensitive      nature of the investigations. I am precluded from discussing      them at this time.            corruption and intimidation: tools of the trade       Traditionally, organized crime has depended on the      corruption of officials, and the intimidation of potential or      actual witnesses, as well as violence against anyone who      stands in the way of business. The Medellin and Cali      traffickers were masters of corruption, intimidation and      violence, and used these tools effectively to silence and      coerce.       Organized crime figures in Mexico routinely use these tools      as well. The recent arrest of the Commissioner of the INCD in      Mexico last week is the latest illustration of how deeply      rooted corruption is in Mexican anti-narcotics organizations.      A good illustration of the extent of corruption in Mexico was      revealed when officials, seeking the extradition of two of      Arellano-Felix's contract killers, who are currently      incarcerated in the United States, submitted papers      indicating that the State Attorney General and almost 90      percent of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and      judges in Tijuana and the State of Baja California have been      compromised and are on the payroll of the Arellano-Felix      brothers. In addition, several high ranking police officers      regularly provide the names of witnesses who give statements      against the Arellano-Felixes and have even provided      information that assisted in locating targets for      assassination. Just recently, the Federal Police in Baja      California Norte were replaced with military troops, a tacit      admission of the level of corruption in that area. Yet, as we      observed with the arrest of Gutierrez-Rebollo, the military      is not immune from corruption either.       Historically, corruption has been a central problem in      DEA's relationship with Mexican counterparts. In short, there      is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with      whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship. Such a      relationship is absolutely essential to the conduct of      business in that, or any other nation where organized crime      syndicates traffic in narcotics.       In the brief time we have allotted to us today, I would      like to provide you with some recent examples of the      corruption which we encounter all too frequently in Mexico.       This January, the Mexican Army raided the wedding party of      Amado Carillo-Fuentes' sister. When they arrived at the      scene. Mexican Federal Judicial Police were guarding the      party. The MFJP had alerted Carillo-Fuentes about the planned      raid, and he was able to escape.       The Arellano-Felix organization routinely bribes government      officials to obtain information from prosecutors' offices      including information on potential witnesses.       Despite the firing of over 1,200 government officials for      corruption charges by President Zedillo, no successful      prosecutions of these individuals has taken place.       In March 1996, DEA Task Force Agents arrested two      individuals who identified themselves as police officers from      Sonora, Mexico. Eleven hundred pounds of marijuana were found      on the scene, and the police admitted they worked at the      stash house.       In July a Mexican Army Division arrested nine Mexican      Federal Judicial Police Officers and seized 50 kilograms of      cocaine and $578,000 in U.S. currency. The defendants were      acting under the direction of the Commandante for Culiacan,      Sinalon at the time.       While a great deal of the corruption plagues the law      enforcement agencies in Mexico, the Mexican military and      other institutions are also vulnerable to the corrupting      influences of the narcotics trade. The Mexican Government has      replaced police with military officials, who are not fully      trained in all of the aspects of narcotics investigations.      This situation is far from ideal. Political officials are      also not immune to narcotics corruption: DEA has documented      instances where public officials have allowed drug      traffickers to freely operate in areas under their control.      Corruption is the most serious, most pervasive obstacle to      progress in addressing the drug trade in Mexico.       In addition to the serious corruption problems plaguing      anti-narcotics enforcement efforts in Mexico, murders and      violence are commonplace methods of silencing witnesses or      rivals. Since 1993, twenty-three major drug-related      assassinations have taken place in Mexico. Virtually all of      these murders remain unsolved. Many of them have occurred in      Tijuana or have involved victims from Tijuana. In the last      year, 12 law enforcement officials or former officials have      been gunned down in Tijuana and the vast majority of the 200      murders in that city are believed to have been drug-related.       A number of these incidents involving law enforcement      officials are a serious indication of the depth and breadth      of the power of the traffickers in Mexico.       The Arellano-Felix organization was responsible for setting      off a bomb at the Camino Real Hotel in Guadalajara, where      they intended to kill a rival trafficker, hosting a party for      his daughter. Two men were killed and fifteen people wounded.       In September 1996, Jorge Garcia-Vargas, Sub-Director of the      Tijuana office of the Institute for the Combat of Drugs      (INCD) and former Commandante Miguel Angel Silva-Caballero      were found shot to death in their car in Mexico City. The      bodies showed signs of torture, similar to those on the      bodies of Hector Gonzalez-Baecenas. Garcia-Vargas' assistant      in Tijuana, and three body guards who were tortured and      killed five days earlier in Mexico City. Garcia-Vargas' death      came only one year after he took the job in Tijuana.       Ernest Ibarra-Santes, the Director of Federal Police Force      in Tijuana, and two police officers were executed by machine-     gun fire as they drove along a main street in Mexico City.      Ibarra-Santes was executed just 29 days after he became      Director and two days after he reprimanded his own force      stating ``The Police had become so corrupt they weren't just      friends with the traffickers, they were their servants.'' A      Mexican Army officer has been implicated in this murder.       Baja State Prosecutor Godin Gutierrez-Rico was assassinated      in front of his residence in Tijuana on January 3, 1997.      Guiterrez a supervisory state attorney and former head of a      special enforcement unit that investigated high profile      homicides in Tijuana, had assisted DEA in identifying several      assassins for the Arellano-Felix organization. Information      strongly links the Arellano-Felix's to this murder which was      particularly vicious; Guiterrez-Rico was shot over 100 times,      after which his body was repeatedly run over by an      automobile.       It is hard to imagine that in our own nation, we would      stand for such killings and for government inaction in      solving the murders. The assassinations in Mexico are akin to      three Assistant United States Attorneys, the Special Agent in      Charge of the DEA office in San Diego, the Special Agent in      Charge of the FBI office in Houston and the Chief of Police      in San Diego being murdered callously by drug dealers.      Americans would not accept these murders going unsolved and      no arrests being made. For any country's law enforcement      agencies to be viable partners in the international law      enforcement arena, they must apprehend and incarcerate      those criminals who murder with such impunity.                        cooperation with mexico       The primary program for cooperative law enforcement efforts      with the Government of Mexico is a proposed series of      Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). The U.S. and Mexico signed a      memorandum of understanding in 1996, outlining the framework      for the United States Government and the government of Mexico      to conduct joint investigations against targeted drug      organizations. These Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's) were      established in Juarez, Tijuana and Monterrey. The task forces      in Tijuana and Juarez have been limited in their ability to      collect intelligence and seize drugs and they have not met      their most important objectives of arresting the leaders of      the major syndicates and dismantling their organizations.       During bilateral plenary meetings, Mexican officials      promised they would allocate $2.4 million from seized assets      the U.S. had shared with Mexico towards the financing of the      BTF's; however, Francisco Molina Ruiz, the former head of the      INCD, advised DEA that he had been unable to obtain the      financial support necessary to make these Task Forces      operational. The BTF's for the most part are staffed with      enthusiastic young officers, however, they have neither      received the training nor the equipment necessary to build      cases on and arrest these sophisticated and wealthy drug      traffickers.       The most significant shortcoming of the B.T.F.'s however,      lies in its leadership. On at least two occasions, after      having been advised of pending enforcement actions by their      subordinates, corrupt command officers in Mexico City      compromised the investigations. One involved the attempted      seizure of sixteen tons of cocaine belonging to the Arellano-     Felix family. To be successful in Mexico, we must be able to      share intelligence with the B.T.F.'s with the confidence that      it will be promptly acted on and not be compromised by      corrupt officials that is not the condition that we are      currently faced with in our relationship with the bi-lateral      groups.       Unfortunately, I was recently forced to limit DEA      participation in these B.T.F.'s, because of a decision by the      Government of Mexico that would no longer allow us to      guarantee the safety of our Special Agents while they were      working in Mexico. The atmosphere in Mexico is volatile and      threats against DEA Special Agents, along the border, have      increased substantially; therefore I have rescinded travel      authority for all DEA Special Agents to Mexico, to      participate in counter-drug investigations, until they are      provided appropriate protection, that is commensurate with      the risks inherent in these dangerous assignments.                         prospects for progress       Since coming to office, President Zedillo has promised that      he would take action against organized criminal groups in      Mexico. In that time period he has moved to make significant      changes to the law enforcement process by sponsoring the      Organized Crime Bill to provide the tools needed to      successfully attack the criminal synidates and formed the      Organized Crime Task Force and the Bilateral Task Forces.      However, even with the improved process, the infrastructure      of the mechanism, itself, is so decimated by corruption that      short term results are very doubtful.       The real test is in the mid- and long-term. Unless some      meaningful reforms are made in the law enforcement systems      responsible for targeting and apprehending major organized      crime figures in Mexico, that nation, and unfortunately our      own, will continue to fight an uphill battle as drugs will      continue to flow into cities and towns across the United      States. To date, our inability to successfully attack the      major organized crime groups in Mexico, as we have the United      States and Colombia, is a direct result of our inability to      arrest the leadership of these groups.       President Zedillo has acted against corrupt officials, and      has stated that he is committed to professionalizing Mexican      law enforcement. Yet the bottom line remains; until the major      organized crime figures operating in Mexico are aggressively      targeted, investigated, arrested, sentenced appropriately and      jailed, both Mexico and the United States are in grave      danger.       What law enforcement steps are necessary for long-lasting      progress against organized crime leaders in Mexico? We faced      the same questions in our mutual struggle against the      Colombian organized groups during the past decade. What it      took was an all-out effort by the Colombian National      Police to target and incarcerate the top leaders in Cali.      Until the Government of Colombia was put on notice that      their lack of commitment to this goal was unacceptable,      the CNP did not have the moral backing it needed to move      out aggressively. In Mexico's case, it appears that the      political will to rid the country of the its narco-     trafficking reputation is there; however, what is lacking      are clean, committed law enforcement agencies willing to      take on the most powerful and influential organized crime      figures operating on a global scale.       We hope that efforts towards this end will bear fruit. In      November, 1996, the Government of Mexico passed an Organized      Crime Law which provides Law Enforcement officials with many      of the tools needed to successfully attack the sophisticated      drug syndicates in their country. Included as part of the Law      were: authorization to conduct electronic surveillance, a      witness protection program; plea bargaining; conspiracy laws;      undercover operations; the use of informants by police.       For these new law enforcement tools to be utilized      effectively, the new law mandated the Government of Mexico to      form Organized Crime Units to conduct the investigations and      further stipulated that the laws could not be enforced until      the unit was formed and properly trained. The Organized Crime      Units are now in place and consist of 60 officers to      investigate crimes specified under the law. The Government of      Mexico has agreed to insure the integrity of the Organized      Crime Unit through the use of polygraphs and regular      background investigations. However, like the Bilateral Task      Forces, these units will not be successful and DEA might not      be able to share sensitive information with them as long as      their supervisors or managers are corrupt.       It is important to remember that law enforcement in the      United States did not have wiretap authority and wide ranging      organized crime laws such as RICO and Continuing Criminal      Enterprise until the late 1960's. The Government of Mexico is      effectively 35 years behind us in establishing laws that were      critical in our successful dismantling of organized criminal      syndicates. If they work properly, the Bilateral task forces      and our Southwest Border Initiative can be favorably compared      to the Strike Forces established by Bobby Kennedy in the      1960's. This 1990's version of the Strike Force is      international in scope and pools the resources, expertise and      laws of several federal and state institutions in the United      States with those in Mexico.       It is absolutely essential that the Organized Crime Units      and the Bilateral Task Forces have integrity insurance      programs as part of their charter. Unless these units are      trustworthy, informants who cooperate will not be safe,      undercover investigations will be compromised and      intelligence sharing process will not function at all. As we      have seen recently, both the military and law enforcement      have been grievously compromised by these criminal groups and      this brings into question the ability of any program in      Mexico to remain corruption free. However, last week we saw      in the arrest of General Gutierrez-Rebollo, that some      trustworthy units do exist and can work without compromise.       The problems of establishing a corruption-free law      enforcement infrastructure are not insurmountable. However,      to become credible in the law enforcement arena the      Government of Mexico must ensure the integrity of the units      that have the responsibility of tracking down and arresting      the syndicate leaders, insuring these individuals are either      prosecuted in Mexico and receive meaningful sentence      commensurate with their crimes or agree to extradite them to      the United States where they will receive punishment similar      to that of Juan Garcia-Abrego.                               Exhibit 2                                  U.S. Government Printing Office,                                 Office of the Public Printer,                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 1997.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We return herewith your manuscript      entitled ``Re: Remarks by Thomas A. Constantine'' submitted      to this Office for insertion in the Congressional Record, and      respectfully invite your attention to the following      regulation of the Joint Committee on Printing:       (1) No extraneous matter in excess of two printed Record      pages, whether printed in its entirety in one daily issue or      in two or more parts in one or more issues, shall be printed      in the Congressional Record unless the Member announces,      coincident with the request for leave to print or extend, the      estimate in writing from the Public Printer of the probable      cost of publishing the same.       (2) No extraneous matter shall be printed in the House      proceedings or the Senate proceedings, with the following      exceptions: (a) Excerpts from letters, telegrams, or articles      presented in connection with a speech delivered in the course      of debate; (b) Communications from State Legislatures, and      (c) Addresses or articles by the President and the Members of      his Cabinet, the Vice President, or a Member of Congress.

This manuscript is estimated to make approximately 5 pages      of the Congressional Record at a cost of $1,152.00. If you      still desire to have this matter published in the Record,      permission must again be requested of the Senate for its      inclusion and the probable cost should then be announced and      this estimate attached to the manuscript sent to the Official      Reporters.           Sincerely,     Charles C. Cook, Sr.       Superintendent, Congressional Printing Management Division.                                                                    ____                               Exhibit 3               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1997]           Alleged Kingpin of Sonora Cartel Untouched by Law                        (By John Ward Anderson)       Caborca, Mexico.--Miguel Angel Caro Quintero, identified by      U.S. officials as one of Mexico's drug smuggling kingpins,      arrived in a pickup truck at his modest horse and cattle      ranch here and described life in this small desert town 60      miles south of the U.S. border.       ``I go to the banks, offices, just like any Mexican,'' said      Caro Quintero, who has four indictments pending against him      in the United States on charges involving cocaine, marijuana,      money laundering and racketeering. ``Every day I pass by      roadblocks, police, soldiers, and there are no problems.''       ``I'm in the streets all the time. Howe can they not find      me?'' he asked at the end of a rare, hour-long interview.      ``Because they're not looking for me.''       Caro Quintero, 33, is identified by U.S. law enforcement      officials as the head of the Sonora cartel, which they      describe as one of Mexico's main drug mafias. Although      arrested here in 1992 on tax charges, he has never been      convicted of any crime, and Mexican authorities have never      charged him with any drug violation.       U.S. officials see Caro Quintero as a prime example of how      weak Mexican laws and an intricate web of corruption have      permitted some alleged drug kingpins to operate their      syndicates with impunity and live without fear of arrest,      conviction or extradition to the United States. At the same      time, high-ranking politicians, government officials, judges,      prosecutors, and military and police officers have enriched      themselves by protecting the syndicates, and they are rarely      prosecuted or investigated.       After Caro Quintero's 1992 tax arrest, for instance, the      United States and Mexico launched a joint prosecution effort.      ``But it was thwarted when Miguel used a combination of      threats and bribes to have the charges dismissed by a federal      judge in Hermosillo [capital of his home state, Sonora], and      he's operated freely since that time,'' said an official of      the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).       Similar allegations of high-level corruption are aired      almost daily here, depicting decay in Mexico's justice system      and some of its other institutions, including the military.       The recent revelations have prompted a more thorough debate      among U.S. officials over whether President Clinton should      certify by Saturday that Mexico is a reliable ally in the      international war on drugs.       ``I don't know if `collapse' is the correct term'' for      what's happening to the justice system, Attorney General      Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said in a recent interview. ``But it's      the gravest crisis Mexico has faced in the modern age.'' On      Tuesday, Madrazo announced a ``top-to-bottom'' reform of his      office to address the crisis--the latest in a number of such      reforms announced in recent years.       The New York Times reported Sunday that two state      governors--Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera of Sonora and Jorge      Carrillo Olea of Morelos--have aided Amado Carrillo Fuentes,      head of a Juarez-based smuggling cartel. Despite numerous      U.S. intelligence reports detailing their drug ties, the      Times reported, ``both [governors] seem to enjoy a tacit      immunity from concerted criminal investigation in Mexico and      the United States.''       A spokesman for Attorney General Madrazo said neither      governor is under investigation for ties to drug smuggling.       At the same time, some of Mexico's top alleged kingpins--     including Carrillo Fuentes, Caro Quintero and brothers Jesus      and Luis Amezcua, who are considered among the world's      biggest traffickers of methamphetamine--have no drug charges      pending in Mexico. Despite indictments against each of these      men in the United States, U.S. officials say they face little      threat of being apprehended and extradited for trial in the      United States because of tough restrictions against      extradition in Mexico's constitution.       Until last year, only two Mexican citizens had been sent to      the United States for trial under a 1978 extradition treaty      between the     two countries. But new laws permit Mexico's foreign minister      to find ``an exception'' permitting extradition. Last year,      four Mexican citizens were sent to the United States,      including two accused drug dealers.       Juan Garcia Abrego, the head of the Gulf cartel who was      recently sentenced to life in prison in a drug trial in      Houston, was not extradited but deported to the United States      because he held dual citizenship.       Mexican anti-drug officials said Carillo Fuentes has      weapons and conspiracy charges pending against him. If      arrested, they said, he would be held while drug trafficking      charges were filed and officials considered a pending U.S.      request for extradition.       Authorities thought they would nab Carillo Fuentes at his      sister's wedding in early January, when private planes      ferrying guests in and out of local airports led drug      investigators to believe that he would make an appearance at      the ceremony. But the Juarez cartel chief never showed up,      and officials say he may have been tipped off by Gen. Jesus      Gutierrez Rebollo, the anti-drug czar who was arrested last      week after officials charged he had been an informant for      Carrillo Fuentes for years. A federal judge indicted      Gutierrez yesterday on charges of aiding and protecting      cocaine shipments, the Associated Press reported.       While drug investigations here have been severely hampered      by corruption, U.S. and Mexican officials said, until      recently they were also crippled by a legal system that did      not permit the use of evidence gathered by wiretaps or paid      confidential informants. In November, however, Mexico's      Congress approved an organized crime bill that legalizes such      tactics and institutes a witness protection program.       ``We didn't have any legal way to introduce into evidence      taped conversations--wiretaps--or to protect witnesses who      enter into plea bargains in return for evidence that can be      used against kingpins,'' said Juan Rebolledo Jout, a top      Foreign Ministry official. Without such tools, he said,      ``these people are powerful, they are corrupt, and they are      difficult to catch.''       However, Mexican officials conceded, a critical problem      still remains. Because U.S. cases are often built with      confidential informants and wiretaps, it is unclear whether      Mexican judges will allow extraditions to move forward if      they are based on U.S. cases that used wiretaps and      confidential informants before they became legal in Mexico.       U.S. officials said they are beginning a major extradition      push for Caro Quintero because there are no charges against      him in Mexico. Mexican officials said he is under      investigation.       ``The problem is, we don't know why he doesn't have charges      against him,'' said the Foreign Ministry's Rebolledo. ``We      are reviewing how decisions are made and investigations are      being carried out.''       Caro Quintero denied being involved in any way in drug      trafficking. He said he and his family are the victims of a      vendetta by U.S. drug agents seeking revenge for the 1985      murder in Guadalajara of DEA agent Enrique Camarena.       Miguel's brother Rafael, co-founder of the infamous      Guadalajara drug cartel, was convicted in Camarena's slaying,      which U.S. officials frequently cite as the event that opened      their eyes to the growing power and menace of Mexico's drug      mafias.       With his brother's imprisonment, ``Miguel Caro Quintero now      runs the organization,'' DEA chief Thomas Constantine told      the Senate two years ago. It is one of ``the four major      [Mexican] drug trafficking organizations that work closely      with the Cali [Colombia] mafia'' to smuggle cocaine into the      United States, Constantine said.       Caro Quintero called the charges ``fabrications'' and held      up his relatively peaceful lifestyle as proof he is not      wanted by the law. He added that he does not believe his      brother killed Camarena.       Tall, with jet-black hair and a thick mustache, wearing      bluejean pants and jacket with a plain shirt and a white      cowboy hat, Caro Quintero looks like he stepped out of a      cigarette ad. He said his family--he has three brothers and      six sisters--grew up in the neighboring state of Sinaloa,      where his father, who died five years ago, owned a cattle      farm. He is married and has two sons, ages 7 and 12.       Caro Quintero said his family came to Sonora about 15 years      ago. He denied reports that his family owns hotels, movie      theaters and huge amounts of land in and around Caborca,      which is about 75 miles southwest of the border city of      Nogales, in a remote desert region known as a haven for      traffickers and clandestine airstrips.       A 1994 indictment in Arizona charged that Caro Quintero      negotiated with an undercover DEA agent to set up a series of      such clandestine landing strips to smuggle cocaine into the      United States.       Caro Quintero said he and his family own only a ranch where      they raise cattle and a farm where they grow honeydews and      watermelons for export to the United States. He said the      family's land holdings total about 25 acres.       ``If I had a cartel, I'd have a lot of money and my brother      wouldn't be there [in jail],'' he said.     Statement of President Ed Ladd, California Narcotics Officers                               Association       The Board of the California Narcotics Officers' Association      voted today to unanimously support Senator Dianne Feinstein      and Senator Paul Coverdell in their efforts to overturn the      President's decision to certify Mexico. The California      Narcotics Officers' Association Board, representing over      7,000 law enforcement agents and prosecutors, is the second      largest professional law enforcement association in the      nation. Today's vote to join with Senator Feinstein on the      decertification issue is based on our longstanding experience      with the widespread corruption and lack of cooperation shown      by the Mexican government.       It is no secret that drugs are a huge problem in      California. What may not be widely known is the alarming rate      in which narcotics spill over the California border from      Mexico. It is estimated that 50% to 70% of the cocaine, up to      80% of the marijuana and 20% to 30% of the heroin are      imported in the United States from Mexico. Without the      cooperation of the Mexican government in the war against      drugs, we cannot put up a fair fight. We strongly urge      Congress to overturn the President's decision to certify      Mexico.       The impact drugs have on our communities exemplifies the      need for the United States to demand full cooperation from      the Mexican government in their efforts to stem the flow of      drugs into our country. As law enforcement agents and      prosecutors, we have witnessed the effects drugs have on our      cities and communities first hand. Dangerous drugs are      becoming more prevalent on our streets. For example, the      supply of black tar heroin brought into California from      Mexico is growing at such an incredible rate that the price      per ounce has been cut in half in just two years--from $800      per ounce to $400 an ounce. By certifying Mexico again this      year, President Clinton is allowing the drug flow to continue      unchecked.       The corruption and violence created by the Mexican drug      cartels will not be lessened until a strong message is sent      that Mexico must improve their anti-drug efforts. The      President's decision to certify does not send this message.      We simply cannot stand by this decision and we strongly urge      Congress to overturn it.       The members of the California Narcotics Officers'      Association are happy to support Senators Feinstein and      Coverdell and other members of Congress and take whatever      steps are necessary to see that full cooperation occurs.
