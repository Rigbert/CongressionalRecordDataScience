By targeting the worst-of-the-worst and protecting the integrity of the Internet, we have been able to create a broad ranging coalition of support of the PROTECT IP Act. Along with law enforcement groups, more than 400 companies, associations, and unions have come together to support this targeted, bipartisan legislation to combat foreign rogue websites.  Protecting American intellectual property and the American jobs that depend on it is important. Last year we were able to reform our patent laws to unleash American innovators and help boost our economic recovery. Now we need to confront the threat to our economic recovery posed by Internet piracy.  As I have demonstrated throughout my service in the Senate and again during the last two years, I have remained flexible in terms of the legislative language in order to best meet our goals of stemming the criminality when protecting legitimate activities and guarding against doing anything to undercut innovation or fetter free discussion. I have urged those with concerns to come forward and to work with us. We adjusted the very definitions in the bill to narrow them as Senator Wyden had suggested. I announced two weeks ago that I took seriously the concerns about the domain name system provisions and would fix it as part of a manager's amendment when the bill was considered by the Senate.  I regret that the Senate will not be proceeding this week to debate the legislation, and any proposed amendments. I thank the Majority Leader for seeking to schedule that debate on this serious economic threat. I understand that when the Republican leader recently objected and Republican Senators who had cosponsored and long supported this effort jumped ship, he was faced with a difficult decision. My hope is that after a brief delay, we will, together, confront this problem. Everyone says they want to stop the Internet piracy. Everyone says that they recognize that stealing and counterfeiting are criminal and serious matters. This is the opportunity for those who want changes in the bill to come forward, join with us and work with us. This is the time to suggest improvements that will better achieve our goals. The PROTECT IP Act is a measure that has been years in the making, and which has been twice reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee to better enforce American intellectual property rights and protect American consumers. It has been awaiting Senate action since last May. Today the rogue foreign websites based in Russia that are stealing Americans' property are delighted to continue their operations and counterfeiting sweatshops in China are the beneficiaries of Senate delay. People need to understand that the PROTECT IP Act would only affect websites that have been judged by a federal court to have no significant use other than engaging in theft whether through stolen content or the selling of counterfeits. It is narrowly targeted at the worst-of-the-worst. Websites that have some infringing content on their sites but have uses other than profiting from infringement are not covered by the legislation. Websites like Wikipedia and YouTube that have obvious and significant uses are among those that would not be subject to the provisions of the bill. That Wikipedia and some other websites decided to ``go dark'' on January 18 was their choice, self imposed and was not caused by the legislation and could not be.  It was disappointing that sites linked to descriptions of this legislation that were misleading and one-sided. The Internet should be a place for discussion, for all to be heard and for different points of view to be expressed. That is how truth emerges and democracy is served. Last week, however, many were subjected to false and incendiary charges and sloganeering designed to inflame emotions. I am concerned that while critics of this legislation engage in hyperbole about what the bill plainly does not do, organized crime elements in Russia, in China, and elsewhere who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen American content are laughing at their good fortune that congressional action is being delayed.  Nothing in PROTECT IP can be used to cut off access to a blog. Nothing in PROTECT IP can be used to shut off access to sites like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or eBay. Nothing in PROTECT IP requires anyone to monitor their networks. Nothing in PROTECT IP criminalizes links to other websites. Nothing in PROTECT IP imposes liability on anyone. Nothing in PROTECT IP can be required without a court order, first, and without providing the full due process of our Federal court system to the defendants before a final judgment is rendered. I also note that the guarantees of due process provided in the PROTECT IP Act are those likewise provided every defendant in every Federal court proceeding in the United States, no less. The PROTECT IP Act requires notice to the defendant. If the plaintiff seeks an injunction, the court must apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, which is the standard for all courts in determining whether to issue an injunction, including whether to issue the injunction as a temporary restraining order for a limited period of time. When stealing of copyrights are involved, such court orders can be made if, upon a factual showing, a court finds that serious harm would otherwise occur and it is in the public interest to do so while the case is more fully considered.  The PROTECT IP Act is directed at the foreign websites that are the worst-of-the-worst thieves of American intellectual property and operate from outside the United States and the jurisdiction of our courts. These website operators prey on American consumers, steal from our creators and economy, but are currently beyond the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.  The Obama administrative officials were right in a recent post saying ``existing tools are not strong enough to root out the worst online pirates beyond our borders.'' They called on Congress ``to pass sound legislation this year that provides prosecutors and rights-holders new legal tools to combat online piracy originating beyond U.S. borders while staying true to the principles outlined. . . . We should never let criminals hide behind a hollow embrace of legitimate American values.'' That is what we are trying to do with the PROTECT IP Act.  What the PROTECT IP Act does is provide tools to prevent websites operated overseas that do nothing but traffic in infringing material or counterfeits from continuing to profit from piracy with impunity. The Internet needs to be free, but not a lawless marketplace for stolen commerce and not a haven for criminal activities.  In the flash of interest surrounding this bill last week, those who were forgotten were the millions of individual artists, the creators and the companies in Vermont and elsewhere who work hard every day only to find their works available online for free, without their consent. There are factory workers whose wages are cut or jobs are lost when low-quality counterfeit goods are sold in place of the real thing they worked so diligently to produce. There are men and women of our National Guard and military who put their lives on the line for all of us every day, and for whom a counterfeit part can literally be a matter of life and death. There are the seniors who are struggling to be able to afford medications and order from what appears to them to be a reputable site, only to find that a foreign website has sent them an untested counterfeit drug that will not control their blood pressure or diabetes or heart problem.  At the end of the day, this debate boils down to a simple question. Should Americans and American companies profit from what they produce and be able to provide American jobs, or do we want to continue to let thieves operating overseas steal that property and sell it to unsuspecting American consumers? I hope that in the coming days the Senate will focus on stopping that theft that is undercutting our economic recovery. I remain committed to confronting this problem. And I appreciate the efforts of Senator Kyl, Senator Alexander and others who want to continue to work in a thoughtful manner with all interested parties to find an effective solution to eliminate online theft by foreign rogue websites. I thank those Senators who called me in Vermont and back here this past week when I got back to Washington to offer their help--Senators on both sides of the aisle. It means a lot.  I know the senior Senator from Nebraska is waiting to speak about the judicial nominee from his State. I will say what I said to him privately because I know this is his last year in the Senate. I have always enjoyed working with him. He has worked hard. He has represented the people of his State well. He has been very honest in his dealings with me. He has been diligent with respect to judicial nominations for vacancies in Nebraska. He has tirelessly pressed to fill vacancies there to ensure cases before the Federal court are not needlessly delayed. He did that to protect everybody in Nebraska, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure the courts are open for them.  I am sorry the confirmation of Justice Gerrard, one he so strongly supported, has been so needlessly delayed for more than 3 months, but I say to the people of Nebraska they are very fortunate to have been represented by the senior Senator from Nebraska, my friend Ben Nelson, who has been there fighting for them. He fought for the people of Nebraska every day from the day he took the oath of office. This may be his last year here, but based on past performance I think it is safe to say he will fight for Nebraska right up until the moment that adjournment bell sounds.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a January 19 article from the Wall Street Journal and a January 22 article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 2012]                       Brake the Internet Pirates       Wikipedia and many other websites are shutting down today      to oppose a proposal in Congress on foreign Internet piracy,      and the White House is seconding the protest. The covert      lobbying war between Silicon Valley and most other companies      in the business of intellectual property is now in the open,      and this fight could define--or reinvent--copyright in the      digital era.       Everyone agrees, or at least claims to agree, that the      illegal sale of copyrighted and trademarked products has      become a world-wide, multibillion-dollar industry and a      legitimate and growing economic problem. This isn't college      kids swapping MP3s, as in the 1990s. Rather, rogue websites      set up shop overseas and sell U.S. consumers bootleg movies,      TV shows, software, video games, books and music, as well as      pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fashion, jewelry and more.       Often consumers think they're buying copies or streams from      legitimate retail enterprises, sometimes not. Either way, the      technical term for this is theft.       The tech industry says it wants to stop such crimes, but it      also calls any tangible effort to do so censorship that would      ``break the Internet.'' Wikipedia has never blacked itself      out before on any other political issue, nor have websites      like Mozilla or the social news aggregator Reddit. How's that      for irony: Companies supposedly devoted to the free flow of      information are gagging themselves, and the only practical      effect will be to enable fraudsters. They've taken no      comparable action against, say, Chinese repression.       Meanwhile, the White House let it be known over the weekend      in a blog post--how fitting--that it won't support      legislation that ``reduces freedom of expression'' or damages      ``the dynamic, innovative global Internet,'' as if this      describes the reality of Internet theft. President Obama has      finally found a regulation he doesn't like, which must mean      that the campaign contributions of Google and the Stanford      alumni club are paying dividends.       The House bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or      SOPA, and its Senate counterpart are far more modest than      this cyber tantrum suggests. By our reading they would create      new tools to target the worst-of-the-worst black markets. The      notion that a SOPA dragnet will catch a stray Facebook post      or Twitter link is false.       Under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998, U.S.      prosecutors and rights-holders can and do obtain warrants to      shut down rogue websites and confiscate their domain names      under asset-seizure laws. Such powers stop at the water's      edge, however. SOPA is meant to target the international      pirates that are currently beyond the reach of U.S. law.       The bill would allow the Attorney General to sue infringers      and requires the Justice Department to prove in court that a      foreign site is dedicated to the wholesale violation of      copyright under the same standards that apply to domestic      sites. In rare circumstances private plaintiffs can also sue      for remedies, not for damages, and their legal tools are far      more limited than the AG's.       If any such case succeeds after due process under federal      civil procedure, SOPA requires third parties to make it      harder to traffic in stolen online content. Search engines      would be required to screen out links, just as they remove      domestic piracy or child pornography sites from their      indexes. Credit card and other online financial service      companies couldn't complete transactions.       (Obligatory housekeeping: We at the Journal are in the      intellectual property business, and our parent company, News      Corp., supports the bills as do most other media content      companies.)       Moreover, SOPA is already in its 3.0 version to address the      major objections. Compromises have narrowed several vague and      overly broad provisions. The bill's drafters also removed a      feature requiring Internet service providers to filter the      domain name system for thieves--which would have meant      basically removing them from the Internet's phone book to      deny consumer access. But the anti-SOPA activists don't care      about these crucial details.       The e-vangelists seem to believe that anybody is entitled      to access to any content at any time at no cost--open source.      Their real ideological objection is to the concept of      copyright itself, and they oppose any legal regime that      values original creative work. The offline analogue is Occupy      Wall Street.       Information and content may want to be free, or not, but      that's for their owners to decide, not Movie2k.to or      LibraryPirate.me or MusicMP3.ru. The Founders recognized the      economic benefits of intellectual property, which is why the      Constitution tells Congress to ``promote the Progress of      Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Times to      Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective      Writings and Discoveries'' (Article I, Section 8).       The Internet has been a tremendous engine for commercial      and democratic exchange, but that makes it all the more      important to police the abusers who hijack its architecture.      SOPA merely adapts the current avenues of legal recourse for      infringement and counterfeiting to new realities. Without      rights that protect the creativity and innovation that bring      fresh ideas and products to market, there will be far fewer      ideas and products to steal.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 2012]         Megaupload Shows Online Copyright Protection Is Needed                          (By Editorial Board)       By most measures, the Web site Megaupload was a 21st-     century success story, with 50 million daily visitors and      $175 million in profits. According to the Obama      administration, it was also an ``international organized      crime enterprise.''       In an indictment last week, the Justice Department accused      the company and several of its principals of conspiracy,      racketeering and vast violations of copyright law. The loss      to copyright owners of movies, television programs,      entertainment software and other content: some $500 million.      The government calls this the largest criminal copyright case      in the nation's history.       Megaupload maintained servers in the United States and      relied on U.S.-registered domain names, allowing U.S.      prosecutors to tap domestic laws to shutter the business. But      what if the Web site had been run using only foreign-based      servers and foreign-registered domain names? U.S. law      enforcers would have had a difficult if not impossible time      stopping the alleged wrongdoing.       That reality, of course, is what gave rise to the Protect      IP Act (PIPA) and its House counterpart, the Stop Online      Piracy Act (SOPA), which proposed to give the Justice      Department and copyright owners the legal reach and muscle to      thwart overseas theft of American intellectual property. SOPA      was fatally flawed, with vague provisions that could have      made legitimate Web sites vulnerable to sanctions. PIPA was      more measured, allowing action against a site only if a      federal judge concluded it was ``dedicated to'' profiting      from the unauthorized peddling of others' work.       Still, Internet giants such as Google railed against the      bills, arguing they sanctioned government censorship and      threatened the viability and security of the Internet. The      protests culminated last week in a remarkable, largely      unprecedented protest during which sites such as Wikipedia      temporarily went dark. Millions of individuals--many of them      armed with distorted descriptions of the bills--phoned, e-     mailed and used social networks to demand that they be      quashed.       Whether it was democracy in action or spinelessness by      cowed lawmakers, the campaign worked. House and Senate      leaders said they would pull back the bills for further      consideration. While a temporary breather may be helpful,      lawmakers should not abandon the quest to curb the      multibillion-dollar problem that is overseas online piracy.       Some opponents will fight any regulation of the Internet.      This should not be acceptable. A free and viable Internet is      essential to nurturing and sustaining the kinds of      revolutionary innovations that have touched every aspect of      modern life. But freedom and lawlessness are not synonymous.      The Constitution does not protect the right to steal, and      that is true whether it is in a bricks-and-mortar store or      online.
