USAID has done, I think, a remarkable job in focusing on unmet needs, not just in the area of family planning, but child survival, microcredit lending and a whole host of other very important interventions that help poor people.  It's all about prioritization. I showed you earlier one country after another that has had a doubling and a tripling of their money and commodities and contraceptives since the Mexico City policy was reinstated in 2001. It's all about prioritization.  Let me also say, because Ghana was mentioned earlier today, just because Planned Parenthood of Ghana is so obsessed with abortion promotion that it won't sign the policy, other NGOs and other providers have stepped into the breach and provide family planning and abortions to the people of Ghana.
