President, our patent system is grounded in the Constitution. Among the specifically enumerated powers of Congress in Article I, Section 8, stands the command to ``promote the progress of science and the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries.'' Those discoveries have, since the founding of our Nation, made us the envy of the world. Our inventors, our research institutions, and the many companies that commercialize those discoveries have brought a wealth of new products and processes to our society; we have all been the beneficiaries of that creativity and hard work.  Vermont has long played an important role in bringing such inventions to the public, combining `Yankee ingenuity' with lots of sweat equity. In fact, the very first U.S. patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, a farmer in Pittsford, VT, who discovered a process for making potash. That ethic continues to the present day; just last year, inventors in IBM's Essex Junction plant received 360 patents 10 percent of IBM's total U.S. patents.  Vermont is special, of course, but not unique in this regard. American inventors are in every community, every company and school. They are individuals tinkering on the weekends in their garages. They are teams of PhDs in our largest corporations. They are scientists training students in laboratories at our colleges and universities. Our patent laws should support and reward all American innovators--independent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists, academic researchers, and large corporations. To do so, we must update our patent laws. Crafted for an earlier time, when smokestacks rather than microchips were the emblems of industry, those laws have served well but need some refinements.  Senator Hatch and I introduced an earlier version of this bill, S. 3818, last August. At that time, I said we had taken the first step down a road to real, constructive patent reform, which could reduce the unnecessary burdens of litigation in the patent system and enhance the quality of patents granted by the Patent and Trademark Office. Senator Hatch wisely noted that we would have to have continuing conversations about issues that remained unresolved. We have spent the time since then hearing from all manner of interested parties, and indeed we have learned as much since we introduced S. 3818 as we had in the two years prior to its introduction.  In this Congress, the partnership is not only bipartisan but bicameral. We have reached not only across the aisle but across the Hill to work out a bill that joins the Senate and the House, Democrats and Republicans, so that today we are introducing a Leahy-Hatch bill in the Senate that mirrors a Berman-Smith bill in the House. The message is both strong and clear: We have a unified and resolute approach to improving the nation's patent system. We will all have time to focus on the bill's many provisions in the weeks to come, but I would highlight three significant changes we have made since last summer, aided by the many stakeholders in this process.  First, the Patent Reform Act of 2007 now includes a pure ``first-to-file'' system, which will inject needed clarity and certainty into the system. The United States stands alone among nations that grant patents in giving priority for a patent to the first inventor, as opposed to the first to file a patent application for a claimed invention. The result is a lack of international consistency, and a complex and costly system in the United States to determine inventors' rights. At the same time, our legislation provides important protections for inventors at universities, by permitting them to discuss publicly their work without losing priority for their inventions.  Second, poor patent quality has been identified as a key element of the law that needs attention. After a patent is issued, a party seeking to challenge the validity and enforceability of the patent has two avenues under current law: by reexamination proceeding at the USPTO or by litigation in federal district court. The former is used sparingly and some see it as ineffective; the latter, district court litigation, can be unwieldy and expensive. S. 3818 had created a new, post-grant review to provide an effective and efficient system for considering challenges to the validity of patents. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 has improved that system, and in particular, we have addressed concerns about misuse of the procedure. Post-grant review will include protections to avoid the possibility of misuse of the post-grant process. The Director is instructed to prescribe rules to prevent harassment or abuse, successive petitions are prohibited, and petitioners are barred from raising the same arguments in court.  Third, we are keenly aware that a sound patent system needs fair and equitable remedies. As products have become more complex, often involving hundreds or even thousands of patented aspects, litigation has not reliably produced damages awards in infringement cases that correspond to the value of the infringed patent. Our bill last summer was our first effort to ensure that damages awards accurately reflected the harm caused by infringement. Subsequent conversations with many affected parties have led us to language that, we believe, better serves that purpose and avoids potential pitfalls.  The Patent Reform Act of 2007 is also significant for what is not included. S. 3818 would have made three considerable changes to the patent laws that, upon further consideration and after listening to the affected parties, we have decided not to make in this year's legislation. First is the requirement that patent applicants not intentionally misrepresent a material fact or fail to disclose material information to the PTO. Candor and truthfulness are the backbone of the patent application system, and are protected by the inequitable conduct doctrine. S. 3818 would have weakened that doctrine, but it is preserved this year. Second, we maintain the traditional rule on attorneys' fees, instead of shifting fees and other expenses to the non-prevailing party as was proposed in S. 3818. Finally, we do not inject Congress into the ongoing litigation over the extra-territorial provision, section 271(f). S. 3818 would have repealed the provision in its entirety; the Patent Reform Act of 2007 does not, while the interpretation of the provision is currently pending before the Supreme Court. If the Court does not resolve that issue, we will revisit it in the legislative process.  If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's economy, ifwe are to continue to lead the globe in innovation and production, if we are to continue to enjoy the fruits of the most creative citizens, then we must have a patent system that produces high quality patents, that limits counterproductive litigation over those patents, and that makes the entire system more streamlined and efficient. This bill is an important step towards that goal. I look forward to immediate and intense debate that will inform both the Members of Congress and the public about these improvements, that will allow us to further refine our legislation, and that will lead us to consideration on the Senate floor.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1145       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
