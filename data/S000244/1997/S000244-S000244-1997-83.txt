Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's interest in this issue and commend her for offering this amendment.  Although the language in H.R. 1271 in no way restricts the FAA's ability to award research grants to historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic serving institutions, we will accept her amendment to clarify that point that the FAA has the authority to make such grants, and I support the amendment.
