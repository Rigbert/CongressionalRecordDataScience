 President, I would simply offer a consent agreement that the majority leader objected to when he pulled the Shaheen bill a while back. It was pretty simple and pretty easily understood. This is the consent that was offered when the majority leader, as I said, pulled the Shaheen-Portman bill a while back. This is what I said:       I propose a different unanimous consent agreement. I ask      unanimous consent that the only amendments in order be five      amendments from the Republican side related to energy policy      with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. I      further ask that following the disposition of those      amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate      proceed to vote on the passage of the bill, as amended, if      amended.  Now, that gives the majority leader what he was asking for on the last bill: 60-vote thresholds. It gives him amendments from our side related to energy policy, and it would have led to a vote on Keystone.  So I would propound that unanimous consent requestagain. It sounds to me as though we may be getting somewhere if the majority leader really wants to give us a chance to have a Keystone vote here on the Senate floor.
