Chairman, as we close down general debate, I want to state my sincere thanks to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) for his openness in working through this bill. He has been responsive to all of our Members. We have had some testy moments at the subcommittee and full committee levels, but we have managed to keep walking forward; and I congratulate the gentleman on this first bill that he has brought to the full House.  Mr. Chairman, regarding the issue of Karnal bunt and the wheat supply in Texas, a couple of years ago post-NAFTA, we had a situation in Arizona and in Texas, and I believe even in parts of California, where it was suspected that this fungus had moved into our wheat supply. This is a really serious issue. It essentially can make our wheat product unexportable. Already we are having trouble in our wheat markets as China now exports to us more wheat than PNTR ever anticipated. Now we have this real contamination inside our country.  We need USDA's attention to this issue. I am going to enter into the Record a Sunday, June 24 article from the Associated Press on this question. It explains one of the reasons we fought so hard in this budget and in this bill for additional help for the inspector general, additional help for theAnimal, Plant Health Inspection Service so we could have timely inspections and also avoid of these problems in the first place.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is not perfect. Let us hope as we move toward the Senate it can be made even better. But we ask for the membership's support. In closing down this general debate period, I would hope that we can move through the amendments in a very expeditious manner so Members can catch airplanes late tonight in order to get home.               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2001]                  USDA Wheat Disease Reaction Faulted    growers say the spread of karnal bunt fungus could be crippling                          (By Roxana Hegeman)       Anthony, Kan.--Bureaucratic bungling by the U.S. Department      of Agriculture has allowed the spread of a plant disease that      could prove as devastating to wheat exports as foot-and-mouth      disease has been to European livestock, farm groups said.       Wheat growers in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas say the USDA      responded too slowly to an outbreak of Karnal bunt at the      southernmost edge of the nation's wheat belt just as harvest      season was getting underway.       Karnal bunt is a fungus that is harmless to people but      sours the taste and smell of flour made from infected      kernels. It also slightly cuts production in infected fields.      The disease's main impact is economic: 80 countries ban      imports of wheat grown in infected regions.       That could be as crippling for American growers, who last      year produced nearly $6 billion of wheat, as would be the      discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. livestock, said      Brett Myers, executive vice president of the Kansas Wheat      Growers Association.       Europe's foot-and-mouth outbreak has cost millions of      dollars for the slaughter of some 3 million animals and a ban      on exports.       The suspected Karnal bunt contamination was first reported      to the USDA on May 25, and Michael Bryant, co-owner of the      elevator in Olney, Tex., that found it.       But it was seven days before the USDA's Animal and Plant      Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the finding, and      15 days passed before it quarantined the first affected      counties.       ``Their reaction to the situation was not as timely as we      would have liked,'' said Kansas Agriculture Secretary Jamie      Clover Adams.       Charles P. Schwalbe, deputy director of APHIS's plant      protection and quarantine program, said his agency sent the      sample away for testing at a national lab instead of using a      local one to make sure it had accurate and legally defensible      information before taking action.       ``The decisions that emerge . . . mean livelihood to people      from time to time,'' Schwalbe said.       The Karnal bunt found in Throckmorton and Young counties in      Texas were the first confirmed cases in the nation's wheat      belt, an area extending from central Texas to Alberta,      Canada.       On June 19, concern grew as the USDA added neighboring      Archer County to the quarantined area, followed by Baylor      County the next day. One elevator has also been quarantined      in Fort Worth, about 150 miles southeast.       Karnal bunt, which originated in India, was first detected      in the United States in 1996 in Arizona and California. It      has since spread to southern Texas and New Mexico.       In Arizona the amount of land used to grow wheat dropped      almost 50 percent after a quarantine was imposed in 1996 in      four counties, according to the Arizona Agricultural      Statistics Service.       But Arizona is a minor durum wheat producer, and U.S. wheat      growers have reassured overseas buyers that the disease was      far from the nation's major winter wheat producing region.      Winter wheat, which is planted in the fall and harvested in      the spring, accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. wheat and      is used primarily for bread. Durum wheat is used for pasta.       With half the winter wheat going to the export market, the      discovery of the disease at the southernmost edge of the      nation's breadbasket just as the wheat harvest was moving      north sent shock waves through the wheat belt.       State regulators feared that custom harvesters--cutters who      follow the ripening wheat harvest from Texas to the Canadian      border--would spread the fungus.       Oklahoma, just 50 miles from the two Texas counties where      the disease was first discovered, immediately closed its      borders and ordered combines coming into the state to be      blocked and inspected. Harvesters from infected areas without      a USDA certification of cleanliness were turned back.       ``We need to preserve our heritage and our wheat industry.      The spread of Karnal bunt in Texas should be considered a      threat to Kansas wheat,'' said Kansas Gov. Bill Graves (R).      Kansas is the nation's biggest wheat producer, with a $1      billion crop and nearly 10 million planted acres.       Rep. Frank D. Lucas (R-Okla.) has been pursuing the issue      after a request from growers for a congressional      investigation into the USDA's handling. His office said he      has not decided whether to ask for an inquiry.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
