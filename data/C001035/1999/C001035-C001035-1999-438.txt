President, today, Senator Coverdell and I are introducing two bills that will help teachers who spend their personal funds in order to improve their teaching skills and to provide quality learning materials for their students. I am going to discuss the first of those bills, the Teachers' Professional Development Act.  I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, in presenting this response to the critical need of our elementary and secondary schoolteachers for more professional development.  Other than involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most important element of student success. Educational researchers have repeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between well-qualified teachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional development is to maintaining and expanding their level of competence. When I meet with Maine teachers, they tell me of their need for more professional development and the scarcity of financial support for this worthwhile pursuit.  In Maine, we have seen the results of a strong, sustained professional development program on student achievement in science and math. With support from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Education, the State of Maine, private foundations, the business community, and colleges in our State, the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance established a statewide training program for teachers. The results have been outstanding.  While American students, overall, performed at the bottom of the Third International Science and Mathematics Study, Maine students outperformed the students of all but one of the 41 participating nations. The professional development available to Maine's science and math teachers undoubtedly played a critical role in this tremendous success story. Unfortunately, however, this level of support for professional development is the exception and not the rule.  The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional development activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English teacher who serves as a member of my Educational Policy Advisory Committee told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then came back to her high school and shared the results of this curriculum conference with all the other teachers in her English department. She is typical of the many teachers throughout the United States who generously reach within their own pockets to pay for their own professional development to make them even better, even more effective at their jobs.  I firmly believe that we should encourage our educators to seek professional training, and that is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today. The Collins-Coverdell legislation would help teachers to finance professional development by allowing them to deduct from their taxable income such expenses as conference fees, tuitions, books, supplies, and transportation associated with qualifying programs. Under the current law, teachers may only deduct these expenses if they exceed 2 percent of their income. My bill would eliminate this 2 percent floor and allow all of the professional development expenses to be deductible.  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the additional education they need to improve their skills and to serve their students better. I hope that this legislation will encourage teachers to continue to take courses in the subject areas that they teach, to complete graduate degrees in either their subject area or in education, and to attend conferences to get new ideas for presenting course work in a challenging manner. This bill would reimburse our teachers for a very small part of what they invest in our children's future. This would be money well spent.  Investing in education is the surest way for us to build one of our most important assets for our country's future, and that is a well-educated population. We need to ensure that our nation's elementary and secondary school teachers are the best possible so that they can bring out the best in our students. Adopting this legislation would help us to accomplish this goal.  I urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in assuring enactment of this legislation.  Thank you, Mr. President.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Hatch, and Mr.         Mack):  S. 1125. A bill to restrict the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to review mergers and to impose conditions on licenses and other authorizations assigned or transferred in the course of mergers or other transactions subject to review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.              telecommunications merger review act of 1999  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce The Telecommunications Merger Review Act of 1999, which will make the government's review of telecommunications industry mergers more coherent and effective.  It seems like hardly a week goes by without the announcement of yet another precedent-setting merger in the telecommunications industry. Consumers are right to be concerned about the possible effects of these mergers, and the Congress is right to be concerned that government review of these mergers is careful and consistent in keeping consumer interests uppermost.  The urgent need for competence and clarity in reviewing telecom industry mergers highlights a glaring problem in the current system. That problem, Mr. President, arises from the fact that different agencies sequentially go over the same issues, and, after considerable delay, can make radically different decisions on the same sets of facts.  Two of these agencies, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, have extensive expertise in analyzing the competition-related issues that are involved in mergers, and they approach the merger review process with a great deal of professionalism and efficiency. The third agency, the Federal Communications Commission, has comparatively little expertise in these issues, and only limited authority under the law.  Nevertheless, the FCC has bootstrapped itself into the unintended role of official federal dealbreaker. How? By using its authority to impose conditions on the FCC licenses that are being transferred as part and parcel of the overall merger deal. Because the FCC must pre-approve all license transfers, its ability to pass on the underlying licenses gives it a chokehold on the parties to the merger. And it uses that chokehold to prolong the process and extract concessions from the merging parties that oftentimeshave very little, if anything, to do with the merger itself.  Mr. President, many people might ask, what's so bad about that? Won't the FCC's conditions make sure that consumer interests are served? The short answer is, the FCC is simply duplicating the review and that the Department of Justice performs with much more competence and efficiency. About the best you can say is that the FCC is wasting valuable resources that could more productively be spent elsewhere. But the real harm lies in the fact that the FCC is foisting needless burdens and restrictions on the merging companies that translate into higher costs for consumers.  The FCC tries to defend its efforts by arguing that its job is really different from DOJ's--that DOJ makes sure that a merger won't harm competition, while the FCC makes sure that the same merger will help competition. In other words, according to the FCC, DOJ looks at a merger's effect on business; the FCC looks at its effect on people. For example, last week FCC Chairman Kennard gave a speech in which he proclaimed that, despite the strain these merger reviews were imposing on the agency, ``We will not rest until on each transaction we can articulate to the American public what are the benefits of this merger to average American consumers, because I believe that's what the public-interest review requires.''  If that's true, I have good news for Chairman Kennard--he can take a rest, because DOJ is doing exactly the same thing. In a separate speech last week Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, DOJ's chief merger review official, said that what most people do not understand (including, evidently, the FCC), is that ``everything we do in antitrust . . . is consumer driven.'' He then went on to say precisely what that means:       We are a unique federal agency. Our interest is to protect      what the economists call consumer welfare. And there is one      simple truth that animates everything we do, and that is      competition--the more people chasing after the consumer, to      serve him or her better, to get lower prices, to get new      innovations, to create new opportunities--the more of that      juice that goes through the system, the better.  To be accurate, there is one big difference between the way the FCC and the DOJ do merger reviews: DOJ is infinitely better at it. Two weeks ago the FCC's already-faltering merger review process hit rock-bottom when a staff member (an ostensible antitrust expert) heading up the FCC's review of the SBC-Ameritech merger (which DOJ has already approved) publicly proclaimed that, unless the FCC imposed major conditions, the proposed transaction ``flunks the public interest test.'' An ``unnamed agency spokeswoman'' then cheerfully agreed that a majority of the Commissioners shared the same view.  Can you imagine either the FTC or DOJ countenancing such happenings during the course of their merger review processes? I think not. This appallingly unprofessional behavior by the FCC staff drove the value of SBC and Ameritech stock down over $2 billion, and it confirmed that, if this is what passes for FCC merger review ``expertise,'' the FCC has no business being in it.  Mr. President, this bill will restore integrity and professionalism to federal review of telecommunications industry mergers. It does not touch either DOJ's or FTC's broad authority to review all mergers, including all telecommunications industry mergers. It would make sure that any FCC concerns are heard by incorporating the FCC into DOJ and FTC merger review proceedings. Nor does it touch the FCC's broad authority to adopt and enforce rules to govern the behavior of telecommunications companies. What it does do is tell the FCC that, in cases where either DOJ or FTC has reviewed a proposed telecommunications merger and stated in writing no intent to intervene, the FCC must follow the determination of these expert agencies and transfer any FCC licenses without further delay.  Under this bill the FCC may independently review proposed mergers when neither DOJ nor FTC states in writing its intent not to intervene. Nevertheless, because DOJ and FTC review all mergers and have authority to intervene in any merger, their nonintervention is any proposed merger appropriately signifies that they find the transaction at issue is unobjectionable. Therefore, any FCC review in such cases is subject to a strict 60-day deadline, and the FCC is directed to presume approval without attaching further conditions or obligations on any of the parties. Nothing (except extreme unlikelihood) would preclude the FCC from rebutting the presumption with hard facts, nor would the FCC be precluded from subsequently exercising its existing enforcement and rulemaking prerogatives to deal with any unanticipated problems.  Mr. President, we can streamline the way the federal government reviews telecom industry mergers and still safeguard the public interest. That's what this bill is intended to do by eliminating bureaucratic mismanagement while preserving essential federal review and enforcement prerogatives. I urge my colleagues to give it careful consideration and support.  This bill, the Telecom Merger Review Act of 1999, would do nothing to change the authority that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission currently have to review all telecom industry mergers.  Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1125       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Merger      Review Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) A stated intent of the Congress in enacting the      Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to reduce regulation.       (2) Under existing law, the Department of Justice and the      Federal Trade Commission exercise primary authority to review      all mergers, including telecommunications industry mergers.      The Federal Communications Commission has only limited      authority under the Clayton Act to review telecommunications      industry mergers.       (3) The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade      Commission have extensive expertise in analyzing issues of      industry concentration and its effects on competition. The      Federal Communications Commission has only limited expertise      in analyzing such issues.       (4) Notwithstanding the limitations on its Clayton Act      jurisdiction and on its substantive expertise, the Federal      Communications Commission exercises broad authority over      telecommunications industry mergers pursuant to the      nonspecific public interest standard and other provisions in      the Communications Act of 1934 that allow it to impose terms      and conditions on the assignment and transfer of licenses and      other authorizations.       (5) The Federal Communications Commission's exercise of      broad authority over telecommunications industry mergers      overreaches its intended statutory authority and its      substantive expertise and produces delay and inconsistency in      its decisions.       (6) Under existing law, parties to a proposed      telecommunications industry merger are unable to proceed      without the prior approval of the Federal Communications      Commission, even if the Department of Justice or the Federal      Trade Commission have already approved the merger.       (7) The Federal Communications Commission's existing      rulemaking and enforcement prerogatives constitute normal and      effective means of assuring that all licensees, including      parties to a telecommunications industry merger, operate in      the public interest.       (8) The primary jurisdiction and preeminent expertise of      the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on      all matters involving industry concentration and its effects      on competition, combined with the Federal Communications      Commission's existing rulemaking and enforcement      prerogatives, make the exercise of separate      telecommunications industry merger approval authority by the      Federal Communications Commission unnecessary.       (9) Because the duplication of effort, inconsistency, and      delay resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's      review of telecommunications industry mergers is unnecessary,      it imposes unwarranted costs on the industry, on the      Commission, and on the public, and it fails to serve the      public interest.

(b) Public Convenience and Necessity.--Section 214(c) of      the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 214(c)) is amended      by inserting after ``require.'' the following: ``The      authority of the Commission to impose terms or conditions on      the transfer or assignment of any such certificate assigned      or transferred in a merger or other transaction subject to      review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade      Commission is subject to section 314.''.
