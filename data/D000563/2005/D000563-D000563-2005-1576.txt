If I understand what has just happened in the House of Representatives, or is about to happen, it is that they decided the changes in the ethics rules which were promulgated to protect perhaps one Member or two Members from close scrutiny, in terms of their conduct, are now going to be changed. I think, if I am not mistaken, this will be the second time in the last few months--in recent times, that the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives has changed the ethics rules and then, after public response, came back and restored the ethics rules.  Is this not similar to a situation we are facing on the Senate side, where there are at least some who are talking about the nuclear option, a term that Senator Lott came up with, that would change the rules of the Senate in the middle of our session, rules that have been in place for almost 200 years?
