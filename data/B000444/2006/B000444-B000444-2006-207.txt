 President, two of the greatest challenges we face today are how to address the needs of post-conflict countries, and countries that are suffering from large-scale natural disasters. These are critical issues, and ones that we cannot afford to getwrong--for the sake of the people living in those nations, and for the sake of our own security.  On the post-conflict front, a 2004 commission organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Association of the U.S. Army found, to no one's surprise, that ``failed states matter--for national security as well as for humanitarian reasons. If left to their own devices, such states can become sanctuaries for terrorist networks, organized crime and drug traffickers, as well as posing grave humanitarian challenges and threats to regional stability.''  The most obvious case in point is the reconstruction of Iraq. I've spent many hours on this floor, for three years, making clear that we have to get it right in Iraq. And in addition to Iraq, unfortunately, we can talk about many other states that are either unstable, or are tenuously recovering from past conflicts including Liberia, Afghanistan, East Timor, Kosovo, Haiti, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Earthquakes, floods, drought and landslides often have the most dire impacts in developing countries that are the least equipped to respond. The countries ravaged by the 2004 tsunami are on a path to recovery, but there is still a long way to go: Indonesia lost over 150,000 people, with half a million left homeless. In India, almost 20,000 people lost their lives and 2.79 million people were affected, losing homes, land, and livestock. The tsunami set back the Maldives twenty years in development, eviscerating the country's economic backbone and tourism industry.  Recent years also saw devastating natural disasters in other parts of the world. Earthquakes in Iran affected more than 30,000 people. Catastrophic floods in Bangladesh left thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Recurring droughts in Afghanistan left over 130,000 people--some 92 percent of the population--in need of food or aid.  We need comprehensive--and creative--strategies to address the need to rebuild in countries on the rebound from conflicts or natural disasters. One such strategy is to tap into the store of human as well as financial resources here in the United States. We should allow, and indeed encourage, immigrants to use their skills, talents, and knowledge to help rebuild their native lands. In fact, the diaspora presents one of the best collective resources that exists: these individuals know the communities. They know the culture. They know the language--more than any contractors and more than any humanitarian workers from the outside, no matter how well trained or how much expertise they may have.  So today, I am introducing legislation that would create a ``Return of Talent'' visa program.  The idea is simple: a Return of Talent program would allow legal immigrants in the United States to return home to help with reconstruction efforts. ``Legal Permanent Residents'' will be able to return temporarily to their countries after a conflict or a significant natural disaster to help rebuild, without their time out of the United States affecting their ability to meet the requirements for U.S. citizenship.  Under current law, a Legal Permanent Resident who wants to apply for U.S. citizenship is required to be physically present in the United States for at least half of the five years immediately preceding the date of filing the naturalization application.  This residency requirement could be particularly difficult to meet for those who may have family and friends in their country of origin who are in desperate need of help. We should not stand in their way of returning, allowing them to bring their talent and expertise home, helping them help others at a time of greatest need.  Press articles have highlighted stories of such individuals--engineers, bankers, teachers and translators--who are willing to contribute to reconstruction efforts. They simply cannot do so without jeopardizing their immigration status.  This legislation would encourage those skilled and committed individuals to return to their countries of origin to revive the business, industry, agriculture, education, health and other sectors that have been weakened or destroyed after years of conflict or devastating disasters.  The Return of Talent program would include any individual who demonstrates an ability and willingness to make a material contribution to the post-conflict or natural disaster reconstruction in their country of origin.  The program would apply to immigrants from countries where U.S. armed forces have engaged in armed conflict or peacekeeping, or countries where the United Nations Security Council has authorized peacekeeping operations in the past ten years. Immigrants from countries which received funding from the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance also would be eligible to participate in the program.  Estimates of individuals who could participate in this program are relatively low. For example, the United States admitted 2,137 Afghani and 3,494 Iraqi immigrants in 2004 who are now Legal Permanent Residents eligible to pursue U.S. citizenship. Immigrants from Indonesia numbered 2,418 and Bangladesh, 8,061 in the same year. Yet, while the program would have a small impact on the U.S. naturalization process, the contributions of even a few hundred individuals could have a tremendous positive effect on reconstruction work.  In simple terms, a Return of Talent program makes sense. Everybody wins: The United States is able to support badly needed rebuilding efforts without increasing foreign aid; immigrants are able to use their skills and resources to help communities without jeopardizing their immigration status; and the people recovering from conflict and disaster receive much-needed assistance.  A Return of Talent program is an important piece of our overall strategy to stabilize and rebuild countries torn by conflict and devastated by natural disaster. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2413       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
