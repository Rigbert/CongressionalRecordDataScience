. 3293, the Labor/HHS spending bill for Fiscal Year 2009.  Requesting Member: Congressman Fred Upton  Benton Harbor Workforce Transformation Program  Department: Labor  Account: Employment and Training Administration--Training and Employment Services  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Michigan Works--Benton Harbor, Ml  Address of Requesting Entity: Michigan Works, 499 W. Main St., Benton Harbor, MI 49022  Description of Request: Michigan Works, a state-supported job recruitment and training organization, is starting a job-training program designed to work in tandem with the upcoming $500 million Harbor Shores mixed-use economic development project being undertaken by Benton Harbor. The basic workforce transformation program, which would be funded by the monies requested here, includes at least three core elements: basic skills training, including workforce literacy remediation; skills training for in-demand, high-growth occupations; and transitional job services. All activities will be based on proven programs administered by workforce training professionals as part of the region's existing and ongoing workforce development activities. All programs will be designed to reduce the unemployment rate, increase the local labor participation rate, increase job readiness, place people into jobs, and increase per capita income. These funds are consistent with the mission of the Employment and Training Administration. Benton Harbor, Michigan is the poorest city in one of the most economically challenged states in America. The magnitude of Benton Harbor's problems is stunning--a workforce with an average 6th grade literacy level and an 80 percent high school dropout rate by young males. In Benton Harbor 42 percent of the available workers are out of the workforce, a fact exacerbated by the lack of basic skills needed to maintain employment which has only served as a barrier to attract new employers into the area  Amount: $381,000  Financial Breakdown: The majority of this funding (around 70 percent) will go to staffing services, stipends for program participants, as well as literacy remediation services. The remainder of the funding will be provided for training scholarships, community outreach, participant assessments and support services. Michigan Works will provide supplemental funds.  Kalamazoo Community Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services Nursing Distance Learning Initiative  Department: Health  Account: Health Resources and Services Administration--Health Facilities and Services  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Kalamazoo Community Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services  Address of Requesting Entity: 3299 Gull Rd., Kalamazoo, MI 49048  Description of Request: The Kalamazoo Community Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services agency will partner with Wayne State University's School of Nursing, the only nursing school in Michigan offering an Advanced Psychiatric and Community Public Health Nurse Practitioner degree program, to bring the opportunity through the use of distance learning technology for nurses in Kalamazoo and surrounding communities to participate in this three-year program right in their home communities, rather than have to travel all the way across the State to Detroit. The plan would provide scholarships to local nurses who wish to participate in exchange for a commitment to remain in and serve their Southwest Michigan communities. Southwest Michigan is a medically underserved area, with a shortage of nurses, and a particularly acute shortage of nurses with advanced training to meet community mental health needs. The Kalamazoo Community Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Nursing Distance Learning proposal promises to be an innovative and successful way to address this pressing need.  Amount: $100,000  Financial Breakdown: The majority of funding for this project (around 60%) will go to nursing faculty, with supplemental funding going to polycom and video conferencing equipment, as well as scholarships for nursing students.  Kalamazoo Valley Community College Wind Technician Academy  Department: Education  Account: Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Kalamazoo Valley Community College  Address of Requesting Entity: 6767 West 0 Avenue, Kalamazoo, MI 49003  KVCC Wind Energy Center will launch a Wind Turbine Technician Academy in the fall of 2009. The competency based program will provide graduates with multi craft credentials which are highly sought after by the wind power industry for the construction, operationand maintenance of utility size wind turbines. The training uses established curriculum based on globally recognized BZEE utility grade turbine technician standards. The KVCC program will be the first BZEE certification program in the US, and will include training on a decommissioned utility grade turbine in a lab at KVCC. The Wind Turbine Technician Academy can be completed in less than 6 months, making the program viable for retraining of workers and for the training of the next generation workforce. The Wind Turbine Technician Academy will consist of three integrated segments: Pre-Employment Electrical Apprenticeship, Wind Turbine Technology Education, and Field Experience. Michigan ranks 14th in terms of wind energy potential, but is currently well behind other states in terms of installed wind generating capacity. The Academy will promote Michigan's potential through their ability to produce highly qualified workers in 6 months and through their plan to create an advisory panel made up of national wind energy employers.  Amount: $350,000  Financial Breakdown: Approximately 75% of this funding will go toward the purchase of wind turbine components, tools and training equipment. The remaining 25% will be split between purchasing lab equipment and curriculum development. KVCC has been, and will continue to provide, supplemental funding for the program.  Lake Michigan College Energy Job Training Program  Department: Education  Account: Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Lake Michigan College  Address of Requesting Entity: 2755 E. Napier Avenue, Benton Harbor, MI 49022  This funding will go toward equipment purchases and curriculum development for an energy production job training program at Lake Michigan College. According to Nuclear Energy Institute research, the nuclear power production industry and their community college partners need to establish forty-four new programs for training non-licensed operators, twelve for radiation protection technicians, and sixty-five to train maintenance workers. To address the projected shortage of energy industry professionals for the region it serves, Lake Michigan College, in collaboration with D.C. Cook Nuclear Plant in Bridgman and Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert, has developed the Energy Production Technology degree to give local residents the opportunity to prepare for one of these high-skill, high-wage jobs. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, about thirty percent of the nuclear energy workforce will retire within the next five years. Locally, that percentage is as high as 35%. Consumers Energy, over the next five years, expects 120-130 retirements among generating plant operations and maintenance personnel. That translates into over four hundred anticipated job openings in this region in just the next few years. This project will help train a local workforce to fill those openings.  Amount: $150,000                          ____________________
