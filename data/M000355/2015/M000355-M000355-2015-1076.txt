 President, that we are even discussing another of ObamaCare's self-inflicted brushes with the brink--yet again--is the latest indictment of a law that has been a rolling disaster for the American people, a rolling disaster for the American people.  Today's ruling will not change ObamaCare's multitude of broken promises, including the one that resulted in millions--literally millions--of Americans losing the coverage they had and wanted to keep. Today's ruling will not change ObamaCare's spectacular flops--spectacular flops--from humiliating Web site debacles to the total collapse of exchanges in States run by the law's loudest cheerleaders. Today's ruling will not change the skyrocketing costs in premiums, deductibles, and copays that have hit the middle class so hard over the last few years.  The politicians who forced ObamaCare on the American people now have a choice: They can crow about ObamaCare's latest wobble toward the edge or work with us to address the ongoing negative impact of a 2,000-page law that continues to make life literally miserable--miserable--for so many of the same people it purported to help.
