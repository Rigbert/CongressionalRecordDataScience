President, I rise to offer some remarks on a timely and important topic--our national celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month.  Hundreds of years after the decline of the Spanish Empire, a new Hispanic presence is making itself felt on the world stage. Democracy is taking deep root throughout much of Latin America. Mexico just celebrated the selection of a new President in an election that is widely viewed as the freest and fairest election in that country's history. Central America is largely at peace. Free trade has spread south of our border, and will continue to spread further south.  And Hispanic Americans are taking their rightful place in this country as an important part of our thriving economy, as a wonderful contributor to the diversity of American culture, and as a powerful political force that deserves attention.  It is fitting, then--as National Hispanic Heritage Month is upon us--to recognize the Hispanic-American population for its many important contributions to the traditions and history of this nation. Started 32 years ago, this festive month acknowledges the great history of the Hispanic people, celebrate their past achievements, and recognizes that the Hispanic-American community is an essential component in the future of the United States.  Hispanics have immigrated to the United States for many different personal reasons. They have taken the journey to America in hope of a better life for themselves and their families. They have persevered throughout their struggle to maintain their own identity while learning to assimilate into American ways.  Today, the Hispanic population in the United States has expanded and become more diverse. It is now our fastest growing ethnic group, its population increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the population. The Hispanic population is projected to account for 44 percent of the growth in the nation's population between 1995 and 2025. Hispanics are literally changing the face of this nation.  The label ``Hispanic-American'' encompasses an enormous diversity of individuals. Hispanics are not a single ethnic group but are comprised of people from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, and the countries of Central and South America. This diversity has brought a tradition of resilience and excellence to the United States, a country that derives its strength from the diversity of its people.  There is an emerging awareness of the contributions and achievements Hispanics have made. Hispanic individuals are prominent in every aspect of American life. In the business world, such names as Adolfo Marzol, executive vice-president of Fannie Mae and George Munoz, CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, are being recognized. Oscar Hijuelos, the first American-born Hispanic to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, is known as one of literature's award-winning authors. Maria Hinojosa, a CNN correspondent, was named one of the most influential Hispanic Americans by Hispanic Business magazine, and has received many awards for her reporting. These are just some of the extraordinary individuals who contribute to Hispanic-American culture in our country.  A few of the names of Hispanic-Americans from my home state of Illinois will resonate in history, like Luis Alvarez, the Nobel Price-winning physicist, who studied at the University of Chicago before going on to become a central figure in the Manhattan project during World War II. Others are heroes on a quieter scale, like Raymond Orozco who, until his retirement a few years back, headed the Chicago Fire Department with distinction, or Sandra Cisneros whose beautiful stories of women's courage in the midst of poverty have won her international acclaim. But most of all we benefit as a state and as a nation from the thousands of ordinary folks whose lives and dreams and everyday actions make this a richer, stronger, more interesting place to live.  The emergence of a sizable Hispanic-American population has been particularly notable in Illinois, to the great benefit of the state. More than a million Illinoisans are of Hispanic heritage. They own 20,000 businesses in the state and generate more than $2 billion in commerce. More than a quarter of a million Hispanic-Americans are registered to vote here, and the state can boast over 1,000 elected officials--from school board members to members of Congress--of Hispanic heritage.  While celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, we shouldn't blind ourselves to the problems that still beset the Hispanic-American community. The poverty rate among Hispanics is still unacceptably high, and Hispanic youth are graduating from high school at rates significantly lower than the general population. Thankfully, many of these problems have abated in the last decade--unemployment among Hispanics is at historically low levels, for example--but there's still plenty of work to be done.  That's why I support the ``2010 Alliance'' crafted by Hispanic-American leaders and key policymakers, and announced by President Clinton this June. The Alliance sets educational goals for Hispanic-Americans in five key areas, such as increasing the rate of high school completion and increasing English language proficiency for students. The President's budget for 2001 contains more than $800 million for programs to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic-Americans.  I am also hoping to see passage this session of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This important piece of legislation will insure that all immigrants from Latin America are treated equally in the eyes of the law. The current system that treats immigrants from one country differently from those from another country is cumbersome, confusing and inherently unfair. This Act will also restore some important rights that have historically been offered to the immigrant population, but that are now denied to them due to the highly restrictive policies adopted in the past few years. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act as the support of virtually every Democratic Senator as well as strong support from President Clinton and Vice President Gore. I am working hard to overcome Republican resistance to the bill so that it can become law.  The Hispanic population has become an integral part of the American mosaic. We have become united by the aspiration to make a better life for ourselves and our children. We know that America and what it stands for--freedom, prosperity, and hope--should extend to everyone the opportunity to achieve their dreams.  Through the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month we can deepen our understanding and appreciation for a culture that has been so influential in creating the America of today and that will help shape the America of tomorrow.                          ____________________
