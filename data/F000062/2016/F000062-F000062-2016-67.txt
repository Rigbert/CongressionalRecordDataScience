 President, I rise today to speak in support of the fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.  I wish to begin by thanking my friend and colleague, Senator Alexander. We have served together as chairman or ranking member of this subcommittee for the past 5 years. I know of no one in this body who is more intelligent or has a greater sense of fairness. I just want Senator Alexander to know what a great treat it has been to work with him for 5 years. I think we have a bill that will stand the test of time. Each of us has had different views on different parts of the bill, but that is part of what makes this a great country.  I say to Senator Alexander, I just want to thank you for being who you are and thank you for being the kind of U.S. Senator you are. Thank you very much.  As the chairman mentioned, this bill has reached the floor for the first time since 2009. It is also being considered as an appropriations bill on the floor with the quickest time since the budgeting process began in 1974. I just want to say thank you to our leadership on both sides for the desire to get us back to regular order and particularly on appropriations bills.  I wish to thank all of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for supporting this bill during last week's markup. As the chairman said, the vote was 30 to nothing, and that is a pretty good vote, so I thank my colleagues very much.  I believe this is a good bill. It is a fair bill. It does contain trade-offs and hard choices, and we have worked together to settle differences. Obviously, the chair is the chair and those views come No. 1, but in the case of this chair, he has been eminently fair and I am very grateful for that.  As he said, our allocation is $37.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase over fiscal year 2016, and given the top line budget constraints, this is a good allocation.  Let me first speak about the defense portion of the bill. Defense spending in this bill is $20 billion, a $450 million increase over fiscal year 2016. Our defense spending includes funding for cleaning up the environmental legacy of the cold war, maintaining our nuclear deterrent, supporting our nuclear Navy, and partnering with allies to keep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists.  Funding for our nuclear deterrent this year is $9.3 billion, $438 million above last year and equal to the President's budget request.  The science and engineering activities needed to maintain the nuclear stockpile without explosive testing are fully funded at $1.8 billion. The life extension programs for our nuclear warheads are also fully funded, including for the new cruise missile warhead, which I will speak to a little bit more in a moment.  I wish to take a moment now, though, to discuss my concerns with the long-range standoff weapon, or the LRSO. I believe the Defense Department is wrong when it argues that this isn't a new nuclear weapon. I think it is, and it carries with it powerful ramifications. The LRSO would carry an upgraded W80 warhead capable of immense destruction, and it would be fitted on to a new missile specifically designed to defeat the world's most advanced missile defense systems.  I firmly believe that the LRSO is unnecessary. The United States has already developed and fielded a conventional cruise missile specifically designed to do the same job as the LRSO. Furthermore, the United States has a variety of nuclear ballistic missiles that can reach any target anywhere in the world.  Why do I feel so strongly about this? It is very personal with me. I am one of the few who have seen this. I was 12 years old when the United States of America--my country--dropped nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the hundreds of thousands of bodies were seared with burns as the radiation spread, I have never quite gotten over what happened. I have reached the concept that nuclear weapons are really bad for this world. I will not go into it. When we see countries like North Korea practicing tests and other countries struggling to get a nuclear weapon and the high likelihood of terrorists also seeking out radioactive materials, I am very concerned about the probable use of this missile.  In a letter sent 2 years ago, Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall wrote the following: ``Beyond deterrence, an LRSO-armed bomber force provides the President with uniquely flexible options in an extreme crisis.''  This suggestion--that nuclear weapons should be a ``flexible'' option--is alarming. We should never lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons. In fact, I believe we can further reduce the role of nuclear weapons while still maintaining their deterrent effect by terminating the LRSO and instead relying on conventional nonnuclear weapons.  Obviously, this is a point of disagreement between the two of us. This is why I am very thankful to the chairman. He has agreed to include language in the committee report requiring Energy Secretary Moniz and the Nuclear Weapons Council to provide more information on this warhead, including its military justification and the extent to which conventional weapons systems can meet the same objectives. I think we should have that material.  I am also grateful to Senator Alexander for his commitment to hold a subcommittee hearing on the new nuclear cruise missile. I believe this issue hasn't received the attention it deserves, and it requires some public discussion. So I want to say thank you to him. I have yielded to his point of view and exchange. I actually am happy with the report language and the hearing. So I thank the chairman very much.  Going back to the nonproliferation account, it is funded at the President's requested level of $1.8 billion. But this is a $120 million decrease from last year, and I hope we can do better next year.  Work with Russia on securing material and facilities in that country has slowed, but other threats remain at home and abroad, and I believe we should be investing more.  Funding for the environmental cleanup of legacy cold war sites is the highest it has been in many years--and that is very good--at $5.4 billion, which is a $126 million increase above last year. This reflects the importance this subcommittee has placed on addressing environmental contamination at sites in Washington, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Tennessee. I thank the chairman for what he said about putting a pilot nuclear waste facility reference in our bill. Nuclear waste is piling up all over this country, with no good place for it to go. I can reference my State alone.  Southern California Edison, a huge utility serving over 16 million people, has had two big nuclear reactors, each one 1,100 megawatts. They are now in the process of decommissioning those reactors. This facility sits in the heart of an urban area, and there are now 3,300 hot plutonium rods in spent fuel pools at that facility site. We need a place for nuclear waste in this country because it is very dangerous to have it spread all over and to have decommissioned reactors with hot plutonium waste in spent fuel pools right on the coast of the Pacific Rim where we see earthquakes happening, not the least of which was in Ecuador and a recent quake in Japan.  Now let me turn to the nondefense half of the bill. Our nondefense allocation this year is $17.5 billion, and that is roughly a $100 million decrease from fiscal year 2016. One of the anomalies of this portfolio is the fact that as defense goes up, it crowds out the nondefense--important things like the Army Corps of Engineers, important things like the Office of Science. So our nondefense allocation is at $17.5 billion.  Despite this, the bill maintains funding levels for basic scientific research, energy technology development, and water infrastructure. Funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science sees a modest increase of $50 million to $5.4 billion this year.  The Office of Science is the largest single funder of physical science research in the United States--think of that--and supports research at 300 universities in all 50 States. Its experimental facilities host more than 24,000 researchers each year.  Funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is $2.1 billion, equal to fiscal year 2016, and that program funds activities to develop the technology that makes our homes, cars, and factories more efficient. It lowers the cost of renewable energy sources like solar and geothermal.  While I wish we could have funded the President's proposed mark for Mission Innovation climate change, I want my colleagues to know that we did the best we could, but we were simply unable to make it work with the allocation we received.  The chairman mentioned the Army Corps of Engineers. With the highway program and the Army Corps, this is really the Federal infrastructure program, and it is funded at $6 billion. This is a historic high. It maintains level funding for the Bureau of Reclamation at $1.275 billion. In particular, the bill provides an estimated $1.3 billion from the harbor maintenance trust fund. That is the highest level ever.  While users of our Nation's harbors and ports pay into the fund, the money does not get disbursed by itself, and it is up to us to appropriate the money out of the fund. This has been a challenge under current budget caps, and it has been a challenge to me because my State--California--pays approximately 40 percent of the fund's receipts each year but gets shortchanged by the disbursement formula. So I am very pleased that the chairman and the members have agreed to provide an additional $50 million for energy ports and donor ports like L.A.-Long Beach and Seattle-Tacoma that otherwise see little benefit from the harbor maintenance trust fund.  The bill, once again, includes $100 million for the Bureau of Reclamation's Western Drought Response program. Ten of the 17 reclamation States are currently suffering from severe to exceptional drought conditions that have devastated the agricultural industry, left some rural communities without any water for drinking or bathing, and killed tens of millions of trees that could lead to yet another catastrophic wildfire season in these 10 States. We in California had hoped that El Nino storms would refill California reservoirs, but the drought persists and will persist. It is estimated that we need a snowpack, just for point of interest, of 150 percent of the average by April 1 in order to end the drought, and the snowpack was only 87 percent of the historical average. Therefore, this $100 million is critical to operating water systems more flexibly and efficiently, restoring critical wetlands and habitat, and ensuring that the best science and observational techniques are being brought to bear.  The bill also makes critical investments in new water supply technologies to help mitigate the current drought and lessen the impacts of future droughts such as desalinization, water recycling, and groundwater recharge.  As Members begin to bring amendments to the floor, I very much urge my colleagues, particularly on thisside, to exercise restraint, particularly with policy amendments. The Senate has just completed a broad energy authorization bill, and I understand that the Environmental and Public Works Committee will soon be drafting a Water Resources Development Act. So I want my colleagues to know that the subcommittee has had to make some tough choices, but these decisions were made in a bipartisan way and have led us to draft a balanced bill, one that I believe and hope should satisfy Members on both sides of the aisle.  I thank the chairman and the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
