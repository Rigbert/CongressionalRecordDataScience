Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Let us try to explain the issue before us. Animas-La Plata. Sounds good. Satisfy Indian claims, Well, actually, it is a project that cannot be built without violating the environmental laws of our Nation, voiding the laws that require local cost for sharing for new Federal water projects.  It is a project that has been sold as an Indian water rights settlement, except that it will not deliver affordable or usable water to the Indian tribes in question. It is a project that will deliver a $5,000 an acre irrigation subsidy to non-Indian farmers in the high desert of southwestern Colorado so they can grow low-value crops. Two-thirds of the water will go to them if this project is ever completed, if we void the environmental laws, if we go ahead with a project that will produce 36 cents of benefits for every Federal dollar invested.  Thirty-six cents of benefits for every Federal dollar invested. How can that be in a time when we are striving to balance the Federal budget? We will hear a lot from the opposition. They think they have a strategy to get this through, 36 cents of benefits for every dollar that every American taxpayer will invest. And they are going to say that it is because it is satisfying Indian water claims. It is not.  What is before us today is called phase I stage A of the Animas-La Plata project. It barely passes muster under the Endangered Species Act. It fails the cost-benefit test. And it does not even come close to satisfying the Indian water rights.                              {time}  2000  That is phase one.  Now, if the proponents are successful in pushing through this nearly $500 million project, despite the environmental problems, despite the negative cost/benefit ratio, it still will not satisfy the Indian water claims because it does not deliver the water to those tribes.  There is some thought that maybe they can sell the water or they can do something else with it. Colorado law will not allow them to sell it out of State. The water is going to be extraordinarily expensive. It is not going to be delivered in time to satisfy the Indian water claims. In fact, they can back out. The Bureau of Reclamation says we can finish the project by 2003. The tribe has the right, after the year 2000, to back out of this agreement.  I believe when they see that they are going to be delivered water at an extraordinary price that they cannot sell to anybody, that they are going to opt out. They are going to pursue their claims in court and a future Congress is going to be where we are today, except they will have spent nearly $500 million, if they void the environmental laws of the land, if they waive all cost share and if they build a project that delivers 36 cents on the dollar, if we pony up all that money. And they will then have to come up with some other proposal to meet the Indian water claims.  There is a better way to do it. The Inspector General of the Interior Department says, cut $170 million out of this particular project and you can just direct it to the Indian claims and you could better meet their claims. Local citizens are looking at other non-dam alternatives.  The amendment before us would cut $10 million that is going to irrevocably commit us to this poorly thought out project. It is also about the ultimate $481 million to be spent by the taxpayers to bring a return of 36 cents on the dollar to Federal taxpayers. The proponents cannot say it is economically justified. It is not, by the numbers of the Bureau of Reclamation, who always try to cook the numbers in favor of these projects, they cannot say it is environmentally justified. We will have to waive a whole host of laws to complete the project. So they are staking their hopes on convincing us that this will satisfy the Indian water rights settlement. As I explained earlier, it will not.  It is quite simple, in my opinion, Mr. Chairman. This half a billion dollar boondoggle should be stopped now before we waste any more of Federal taxpayers' dollars on this project.
