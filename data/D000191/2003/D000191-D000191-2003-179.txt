Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill. Just following up on the remarks of the esteemed chairman, I am really pleased that he has strongly supported and we have included in the bill a mandate that on an annual basis we have a report of essentially the 10 ``most wanted,'' is the way I would phrase it.  Too many times we have seen in the past where the National Transportation Safety Board raises serious concerns in the aftermath of an aviation incident or accident; and oftentimes, because of various pressures or bureaucratic inertia, we find that those recommendations never again see the light of day.  Minimally, we would want to see a substantive response on each and every important recommendation that would track it and give us a meaningful document that shows why it was implemented, why it was not implemented, or where we are in the implementation process or what modifications the FAA has made to it in moving forward with the implementation.                              {time}  1230  So I think that is an excellent addition to the authority of the NTSB and will enhance their status as the world's number one transportation safety watchdog. And that, indeed, is what the NTSB is.  They are sought after in accidents overseas, have conducted some very,very difficult investigations and technically assisted in very, very difficult investigations and recovery efforts. So I am also pleased to see that there is a modest increase in the funding for the NTSB recommended here and for the NTSB Academy, which provides the world-class standard of training for accident investigators.  And then finally, there is a provision regarding families of passengers. The NTSB does not have really the extensive resources on an ongoing basis to provide assistance to the families and the bereaved of passengers in accidents; and this bill would move that on to other, more appropriate Federal agencies at the appropriate point in the investigation, something which today, unfortunately, often languishes so that neither the NTSB and their principal functions are served, nor are the bereaved family members of the passengers.  So also I think this bill is an improvement and a long-needed reauthorization of the NTSB.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
