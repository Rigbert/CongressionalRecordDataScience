 President, I rise today with the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss one of the greatest threats facing California growers and farmers across the nation--infestations of disease-carrying pests which can potentially destroy entire crops. Just this past year, California has been victimized by a number of pest infestations that have resulted in significant quarantine and eradication programs. California's $1 billion nursery industry is being threatened by red imported fire ants. The $2.8 billion grape industry faces complete destruction due to an infestation of the glassy winged sharpshooter which spreads Pierce's disease, and there is no known cure.
