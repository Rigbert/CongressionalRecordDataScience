S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I will be opposing this nominee, and I would like to explain why.  First and foremost is Ms. Halligan's record of advocacy for an activist view of the judiciary and a legal career that leads any reasonable person to conclude that she would bring that activism right on to the court. As I have said many times before, the proper roleof a judge is that of an impartial arbiter who gives everybody a fair shake under the law as it exists.
