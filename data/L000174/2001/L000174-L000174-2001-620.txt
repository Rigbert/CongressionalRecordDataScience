President, today I join with Senator Hatch and Senators Biden, DeWine, and Thurmond to introduce the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001. This bill provides a comprehensive approach to drug treatment, prevention, and enforcement. It is my hope that the innovative programs established by this legislation will assist all of our States in their efforts to address the drug problems that most affect our communities.  No community is immune from the ravages of drug abuse. My own State of Vermont has one of the lowest crime rates in the nation, yet we are experiencing serious troubles because of the abuse of heroin and other drugs. Recent estimates indicate that heroin use in Vermont has doubled in just the past three years, and the number of people seeking drug treatment has risen even more rapidly. The average age of a first-time heroin user dropped from 27 to 17 during the 1990s, signaling a sharp rise in teenage drug abuse. The consequences of this rise have made themselves all too clear over the past months.  On January 3, Christal Jones, a 16-year-old girl from Burlington, was murdered in New York City. According to news reports, she was recruited in Burlington to move to New York and become part of a prostitution ring, and she was motivated by a desire to get money to buy heroin. When she died, drugs were found in her body, although they were not the cause of her death. And Christal Jones' tragedy apparently is not unique as many as a dozen Vermont girls may have been involved in this New York ring. And since her death, others have come forward to say that teenage girls in Burlington are prostituting themselves to get money to buy heroin.  These disturbing reports followed by only a few months a heinous drug-related triple murder in Rutland, Vermont. In that case, 20-year-olds Robert Lee and Donald Fell reportedly spent the night drinking and taking crack cocaine, and then allegedly killed Fell's mother and her friend. Looking to get out of Vermont, they then allegedly carjacked a woman arriving for work at a local supermarket and drove to New York, where they are accused of beating her to death. Such a case surely deserves a strong law enforcement response, and last Thursday the accused were indicted by a federal grand jury for carjacking resulting in death and kidnapping, among other charges.  Such violence is rarely visited upon my State. When it is, a swift law enforcement response is necessary, and we must do what we can to support the efforts of law enforcement to safeguard our communities. But we kid ourselves if we think that law enforcement alone, with ever-increasing penalties, is the answer to the drug problem. Though effective enforcement of our drug laws, particularly to deter involvement of our young people, is a critical component, this is simply insufficient to meet the severe social effects of drug abuse. We need to provide a comprehensive approach to the drug problems of my State and our nation. In Vermont, as the Rutland Daily Herald recently editorialized, on January 26, 2001, ``agencies that treat addictions'' need ``a boost in resources and manpower.'' Those who work to prevent drug abuse from occurring in the first place need our strong support.  I have tried to boost Vermont's anti-drug efforts by working to provide funding for drug prevention, law enforcement, and drug treatment projects. For example, I secured funding for the Vermont Coalition of Teen Centers in last year's Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. These teen centers give adolescent Vermonters recreational alternatives to drug use. I was also able to help provide significant funding for the Vermont Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Task Force, facilitating the ability of law enforcement officials to work together to tackle Vermont's drug problems. In addition, at my request Congress approved substantial funding for Vermont to plan and establish a long-term residential treatment facility for adolescents.  I believe that the bill I introduce today with Senator Hatch will buildupon those important efforts by providing a substantial boost for treatment, law enforcement, and prevention, both in Vermont and across the nation. It contains numerous grant programs to aid States and local communities in their efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse. Of particular interest to the residents of my State, it establishes drug treatment grants for rural States and authorizes money for residential treatment centers for mothers addicted to heroin, methamphetamines, or other drugs.  This legislation also will help States and communities reduce drug use in prisons through testing and treatment, an effort I proposed in the Drug Free Prisons Act I introduced in the last Congress. It will provide funding for programs designed to reduce recidivism through funding drug treatment and other services for former prisoners after release. In addition, this bill will reauthorize drug courts another step I proposed in the Drug Free Prisons Act and create juvenile drug courts.  Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to review and amend penalties for a number of drug crimes involving children. For example, in addressing circumstances such as those surrounding the death of Christal Jones, the bill instructs the Sentencing Commission to amend its guidelines to provide for any necessary sentencing enhancement for criminals who distribute drugs to minors in order to lure a minor into or keep a minor engaged in prostitution or other criminal activity.  In short, there are programs in this legislation to benefit all Americans whose lives are disrupted by drug abuse in their families and communities. I strongly recommend this bipartisan bill to my colleagues, and hope that we can move quickly to make it law.  As I mentioned earlier, I have worked to provide necessary funding for treatment, prevention, and enforcement efforts in Vermont. Last year, I secured $150,000 for the Vermont Coalition of Teen Centers, $400,000 for the Vermont Drug Task Force, $100,000 for an adolescent treatment facility, two grants worth $500,000 for a balanced and restorative justice project, $1.7 million in Byrne law enforcement grants, two grants worth $560,000 to reduce underage drinking, about $725,000 for Drug Free Communities Support Programs throughout Vermont, and $274,535 for Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, RSAT, programs in the Vermont Corrections Department. In 1999, I worked to procure $270,611 for RSAT programs for Vermont prisons and jails, $75,000 for the Vermont Coalition of Teen Centers and an additional $74,976 for the Essex Teen Center, two grants worth $660,000 to combat underage drinking, and about $172,000 for Drug Free Community Support programs throughout Vermont. And in 1998, I helped secure $249,864 for balanced and restorative justice programs, $274,938 for RSAT programs, $1.9 million in Byrne law enforcement grants, $360,000 to combat drunk driving, and $424,494 in a Safe Kids/Safe Streets grant.  This legislation will provide additional ways that Vermont and other States can benefit from federal assistance to prevent drug abuse and drug-related crime. I would like to describe in more detail some of its most important aspects.  This bill authorizes a wide variety of treatment and prevention programs. Treatment and prevention efforts are often overshadowed by law enforcement needs. Indeed, a recent study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, CASA, showed that of every dollar States spent on substance abuse and addiction, only four cents went to prevention and treatment. The States and the Federal government have undeniably important law enforcement obligations, but we must do more to balance those obligations with farsighted efforts to prevent drug crimes from happening in the first place.  As I have said, heroin is an increasing problem in Vermont. In other States, methamphetamines or other drugs present a growing challenge. This legislation will help States address their most pressing drug problems, and places a particular emphasis on States that may not have been able to address their treatment and prevention needs in the past. Indeed, among many other provisions, the bill offers funding for rural States like Vermont to establish or enhance treatment centers. It instructs the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to make grants to public and nonprofit private entities that provide treatment and are approved by State experts. This will allow the Vermont agencies looking to provide heroin treatment or to prevent heroin abuse in the first place to acquire Federal funding to help in their efforts.  The Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act also authorizes funding for residential treatment centers that treat mothers who are addicted to heroin, methamphetamines, or other drugs. This will help mothers and the children who depend on them to rebuild their lives it will keep families together. And I hope it will help avoid further stories like one that appeared in last Sunday's edition of the Burlington Free Press, in which a young mother told a reporter how heroin ``made it easier for [her] to take care of [her] kids.''  The bill also calls for funding drug treatment programs for juveniles. As the tragic story of Christal Jones and the disturbing reports about other girls in her position have shown, juveniles can see their lives quickly deteriorate under the influence of drugs. This is why I have worked to provide Vermont with funding to establish a long-term residential treatment facility for adolescents. I hope to continue that effort through this bill, in the hope that we may be able to prevent future tragedies.  Our efforts here must include reducing the lure of drugs, and educating our kids and making sure they have recreational alternatives are two key components. In light of that, this bill authorizes grants to carry out school- and community-based prevention and education programs, with priority given to rural and urban areas experiencing drug problems. It provides additional funding for after-school programs. Finally, it authorizes funding for States to establish demonstration projects of alternative education for at-risk youths. These steps should improve the quality and availability of drug education and prevention efforts throughout the United States.  In addition to providing additional funds for treatment and prevention, the bill directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review existing criminal penalties and provide any necessary increases for drug crimes involving juveniles. In particular, the Sentencing Commission must review the current penalties for distributing drugs to minors, using minors to distribute drugs, trafficking near a school, and using Federal property to grow or manufacture controlled substances. I would like to highlight one provision in particular in my comments today.  This bill calls for the Sentencing Commission to amend its guidelines to provide for a specific sentencing enhancement for anyone who distributes drugs to minors in order to lure a minor into or keep a minor engaged in prostitution or other criminal activity. Let me explain why this provision matters. If the law enforcement officials investigating the death of Christal Jones find that the person or people who brought her to New York and prostituted her were giving or selling her heroin to entice her, the punishment should be more severe. This provision will give prosecutors an additional tool to fight such odious conduct.  I would also like to commend the approach taken in the criminal provisions in this legislation. Instead of imposing mandatory minimums, we have invested discretion in the Sentencing Commission to determine appropriate penalties. A 1997 study by the RAND Corporation of mandatory minimum drug sentences found that ``mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.'' Despite this study and mounting evidence of prison overcrowding, legislators continue to propose additional mandatory minimums. In light of the persistence of that idea, this legislation calls for a new study of the issue, including whether mandatory minimums have a disproportionate impact on any racial or ethnic groups and whether they are an appropriate vehicle to punish nonviolent offenders.  Last year I introduced the Drug Free Prisons Act, which authorized grants to States to facilitate treatment and testing programs in prisons and jails.This bill provides resources to achieve the same goal. It is critical that our prisons be drug-free, both because lawbreaking within our correctional system is a national embarrassment, and because prisoners who are released while still addicted to drugs are far more likely to commit future crimes than prisoners who are released sober. This bill will provide needed help to address drug abuse in prisons throughout the country. It authorizes $50 million for drug-free prisons and jails bonus grants, allows States to use Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, RSAT, grants to provide services for inmates or former inmates, and reauthorizes funding for substance abuse treatment in Federal prisons.  As Joseph Califano, Jr., the president of CASA and former secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, told the National Press Club last month: ``The next great opportunity to reduce crime is to provide treatment and training to drug and alcohol abusing prisoners who will return to a life of criminal activity unless they leave prison substance free and, upon release, enter treatment and continuing aftercare.'' This legislation will accomplish both of those goals.  A prior CASA study found that drug and alcohol abuse was implicated in the crimes and incarceration of 80 percent of those currently serving time in America's prisons. This finding shows that we have a prison population that has a history of substance abuse, and will seek out opportunities to continue using drugs while imprisoned. Of course, if prisoners are using drugs in prison, this will create serious behavioral and other problems that corrections officers will have to address, at no small risk to them.  The problem does not end there. The same CASA study shows that inmates who are illegal drug and/or alcohol abusers are the most likely to be repeat offenders. In fact, the study concluded that 61 percent of state prison inmates who have two prior convictions are regular drug users. The strong link between drug use and recidivism cannot be ignored. Prison should provide an opportunity for us to break this cycle and therefore reduce crime. We can do this through a concerted effort to test prisoners for drug use and penalize those who test positive and provide adequate drug treatment so that prisoners can lead productive, non-criminal lives upon their release.  This approach to reducing drug use and addiction in prisons has the support of Jim Walton, Vermont's Commissioner of Public Safety, and John Perry, the Director of Planning for the Vermont Department of Corrections, who work with these issues every day. I have always valued their counsel, as they have first-hand knowledge of the real law enforcement needs in my state. They both feel strongly that the bill will give law enforcement the tools it needs to test and treat offender populations, both in jail and in the community. I hope and expect that this bill will have the same effect across the country.  In addition to providing funding for drug treatment and testing in prisons, this legislation also adopts a proposal made by Senator Biden in both this Congress and the last that would provide funding for Federal and State programs designed to ease the transition of criminal offenders back into society after their release. It establishes court-based programs to monitor the return of offenders into communities. These programs include drug treatment and aftercare, mental and medical health treatment, vocational and educational training, life skills instructions, and assistance in obtaining suitable affordable housing. Each program uses court sanctions and incentives to promote positive behavior and graduated levels of supervision within the community corrections facility to promote community safety. I commend Senator Biden for his leadership on this program.  The bill also re-establishes the drug courts program and re-authorizes funding for it, as I proposed in last year's Drug Free Prisons Act. The majority repealed the authorization of the drug courts program in the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, in an apparent attempt to discredit Democratic programs. In my view, effective programs dealing with drug abuse should not be used as political footballs. That is why the Congress has continued to fund drug courts in every year's appropriations acts. This has been the right decision, and we should undo the repeal.  Drug courts provide the opportunity to deal systematically with nonviolent drug offenders at a substantial savings to taxpayers. Instead of jailing these nonviolent offenders, the courts can order alternative punishments that are mixed with mandatory testing and drug treatment and human services such as education or vocational training. Meanwhile, imprisonment is held out as a stick to ensure good behavior. To qualify for federal assistance, a drug court program must mandate periodic drug testing during any supervised release or probation periods, provide drug abuse treatment for each participant, and hold out the possibility of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration for noncompliance or failure to show satisfactory process. Violent offenders are defined quite broadly, so we can be confident that we are not funding programs that put dangerous people back on the streets.  In addition to reauthorizing drug courts for adults, this legislation authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to State and local governments to establish juvenile drug courts, extending the drug court model that has shown significant promise in dealing with adult offenders to juveniles. Juvenile drug courts should provide a way to reach out to younger offenders before they turn to a life of crime, helping to save both lives and significant government resources.  Finally, I would like to comment on the inclusion of charitable choice language in this legislation to allow religious groups to compete for grants on the same basis as other groups. Although the language in this bill mirrors language that was passed in the Children's Health Act last year as well as in previous legislation, I have serious reservations about it. I know that many of my colleagues share those reservations.  Charitable choice is going to be a significant issue during this Congress. I would have preferred that we have hearings about charitable choice before including it in this bill, and I made my feelings known to Senator Hatch. I asked him to introduce the bill without the language and consider adding it later if specific language could be crafted for which there was bipartisan support. But Senator Hatch was committed to including this language in the bill as introduced. Let me be clear: its inclusion here does not represent my endorsement. As this legislation is considered by the Committee and the Senate, we need to give considerable thought to the approach taken here. I intend to work with Senator Hatch and the other sponsors of the bill to ensure that the important protections and prohibitions of the First Amendment are fully respected. At the very least, we need to ensure that those who receive federal drug treatment and prevention funds are trained professionals, and that the government funds are not used in any way, directly or indirectly, to support or promote discrimination.  At the same time, I believe that this bill, taken as a whole, will do a great deal of good. While charitable choice language is in this bill today, I have made no commitment to having this charitable choice language in the bill when Congress passes it. My commitment is to help improve drug treatment, prevention, and education throughout the United States.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two newspaper articles.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Rutland Daily Herald (VT), Jan. 26, 2001]                            Now Is the Time       It is time for Vermont lawmakers to take the initiative in      pushing for a comprehensive anti-drug program that will      respond constructively to the increased use of dangerous      drugs in Vermont.       Major drug busts in the Rutland area, as well as a rise in      crimes related to drug addiction, have pointed to the heroin      problem in the region. City leaders have taken needed steps      to bolster efforts by city police to address the problem, and      Mayor John Cassarino has offered a tax proposal that would      provide necessary funding in the future.       Statewide, the use of heroin has probably doubled in the      past three years. The number of Vermonters seeking treatment      rose from 164 to 344 in that time. That number doesn't     take into account the users who don't seek treatment.       The Vermont State Police have made a compelling case for      boosting manpower, which has eroded substantially in the past      eight years. And Gov. Howard Dean has made the fight against      heroin one of his priorities.       But so far Dean has not come up with resources for a long-     term attack on the problem. The Legislature ought to use this      moment to take Dean's initiative further.       Dean is well known for his punitive attitude toward drugs      and for his lack of faith in the efficacy of treatment for      drug users. But aggressive treatment, combined with      aggressive law enforcement, has not been tried. And at this      late date in the war on drugs, we ought to realize that law      enforcement alone has not done the job.       Law enforcement agencies at the local and state levels can      use a boost in resources and manpower. But so can agencies      that treat addictions. Effective treatment is labor-intensive      and could be made available to people both inside and outside      of the state's corrections system.       Mental health workers know that drug addiction is not an      easy affliction to cure. Addicts sometimes want no part of      treatment. But the state could establish institutions that      would respond more effectively to people who need help. Drug      courts could establish a regimen of treatment that would      expose people in state custody to the kind of help they may      never have seen before.       Dean has promised to move quickly to set up clinics for      drug treatment, following passage last year of legislation      allowing for methadone treatment. But as Dean has often said,      methadone alone will not solve the problem. Methadone needs      to be part of a larger program of treatment.       As of last week, only two hospitals in Vermont had      expressed firm interest in establishing methadone clinics.      Rutland Regional Medical Center is waiting to determine what      resources will be available and what kind of program the      regulations will establish. Health care facilities such as      RRMC need to be given the support and the resources to do the      job.       Vermont is a small enough state that it could pioneer      methods for treating drug problems that go beyond the obvious      first step of locking people up. It would be in the state's      interest to do so both to prevent the kind of crime and      dereliction that is a drain on any community and to rescue      Vermonters who succumb to the deathly appeal of drugs.       A package that included both law enforcement and treatment      measures might draw bipartisan support. Vermonters are not      helpless before the scourge of drug addiction if they have      the will to act.                                  ____          [From the Burlington Free Press (VT), Feb. 7, 2001]                    Vt. Teen's Death Ruled Homicide                           (By Sam Hemingway)       Christal Jean Jones, the 16-year-old Burlington girl found      dead in a Bronx apartment Jan. 3, was the victim of a      homicide, according to New York City's top medical officer.       ``The cause of death was asphyxiation, and the manner of      death is homicide,'' Ellen Borakove; spokeswoman for the New      York City Medical Examiner's Office, confirmed Tuesday.       The medical examiner relied on police investigation and      toxicology tests to reach his conclusion. Borakove said Jones      was smothered.       Drugs were found in Jones' body, but Borakove declined to      say what the drug was or how it had been administered.       ``Whatever substance was found was not a contributing      factor in her death,'' Borakove said.       Jones' mother, Kathleen Wright, received the news during an      emotional 11:30 a.m. phone call Tuesday from Borakove's      office.       ``It's just what I expected,'' a weeping Wright said after      hanging up the phone. ``She was injected with drugs and then      she was killed.''       Local and federal authorities say Jones was part of a      prostitution ring operating out of an apartment in the Hunts      Point section of the Bronx last fall and this winter.      Authorities also say drugs, particularly heroin, were      involved.       As many as a dozen Vermont girls, many in the custody of      the state Social & Rehabilitation Services department at the      time, have been involved, say some of the teens who have      traveled to New York, their parents and authorities.       Gov. Howard Dean has ordered an investigation into SRS's      handling of the girls' cases.       Jose Rodriguez, a part-time Vermont resident with a      criminal record here, is being held on $100,000 bail in a New      York City prison because New York officials suspect he might      be involved in Jones' death. However, Rodriguez has been in      jail since Dec. 11, when he was arrested on two charges of      promoting prostitution and one charge of statutory rape      involving another Vermont teen-ager.       At prosecutors' request his initial bail of $10,000 was      increased to $100,000.       ``Our sympathy goes out the (Jones) family,'' Eric Sachs,      Rodriguez's court-appointed attorney, said Tuesday. ``We      don't wish that on anybody, especially a young girl.''       He said Rodriguez has cooperated fully with authorities and      knows nothing about Christal Jones' death.       ``He's in jail. Obviously, we know he didn't do it,'' Sachs      said.       When he was told Tuesday that the medical examiner had      ruled Jones' death a homicide, Sachs called the District      Attorney's Office.       He was assured, he said, ``there is no Christal Jones case,      and there is no accusation that my client is involved.''       ``Nobody has ever seen him'' in the Zerega Avenue apartment      in which Jones was killed, Sachs said. ``It's not his      apartment. He has no connection to this apartment. Where      these girls live, or don't--he doesn't know.''       However, in the police affidavit outlining the prostitution      and rape charges against Rodriguez, New York Police Office      Sean Iannucci said the victim said the crimes were committed      at the apartment where Jones' body was found.       If convicted, Sachs said, Rodriguez faces a maximum jail      term of four years for the rape charge and 15 years for each      of two prostitution charges.       Investigators who have interviewed witnesses and some of      those involved say Rodriguez was intimately linked to the      girls and a prostitution ring.       ``I will kill you if you try to leave; I know people in      Vermont and New York,'' Rodriguez was said to have told two      of the Vermont girls before his arrest. Police also said he      beat one of the girls after learning she had tried to call a      family member for help.       Since Jones' death, many of those involved have gone into      hiding. Some parents of the girls known to frequent New York      won't talk. When approached, they crack the door only to say      they don't know where their daughters are. Their fear is      palpable.       In the Old North End and the King Street area of      Burlington, Jones' death--and life-- are well known. Local      residents are painfully aware of the extent of heroin use and      the hold the drug has over their neighbors. They say there is      no easy resolution to the problem they have watched reach      epidemic propositions in the past five years.       ``We've got the demand,'' said Mike Larow, who owns Larow's      Market on North Street. ``Everyone seems to be afraid to      admit that it's here.''       A federal grand jury in Burlington is reviewing evidence in      the case.       Vermont state officials and local police knew of the      prostitution ring in the fall, according to a variety of      sources. Dean said state officials went to New York and      brought back two girls who had been at the apartment where      Jones eventually died.       ``The only comment is how sad it is that this child has      died and how unnecessary,'' SRS Commissioner William Young      said Tuesday. ``I think everyone from our local office and      throughout the organization takes this kind of news hard.       ``We certainly hope whoever is responsible for her death is      brought to justice.''       Young said the case pointed out how vulnerable young women      are, especially when they abuse drugs. Young said this was      the first case that anyone in his agency was aware of in      which there was an organized effort to take girls from      Vermont to another location to work as prostitutes.
