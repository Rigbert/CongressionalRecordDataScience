 President, I would like to briefly address an issue I talked about already on June 5. I want to clarify the record regarding an inaccurate Washington Post front-page story on Chief U.S. District Judge George P. Kazen of the southern district of Texas.  To refresh your memory, the Post reported on May 15 of this year that Judge Kazen had stated he was overworked, couldn't manage his caseload and needed more judges. The article then more than implied there was a backlog in his district and there was a crisis across the Nation which was created by the Judiciary Committee playing politics at the cost of justice.  I had hoped we were done talking about that example of inaccurate and misleading reporting, but judging by a remark made Monday here on the floor, I must reiterate what I already said on June 5: there is no backlog in the southern district of Texas, the article III judges of that district, and of most districts of the country, for that matter, assure me that they can handle their caseloads just fine.  I noticed my colleague Senator Leahy used this article Monday to once again complain about the pace of confirmations. Unfortunately, he has also become a victim of that misguided article.  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I felt compelled to come before my colleagues and set the record straight on the southern district of Texas. Therefore, on June 5, I gave you the applicable statistics for the district and I gave you the responses my 1996 survey produced for that district. As you might recall, in an effort to keep the lines of communication open between this Congress and the judicial branch, I sent a comprehensive survey to all article III judges last year. Some of the questions in the survey addressed precisely this issue of a backlog. I said on June 5 and I'll repeat it today, both my survey and my communications with our Federal judges clearly show that there is no backlog and that a vast majority of the judges in the southern district of Texas, one of the largest and busiest in the Nation, can more than aptly manage their caseload. By the way, the same holds true for the Nation in general.  When I spoke to you on June 5, I wondered how come Judge Kazen would turn to the Washington Post and create such a different impression from what my research, my figures, and, most importantly, my communications with our Federal judges indicated. Well, it turns out that Judge Kazen was as surprised by the article as I was. You see, I just received a letter from Judge Kazen on June 6 and it has now become clear that Judge Kazen is as much a victim of inaccurate reporting as everyone who ended up reading that article is. According to Judge Kazen, he only talked to the reporter regarding his district's contemplation to move the home seat of a judicial vacancy from Houston to either Laredo or McAllen.  Incidently, the vacancy Judge Kazen was talking about has been around since 1990. It therefore appears that my Democratic colleagues, who are so quick to cry ``politics'' when the Judiciary Committee dares to scrutinize a Clinton nominee, had ample opportunity to fill that seat and for one reason or another they chose not to do so.  Judge Kazen insists in his letter that while the article ultimately quoted him as speaking about judicial vacancies, the conversation he had with the reporter was solely on the proposed move of the future judge's home seat. Judge Kazen further states that the article's focus on filling vacancies was never the focus of his conversation with the Post reporter. If mentioned at all, it was nothing more than a passing reference. Judge Kazen, in his letter to me, is adamant that he never described ``any caseload as being unmanageable.''  Therefore, not Judge Kazen, but the Washington Post used this one example to complain of backlog and unmanageable caseloads. Mr. President, the vast majority of the judges who have responded to my survey, who have written me letters, who have called my offices, or who have come before the Judiciary Committee or my subcommittee are not backlogged and are quite able to manage their caseloads. Judge Kazen's letter to me underscores that fact, and I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              U.S. District Court,                                   Southern District of Texas,                                                     June 6, 1997.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the          Courts,     Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Your letter of May 30, 1997, prompts      me to seek clarification of what issues you believe that I      raised in the Washington Post article of May 15. That article      was the result of a telephone call in April from a Texas      reporter working for the Post. She inquired about a letter I      had written in February to the Democratic members of Congress      from southern Texas. The letter had apparently been released      to the media by one or more of the recipients, as it had      already been the subject of press reports in Texas.       The purpose of my letter was to advise the Representatives      that our Court was contemplating a request to the Judicial      Council of the Fifth Circuit that the home seat of the judge      who would eventually succeed former Chief Judge Norman Black      be moved from Houston to either Laredo or McAllen. The      possibility of such a move had been discussed off and on      during 1996, but no action had been taken. We knew that this      position would not be filled immediately, and we could have      deferred action until later. However, we learned in February      that the Representatives were meeting soon to recommend a      nominee to the White House. They were doing so under the      natural assumption that the person would sit in Houston. We      decided that basic fairness required us to at least alert the      Representatives to our plan.       The letter advised that the Court would ``probably''      request the move and that our final decision would be made at      a meeting of the full Court in May. The letter stated in      general terms why we were taking this step. This included the      fact that the four ``border'' divisions of our Court have      long borne the burden of one of the heaviest criminal dockets      in this country. We advised that scores of new Border Patrol      agents are scheduled for assignment to Laredo and the Rio      Grande Valley this year, along with projected increases of      other law enforcement agents. We concluded that many more      agents inevitably will lead to more arrests and more      prosecutions in our southern divisions. At least, this     should be the result if the agents do what they are hired to      do.       The letter also advised that, for the first time in over      twenty years, the chief judgeship of the Court had moved      outside Houston. Under our seniority system, it will remain      outside Houston for at least the next twenty years. The chief      judge has typically been required to take a reduced docket to      attend to the administration of this vast district, which      consists of seven divisions spread over some 44,000 square      miles.       The Post reporter had called to ask about the status of      this matter. I told her that our plan was still on course. I      never described any caseload as being ``unmanageable.'' In      response to her questions about the reason for our decision,      however, I did try to explain the special pressures caused by      an unrelenting criminal docket and why our judges felt the      move was appropriate.       I realize that the Post article ultimately focused on      filling vacancies, but that was not the focus of our      conversation. If that topic was mentioned at all, which I      cannot recall, it would have been a passing reference to the      fact that we have a very old vacancy which we hope can be      filled this year. The portions of the article actually      quoting me are addressed to the issue of why our Court is      seeking to move a judgeship away from Houston. It is our      belief that this move is an internal judicial issue, governed      by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 134(c). If I am mistaken in this regard, or      if your subcommittee has concerns about it, I will try to      assemble whatever data might be relevant, although this      proposal is based to some extent on our best estimate as to      the situation as we expect it to be whenever that new judge      would be confirmed.       It does not surprise me that some of my colleagues reported      to you that their dockets were manageable. It is precisely      for this reason that the Houston judges have supported me in      the effort described above. Their support is based on certain      assumptions. First, we are assuming that Senior Judge Norman      Black will be able and willing to carry at least a fifty      percent caseload in Houston for the next several years. From      June 1992 until December 1996, we had only one senior judge.      That was Judge Hugh Gibson, who was helping with Judge Sam      Kent's unusually large civil docket in Galveston. Judge      Gibson became seriously ill last year and is only now      beginning to attempt a comeback. Second, Judge John Rainey      has currently been working in three divisions--Houston,      Laredo and Victoria. Whenever the new judge arrives, Judge      Rainey would drop Laredo and take a larger portion of the      Houston docket. We think this is a positive step. Travelling      between two divisions is not efficient; travelling among      three divisions is grossly inefficient, especially when those      three divisions stretch over 300 miles. Third, we are hoping      that the Houston filings will not drastically increase during      the next several years. If any of these assumptions prove      untrue, we may well have to go back to the proverbial drawing      board.       I am attaching a newspaper report that a ``record-setting      number of U.S. Border Patrol recruits'' are currently      undergoing basic training, to be assigned along the Mexican      border. Forty-two of these persons are scheduled for the      Laredo Sector and 133 for the McAllen Sector. We understand      that increases in other law enforcement agencies, together      with United States Attorneys, are also planned.       In 1996, the criminal filings in the four ``border''      divisions (Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi) were      1239, compared with 1069 in 1995, a 16% increase. As of May      31, the 1997 criminal filings in these divisions are 206 in      Brownsville, 130 in Corpus Christi, 175 in Laredo, and 158 in      McAllen. These are the results of five months of grand jury      work. Projecting those figures over 12 months would yield      filings of 494, 312, 420 and 379 respectively. This would      make a total of 1605, a 29% increase over 1996. These      projections do not consider that, as far as I know, few if      any of the new law enforcement agents are actually in place      yet. Also, these statistics refer to cases, not defendants.      Many of these criminal cases, especially narcotics cases,      involve multiple defendants. For example, the 1239 cases      filed in the four divisions in 1996 involved 1884 defendants.      I am currently processing a single case with 22 defendants.      These projections also do not consider any civil filings.       The step our court is proposing is, in my opinion, sound      management and would increase organizational efficiency. I      would hope that you would applaud our effort to place our      resources where the demand is, since I believe that you have      previously encouraged the Judiciary to consider precisely      this type of move.       Despite the fact that I was not discussing the issue of      vacancies with the Post reporter, I do not wish to imply that      I am disinterested in that issue. Chief Justice Rehnquist and      many others more eloquent and prominent than I have spoken      often on the subject. In addition to the new vacancy created      by Judge Black, we have a vacancy that has existed since      1990. The nominee currently before the Senate is the third      person either nominated or recommended for this position,      going back to President Bush. The current candidate was first      nominated in late 1995, if I am not mistaken. She was      renominated earlier this year. This person is scheduled to      sit in Brownsville. As you can see, we are conservatively      projecting almost 500 criminal filings in that division this      year, apart from any civil filings. The new judge and the      incumbent, Filemon Vela, were also due to help Judge Ricardo      Hinojosa, who sits alone in McAllen. As far as I know, no one      has ever advised our Court that there was any doubt about the      need for this position. In fact, based on our statistics, the      Judicial Conference of the United States recently recommended      that still another judge be added to our Court. The 1996      Biennial Judgeship Survey supporting this request is      attached. I am also attaching our latest Magistrate Judge      Survey, dated December 1994, prepared by the Administrative      Office of the United States Courts, and the 1996 statistics      showing the significant amount of work done by our magistrate      judges.       Ours is a hard-working, very productive Court, which closed      almost 13,000 cases last year, in addition to almost 4500      petty criminal cases closed by our magistrate judges. We      realize that we will not get Judge Black's successor, much      less a new position, anytime soon. However, we believe it is      critical that at least our 1990 vacancy be filled in the      reasonably near future. Judge Vela will be taking senior      status within three years, and we must have a judge with some      judicial experience in Brownsville before the vacancy cycle      begins anew.       I hope this letter is helpful. I would be happy to discuss      this situation with you at your convenience.           Sincerely yours,     George P. Kazen.                          ____________________
