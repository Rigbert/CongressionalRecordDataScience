 I wish he would go back to the drawing board. And I will tell my friend, I will participate with you.  Nobody believes, I think, that sequester is going to ultimately rule the day in our appropriation bills because it is, as your chairman said, ill-conceived and unrealistic. I would think it better policy for us to decide that now, and then implement appropriation bills consistent with something that is reasonable and not ill-conceived.
