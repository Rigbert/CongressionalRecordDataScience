President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, that really is the point. In my years here, I have seen time and time again a resolution or amendment to condemn this or that country that violates human rights. They usually pass virtually unanimously. That is fine. We should stand up for human right wherever they occur. But we are now asking our own government for information about Americans whose human rights were violated, and we get pages and pages that are blacked out. That is unacceptable. We should at least be able to tell the families of Americans who disappeared or who were murdered or tortured as much as we can about these crimes.  Frankly, we cannot credibly condemn other countries for their misdeeds, and not be willing to find out what happened to our own citizens because possibly, conceivably, somebody in our Government may have broken the law. If they did we should know about it, and if the truth comes out we can hold people accountable and deter others from covering up crimes in the future. So I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut.  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are three amendments that have been cleared on both sides. I would like to take care of them before going on to Senator Hatch's comments, which are unrelated to the bill.  Amendment No. 3491 is on Export-Import Bank. Amendment No. 3366 is on landmines.             Amendments Nos. 3491, 3366, and 3535, En Bloc  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send three amendments to the desk, en bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.
