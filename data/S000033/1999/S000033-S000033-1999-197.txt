 Speaker, I insert for printing in the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                          Internet Censorship(On behalf of Amanda Cawthra, Angela Bellizzi, Renay Thompson, and Nick                                 Stahle)       Amanda Cawthra: The First Amendment clearly states that      people have the freedom of speech. However, we have to speak      to you about government infringement on this basic right,      guaranteed in the Constitution. The issue we are talking      about is Internet censorship, and whether the government has      the right to mandate what can be accessed through the Net.       Nick Stahle: Censorship on the Internet has become a major      issue, especially now in the late 1990s. Several bills have      been proposed to protect children from explicit material,      such as the Communications Decency Act and the Child Online      Protection Act. However, we feel it is not the government's      place to mandate what can and cannot be posted on the      Internet. If parents do not want their children to be exposed      to this material, there are several software programs      available to block out these sites.       Renay Thompson: Also, once the government steps in, who      decides what is objectionable and what is not? If we are      going to take the step of censoring sexually explicit      material, then why not censor other potentially offensive      material, such as those sites by racist groups, or even      antiabortionists. Obviously, this would be a violation of      these groups' First Amendment rights. Therefore the      government should not censor what appears on the Internet,      any more than it should censor the private, yet still      potentially offensive publications of these groups, or      pornographic magazines.       Angela Bellizzi: Parents, librarians, teachers and others      that provide Internet access to children need to take the      responsibility of monitoring their access. Legitimate web      sites should not be deprived of their First Amendment right.      That is why, Congressman Sanders, that we conclude in asking      you to vote against future legislation that restricts online      freedom of speech.                                       ____                           Juvenile Violence  (On behalf of David Gilbert, Melissa Jarvis, Amber Atherton, Corey                        Lasell and Douglas Kunkle)       Douglas Kunkle: We originally planned to discuss our      feelings on NATO's action in Kosovo, but with the tragedy in      Littleton, we had to choose between two violent and      incomprehensible acts. We, with the rest of the country, have      been shocked and dismayed with the most recent shooting and      bombing incident at Columbine High School, and with the rest      of the country, we have discussed and debated the economic,      cultural, and technical factors which may have contributed to      the escalating trend of violent crimes committed by juveniles      in this country.       We understand that there is no quick solution to this      problem. We only know that action must be taken.       Corey Lasell: Murder rates are down; but not among      adolescents. According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the      problem with children killing is likely to worsen. On a      typical day in this country, nine teenagers are murdered, and      since 1965 there has been a 464 percent increase in the      murder arrest rate for 18-year-olds.       Here in Vermont, we feel protected from those kinds of      statistics. We are lulled into thinking: ``That couldn't      happen in Vermont.'' But according the study conducted by the      Vermont Center for Justice Research, there has been a      dramatic increase in crimes committed by Vermont's youth, and      increasingly more violent ones.       Bill Clints, Director for the Center for Justice Research,      said that the result of this study ``indicates the need for      further examination of the state's troubled youth in the      confidential system that protects and prosecutes them.''       Amber Atherton: We suggest that juveniles who commit      violent crimes should be tried as an adult. Juveniles must be      taught to accept responsibility for their actions. Right now,      every juvenile knows the law protects them, and just about      anything they do will be handled with kid gloves and a slap      on the wrist. Punishment is usually in the form of probation      and/or community service. Most juvenile delinquents do not      get punished at all for the misdemeanor crimes, so some start      committing felonies. We think, because they were not punished      for the misdemeanor crimes, they feel they will not be      punished for the felonies.       Melissa Jarvis: People are afraid to punish juveniles      because they want to give them a second chance. Increasingly,      this second chance is used to commit another crime. We think      it is about time that the adults in charge look at the      juvenile crime situation without colored glasses. This isn't      the '50s. Children are killing and getting killed. Those      killed do not get a second chance.       We think the fear of harsher punishments would serve as a      deterrent for those juveniles who would be successful in      programs such as diversion, and curtail the activities of      habitual criminals. This will at least protect the general      population from them.       David Gilbert: We are afraid lawmakers are scrambling      around to pass new laws. The killers in Littleton broke 18      gun laws and more. There are plenty of laws. What we need to      do is enforce, prosecute, and punish those who break them.                                       ____                    Lowering the Drinking Age to 18   (On behalf of Nicholas Dandrow, Eric Williams, Beth Nadeau, Becca                       Bergeron and Michael French)       Becca Bergeron: I will be speaking on behalf of the group.       We feel that the drinking age should be lowered from 21      years of age to 18. The reasons for our proposal are:       1. If you are 18, you are considered an adult, just the      same as if you were 21.       2. If, at the age of 18, you are allowed to join or be      drafted into the army to fight for your country, why can't      you buy a six-pack of beer?       3. Most European countries have either no drinking age or      it is 18 years old.       4. Giving 18-year-olds this privilege will help them feel      like an adult, rather than just an 18-year-old.       5. The drinking age was 18 at one point in this country. It      was during the '70s. We know the outcome was not the      greatest, but you have to understand that that was the '70s,      there was Vietnam, lots of drug use, many rebellious people      and organizations.       6. Once a rule is made, the number one response is to test      it. That is why many people under the age of 21 consume      alcohol, just because they aren't supposed to.       7. Most of this group here is 18, and once we are 18, are      seniors in high school. That means next year some of us will      be attending college. The college scene is very much more      older and diverse. The ages range from 18 and up, So, if you      are all in the same boat, what makes the 18-, 19- and 20-     year-olds different? They can vote, drive automobiles, serve      the country, get into clubs, buy tobacco products, lottery      tickets, give blood, purchase a firearm. The one thing they      cannot do is purchase or consume alcohol products. What      difference does three years make?       If the age were lowered, it is understood that some      problems may occur, such as more high school students would      start drinking, causing more drinking and driving. But we      believe awareness to be very effective. Also, stricter laws      to minors under the age of 18, and stricter penalties to the      persons supplying minors.       As our representative, Congressman Bernie Sanders, we urge      you to voice our opinion to lower the drinking age to 18.                               ____________________
