I in no way want him to misinterpret the comments I made as being critical of his analysis. Formulas are very difficult. TEA-21 is something we know was totally politically driven. That was a percentage of the total amount of money, so when they got up to 60 votes they could just shut the door and say: Fine, we have our bill. We tried not to do that, take consideration of donor/donee status, fast-growing States.  By the way, you heard the senior Senator from Texas yesterday talking about her dissatisfaction with what Texas was doing. When it gets down to it, under this formula or any other formula, if you do something for a fast growing State that keeps bumping up against the ceiling, you are going to be having a problem. If you try to correct that, it is going to go into the donee States, of which of course Pennsylvania is one.  It is a difficult choice. We spent a whole year working on this and I hope you have a chance to really look at it closely.
