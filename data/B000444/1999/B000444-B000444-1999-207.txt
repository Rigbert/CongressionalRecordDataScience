 President, last week the Senate passed S. 1217, the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. I want to take a minute now to express my serious concerns about the low level of funding for embassy security contained in the bill.  Just about one year ago, two United States embassies in East Africa were destroyed by terrorist bombs, killing hundreds of people and injuring thousands. The bombings underscored the great vulnerability of our diplomatic missions. In response, Congress promptly provided $1.4 billion in emergency funding to rebuild the two embassies and to take other urgent steps to bolster security at overseas missions.  Soon thereafter, two panels were convened by the Secretary of State to review the bombings. The two commissions were chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Crowe commissions recommended that the U.S. government devote $1.4 billion per year for each of the next ten years to security.  Unfortunately, the legislation before the Senate falls far short of what the Crowe commissions recommended. The bill appropriates just $300 million for security in the State Department operations accounts, and just $110 million for security in the capital account. But of this latter amount, only $36 million is provided for construction or renovation of new embassies--$264 million below the President's request. Moreover, the bill rescinds $58 million in previously-appropriated funds in this same account. Neither the bill nor the Committee report explains how these funds will be restored to meet continuing and future needs.  Finally, the bill denies the Administration's request for $3.6 billion in advance funding for capital projects for Fiscal Years 2001 to 2005. The Department based this request on bitter experience. In the mid-1980s, after a commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Inman recommended massive increases in embassy security, Congress initially responded by providing significant funding and significant promises. But as the years passed, security became a second-order priority; the requested funding for security was denied by Congress, and some of the money that had been allocated for security was either rescinded by Congress or redirected to other priorities. By the mid-1990s, the Inman Commission report was collecting dust on government bookshelves, its recommendations barely recalled, and funding for security had been reduced considerably.  So, understandably, the State Department is skeptical that the grand promises made in the wake of the embassy bombings will be fulfilled. With considerable justification, the State Department experts have told Congress that it can best move forward on a sensible and rational construction program if it can be assured in advance of the necessary funds. Otherwise, the Department of State rightly fears, we will see a repeat of the experience after the Inman Commission.  The Committee on Foreign Relations, and then the full Senate, responded to this plea by providing a $3 billion authorization over five years in S. 886, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. But that was just the first step. The authorization will be useless without appropriations. Unfortunately, the Committee on Appropriations has ignored the State Department's request in this bill.  I believe this bill breaks faith with the bold promises that were made in the wake of the embassy bombings last summer. We need to do much, much more to protect our dedicated public servants working overseas. I strongly urge the chairman and ranking member to look for additional resources to fund this important account, without compromising the other important foreign affairs accounts.                          ____________________
