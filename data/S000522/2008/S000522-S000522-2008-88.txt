Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith  Bill Number: HR 2638  Account: Federal Emergency Management Agency's Pre-Disaster Mitigation  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of Trenton  Address of Requesting Entity: City of Trenton  Description of Request:  The City of Trenton will use the $500,000 in Pre-Disaster Mitigation funding in the FY 2009 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to begin elevating the utilities of 270 flood prone properties that have suffered severe and repetitive physical damage resulting in significant economic loss.  Trenton's Island and Glen Afton neighborhoods are greatly affected by rapidly rising flood water as a result of their proximity to the Delaware River. These two neighborhoods are bordered by the Delaware River to the southwest and the Delaware and Raritan Canal to the northwest. Route 29 (a four lane state highway that traverses the City) splits the two neighborhoods; causing an island-like geography.  These waterfront communities are home to approximately 270 structures, many of which are occupied by single family working class homeowners who have suffered great financial loss as a result of: water damaged electrical distribution systems, hot water heaters and central heating units, as well as the loss of personal items that can never be replaced.  Six historical river crests (occurring from the earlier part of the 20th century until present) have caused considerable property damage and interrupted sewer, electric and gas services, causing the evacuation of these neighborhoods. Although these neighborhoods are designated as a 100 year flood plain, the last two floods occurred within seven months of each other (September 2004 and April 2005). Just as the Island and Glen Afton residents saw their lives getting back to some semblance of normalcy, the second flood occurred, resulting in lost wages, belongings, property, major systems and complete dislocation.  One major contributing factor to the early flooding is the storm sewer outfall, which provides an early entry point for water to backflow into the lower points of the Island and Glen Afton neighborhoods via the storm sewer system during early flood stages. However, once the river reaches two feet above flood stage,the entire Island and Glen Afton neighborhoods will flood. The City of Trenton wishes to assist the most affected residents so that property loss and displacement are minimized.  This project is designed to elevate the utilities of approximately 270 properties that have suffered repetitive damages.The 270 identified properties will abandon the use of their basements and elevate their major systems by rewiring the electrical system and redirecting the duct work so that the hot water heating and heating system can be moved to above the first floor; minimizing loss during future floods.                          ____________________
