President, as long as I have served in the Senate--and I have served the longest in this body--I have never seen a time when noncontroversial nominations were being held up, whether we have had a Republican or Democratic President. I would note for the majority leader that we have on the calendar 18 nominees for Federal judgeships that passed unanimously. Every Republican and every Democrat in the Judiciary Committee voted for them. Many of them were recommended by Republican Senators and four of them for judicial emergencies. The oldest one has been pending since June, having gone through the committee unanimously. This is not being responsible to the American people.  The distinguished majority leader talked about the use of Executive orders. Concerns have been expressed by the other side about Executive orders on immigration. I would remind everybody that this body by a 2-to-1 margin--Republicans and Democrats joined together last year to pass a comprehensive immigration bill which covered everything from the people on the borders to those who were already in this country. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to take it up. They complain about the President 1\1/2\ years later--during all this time that has passed between the Republican and Democratic votes here, they have refused to take it up. Yet they complain that the President is going to do something.  I say bring it up and vote yes or vote no. Stop this ``we will vote maybe.''
