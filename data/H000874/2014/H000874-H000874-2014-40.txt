 With respect to the Appropriations Committee and the CR, it is our expectation that the CR is scheduled to have a date of December 11. I notice Senator Cruz has made another suggestion. To clarify, is December 11 still the date that the majority is looking for to run the CR through?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, as of this time. We have posted it this week. December 11 is the duration that the continuing resolution would go through.
