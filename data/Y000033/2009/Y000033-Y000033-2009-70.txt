Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize a program, which in the last year, has helped more than 40,000 Americans who are blind or who have severe disabilities gain skills and training that has ultimately led to gainful employment; The AbilityOne Program.  The AbilityOne Program harnesses the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy products and services from participating community-based nonprofit agencies that are dedicated to training and employing individuals with disabilities. This program affords Americans with disabilities the opportunity to acquire job skills and training, receive good wages and benefits, and gain greater independence and quality of life.  This comes in a segment of the population that has suffered from significant unemployment. But programs such as AbilityOne have come a long way in helping to bring people with disabilities into a working society. I am proud to acknowledge that REACH Inc. has played an active role since 1977 in helping employ people with severe disabilities and is one of the community partners to the AbilityOne Program within my state.  The history and mission of REACH Inc. stands as a true example of why this program is a winning proposition for all parties involved. REACH Inc. grew out of the dream of a group of local families who wanted to organize activities for their children with disabilities. Over 32 years ago, REACH Inc. opened its doors in the basement of the Resurrection Lutheran Church in Juneau. What started out as a small, family-run group meeting in a church basement has developed into an agency employing 200 people and serving over 400 individuals.  The direct impact of these organizations on the lives of Americans with disabilities cannot be overstated. For an individual with a severe disability who has never had the opportunity to hold a job, be independent, participate in the community, or play an important role in society; the AbilityOne Program and organizations like REACH Inc. are invaluable.  Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I extend my support to the AbilityOne Program. I also want to commend the dedication and commitment to the REACH Inc. Executive Director, Mr. Richard Fagundes, and his staff for helping individuals who are blind or have a severe disability find employment. Their work helps people live fuller lives and become more active members of society. I also commend each AbilityOne employee who works every day to improve their lives, support our Government, and make our country a better place to live.                          ____________________
