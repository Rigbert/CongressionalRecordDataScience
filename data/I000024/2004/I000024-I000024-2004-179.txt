President, I will be very brief. I think everything I would have said has been said by our chairman, Senator Warner.  We have 325,000 troops scattered around 120 different countries. I chaired the Subcommittee on Readiness for a number of years. That was during the 1990s when we were making cuts in our defense across the board in terms of end strength, in terms of numbers of divisions and numbers of tactical air wings, in terms of the numbers of ships, in terms of modernization, and in terms of readiness. It was very disturbing during that time. I was outspoken at that time that we might be going too far.  Recently we went through this thing of not having adequate body armor. Of course, the Army, in this case, responded with our help and we are able to say now they are taken care of adequately.  In modernization, we are going into the future combat system. We were delayed in the 1990s. Now things are getting back on track. However, we often say we want our troops, our men and women in uniform, to have the very best of equipment and the best support.  Quite frankly, we don't have as good equipment as some of our potential adversaries in the case of our artillery. We are still dealing with World War II technologies when there are five countries that have made a better case than we have. I don't think the American people want our young people going into combat with anything except the best. That is what this is about. We are in a rebuilding mode right now. We are talking about transforming all branches. We are talking about changing the way our troops are stationed around the world. This is going to be expensive. We are in the middle of a war. I strongly support the increases recommended by the chairman, Senator Warner.  I yield the floor.
