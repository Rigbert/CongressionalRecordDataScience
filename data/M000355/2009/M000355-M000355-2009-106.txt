 President, I thank the majority leader. I did suggest yesterday that, since the President was not meeting with us, we had nothing constructive to do during that hour. I suggested that we be allowed to speak. We worked that out in our first bipartisan moment on this bill, as he indicated.  With regard to the agenda tomorrow, as the majority leader indicated, we have the Gregg amendment, the Pryor amendment, and the abortion amendment. We will have an additional amendment on this side as well. That is up to four.
