 President, today, I am introducing legislation that would give support to community antidrug coalitions nation-wide. The National Community Coalition Institute would strengthen and enhance the role of community coalitions, to reduce and prevent drug use in communities.  More specifically, one of the problems we have found in implementing the Drug Free Communities Program has been the inexperience of a lot of the communities, particularly smaller and rural ones in knowing how to evaluate their efforts; get information on best practices from other, successful coalitions, and on how to fill out grant applications. The National Community Coalition Institute would improve the effectiveness of community coalitions by providing state-of-the-art and widely available education, training, and technical assistance for coalition leaders and community teams. The National Community Coalition Institute would ensure that communities nation-wide are adequately prepared to undertake the important work of building drug free communities.  Ultimately, the fight against drugs cannot be successful if it does not start in our own backyards. I invite all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort.                                 ______                                       By
