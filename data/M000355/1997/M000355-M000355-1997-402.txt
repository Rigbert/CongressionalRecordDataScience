 President, once again I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for an outstanding speech. I appreciate his contribution to this debate.  The question before us, as I have said, as we all know, is whether to amend the first amendment for the first time in history to give to the Government the power to control the political discourse in this country across the board; the political speech of candidates, political speech of individuals, the political speech of groups--all of this, because we have concluded that there is too much political discourse in this country.  Senator Roberts mentioned, and others are familiar with, some of the statistics. Of all the commercials run in the previous year, 1 percent of them were about politics; 1 percent of them. The notion that we have an excessive amount of political discussion in this country is absurd on its face. It is absurd on its face.  The good thing about the debate that we are having is it is an honest debate. The Hollings amendment concedes that there is very little you can do, consistent with the first amendment, in the campaign finance reform field that the Supreme Court will not strike down. The measure most commonly referred to by the reformers, the McCain-Feingold proposal, is unconstitutional at least 12 different ways. It would be dead on arrival in the Federal courts. At least this debate helps sum up what is really needed if Senators believe that there is too much political discussion in our country.  It should not be surprising, Mr. President, that this amendment has almost no constituents. Common Cause, the group most often thought of when you think of the subject of campaign finance reform, opposes this constitutional amendment. The Washington Post, which writes a story on these kinds of issues virtually daily, opposes this amendment. The New York Times opposes this amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union opposes this amendment.  In short, even the proponents of some kind of effort to restrict the speech of people who are involved in the American political process look at this particular effort to carve a big hunk out of the first amendment for the first time in history as an overreaching and ill-advised step in the wrong direction.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter I received from the ACLU dated March 6, 1997, in opposition to the constitutional amendment.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                   Washington National Office,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly      opposes S.J. Res. 18, the proposed constitutional amendment      that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating      federal campaign expenditures and contributions.       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform      and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the      kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First      Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that      S.J. Res. 18 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First      Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the      states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to      restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 18 would give      Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation      that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free      association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this      measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee      that Congress or the states will have the political will,      after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that      will correct the problems in our current electoral system.      This amendment misleads the American people because it tells      them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment      rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not      only is this too high a price to demand in the name of      reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an      unlikely outcome.       Rather than assuring that the electoral processes will be      improved, a constitutional amendment merely places new state      and federal campaign finance law beyond the reach of First      Amendment jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would      have to demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.''      ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of      those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral      process on the basis of their third party status, lack of      wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly      prevents the government from being arbitrary when making      these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 18 would enable the      Congress to set limitations on expenditures and contributions      notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.       Once S.J. Res. 18 is adopted, Congress and local      governments could easily further distort the political      process in numerous ways. Congress and state governments      could pass new laws that operate to the detriment of dark-     horse and third party candidates. For example, with the      intention of creating a ``level playing field'' Congress      could establish equal contribution and expenditure limits      that would ultimately operate to the benefit of incumbents      who generally have a higher name recognition than their      opponents, and who are often able to do more with less      funding. Thus, rather than assure fair and free elections,      the proposal would enable those in power to perpetuate their      own power and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of      those who would challenge the status quo.       S.J. Res. 18 would also give Congress and every state      legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First      Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the      press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and      magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable      operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of      editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered      editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at      the publisher's expense are more certainly expenditures in      support of or in opposition to particular political      candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would      authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the      expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly      reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a      society that cherishes the free press.       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment,      what rational basis would it use to distinguish between      certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be      justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run      unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it      unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited      number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why      would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to      run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate,      but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to      raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the      same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that      is published by an advocacy group different from a major      daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of      candidates for federal office? Should one type of media      outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the      other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty      different state and local standards for expenditures? These      are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or      answered.       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only      expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly      independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed      to protect.       If Congress or the states want to change our campaign      finance system, then it need not throw out the First      Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful      federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating      the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme      Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Some of these reform      measures include: public financing for all legally qualified      candidates--financing that serves as a floor, not a ceiling      for campaign expenditures; extending the franking privilege      to all legally qualified candidates; providing assistance in      some form for broadcast advertising through vouchers or      reduced advertising rates; improving the resources for the      FEC so that it can provide timely disclosure of contributions      and expenditures; and providing vouchers for travel.       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of      Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such      as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of      campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a      collision course with the First Amendment. Before Senators      vote to eliminate certain first Amendment rights, the ACLU      urges the Congress to consider other legislative options, and      to give these alternatives its considered review through the      hearing process.       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 18.           Sincerely,                                                  Laura W. Murphy.  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post editorial of Monday, December 2, 1996, in opposition to the constitutional amendment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Wrong Way on Campaign Finance       Campaign finance reform is hard in part because it so      quickly bumps up against the First Amendment. To keep offices      and officeholders from being bought, proponents seek to limit      what candidates for office can raise and spend. That's      reasonable enough, except that the Supreme Court has ruled--     we think correctly--that the giving and spending of campaign      funds is a form of political speech, and the Constitution is      pretty explicit about that sort of thing. ``Congress shall      make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech'' is the      majestic sentence. So however laudable the goal, you end up      having to regulate lightly and indirectly in this area, which      means you are almost bound to achieve an imperfect result.       As a way out of this dilemma, Senate Minority Leader Tom      Daschle added his name the other day to the list of those who      say the Constitution should be amended to permit the      regulation of campaign spending. He wasn't just trying to      duck the issue by raising it to a higher level as some would-     be amenders have in the past. Rather, his argument is that      you can't win the war without the weapons, which in the case      of campaign finance means the power not just to create      incentives to limit spending but to impose spending limits      directly.       But that's what everyone who wants to put an asterisk after      the First Amendment says: We have a war to fight that we can      win only if given the power to suppress. It's a terrible      precedent even if in a virtuous cause, and of course, it is      always in a virtuous cause. The people who want a flag-     burning amendment think of themselves as defenders of civic      virtue too. These amendments are always for the one cause      only. Just this once, the supporters say. But having punched      the one hole, you make it impossible to argue on principle      against punching the next. The question becomes not whether      you have exceptions to the free speech clause, but which      ones?       Nor is it clear that an amendment would solve the problem.      It would offer a means but not the will. The system we have      is a system     that benefits incumbents. That's one of the reasons we      continue to have it, and future incumbents are no more likely      to want to junk it than is the current crop.       The campaign finance issue tends to wax and wane, depending      on how obscene the fund-raising was, or seemed, in the last      election. The last election being what it was, Congress is      under a fair amount of pressure to toughen the law. The      Democrats doubtless feel it most, thanks to the revelations      of suspect fund-raising on the part of the president's      campaign, though the Republicans have their own sins to      answer for--not least their long record of resistance to      reform. with all respect to Mr. Daschle, a constitutional      amendment will solve none of this.       The American political system is never going to be      sanitized nor, given the civic cost of the regulations that      would be required (even assuming that a definition of the      sanitary state could be agreed upon), should that be anyone's      goal. Rather, the goal should be simply to moderate the role      of money in determining elections and of course the policies      to which the elections lead. The right approach remains the      same: Give candidates some of the money they need to run, but      exact in return a promise to limit their spending. And then      enforce the promise. Private money would still be spent, but      at a genuine and greater distance from the candidates      themselves. It wouldn't be a perfect world, and that would be      its virtue as well as a flaw.  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Roberts referred to the recent George Will column entitled ``Government Gag,'' which appeared in the Washington Post of February 13, 1997. I ask unanimous consent that that also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             Government Gag       To promote the fair and effective functioning of the      democratic process, Congress, with respect to elections for      federal office, and States, for all other elections,      including initiatives and referenda, may adopt reasonable      regulations of funds expended, including contributions, to      influence the outcome of elections, provided that such      regulations do not impair the right of the public to a full      and free discussion of all issues and do not prevent any      candidate for elected office from amassing the resources      necessary for effective advocacy.       Such governments may reasonably define which expenditures      are deemed to be for the purpose of influencing elections, so      long as such definition does not interfere with the right of      the people fully to debate issues.       No regulation adopted under this authority may regulate the      content of any expression of opinion or communication.--     Proposed amendment to the Constitution       Like the imperturbable Sir Francis Drake, who did not allow      the Spanish Armada's arrival off England to interrupt a game      of bowling, supposed friends of the First Amendment are      showing notable sang-froid in the face of ominous      developments. Freedom of speech is today under more serious      attack than at any time in at least the last 199 years--since      enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Actually, today's      threat, launched in the name of political hygiene, is graver      than that posed by those acts, for three reasons.       First, the 1798 acts, by which Federalists attempted to      suppress criticism of the government they then controlled,      were bound to perish with fluctuations in the balance of      partisan forces. Today's attack on free speech advances under      a bland bipartisan banner of cleanliness.       Second, the 1798 acts restricted certain categories of      political speech and activities, defined, albeit quite      broadly, by content and objectives. Today's enemies of the      First Amendment aim to abridge the right of free political      speech generally. It is not any particular content but the      quantity of political speech they find objectionable.       Third, the 1798 acts had expiration dates and were allowed      to expire. However, if today's speech-restrictors put in      place their structure of restriction (see above), its anti-     constitutional premise and program probably will be      permanent.       Its premise is that Americans engage in too much      communication of political advocacy, and that government--     that is, incumbents in elective offices--should be trusted to      decide and enforce the correct amount. This attempt to put      the exercise of the most elemental civil right under      government regulation is the most fundamental principle of      the nation's Founders.       The principle is that limited government must be limited      especially severely concerning regulation of the rights most      essential to an open society. Thus the First Amendment says      ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of      speech,'' not ``Congress may abridge the freedom of speech      with such laws as Congress considers reasonable.''       The text of the proposed amendment comes from Rep. Richard      Gephardt, House minority leader, who has the courage of his      alarming convictions when he says: ``What we have is two      important values in conflict: freedom of speech and our      desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You      can't have both.''       However, he also says: ``I know this is a serious step to      amend the First Amendment. * * * But * * * this is not an      effort to diminish free speech.'' Nonsense. Otherwise      Gephardt would not acknowledge that the First Amendment is      an impediment.       The reformers' problem is the Supreme Court, which has      affirmed the obvious: Restrictions on the means of making      speech heard, including spending for the dissemination of      political advocacy, are restrictions on speech. It would be      absurd to say, for example: ``Congress shall make no law      abridging the right to place one's views before the public in      advertisements or on billboards but Congress can abridge--     reasonably, of course--the right to spend for such things.''       Insincerity oozes from the text of the proposed amendment.      When Congress, emancipated from the First Amendment's      restrictions, weaves its web of restraints on political      communication, it will do so to promote its understanding of      what is the ``fair'' and ``effective'' functioning of      democracy, and ``effective'' advocacy. Yet all this      regulation will be consistent with ``the right of the people      fully to debate issues,'' and with ``full and free discussion      of all issues''--as the political class chooses to define      ``full'' and ``free'' and the ``issues.''       In 1588 England was saved not just by Drake but by luck--     the ``Protestant wind'' that dispersed the Armada. Perhaps      today the strangely silent friends of freedom--why are not      editorial pages erupting against the proposed vandalism      against the Bill of Rights?--are counting on some similar      intervention to forestall today's ``reformers,'' who aim not      just to water the wine of freedom but to regulate the      consumption of free speech.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a couple of years ago, George Will, in his Newsweek column, wrote an article in opposition to the constitutional amendment. The headline is, ``So, We Talk Too Much?''       The Supreme Court's two-word opinion of the Senate's reform      bill may be, ``Good grief.''  I ask unanimous consent that that also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, June 28, 1993]                         So, We Talk Too Much?                            (By George Will)       Washington's political class and its journalistic echoes      are celebrating Senate passage, on a mostly party-line vote,      of a ``reform'' that constitutes the boldest attack on      freedom of speech since enactment of the Alien and Sedition      Acts of 1798. The campaign finance bill would ration      political speech. Fortunately, it is so flagrantly      unconstitutional that the Supreme Court will fling it back      across First Street, N.E., with a two-word opinion: ``Good      grief!''       The reformers begin, as their ilk usually does, with a      thumping but unargued certitude: campaigns involve ``too      much'' money. (In 1992 congressional races involved a sum      equal to 40 percent of what Americans spent on yogurt. Given      the government's increasing intrusiveness and capacity to do      harm, it is arguable that we spend too little on the      dissemination of political discourse.) But reformers eager to      limit spending have a problem: mandatory spending limits are      unconstitutional. The Supreme Court acknowledges that the      First Amendment protects ``the indispensable conditions for      meaningful communication,'' which includes spending for the      dissemination of speech. The reformers' impossible task is to      gin up ``incentives'' powerful enough to coerce candidates      into accepting limits that can be labeled ``voluntary.''       The Senate bill's original incentive was public financing,      coupled with various punishments for privately financed      candidates who choose not to sell their First Amendment      rights for taxpayers' dollars and who exceed the government's      stipulated ration of permissible spending/speech. Most      taxpayers detest public financing. (``Food stamps for      politicians,'' says Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky      Republican who will lead the constitutional challenge if      anything like this bill becomes law.) So the bill was      changed--and made even more grossly unconstitutional. Now it      limits public funding to candidates whose opponents spend/     speak in excess of government limits. The funds for the      subsidy are to come from taxing, at the top corporate rate,      all contributions to the candidate who has chosen to exercise      his free speech rights with private funding. So 35 percent of      people's contributions to a privately funded candidate would      be expropriated and given to his opponent. This is part of      the punishment system designed to produce ``voluntary''      acceptance of spending limits.       But the Court says the government cannot require people      ``to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First      Amendment has made a high constitutional privilege.'' The      Court says that the ``power to tax the exercise of a right is      the power to control or suppress the exercise of its      enjoyment'' and is ``as potent as the power of      censorship.''       Sen. Fritz Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, is a      passionate advocate of spending limits but at least has the      gumption to attack the First Amendment frontally. The Senate      bill amounts, he says candidly, to ``coercing people to      accept spending limits while pretending it is voluntary.''      Because ``everyone knows what we are doing is      unconstitutional,'' he proposes to make coercion      constitutional. He would withdraw First     Amendment protection from the most important speech--     political discourse. And the Senate has adopted (52-43) his      resolution urging Congress to send to the states this      constitutional amendment: Congress and the states `'shall      have power to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures      by, in support of, or in opposition to any candidate in any      primary or other election'' for federal, state or local      office.       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving      this huge hole in the First Amendment would be ``a big boost      to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by      ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible      amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and state      legislatures. Note also the power to limit spending not only      ``by'' but even ``in support of, or in opposition to''      candidates. The 52 senators who voted for this included many      who three years ago stoutly (and rightly) opposed carving out      even a small exception to First Amendment protections in      order to ban flag-burning. But now these incumbents want to      empower incumbents to hack away at the Bill of Rights in      order to shrink the permissible amount of political      discourse.       Government micromanagement: The Senate bill would ban or      limit spending by political action committees. It would      require privately funded candidates to say in their broadcast      advertisements that ``the candidate has not agreed to      voluntary campaign limits.'' (This speech regulation is      grossly unconstitutional because it favors a particular point      of view, and because the Court has held that the First      Amendment protects the freedom to choose ``both what to say      and what not to say.'') All this government micromanagement      of political speech is supposed to usher in the reign of      ``fairness (as incumbents define it, of course).       Incumbents can live happily with spending limits.      Incumbents will write the limits, perhaps not altogether      altruistically. And spending is the way challengers can      combat incumbents' advantages such as name recognition,      access to media and franked mail. Besides, the most important      and plentiful money spent for political purposes is dispensed      entirely by incumbents. It is called the federal budget--$1.5      trillion this year and rising. Federal spending (along with      myriad regulations and subsidizing activities such as      protectionist measures) often is vote-buying.       It is instructive that when the Senate voted to empower      government to ration political speech, and even endorse      amending the First Amendment, there was no outcry from      journalists. Most of them are liberals and so are disposed to      like government regulation of (other people's) lives.      Besides, journalists know that government rationing of      political speech by candidates will enlarge the importance of      journalists' unlimited speech.       The Senate bill's premise is that there is ``too much''      political speech and some is by undesirable elements (PACs),      so government control is needed to make the nation's      political speech healthier. Our governments cannot balance      their budgets or even suppress the gunfire in America's      (potholed) streets. It would be seemly if politicians would      get on with such basic tasks, rather than with the mischief      of making mincemeat of the First Amendment.  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, in terms of insertions into the Record, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 12, by Common Cause, opposing the constitutional amendment which is before us, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Common Cause,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this      week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide      Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on      campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme      Court's 1976 decision in Buckley versus Valeo.       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because      it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent      Congress from passing campaign finance reform this year. We      believe that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in      order to achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.       Under existing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress has      significant scope to enact tough and effective campaign      finance reform consistent with the Court's interpretation of      the First Amendment in Buckley.       The McCain-Feingold bill, S.25, provides for significant      reform within the framework of the Buckley decision. The      legislation would: ban soft money; provide reduced postage      rates and free or reduced cost television time as incentives      for congressional candidates to agree to restrain their      spending; close loopholes related to independent expenditures      and campaign ads that masquerade as ``issue advocacy'';      reduce the influence of special-interest political action      committee (PAC) money; strengthen disclosure and enforcement.       A recent letter to Senators McCain and Feingold from      constitutional scholar Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of      the Brennan Center for Justice and a past National Legal      Director of the ACLU, sets forth the case that the McCain-     Feingold bill is constitutional. Professor Neuborne finds      that the key provisions of the bill are within the Court's      existing interpretation of the First Amendment, and he thus      demonstrates that a constitutional amendment is not necessary      to enact reform.       Professor Neuborne concludes that the voluntary spending      limits the McCain-Feingold bill are consistent with the      Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley. He further concludes that      ``Congress possesses clear power to close the soft money      loophole by restricting the source and size of contributions      to political parties. . . .'' He also concludes that efforts      to close loopholes relating to independent expenditures and      so-called ``issue ads'' are also within Congress' existing      authority.       It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Constitution      in order to enact meaningful campaign finance reform.      Congress has the power, consistent with the First Amendment,      to enact comprehensive reform by statute.       A constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform      should not be used as a way to delay reform legislation.      Typically, amending the Constitution takes years. After both      Houses of Congress adopt an amendment by a two-thirds vote,      it has to be approved by three-quarters of the state      legislatures. Even then, the Congress would still have to      take up enacting legislation. This is a lengthy and arduous      process.       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in      the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and      constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not      and should not start a reform process that will take years to      complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a      constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus      its efforts on enacting S.25, comprehensive bipartisan      legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced,      fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful      reform of the way congressional elections are financed.           Sincerely,                                                      Ann McBride,                                                        President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the question before us, the resolution by the junior Senator from South Carolina to amend the Constitution, grounds the campaign finance debate right where it needs to be and where it is, in the first amendment. That is where this debate should be centered. Lest anyone outside of the Senate construe this as an endorsement, I hasten to clarify that I regard this proposal as totally abhorrent. However, this is a debate we needed to have. This is an important discussion which clarifies that the campaign finance issue is really about political speech and about participation in our democracy. That is what this is about. That is the whole discussion.  In an effort to pave the way for restrictive legislation, such as the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, the amendment before us would amend the Constitution to grant Congress and the States the power to ``set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, or in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate.''  When Senator Roberts was here a few minutes ago, we talked about just what that means. Clearly, this amendment would give incumbent Members of Congress the ability to make it impossible to lose, short of some commission of a felony or some outrageous act on the part of an incumbent that brought total disfavor upon his or her head in their constituency. It would give to the Congress the power to totally mug, muzzle, shut up critics out in our constituencies who may have organized together. In fact, about the only group it leaves untouched are our friends in the gallery, the press, who would have enhanced power as a result of an effort to shut up everybody else. If you are going to go down this route, some would even advocate telling the press how much they can criticize us.  While we are messing with the first amendment, if we wanted to make it totally impossible for us to be defeated, why not, in addition to shutting up our challengers in the next election and muzzling all of the groups outside that may or may not like what we do, let's just go on and trash some of the rest of the first amendment. We can get rid of those nasty editorials that all of us despise, put some restrictions on those pesky little reporters who tend to point out our shortcomings, as they see them.  In short, there is no end to how much of this speech we could contain if we really wanted to do it. I mean, it is a short step, it seems to me, from amending the first amendment to give the Government the power to shut up its critics in a campaign to giving the Congress the power to shut up its critics in the gallery, and pretty soon, ofcourse, the first amendment doesn't have any resemblance whatsoever to what it has today.  This amendment that we are debating applies to Federal, State, and local elections. Any future Congress would have a free hand to regulate, restrict, or even prohibit any activity which is perceived by the Government--perceived by the Government--to constitute an expenditure by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate.  Mr. President, the words are few; their ramifications are simply stunning. Quite simply, this amendment empowers future Congresses to severely restrict--I would argue eliminate--the universe of political spending/speech which is deemed by Congress or some Government bureaucracy to effect an election. Candidate spending, independent expenditures, even issue advocacy by private citizens and groups, all of it could be muzzled under this amendment.  Senate Joint Resolution 18, which is the amendment before us, is a blank check for a Congress 10, 50, 100 years from now, or maybe tomorrow, the day after this is approved, to gag American citizens, candidates, groups, and parties. They could do it with a Constitution altered by this resolution. And some call this reform.  Mr. President, maybe some people believe that the 105th Congress or the 106th Congress would not do much damage with the power granted by this resolution, but I ask our friends on the left: Are you confident that some Republican-controlled Congress in the future with a 60-plus majority, with a Republican in the White House, will not seize the occasion to limit political activities by liberal-leaning groups, labor unions, the media, and others? Would you not like the Court to be able to stop such an effort on the grounds that it violated the first amendment?  My conservative friends, I ask you: Are you not relieved the Supreme Court was able to strike down the draconian restrictions on independent expenditures in campaigns in the 1978 campaign finance law?  I say to my conservative friends: Are you confident that liberal Democrats would never be in a position to enact into law a regulatory scheme on campaign finance that restricts your ability to communicate while leaving the media and labor unions unfettered and even more powerful than they already are? All of that, Mr. President, would be possible under this amendment.  No campaign finance bill will pass this or any Congress that was not drafted and amended by people fully cognizant of the partisan implications. That is why it is so important to have the impartial reasoning of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the backstop. It saves the country from legislative excess, ignorance, and mischief.  Having said that, it doesn't mean I agree with all the Supreme Court's decisions or I will not scrutinize Supreme Court nominees, but I do recognize that the Court, be it of liberal or conservative leaning--it is interesting to note in the Buckley case there were many liberals on the Court at that time. The Court was much more liberal than it is now when the Buckley case was rendered, a very sound decision, which the Court has only expanded in the direction of more permissible speech during the years, including the Colorado case last summer.  The Court is an essential check on legislative and executive branches. This amendment seeks to take the Court out of the picture where campaign finance is concerned so that those who desire campaign spending limits and restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy will not be inconvenienced, will not be inconvenienced by Court action such as the Buckley decision.  The Supreme Court got in the way. The Supreme Court got in the way and said you cannot do that, that it is impermissible for the Government to dole out political speech to candidates, individuals, or groups.  Revolting as the Clinton reelection team's fundraising practices were, or anybody else's, they do not justify restricting the rights of law-abiding American citizens in the future to participate in politics and spend as much as they want on their own campaigns for office. American democracy should not be diminished because a 1996 reelection effort violated current laws and flouted commonsense decency out of a ruthless, ruthless desperation to get reelected or some self-righteousness that their success was essential to the country, that the ends justified even illegal and unethical means.  Freedom should not be negotiable because one political party or other benefits disproportionately at a given point in time from some form of political speech or participation. Nor should freedom, Mr. President, be dialed back--dialed back--because some level of campaign spending violates somebody's notion of what is proper. The future should not be made to suffer so that some may appear to atone for misdeeds in the present or impose on the country their own view of what is an appropriate level of campaign spending.  Mr. President, God bless their souls, the Founding Fathers had the wisdom and the courage to construct the Constitution of the United States. Though I have much admiration for my colleagues in this Senate, I do not think we have the collective wisdom to improve upon the first amendment ratified by the States in 1791.  The amendment says:       Congress shall make no law [no law] respecting an      establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise      thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;      or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to      petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  The critical part is ``abridging the freedom of speech.'' That is what the Buckley case is about. And that is what this amendment seeks to revise.  Mr. President, reflecting upon the formulation of the Constitution, De Tocqueville observed in the 19th century that:       The course of time always gives birth to different      interests, and sanctions different principles, among the same      people; and when a general constitution is to be established,      these interests and principles are so many natural obstacles      to the rigorous application of any political system with all      its consequences. The early stages of national existence are      the only periods at which it is possible to make legislation      strictly logical; and when we perceive a nation in the      enjoyment of this advantage, we should not hastily conclude      that it is wise, but only remember that it is young.  I would contend that our Nation 200 years ago was both young and its leaders wise. I have also considered the environment in which the Founding Fathers toiled, free of the harsh glare of our modern media, unfettered by the influence of present-day polling, and blissfully unacquainted with grassroots lobbying machines.  Absent those factors, I suspect much in the legislation in this body, most especially campaign finance reform, would have a different outcome. Then again, we did not have to face down the Red Coats, and I am confident that the confluence of greatness which gave us the Constitution would have done so by candlelight or klieg lights.  The first amendment has served our Nation well for over 200 years. If this Senate will resist the temptation to scale it back, it can serve our descendants for 200 years more. The first amendment's speech protections are a legacy we are extremely fortunate to have inherited. It is the one we most certainly ought to bequeath, in turn, to generations to come.  The first amendment is America's premier political reform. It is at the heart of the campaign finance debate. This is not just my view. It is the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court and the American Civil Liberties Union--America's specialists on the first amendment. As the Court stated in the 1976 Buckley case:       The first amendment denies government the power to      determine that spending to promote one's political views is      wasteful, excessive or unwise.  That gets right to the heart of it. The first amendment prohibits the Government from determining ``that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise.'' In other words, when it comes to our political speech, we can be wasteful, we can be excessive and we can be unwise, and it is none of the Government's business.       In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not      the government but the people--individually as citizens and      candidates and collectively as associations and political      committees--who must retain control over the quantity and      range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.  So the proponents of this amendment look at that decision and say we needto cut a niche out of the first amendment and hand over to the Government the power to determine what is reasonable speech. In short, they could determine that no speech was reasonable under this amendment.  The Court has been clear and consistent on campaign finance, stating further in Buckley:       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can      spend on political communication during a campaign      necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting      the number of issues discussed, the depth of their      exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is      because virtually every means of communicating ideas in      today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.  It just does. The Court observed that even ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' costs money. Further, the Court stated that the electorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and information makes ``these expensive modes of communication indispensable [the Court said ``indispensable"] instruments of effective political speech.''  ``Indispensable.'' Under this amendment there would be nothing to keep the Congress from saying you do not get to use television at all--at all.  Quite simply, the Government may no more ration the political speech of an American citizen via campaign spending regulations than it can tell the Washington Post how many newspapers it may distribute or how many hours a day CNN may broadcast. Nor can the Government dictate the content of campaign ads, just as it cannot control the content of television news programs.  Mr. President, there is no reason sufficient to justify, in the eyes of the Court, campaign spending limits. Not to alleviate the appearance of corruption: The Court held there is ``nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy'' in campaigns spending money to communicate--nothing. Not to stem the growth in campaign spending. Again, the Court was clear:       . . . the mere growth in the cost of federal election      campaigns in and of itself provides no basis [no basis] for      governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign      spending. . .  And not to level the political playing field, a notion flatly rejected by the Court in Buckley.       . . . the concept that the government . . .  This is in response to the level playing field argument, Mr. President. In the Buckley case the Court said:       . . . the concept that government may restrict the speech      of some elements of our society in order to enhance the      relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First      Amendment.  ``Wholly foreign.''  So, Mr. President, the Government cannot, by congressional edict or regulatory fiat, impede or impair the ability of candidates, groups, individuals or parties to communicate with the electorate. Nor can Congress, as the American Civil Liberties Union has observed, coerce what it cannot command. In other words, spending limits that are voluntary in name only, such as in the McCain-Feingold bill, would have in the Court a half-life of an ice cube on a sun-baked Constitution Avenue on the 4th of July. That is about how long that would last.  There is nothing in Buckley, or any subsequent Supreme Court decision, upon this to pin hope that McCain-Feingold or any similarly coercive bills would be upheld. Buckley was not an aberration. In fact, the Court is increasingly of a deregulatory mind on campaign finance, as evidenced by last June's Colorado decision allowing the political parties to make independent expenditures.  Now, some seek to nullify the Court, and thereby pave the way for bills like McCain-Feingold, by amending the first amendment, and that is the issue before us--amending the first amendment for the first time in two centuries and thus make the unconstitutional, constitutional. They would rewrite the first amendment, a frontal assault on American freedom that the ACLU has characterized as ``a recipe for repression.''  That is what is before the Senate today. What is before us today has no constituency. Common Cause is against it. The New York Times is against it. The Washington Post is against it. The ACLU is against it. Importantly, an overwhelming number of Senators will be against it.  I personally recoil at the prospect of a Constitution so altered, while I relish the debate itself. This is an honest debate because it shows what you have to do to carve a big hunk out of the first amendment, if you will try to achieve the result that some are trying to achieve. This is an honest debate. It draws a clear line between those like myself who look on last year's record election spending as illustrative of a robust national debate over the future of the Nation, and those who believe you cannot have both freedom of speech and a healthy democracy.  Looking upon the first amendment as an impediment to reform, rather than reform, itself steers even well-intentioned reformers on a path of Government regulation, restriction, and even prohibition of fundamental political freedoms. A myopic determination to restrict campaign spending can result, as it has today, in an effort to essentially repeal the first amendment's protection of political speech. That is what is before the Senate today.  The Court stated in the 1937 case Palko versus Connecticut that freedom of speech ``is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.''  Whatever one believes about the current state of campaign finance or the validity of the Buckley decision, surely it is not cause to carve out of the first amendment fundamental protection for core political speech by American citizens. The first amendment was borne of extraordinary people in an extraordinary time. Let us not diminish that freedom, 200 years later, out of frustration with Court decisions.  The campaign finance reform debate is necessarily difficult. It is difficult because the ramifications of any significant change in this area are serious. A ban on soft money, for instance, will have serious repercussions, because--like it or not--the political parties do some good things. For one, they are the only entity in the system that will support challengers without regard to ideology.  The Democratic Party committees support challengers--pro-choice or pro-life, or pro-gun control or con-gun control, you name the issue and they have supported candidates of their side. In the case of the Democratic committee, because they are Democrats; in the case of the Republicans, because they are Republicans.  Our criteria is, first and foremost, a candidate's party affiliation. Then we consider their ability and the availability of money to help their candidates. The political party's helping challengers is often all that stands between an incumbent having real competition and not just a coronation on election day.  Much is said about independent expenditures and issue advocacy. The truth is, politicians hate independent expenditures because by definition they are out of our control. We do not get to control them. A group that thinks your reelection is the most important goal may make independent expenditures that are intended to help you but, in fact, inject into the election an issue you wish was not going to be discussed. In other words, a group can love you to death with independent expenditures. That is why politicians would like to have complete control of elections. That is what they would be given under this amendment--complete control.  Mr. President, the candidates do not own the elections. They are the people's elections, not the candidates. They are the people's elections to influence through independent expenditures, issues advocacy, and through the support of candidates and political parties of their choosing. These reform bills would take elections away from private citizens, groups, and parties and hand them over, exclusively, to the candidates and to the media.  Issue advocacy is a recent addition to the reform lexicon. Some reformers profess to be horrified by all the issue advocacy that occurred last year because--news flash--they affected the election. They decry issue advocacy as another loophole that has been blasted through allowing groups to circumvent campaign finance restrictions.  A funny thing about citizens, groups, and parties who wish to make themselves heard in a democracy: They always seem to find a way around Government speech roadblocks.  If Congress ever does impose Government regulations on issue advocacyand the courts do not strike them down, the first amendment will be a hollow shell. Soft money limits, independent expenditure limits, issue advocacy regulations, spending limits, PAC limits--these are all euphemisms for speech limits.  Under this amendment before the Senate--by carving out a huge chunk of the first amendment--Congress could succeed in imposing all of these speech limits. America would then spend less on elections. Elections would be quieter, politics--at least, on the surface--would be more civil because dissent would be tightly regulated by this Congress and incumbents would be less bothered by fundraising. And we will have gutted American democracy.  Mr. President, I am confident this amendment is not going to be approved. I hope it will be rejected overwhelmingly. It is one of the most frightening proposals we have had before this body in the 13 years I have been here. The first amendment should be the touchstone of reform, and the Buckley case, its guide.  Within those parameters, we could enact bipartisan reform to strengthen, rather than diminish, our democracy. I hope at some point that is what we will be doing.
