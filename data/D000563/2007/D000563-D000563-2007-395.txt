President, today I am necessarily absent to attend a funeral, and therefore will miss rollcall vote No. 346 on the Levin-Reed amendment to provide for a reduction and transition of U.S. forces in Iraq. As a cosponsor of this amendment, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.''  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)
