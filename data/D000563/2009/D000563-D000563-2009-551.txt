President, I listened carefully to the Republican leader of the Senate, as I have every day, waiting for one thing: the Republican health care reform plan. We did not receive it today. We have never received it because there is no Republican approach to health care reform.  I know we have tried to engage the Republicans in this debate. We waited weeks--make that months--to bring over just three Republican Senators who would sit down and negotiate with us. In the end, they walked away. One Senator from Maine is still possibly going to vote for this. We hope she will. I hope others will join her. But it is not for lack of effort that we do not have a bipartisan approach at this moment.  What the Senator from Kentucky failed to mention when he said we have dismissed commonsense Republican proposals is when the HELP Committee--which is the Health, Education, Labor Committee--sat down to write their health care reform bill--it went on for weeks--day after weary day, amendment after amendment was considered by this committee because of the gravity of this challenge--we are literally talking about a health care system that affects every one of us--and at the end of the weeks of hearings and the hundreds of amendments offered, 150, maybe more, Republican amendments were adopted to this bill.
