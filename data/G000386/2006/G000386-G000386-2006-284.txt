 President, it is very unfortunate that when it comes to issues of taxes that we see hand-wringing and we read editorials about who is receiving the benefits of a reduction in taxes or, in this case, who is going to have to face an increase in taxes because that is what this is all about, preventing an automatic increase in taxes if we don't do anything.  With the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, it is going to hit millions of families next year if we don't do something. We are going to have an increase in capital gains and dividends in a couple years if we don't take action today on this bill.  We should think of this as a question of who is going to see an increase in taxes. That is why the title of this bill is so on point. The title of the bill is the ``Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act,'' and the key part of those many words is ``tax increase prevention.'' That is the key part of the title. That is what this bill is all about. This is not about cutting taxes further. How many times have we heard the words ``cutting taxes'' used on the floor of this body?  What we are doing in this bill is making sure that people don't get an automatic tax increase because of sunset, and because Congress doesn't have guts enough to vote for a tax increase, they can stop legislation like this and have a tax increase and never have to be on record in favor of the tax increase. But we are not cutting taxes. We are keeping the same tax policy that we had in the 2003 tax bill, in the case of dividends, and we are keeping the same tax policy in the case of the alternative minimum tax that we had in the tax bill since Senator Baucus and I negotiated that tax bill in 2001--in other words, to hold harmless 22 million more people who are not going to be paying that tax on 2006 income who didn't have to pay it on 2005 income.  I would like to discuss some of the points on this matter that I hope will help keep the feet of people on the other side of the aisle, and maybe a couple on our side of the aisle, on the ground.  Let's start with the basic fact that thanks to the tax cuts we have enacted during the Bush administration, we have now removed millions of people from the Federal income tax rolls. Millions of hard-working families now do not have to pay any Federal income tax and, as my colleagues know, many of these families can get benefits from what is called the earned-income tax credit which serves the purpose of offsetting some payroll taxes low-income people pay.  Let me make it very clear. If you are bad-mouthing the tax policies of 2001 and 2003 in this administration, are you saying that it was wrong to take millions of low-income people who previously had to pay some income tax off the rolls? They probably couldn't afford to pay a little amount of income tax, and they are no longer paying income tax. It just shocks me that I would hear people bad-mouthing that tax policy that was adopted in 2001 which, quite frankly, is a continuation of some tax policy that was adopted in other tax bills in previous years.  That is a fact of life. Thanks to our tax cuts, millions of low-income families and individuals no longer pay Federal income tax. Yet people love to pull their hair about the fact that we are not giving tax cuts to these same low-income people. It is a fact of life that we all looked at. This kind of talk stops me right in my tracks. It reminds me of city folk who start to farm, plant soybeans, and wonder why they are not going to get a corn crop.  It is this way: If you don't pay Federal income tax--and remember, we just took lots of people, millions of people, off the Federal income tax rolls who don't pay Federal income tax--if you don't pay it, it is pretty hard to cut your income taxes. If you don't plant corn, you are not going to get a corn crop.  Again, this bill is focused on preventing tax increases, not cutting taxes. So anybody on the other side of the aisle who says we are cutting taxes for this group or that group doesn't know what they are talking about because what we are doing is continuing existing tax policy. If they want to go back and argue that tax policy adopted in 2001 and 2003 is wrong, that we cut taxes way back then, that is an intellectually honest argument. But don't say we are cutting taxes in this tax bill because we are not cutting taxes anymore. We are keeping the tax policy where it has been.  I find it particularly interesting that we hear from the other side of the aisle that we should have done just the alternative minimum tax in this bill and not done provisions for capital gains and dividends. Often, these folks arguing this way are the same folks who are wearing their hair shirt ragged on this issue of who is going to get tax benefits.  Interestingly, the Tax Policy Center, which is so often cited by newspapers and Members, shows that if we had just done capital gains and dividends and not done the alternative minimum tax, that would have provided more tax relief for low-income families and individuals. Let me make sure my colleagues understand that point. By including capital gains and dividends, this bill provides more tax benefits to low-income families and individuals than if we had just done the alternative minimum tax.  So I suggest to those who think they should only do the alternative minimum tax, they should hang up their hair shirt. We all know the reality is that capital gains and dividends are encouraging investors, new businesses,and as a result we get 5.2 million new jobs. We get 4.8 percent economic growth in the last quarter--18 quarters in a row of growth. I don't say that; Chairman Greenspan says that the tax cuts are responsible for turning the economy around and having this growth.  Let me further say that Chairman Greenspan has always had a great deal of credibility, and he still does. If he says it is better, then I say it. But if we can both say it, we are both right.  You create new jobs, new businesses. It is absolutely wrong to state that low-income families are not seeing benefits. They are seeing the benefits of these tax policies previously enacted by these 5.3 million new jobs created, and they will see these benefits in the future with more new jobs being created.  This has helped Americans at all levels. It is reported that the percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 a year rose from 40.8 percent of the population to 44.2 percent of the population in just 2 years. While inflation is a factor--it is a very low inflation rate--that still reflects real gain.  To reduce all of this to a spreadsheet of who benefits directly from taxes is an easy game, and it is a good tool of demagoguery. The truth is that all Americans will benefit from a strong, growing, robust economy that will continue when we pass this bill because these policies are working today, and if we continue these tax policies, they are going to continue to grow the economy, producing new jobs and, more importantly, better jobs.  I would like to focus on this issue of who is paying the taxes in this country because that argument vexes me when I hear it demagoged. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from the Wall Street Journal last week that says: ``How to Soak the Rich (the George Bush Way).''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               How To Soak the Rich (the George Bush Way)                           (By Stephen Moore)       With the House and Senate preparing to vote on extending      George W. Bush's investment tax cuts, it's no surprise the      cries against ``tax giveaways to the rich'' grow increasingly      shrill. Just yesterday Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid      charged that the Bush tax plan ``offers next to nothing to      average Americans while giving away the store to multi-     millionaires'' and then fumed that it will ``do much more for      ExxonMobil board members than it will do for ExxonMobil      customers.''       Oh really. New IRS data released last month tell a very      different story: In the aftermath of the Bush investment tax      cuts, the federal income tax burden has substantially shifted      onto the backs of the wealthy. Between 2002 and 2004, tax      payments by those with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) of more      than $200,000 a year, which is roughly 3% of taxpayers,      increased by 19.4%--more than double the 9.3% increase for      all other taxpayers.       Betwen 2001 and 2004 (the most recent data), the percentage      of federal income taxes paid by those with $200,000 incomes      and above has risen to 46.6% from 40.5%. In other words, out      of every 100 Americans, the wealthiest three are now paying      close to the same amount in taxes as the other 97 combined.      The richest income group pays a larger share of the tax      burden than at anytime in the last 30 years with the      exception of the late 1990s--right before the artificially      inflated high tech bubble burst.       Millionaires paid more, too. The tax share paid by      Americans with an income above $1 million a year rose to      17.8% in 2003 from 16.9% in 2002, the year before the capital      gains and dividend tax cuts.       The most astounding result from the IRS data is the deluge      of revenues from the very taxes that were cuts in 2003:      capital gains and dividends. As shown in the nearby chart,      capital gains receipts from 2002-04 have climbed by 79% after      the reduction in the tax rate from 20% to 15%. Dividend tax      receipts are up 35% from 2002 to 2004, even though the      taxable rate fell from 39.6% to 15%. This is as clear      evidence of a Laffer Curve effect as one will find: Lower      rates produced increased revenues.       What explains this surge in tax revenue, especially at the      high end of the income scale? The main factor at play here is      the robust economic expansion, which has led to real income      gains for most tax filers. Higher incomes mean higher tax      payments. Between 2001 and 2004, the percentage of Americans      with an income of more than $200,000 rose from 12.0% to      14.2%. The percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000      a year rose from 40.8% to 44.2%--and that's just in two      years. While these statistics are not inflation-adjusted by      the IRS, price rises were relatively modest during these      years, so adjusting wouldn't alter much.       We can already hear the left objecting that the rich are      paying more taxes simply because they have hoarded all the      income gains, while the middle class and poor wallow in      economic quicksand. But, again, the IRS data tell a more      upbeat story of widespread financial gains for American      families. The slice of the total income pie captured by the      richest 1%, 5% and 10% of Americans is lower today than in      the last years of the Clinton administration.       So how can the media contort these statistics to conclude      that the Bush tax cuts only benefited the affluent? The New      York Times claims that the richest 0.1% got 5,000 times the      tax benefit than those with less than $50,000 of income. That      figure can only be true if one assumes that there were no      economic benefits from the tax cuts whatsoever; and that      lower taxes on income, capital gains and dividends resulted      in no changes in the real economy--not the value of stocks,      not business spending, not employment, not capital flows into      the U.S., not corporate dividend payments, not venture      capital funding--nothing. The underlying assumption of this      static analysis is that tax cuts don't work and that      incentives don't matter.       Of course, in the real world, financial incentives through      tax policy changes matter a great deal in altering economic      behavior. And we now have the evidence to confirm that the      latest round of tax cuts worked--five million new jobs, a 25%      increase in business spending, 4% real economic growth for      three years and a $4 trillion gain in net wealth. So now the      very class-warfare groups who, three years ago, swore that      the tax cuts would tank the economy rather than revive it,      pretend that this robust expansion would have happened      without the investment tax cuts. Many Democrats on Capitol      Hill recite this fairy tale over and over.       One final footnote to this story: Just last week, the      Department of the Treasury released its tax receipt data for      March 2006. Tax collections for the past 12 months have      exploded by 14.4%. We are now on course for a two-year      increase in tax revenues of at least $500 billion, the      largest two-year increase in tax revenue collections after      adjusting for inflation ever recorded. So why are the      leftists complaining so much? George Bush's tax rate cuts      have been among the most successful policies to soak the rich      in American history.
