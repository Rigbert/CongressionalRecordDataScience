I am truly offended by it.  When I heard the announcement that Hershey, one of America's logo companies, right, was going to move production to Mexico, they are already making those big kisses there, I guess. I did not know that. When you think of all the dairy jobs in Pennsylvania, you think of all of the factory jobs, you think of all of the distribution jobs. I mean, this is a massive American company. It was America. It was America. And so now we are going to let that go? And then they dumbed down the recipe so the chocolate is not as good? They put more wax in it or whatever. Come on.  Do not take the American people for fools. We understand what is going on, and we know that we are being sold out. America is being sold out from under us, and the American people do not like it at all. They expect us to stand up for them.  So it is just a joy to have you here, to be a part of this effort, and to say that the Peru and Colombian free trade agreement that is supposed to come through here on fast track, again, it is more just of NAFTA. It is more of the same. We should not approve it.  But what has surprised me the most, as much as the American people have been hurt by NAFTA, if we go back, what has shocked me, what I never expected or anticipated, was all the casualties across the continent in terms of job loss and people hurt. I never thought I would see the people of Latin America rise up in Mexico, in Brazil, in these massive demonstrations. That has literally humbled me as a citizen of the continent to think that the poorest among us, many have been risking their lives, to say the pain on them is even greater than on us. Their wages have been cut in half. They are losing their little stakeholds in Mexico, for example, and they are just being thrown off their land, and yet they are going to Mexico City and demonstrating by the millions.  I never anticipated that that would happen, and I think what is going to happen here, those folks in Wall Street and other places thought they were going to be so smart. I think you are going to see another generation come behind us. They are going to create a charter for the people of the Americas that we should have created. Some of us wanted to, but we did not have the votes here, and I think that the backlash on NAFTA and on these kinds of free trade agreements that cause so much harm, I think Wall Street has only begun to see what is going to happen.  So I put my faith in the people, I put my faith in the institutions of good governance, and I hope that, I do not know how harshly God will judge those who have done so much harm, but it did not have to happen.                              {time}  2030  We don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past, so I thank my dear colleagues here this evening, Congressman Michaud and Congressman Hare and Congressman Lynch and Congressman Ellison, for understanding what it is going to take to turn this continent and our values to put the values forward that were the ideals.  When I think about John Kennedy and his Alliance For Progress, and you go down in Latin America and in every home there is a picture of John Kennedy because he cared for them. He cared for them first. I thought how did we go so far? Why couldn't we get a majority here? What was wrong with us back in the 1990s, that is, that we couldn't put that together? I see a rebirth of that spirit of idealism here this evening, and I know that the continent is waiting for us.  I thank my dear colleagues for sponsoring this Special Order this evening and for helping us speak on behalf of the people who expect us to be here for them.
