President, reserving the right to object, I shall not object, but if I may have the attention of the majority leader.  The question was asked earlier by the majority leader, and I am willing to go forward on my amendment, following the Senator from Arizona, under the same time agreement. I just had a chance to read the agreement made with the Senator from Arizona. I advise the distinguished majority leader that I am happy to follow him with a similar agreement.
