President, this amendment would create a $3.1 billion reserve fund to boost student financial aid programs, programs such as the LEAP program, leveraging opportunities, a partnership with the Federal Government to provide resources for young people of modest means to go on to college, the work-study program, the TRIO program, the GEAR UP program, and the graduate assistance program.  Every time we talk about our economy and talk about our future, we inherently come back to education and higher education as a key. This budget does not fund these programs sufficiently.  This proposal has been embraced and supported by the Student Aid Alliance, a coalition of more than 60 organizations representing students, colleges, and universities.  At a time when costs of colleges are going out of sight, when literally hundreds of thousands of young people are not able to go to school or must defer their chances to go to school, we have to do more. I hope we can support the amendment.  At this point, let me say I will be prepared to accept a voice vote at the conclusion of the debate. I urge support for this amendment.  I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Sarbanes as a cosponsor.
