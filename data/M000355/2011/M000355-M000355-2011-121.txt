 Our friends on the other side are not only objecting to voting on the President's original jobs proposal but his jobs proposal as modified.  The practical result, however, of voting for cloture on the motion to proceed, rather than going on and voting on the bill, as the President has asked us to do on 12 occasions out on the campaign trail, is we will not be able to proceed to one of the things that is rare here--we actually have a bipartisan agreement to go forward on these important trade agreements, pass them tomorrow night, and then have the President of South Korea address a joint session of Congress. South Korea is one of our most important allies--probably the most important ally in Asia. Why would we not just want to vote on the proposal tonight? I am sorry we will not be able to do that.  I will continue to look for opportunities to give the President the vote he has asked for repeatedly--not a procedural vote but a real vote on the matter he requested.  I object.
