President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her excellent work and concur with her remarks.  Mr. President, you cannot look the public in the eye and say you are going to drill in ANWR and then ship this oil to China or one of the highest bidders around the world. That is, in my view, exactly what would happen without the Wyden-Talent legislation that is going to be offered now.  Under the legislation, the Secretary could adopt oil lease terms that ensure what is described as the receipt of fair market value.
