Speaker, the gentleman raised a point about the border guards, and I think most of them are probably essential employees. It occurs to me, however, that both of us have discussed this and we have had what, I think, is somewhat an unfortunate incident; not only having employees being told to go home, but the implication that they are not essential.  I think the American public should know that essential is a technical term which simply means that the employees who are necessary for the defense of the Nation or public safety or immediate health are determined to be, under the law, employees that we can keep on board, even though funding authorization has not been approved.  Frankly, I perceive all of our Federal employees as essential. That is to say they are important to carry out functions adopted by this Congress and carried out by the executive department. I think we ought to make that comment to all of them, so that some of them do not believe that the tasks they perform are not important. They are critically important even though they may not be in the category that if they are not on the job public safety and life and health may be jeopardized.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his leadership on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's interpretation of the word ``essential'' and would concur with the assessment of such.
