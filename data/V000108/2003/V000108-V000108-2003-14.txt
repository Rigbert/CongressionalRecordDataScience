Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I thank my chairman very much. I, too, would begin by thanking individuals; and I do want to thank members of the staff, because we would not be here without this excellent product and their help.  I do want to mention specifically Rob Pace, Leslie Phillips, Tracey La Turner, Kenny Craft, Peder Maarbjerg, Scott Burnison, Dennis Kerns, Kevin Cook, Rob Nabors, and Bob Schmidt. They have all worked very diligently, very hard; and, again, we would not be here without their very diligent and intelligent work.  Secondly, I must thank my chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson). While this is the first time he has brought an energy and water bill to the floor, you would not know it from the work product. I have had the pleasure of serving with a number of very distinguished, wonderful gentlemen who have produced good work products. I must tell you this now is the fifth energy and water bill I have managed for the minority on the floor. It is by far the best bill we have ever brought to the floor, and I would ask my colleagues to support it.  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) has been eminently fair. He has been trusting of the minority, he has been professional in all of his dealings, he has been decisive in his decisions, and the Department of Energy and other agencies within this bill will be better for his actions. He is a friend, and he has made the last 6 months of working on this bill fun. This is a good bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
