 President, I want to start by complimenting Senators Warner, McCain and Graham and the work that they did to improve this bill, particularly in two areas.  First, our colleagues did the right thing by rejecting the attempt by the administration to reinterpret, by statute, Common Article III of the Geneva Conventions. That would have been an enormous mistake--and an invitation for other countries to define for themselves what the Geneva Conventions require.  Second, our colleagues were right to reject the use of secret evidence in military commissions. Such a proposal is not consistent with American jurisprudence, and would not have satisfied the requirements of the Supreme Court decision in Hamdan.  Overall, the bill provides a much better framework for trying unlawful enemy combatants than under the flawed order issued by the President. All this is positive, and our three colleagues deserve credit for their good work.  But the bill contains a significant flaw. It limits the right of habeas corpus in a manner that is probably unconstitutional. Don't take my word for it. Listen to the words of a conservative Republican, Kenneth Starr, who used to sit on this nation's second highest court, and is now one of the country's leading appellate advocates, in a letter written to Senator Specter earlier this week:       Article 1, section 9, clause 2 of the United States      Constitution provides that ``[t]he privilege of the Writ of      Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of      Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.''
