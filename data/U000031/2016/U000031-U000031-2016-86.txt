Speaker, I submit the following exchange of letters.                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2016.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R.      4981, the ``Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and      Modernization Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on      Energy and Commerce and in addition to the Committee on the      Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with us on      provisions in H.R. 4981 that fall within the Rule X      jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to      discharge our Committee from further consideration of this      bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor      for consideration.       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual      understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4981 at      this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject      matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our      Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as      this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may      address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our      Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an      appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks      that you support any such request.       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming      this understanding with respect to H.R. 4981, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the Congressional Record during Floor      consideration of H.R. 4981.           Sincerely,                                                    Bob Goodlatte,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                                                           House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2016.     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter      regarding H.R. 4891, the ``Opioid Use Disorder Treatment      Expansion and Modernization Act.''       I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill,      and I agree that your decision will in no way diminish or      alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with      respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future      jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in      the bill or similar legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 4891 on      the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                          ____________________
