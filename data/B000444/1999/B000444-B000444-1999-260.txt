  What I suggest is I think we are very close to being able to work this out. I commit to the Senator we will attempt to do that. Obviously, if we do not, he is entitled to a vote on this, but I am inclined to believe we can do this and accept it to his satisfaction in the managers' amendment. But we will have between now and Monday evening to try to work that out, if he is willing to do that?
