FITZGERALD. No, and that is certainly not clear from the language. I cite section 1(f) of your language where you define the runway design plan to include related facilities, which I take to include related roadway improvements. So I don't know how many Senators want airport improvement funds drained from their States to go for a road in the Chicago area which would be part of this overall O'Hare expansion plan. That road happens to be a good idea if they do it in the right way. If they do it in the wrong way, it will take up 20 percent of the business and an industrial park in the city of Elk Grove, the largest industrial park in the country. Twenty percent of that would be taken out.
