Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 441) to congratulate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Discovery crew of Commander Eileen Collins, Pilot Jim Kelly, Mission Specialist Charlie Camarda, Mission Specialist Wendy Lawrence, Mission Specialist Soichi Noguchi, Mission Specialist Steve Robinson, and Mission Specialist Andy Thomas on the successful completion of their 14 day test flight to the International Space Station for the first step of the Vision for Space Exploration, begun from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 26, 2005, and completed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 9, 2005. This historical mission represented a great step forward into the new beginning of the Second Space Age, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 441       Whereas the Space Shuttle Return-to-Flight is the first      step in the Nation's Vision for Space Exploration;       Whereas the Space Shuttle Discovery Crew completed three      highly successful extra-vehicular activity spacewalks;       Whereas the STS flight 114 accomplished the first in-flight      heat shield repairs on the Space Shuttle;       Whereas the Discovery crew delivered more than 6 tons of      needed supplies and equipment to the International Space      Station;       Whereas Discovery's spacewalkers removed a failed Space      Station gyroscope and replaced it with a new one, restoring      full capability of the Station's attitude control system;       Whereas the Discovery mission successfully used three      different Canadian robotic extensions to conduct spacewalks      and to survey the Shuttle: the Shuttle Canadarm; the Space      Station Canadarm2; and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System;       Whereas the crew of the Discovery experienced ``virtual''      visits from leaders of 2 nations, the President of the United      States and the Prime Minister of Japan; and       Whereas Commander Eileen Collins led the crew of 7 and      guided the Discovery vehicle through an unprecedented back      flip maneuver: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) commends the entire National Aeronautics and Space      Administration team and community, who provided invaluable      technical support and leadership for the historic mission of      Space Shuttle Discovery STS flight 114;       (2) commends Commander Eileen Collins, for being the first      female space shuttle commander and a role model for all;       (3) commends Col. Jim Kelly, pilot of STS 114, for his      second flight aboard the Space Shuttle and his participation      in robotic arm operations;       (4) commends Charlie Camarda, mission specialist, a      ``rookie'' who performed like a veteran by transferring the      multipurpose logistics module from the International Space      Station to the Space Shuttle;       (5) commends Wendy Lawrence, mission specialist, for      outstanding skill in operating Canadarm2;       (6) commends Soichi Noguchi of Japan, mission specialist, a      ``rookie'' who was a ``spacewalker'' for the inspections and      repairs of the Space Shuttle;       (7) commends Steve Robinson, mission specialist, for his      outstanding skill as a ``spacewalker,'' who enhanced and      repaired Discovery and the International Space Station; and       (8) commends Andy Thomas, mission specialist, who performed      the laser checks on the leading edge of the Space Shuttle by      the operation of Canadarm2.                              {time}  1615
