Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) for managing the bill for the Democrats and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for his work in crafting this legislation. I especially want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) for authoring this very important piece of legislation to make sure to the greatest extent possible that U.S. professionals--of all ages--who are deployed abroad as part of the Peace Corps, one of the finest U.S. initiatives ever created, get the best possible protection and security. We need to provide them protection, that is second to none, so that they can be safe and secure.                              {time}  1545  Obviously, when people are deployed to dangerous areas, there are risks that are associated with that commitment. Still, it is up to this Congress, the State Department, and the administration, to ensure that no stone is left unturned in trying to make sure that Peace Corps volunteers are safe and secure in that environment  No bill comes to this floor without a tremendous amount of work by very competent staff, and Peter Smith has helped to draft this legislation. I want to thank him especially for his fine work and his skill and expertise in drafting this bill, as well as Paul Oostburg for his work on it as well.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 4060.
