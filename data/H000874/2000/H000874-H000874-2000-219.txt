Chairman, I move to strike the last word. I rise to enter into a colloquy with our distinguished chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), who is standing in for our distinguished subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter).  Mr. Chairman, is the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) prepared to enter into that colloquy with me?
