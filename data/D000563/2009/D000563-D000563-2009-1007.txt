President, the people who work in public health are responsible for some of the most important jobs that protect the lives and health of ordinary Americans. The scope of public health includes preventing the spread of communicable diseases and pandemics, managing the health system's response to biological and chemical attacks, fighting food-borne illnesses, assisting communities in preparing for disasters, and promoting best health practices.  The recent outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 virus reminds us how much we depend on the people who work in public health. This virus has infected thousands of people and caused nearly a hundred deaths worldwide. The American people have looked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their State and local health departments to collect data, monitor the threat, provide accurate information, and prepare to respond if the situation worsens. But even when a pandemic or other widespread threat is not imminent, the public health workforce remains on the front lines in promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic disease.  Our ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from a pandemic or other health challenges depends largely on a strong pipeline of public health professionals. Unfortunately, a critical--and growing--shortage of public health workers is putting our nation at risk.  The Association of Schools of Public Health recently reported that there were 50,000 fewer public health workers in 2000 than there were in 1980. In my home State of Illinois, the average Illinois Department of Public Health worker is 48 years old, and 39 percent of the staff will be eligible to retire within 5 years. Compounding this problem is the fact that 13 percent of agency positions are vacant, and when a new hire is found, the average age is 41. The ``graying'' workforce and weak pipeline of new public health graduates are problems across all levels of government. Nearly half of the federal employees in occupations critical to U.S. biodefense will be eligible to retire by 2012.  We cannot stay on the same trajectory in the future. We are not educating enough people in public health to replace retiring public health workers, and the salaries for those who do work in public health disciplines are not competitive with comparable employment in the private sector. The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials reports that in 2004, most of the approximately 6,400 graduates from accredited schools of public health took jobs in the private sector.  I am pleased to introduce the Public Health Workforce Development Act of 2009 today to help address this challenge. This legislation provides several common-sense solutions to develop a strong pipeline of public health professionals. This bill would provide scholarships to students going into public health and provide loan repayment for current public health workers in exchange for a commitment to additional years of service in public health.  The legislation also encourages states to set up their own public health training programs and creates a scholarship program for mid-career professionals to maintain or upgrade their training. Finally, it creates an online clearinghouse of public health jobs available in the Federal Government. Together, these programs will help attract young people to a career in public health and give current public health professionals incentives to remain in the field in the long-term  Our health care system today focuses too much on treating sickness, at the expense of preserving wellness. As the process of health reform moves forward, two key concerns are improving health care quality, while holding health care costs down. To do this, we need to focus on wellness, preventive care, and effective management of chronic conditions, all of which are hallmarks of the public health system. This bill will help maintain a strong and effective public health system by alleviating the dangerous shortage of public health workers  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1143       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Workforce      Development Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The ability of the public health system to prevent,      respond to, and recover from bioterrorism, acute outbreaks of      infectious diseases, or other health threats and emergencies,      and to prevent and reduce chronic disease, depends upon the      existence of adequate numbers of well-trained public health      professionals in Federal, State, local, and tribal public      health departments and health centers.       (2) The public health system has an aging staff nearing      retirement with no clear pipeline of highly-skilled and      capable employees to fill the void, with the average age of      the State public health workforce at 47 years.       (3) Retirement rates in some State public health agencies      were as high as 20 percent as of June 2007, and projected to      be as high as 45 percent in 2009.       (4) The ratio of public health workers to the population      has dropped from 219 per 100,000 in 1980 to 158 per 100,000      in 2000, while responsibilities of such workers have      continued to expand.       (5) Public health nurses comprise the largest segment of      the public health workforce. A study by the Institute of      Medicine in 2003 identified nursing as facing one of the most      severe shortages of public health workers. The average age of      public health nurses is nearly 50 years, with the leaders of      State public health nursing averaging more than 30 years of      service. In one State nearly 40 percent of the public health      nursing workforce was eligible for retirement as of June      2007.       (6) According to the Association of State and Territorial      Health Officials, most of the approximately 6,400 graduates      from accredited schools of public health took jobs in the      private sector in 2004. The Bureau of Labor Statistics      projects that there will be an increase in private sector      demand for highly-educated graduates in scientific fields      during the 10-year period ending in 2017. Public health      agencies will have difficulty competing for those highly-     skilled scientists.       (7) As of June 2007, approximately 42 percent of the      epidemiology workforce in State and territorial health      departments lacked formal academic training in epidemiology.      States have reported that approximately 47 percent more      epidemiologists are needed to adequately prevent and control      avian influenza and other emerging diseases.       (8) The Partnership for Public Service reports that in the      field of microbiology, there are more than 4 times as many      full-time permanent employees over age 40 as under age 40 at      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among full-     time permanent employees with medical backgrounds at the      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and      Drug Administration, there are 3 times as many employees over      40 years of age as under 40.       (9) More than 50 percent of States cite the lack of      qualified individuals or individuals willing to relocate as      being a major barrier to preparedness. A study conducted by      the Health Resources and Services Association reported      difficulty with recruiting more educated, skilled public      health providers to work in traditionally medically      underserved areas, such as rural populations. Public health      agencies continue to face an unmet need for public health      workers who are bilingual and culturally competent.       (10) Lack of access to advanced education, including      baccalaureate nursing and graduate studies, is a significant      barrier to upgrading the existing public health workforce,      particularly in rural areas.
