President, I will just speak very briefly. I have spoken many, many times about the dangers of landmines, especially indiscriminate antipersonnel landmines. I was very proud when the Senate went on record by a two-thirds vote supporting my moratorium on our own use of landmines. That is something designed to give the United States the moral leadership in arguing with other nations around the world to eventually ban the use of indiscriminate antipersonnel landmines.  It was, in my 21 years here, one of those rare occasions when people across the ideological spectrum joined together on one major issue, in this case one of the biggest humanitarian issues possible, but also something that could affect defense policies of nations well into the next century.  Earlier today I spoke of the dangers of landmines in the former Yugoslavia.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an article regarding the debate in Congress on landmines, written by Bob Kemper of the Washington Bureau of the Chicago Tribune, dated yesterday, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 27, 1995]Congress Debates Land Mine Ban--110 Million Mines Planted in 60 Nations                               Spark Outcry                            (By Bob Kemper)       They are trash, the debris of war, like burned-out tanks      and bombed-out buildings. But long after peace treaties are      signed and soldiers go home, land mines go on killing.       Bosnia may provide the latest example. There are an      estimated 6 million anti-armor and anti-personnel mines      there, only 1 million of which are mapped, according to the      United Nations. UN peacekeepers already have suffered 100      casualties from mines in Bosnia.       Killing or maiming 70 people a day worldwide--26,000 each      year--land mines are especially devastating to some of the      world's poorest countries, according to the State Department      and humanitarian groups. And with 110 million mines still      buried in more than 60 countries, an international outcry has      risen and is echoing in the halls of Congress.       Led by Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.), Congress is taking the      extraordinary step of ordering the Pentagon to unilaterally      disarm itself of anti-personnel mines, devices that in one      form or another have been in the U.S. arsenal since the Civil      War.       The House and Senate approved a provision in a foreign      operations bill that would give the Pentagon three years to      learn to fight without anti-personnel mines.       A one-year moratorium, which later could be extended, then      would be placed on the use of anti-personnel mines by      American forces, except along international borders or in      clearly marked fields.       ``The U.S. government ought to set a moral example, to lead      the world to see the menace of land mines in a clear light,''      said Evans, who pushed the proposal in the House while Sen.      Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) worked the Senate.       No one is blaming the U.S. military for what the State      Department dubbed ``the global land mine crisis.'' American      forces routinely use ``smart mines'' that self-destruct or      turn themselves off after a month or so in the ground. When      they do use long-life mines in the field, such as the      claymore, the mines are typically removed as the soldiers      withdraw.       However, Evans and Leahy say that by disarming its      military, America sets an example and can prod other      countries to follow suit.       Evans and Leahy used a similar strategy three years ago      when they pushed for a moratorium on the U.S. export of      mines. Two dozen nations have since followed the U.S. lead in      banning or restricting land mine exports. The most recent,      France, went further this fall when it announced that it also      would stop making mines and destroy those already stockpiled.       Though launched by liberal Democrats, the ban gained new      authority on Capitol Hill when pro-defense Democrats, like      Virginia Sen. Charles S. Robb, and 25 Republicans, including      Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), backed it.       ``In Vietnam I had a number of my men killed or wounded by      various types of mines or booby traps,'' said Robb, who had      led a Marine platoon. ``I have visited around the world, in      combat areas, literally tens of      thousands of amputees who were victims of mines and lots of those folks      are just children, children who were playing.''       Ban proponents say they are singling out the anti-personnel      mine because, unlike other implements of war, it keeps      killing long after the fighting ends. In Denmark, some areas      are still unusable because of mines planted there during      World War II.       Many of the 200-plus types of anti-personnel mines      manufactured around the world are designed to maim rather      than kill because a severely wounded soldier is a bigger      drain on enemy logistics and medical resources than a dead      soldier. Those same mines, ban proponents argue, are      transforming farmers in developing countries into financial      and emotional drains on their families and communities.       Still, the Pentagon is fighting to keep the mines.       The Army does not want to give up a weapon on which its      field commanders have long relied. Anti-personnel mines are      the perfect weapon for defending battlefield positions,      protecting economic assets such as power plants, slowing      enemy advances or detouring enemy troops into ``killing      zones.''       Worried about the effect on the Army, Senate Armed Services      Chairman Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) and Sen. John Warner (R-     Va.), a senior member of that panel, plotted with House      Republicans to kill the ban. They intended to place a      provision in the defense authorization bill giving the      Pentagon veto power over the moratorium. However, Warner      said, he dropped that plan after being lobbied by Leahy.       ``Let him have his shot at it,'' Warner said.       One remaining obstacle is the difficulty congressional      leaders have had getting the foreign operations bill to the      White House. The House and Senate approved the bill in early      November, but remain divided over a separate abortion      amendment, preventing the bill from moving forward.       Momentum toward a land mine ban has been building since a      year ago, when President Clinton called for the eventual      elimination of land mines. Three months later, the United      Nations approved a U.S. resolution urging action. Last      summer, 280 members of the National Conference of Catholic      Bishops meeting in Chicago issued a statement singling out      land mines as an indiscriminate killer whose production      should cease.       Meanwhile, hundreds of humanitarian groups have spent      months--and in some cases years--cataloging land mine      atrocities and lobbying for a worldwide ban on the      manufacture and use of land mines.       But this fall, the push for a ban fizzled when 42 nations      at a UN-sponsored conference on conventional weapons failed      to reach agreement.       ``I don't think there were two minutes of serious      discussion * * * on a total ban on land mines,'' said Stephen      Goose, program director of Human Rights Watch's Arms Project      and a delegate to the Vienna meeting.       Contrary to Clinton's call for the elimination of mines,      many anti-mine groups say, the administration is actually      perpetuating the use of mines by pushing for expanded use of      ``smart mines'' rather than backing a total ban.       ``There is no technological solution'' to the mine problem,      Goose said. ``A self-destructing or self-deactivating mine is      still an indiscriminate mine. It will still deny the fields      to the farmer.''       Evans said he hopes Congress's action will redirect the      administration.       ``The President is far too cautious,'' Evans said. ``We're      encouraging them to be bolder, to demonstrate leadership in      encouraging other countries'' to give up mines altogether.       But Robert Sherman, of the U.S. Arms Control and      Disarmament Agency, defended the administration's push for      advanced mines and other measures short of a ban, including      requiring manufacturers to put at least eight grams of metal      into each plastic mine so that they can be more easily      detected. Such steps are a much more realistic way to protect      civilians, he said.       ``We know there will not be a total ban in 1996 or 1997 or      whenever,'' Sherman said. ``If mines are your concern, you      say this is bad. If people are your concern, you say this is      good.''       Anti-mine advocates argue that ``smart mines'' often fail      to self-destruct, compounding--rather than solving--what is      already a daunting problem globally: detection and removal of      mines.       Some anti-personnel mines sell for as little as $2 to $3      and hundreds of them can be planted in seconds by special      artillery or trucks. In contrast, it takes 100 times longer      to remove a mine at a cost of up to $1,000 per mine. And      that's if the mine can be found.       Many modern mines are as small as a can of shoe polish and      made of plastic. Their only metal part is the size of a      thumbtack, making detection by the 1940s-style minesweepers,      still in use today, nearly impossible.       Also, for every mine removed, 20 more are planted. In 1993,      the UN estimated that 100,000 land mines were found and      removed at a cost of $70 million. During that time, 2 million      more mines were laid. Even if no more mines were planted      after today, experts said, it would take decades and at least      $33 billion to clear those still in the ground.       The State Department and the Vietnam Veterans of America,      in separate studies, found that mines left behind after wars      have taken a devastating toll on civilians. Once fertile      fields are now too dangerous to plow. Cattle are killed or      maimed. Roads and major utilities hampered by mines make      producing and shipping goods difficult.       ``Without a clear statement by the U.S. that demonstrates      that we are opposed to their use, other nations will continue      to sell and deploy them,'' Evans said. ``This legislation,      like the moratorium on exports, calls a `time out' and puts      us in the leadership position to challenge other nations to      work with us and solve this global crisis.''
