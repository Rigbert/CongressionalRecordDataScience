 This is my moment also to add my voice to the other Members here who have celebrated and expressed gratitude to Chairman Wolf for his years of service to the people of the United States and this great Republic.  I don't think I will ever hear the word ``Darfur'' and not see Frank Wolf's face in my mind's eye. I don't think that I will ever read articles that deal with child hunger, wherever it might exist, in some of the most forgotten places on Earth, and not think of Frank Wolf.  I will always remember, sir, your gentlemanly manner, your great passion. I will always recall the work that you have done to stand up for those who speak for liberty in places, forgotten corners in China, for religious leaders who have been suppressed around the world. And what a great patriot you are and a gentleman who can work across the aisle and whose word is always gold.  I thank you very, very much for your support on this amendment. We wish you Godspeed in the years ahead. I know all my colleagues join me in wishing you well and thank you for your exemplary service.  I yield back the balance of my time.
