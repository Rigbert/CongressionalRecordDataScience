Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Hammond Public Library throughout its 100 years of service to the Northwest Indiana community. As the citizens of Hammond and all of Northwest Indiana celebrate the centennial of the Hammond Library, we are reminded of the dedication and valiant efforts that have been made to incorporate education and community leadership to the region.  It was in 1903 that the first library board of Hammond was appointed. This board included Dr. W.F. Howat as the first president, Mr. J.G. lbach as the vice president, as well as many other distinguished appointed members. In 1904, the first library was moved into its own room in the Chicago Telephone Building. Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who at the time was contributing to the funding of public libraries across the nation, donated $27,000 to construct a new building for the library. On July 8, 1905, the library dubbed "Old Main," was dedicated as the first fully constructed library building in the area and it served the community well for 62 years.  In 1910, the first branch office was established in a room above a fire station, and it was known as Branch No. 1. Three more branches were established in the next 12 years and the library deposited many collections of books in local department stores, the State Bank of Hammond, and also in private homes. Throughout the years, additional branches were opened to provide books and a community gathering space for the citizens of Hammond. The Hansen Branch was named after the first librarian of the Hammond Public Library, Ms. Marie Hansen. The branches continued to be named after influential leaders that helped make the dream of the library a reality.  After a time of change in the community and lack of resources, some branches were forced to close. But because of the city's strong encouragement and need for the library, they renovated the main library, as well as other branches. No matter what challenges face the community, the Hammond Public Library continues to provide many important resources for the community including books, classes, summer reading programs for children, and many community outreach programs.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Hammond Public Library as well as its staff and community leaders on their 100th anniversary. Their many great accomplishments and service to the Hammond community will forever be cherished and commended.                          ____________________
