Two years ago, Congress took important action to update and modernize this system for the 21st century by passing the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The Leahy-Smith act has made key improvements to the patent system, strengthening it for the long term. Unfortunately, there are bad actors who are misusing the system by unfairly targeting small businesses and others with lawsuits that are often based on low-quality patents. That is why I joined on Monday with Senator Lee, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Klobuchar to introduce legislation that will build upon the success of the Leahy-Smith act and curb abuses by so-called patent trolls.  The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act will take important steps to rein in the most egregious abuses of the patent system. It will improve transparency of patent ownership so that trolls cannot hide behind shell corporations and obscure the true owner of the patents that are being asserted. It will help customers who are sued simply for using a product that they purchased by allowing the case against them to be stayed while the product's manufacturer litigates the suit. The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act will also take steps to crack down on abuses of demand letters that are all too often sent to small businesses simply to extort monetary settlements.  When small businesses in Vermont are threatened with lawsuits simply for using document scanners in their offices or offering wi-fi service to their customers, we can all agree that the patent system is not being used as intended. I thank Senator Lee and our cosponsors for joining me in this important effort and applaud Chairman Goodlatte for the work he is doing in the House to address this problem. I look forward to working with all members of the Judiciary Committee, as well as with the House, to pass bipartisan and bicameral legislation that will crack down on these abuses while at the same time preserving the parts of the patent system that have made it the greatest in the world and an engine for job creation.                          ____________________
