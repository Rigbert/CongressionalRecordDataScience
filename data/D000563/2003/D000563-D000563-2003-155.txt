This is what my amendment sought to achieve, so I am going to withdraw this amendment and thank both Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes for their cooperation and urge them to join me in offering an amendment to the Higher Education Act which codifies in law this new policy that the Sallie Mae agency has now decided to implement.  There is no reason responsible college students, having paid off their loans, should be penalized because Sallie Mae refuses to notify all three major credit bureaus in America. I am glad with this letter they have decided to change their policy. I hope at a later time to offer this amendment to the Higher Education Act and thank the members of the committee for their cooperation in this regard.
