Speaker, for 36 years, agriculture in Lucas County, Ohio, has had a friend in Norm Moll. As 2003's harvest approaches, it seems a fitting time to look back on Norm's service with the county office of the Cooperative Extension Service, from which he has now retired.  Norm Moll's life has been spent in agriculture, from his boyhood on a livestock farm in Fulton County. He holds graduate and undergraduate degrees in horticulture, and has studied biometrics and the marketing of produce. He served as the chief of the Lucas County Extension office since 1980. Under his extremely capable tenure, the office developed the Agricultural Business Enhancement Center, Master Gardener initiative, gypsy moth suppression to save the region's oak savannah, urban horticulture opportunities, and development projects with 4-H, community garden clubs, greenhouses, and the agricultural community. His expertise was sought by people far afield, and methodical planning was his hallmark. His contributions to agricultural research and development leading to valued-added agriculture include: rebirth of the Toledo Farmers Market; innovations for new crops, tomatoes, vegetables and livestock; and initiation of the ``glasshouse.com'' website as a new marketing site of our region's greenhouse industry.  Now in retirement, Norm Moll will have the time to devote to his own horticultural pursuits. His Toledo, Ohio yard will bear the fruits of his labor as our community learns to move forward without his effective quiet countenance. We wish for him a retirement full of all those things he most enjoys and with those for whom he cares. We extend a deep and sincere thank you to Norm for his life of service to our country and community.                          ____________________
