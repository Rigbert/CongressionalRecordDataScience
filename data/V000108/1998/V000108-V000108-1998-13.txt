Speaker, reclaiming my time, most of the bipartisan language. So, this was not a partisan issue.  The administration has not acted and that is why we are here tonight. The Commerce Department has not initiated its own investigation. The Trade Rep's office has not initiated its own investigation. Neither has the Commerce Department or Trade Rep office called for countervailing duties. No one in the administration has pressured the European Union to discuss sharing the burden of the financial crisis in Russia or Asia.  Mr. Speaker, I will close my portion of the remarks by indicating that this is not the best all of us can do collectively. The best we can do collectively is to send this back to the committee of jurisdiction and tell them to do better on Wednesday.
