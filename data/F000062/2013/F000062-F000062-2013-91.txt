 President, I rise today with Senator Rubio to submit a resolution recommending the posthumous award of the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Rafael Peralta, United States Marine Corps.  My friend and colleague from California, Representative Duncan Hunter, will introduce this resolution in the House and I am proud to work with him on this important matter.  Our resolution recognizes that Sergeant Peralta's courageous and selfless actions in combat saved the lives of his fellow Marines.  Our resolution concurs with the Marine Corps and the Department of the Navy that Sergeant Peralta's actions are in the spirit and tradition of the Medal of Honor; maintains that, consistent with previous Medal of Honor awards, the eyewitness accounts confirm that Sergeant Peralta deliberately pulled the grenade into his body and that eyewitness accounts should be the leading and deciding factor in evaluating Sergeant Peralta's Medal of Honor nomination; and recommends that Sergeant Peralta be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.  Sergeant Peralta was a true American hero.  He was born in Mexico and immigrated as a young child with his family to San Diego, CA.  He embraced his new life and anxiously awaited the opportunity to serve his adopted country and give something back.  In fact, on the very day he received permanent legal resident status in the United States, he joined the United States Marine Corps.  Sergeant Peralta deployed to Iraq as a scout team leader assigned to Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment.  In November 2004, Sergeant Peralta and his battalion were involved in intense house-to-house fighting in an effort to reclaim Fallujah, Iraq from insurgents.  After clearing scores of houses for days, he asked to join an under-strength squad.  Upon entering their seventh house of the day, Sergeant Peralta's squad came into direct contact with insurgents and he was hit in the back of the head by a fragment from a ricocheted bullet.  As insurgents fled the house they threw a grenade through a window which landed near Sergeant Peralta's head. Despite his wounds, he was able to reach for the grenade and pull it under his body to absorb the blast.  He was killed instantly but his sacrifice saved the lives of his fellow Marines.  For his selflessness and heroism, Sergeant Peralta was recommended for the Medal of Honor by his local commanders, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Now, the historical standard for awarding the Medal of Honor is two eyewitness accounts. Sergeant Peralta has seven.  Seven eyewitnesses gave sworn statements attesting that Sergeant Peralta smothered the grenade and placed it under his body in order to absorb the explosion.  Four of those accounts, taken independently, state that he pulled the grenade to his body with his right arm.  Nevertheless, an independent panel formed by then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates determined that Sergeant Peralta could not have deliberately pulled the grenade to his body because he was immediately incapacitated after being shot in the head.  Secretary Gates agreed with its conclusions and Sergeant Peralta was awarded the Navy Cross instead of the Medal of Honor.  Yet, despite the panel's findings, the citation for the Navy Cross agrees with the eyewitness accounts and states that ``without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety, Sergeant Peralta reached out and pulled the grenade to his body, absorbing the brunt of the blast and shielding fellow Marines only feet away.''  In fact, his family has refused to accept the Navy Cross and has worked tirelessly to ensure that Sergeant Peralta's actions are not forgotten and properly recognized with the Medal of Honor.  In 2012, Representative Hunter submitted new and previously unconsidered evidence, including combat video and an independent pathology report, to the Department of the Navy.  Dr. Vincent DiMaio of San Antonio, Texas volunteered to review the case for Sergeant Peralta's family and submitted the report.  He concluded that, in all medical probability, Sergeant Peralta was not immediately incapacitated after being shot, and, in fact, reached for the grenade and pulled it under his body.  After a new review of the evidence, the Department of the Navy once again recommended Sergeant Peralta for the Medal of Honor.  Unfortunately, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta denied the request.  I have the utmost respect for the judgment of Secretary Gates and Secretary Panetta. On this matter, I just take a different view and I urge our new Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, to take another look at this matter.  I do not take the awarding of the Medal of Honor lightly. Indeed, the Medal of Honor is our country's highest and most prestigious military award.  It says something to me that seven eyewitnesses verified that Sergeant Peralta absorbed the blast of the grenade and saved the lives of his fellow Marines.  It says something to me that the citation for the Navy Cross backs up the eyewitness accounts.  It says something to me that Sergeant Peralta was recommended for the award by his local commanders, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  It says something to me that the Secretary of the Navy has even publicly stated that he believes Sergeant Peralta deserves the Medal of Honor.  Sergeant Peralta gave his life for our country and his fellow Marines. His actions in combat and the evidence make it clear to me that he has gone above and beyond the call of duty and is deserving of the Medal of Honor.  In the days before his death, he wrote to his brother saying ``I'm proud to be a Marine, a U.S. Marine, and to defend and protect the freedom and Constitution of America. You should be proud too of being an American citizen.''  Let us honor this American hero and show our pride in being Americans by passing this resolution.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
