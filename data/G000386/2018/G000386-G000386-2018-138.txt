 President, I thank my colleague who spoke very highly of the qualifications of Mr. Northey to be Under Secretary at the Department of Agriculture. I may say just a little bit about his qualifications, but I want to spend most of my time expressing my thoughts to my colleagues in the Senate, and to Senator Cruz primarily, on what I think about the argument over RINs being an impediment to some refineries operating efficiently, going into bankruptcy, or other problems they have.  Senator Cruz has said there are some things that could be put together to help this situation. I will name three of them that I think would work, and then I will say why I disagree with the Senator from Texas about the RINs issue and why he thinks that is a solution to it and why I feel it is not a solution to it.  First of all, my colleague from Texas said there is a problem with Wall Street speculators. I don't know whether that happens every day, but it happens sometimes, and it is something that should be taken care of. I recognized that back in November of 2013, when I wrote a letter on that very subject urging the regulators to take a position on that.  I think greater transparency of this whole market would be very good as well. I think that is a possibility. That is something the Senator and I have discussed as being very helpful, the EPA putting out regulations on vapor so we could get more ethanol in the percentage of E15.  I would say his idea of putting caps on RINs will not work because when you do that, you are getting--the marketplace isn't working. I suppose I am a little surprised that a free market person like Senator Cruz would suggest the government step in and cap that. Also, I would like to speak to the point that in November of last year, 2017, as an agency, the EPA itself said the RINs market was working, which puts the Agency in a little bit different position than where we think Mr. Pruitt, the Administrator of EPA, is coming from.  So, with that in mind, I am going to go to my remarks right now and express that it is very unfortunate that there is an objection to advancing President Trump's nomination of Iowa secretary of agriculture Bill Northey to be Under Secretary at the Department of Agriculture all because of unrelated concerns over the renewable fuel standard, which is a law passed by Congress and obviously administered by the EPA.  I am very disappointed that a highly qualified and honorable man like Bill Northey is being held up for an issue unrelated to his position. As you heard my colleague say, Secretary Northey enjoyed unanimous support from the Senate Agriculture Committee and has the support of numerous agriculture groups from around the country.  Now I will get to the RINs issue and my feeling that this is not a legitimate reason for either holding up this nomination for the bankruptcy that has been referred to or for any other refinery that has trouble.  I think it is a manufactured and baseless rumor that the RFS, the renewable fuel standard, has caused an oil refinery in Pennsylvania to file for bankruptcy. This example has been cited repeatedly as a justification for forcing the renewable fuel standard supporters to agree to sudden and drastic changes in how the renewable fuel standard was designed.  I have been trying to work in good faith with the Senator from Texas and have offered several options--some of them I have just expressed here in my off-the-cuff remarks--that would resultin lower prices on the RINs issue. As has been said, that stands for renewable identification number. That is what we call the compliance credits--to make sure the refineries use the right amount of ethanol to meet the renewable fuel standard.  However, I keep being told by the Senator from Texas that I need to accept a proposal for a guaranteed cap on RIN prices in the short term to save this Philadelphia refinery. Unfortunately for those who are spreading the rumors that the problems the Philadelphia refinery has are due to high RIN prices, from my point of view--and I hope I backed this up in a paper that we have widely disseminated within the last week--the facts don't add up very well for the people making the argument that RIN prices are the problem.  My staff and other analysts have read the SEC filings and the bankruptcy filings of the refinery in question and have come to the conclusion that the Philadelphia refinery cannot pin its problems on the renewable fuel standard. The No. 1 problem the Philadelphia refinery has faced is the result of the petroleum export ban being lifted, which cost it access to cheaper feedstocks. Another reason, and the second biggest problem it has, is that a pipeline opened which diverted rail shipment of Bakken crude oil away from the east coast because of the pipeline sending it someplace else, obviously raising the price of the feedstock to the Philadelphia refinery.  We keep being told the refinery is facing hardship because it cannot afford to buy enough RINs to comply with the renewable fuel standard. If that is the case, then why did this Philadelphia refinery sell off a significant quantity of RINs just last fall? That is quite odd, considering the company needs to turn them in later this month for compliance with the renewable fuel standard.  Some have said it is executing a market short on RINs, which is dependent on some sort of Federal action that will suddenly drive down the cost of RINs. I would point out that shorting the RIN market is something Carl Icahn is reportedly being investigated for by Federal investigators. I hope that the Philadelphia refinery is not trying to follow that same playbook. I certainly want nothing to do with that kind of chicanery.  Finally, the Philadelphia refinery could have avoided needing to buy any RINs at all if it had just invested in blending infrastructure years ago like many of its fellow merchant refineries did. In fact, the Philadelphia refinery is partly owned by Sunoco, which owns blending infrastructure.  We also know that refinery has an arrangement whereby it supplies ethanol with RINs attached to Sunoco for blending with its gasoline. Other independent refiners with similar arrangements have an agreement to return the RINs to the refiner once they are detached.  The RFS was created to bring cleaner burning renewable fuels to consumers. The RINs system was developed as a flexible system that would allow obligated parties to choose between investing in blending infrastructure or buying RINs for Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. The Philadelphia refinery made the decision to buy RINs instead. That hasn't worked out very well for that refinery apparently, but that was the bet that refinery made. A cheaper option for Renewable Fuel Standard compliance exists, and the Philadelphia refinery chose to pursue other investments.  None of this has anything to do with President Trump's choice to oversee farm programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Bill Northey should be confirmed by this body. He has overwhelming bipartisan support. Taking a nominee hostage to try to force an ill-conceived policy change is only going to cause more problems for this body in the future.  I don't know what the next step is, but I think that Bill Northey is such a good person for this position, I am going to continue to work as long as he wants me to work for his nomination to proceed.  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article on this issue of the Philadelphia refinery.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), Feb. 6, 2018]                             (By Tom Kloza)    Verleger: PES Bankruptcy Judge Could Inflict Lehman-Like Moment       Noted oil economist Phil Verleger has read the Philadelphia      Energy Solutions (PES) bankruptcy filing and makes no bones      about his verdict. The company is scapegoating the Renewable      Fuel Standard for its financial woes, Verleger says, instead      of properly attributing the demise of the 330,000-b/d      refinery to the end of the long-time crude oil export ban,      antiquated equipment and a lack of investment that kept the      plant competitive with other northeastern refineries.       But most importantly, Verleger sees a possibility that the      bankruptcy judge just might render a decision that could      wreak havoc with the RFS and throw the RINs market into utter      chaos. Bankruptcy papers clearly indicate that PES would like      to get its RIN obligation discharged in the reorganization.      If not, the company would have to purchase and retire RINs      with an aggregate market value of approximately $350 million      at current market prices before a compliance deadline this      spring. It would also need to buy about 550 million 2018      vintage RINs. A buyer of that quantity under current      circumstances might lead to a quick doubling of the renewable      credit asking prices.       But if a bankruptcy judge allows cancellation of the RINs'      obligation, any credibility associated with the RFS program      might be thrown out the window.       There is a legal obligation to blend ethanol and other      biocomponents into transportation fuels and the EPA might      have great difficulty administering the program, even though      the agency has been an advocate. A court decision granting      PES' request for relief might lead to a ``Lehman-like      moment'' that could completely halt RINs' trading, plunge the      value of accumulated RINs to near zero and bring about pure      chaos.       PES' owners blame the U.S. renewable fuels' standard for      their woes, but Verleger disagrees. Failure came about      because the refinery complex is out of date and it is a      merchant refinery with no downstream outlets. It also      operates in a region where flat demand is a victory and      decelerating demand a probability. Financially solvent and      technologically advanced companies can operate under these      circumstances, but the noted oil economist finds no evidence      that critical investments were made PES in the refinery.       The PES bankruptcy filing took place on Jan. 22, and the      RINs' cost of $217 million was the largest expense other than      crude oil costs. When the Trump administration reaffirmed the      government's commitment to the RFS in the autumn, it dealt a      blow to merchant refiners and other processors who hoped to      shift the compliance burden to others. PES CEO Gregory Gatta      told the Philadelphia Inquirer: ``It is unfortunate that the      company was driven to this result by the failed RFS policy      and excessive RIN costs.'' He added that the company ``can      only hope that our filing . . . will provide the necessary      catalyst for meaningful long-term reform of the RFS      program.''       In contrast, Verleger notes that megarefiner Valero      reported net income of $4.1 billion for the year and saw a      quarterly profit of $509 million excluding the Trump tax cut      benefits. Expense for RINs was $311 million in the fourth      quarter, but the company invested $2.4 billion, with half of      it going to ``growth projects.''       Some of those past investments have included logistical      additions and refinery tweaks so that properties could run      heavily discounted Canadian crude.       ``Valero invested. Canadian producers have not. And      clearly, PES has not,'' notes Verleger.       He backdates the lack of investment for several decades.      Some 35 years ago, the Washington Post acknowledged that the      refinery owner at the time (Sun Oil, and then Sunoco) bucked      the trend toward expensive refinery upgrades in favor of      keeping a light sweet more expensive feedstock dependence.       That luck ran out for Sunoco, but PES had a run of several      years during which it could bring inexpensive landlocked U.S.      crude to Philadelphia, thanks to the U.S. export ban. An      investment was made in a $186 million rail-unloading      facility, but refineries were not upgraded. Nowadays, Bakken      crude trades within a few dollars of WTI, so shipping the      North Dakota crude to the East Coast doesn't make economic      sense.       In contrast, Delta Air Lines bought the closed      ConocoPhillips refinery in Trainer, Pa., in 2012, renamed it      Monroe Energy and upgraded the refinery to meet tougher U.S.      specifications. In 2016, some $70 million was invested so      that the plant could produce the lower-sulfur gasoline      required by EPA.       PES hoped to make investments in the refinery from funds      from a proposed IPO, but investors balked at terms. There was      no IPO and no investment.       The end of the export ban on U.S. crude combined with the      completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline eliminated PES'      access to favorably priced crudes. PES had a favorable      position only so long as the export ban was in effect, notes      Verleger.       The refinery isn't just dependent on expensive light sweet      crude. It also produces about 12% of low valued industrial      products that ultimately fetch prices beneath crude costs. It      is much less competitive than nearby PBF, which boasts about      double the PES margins.       ``The owners (of PES) gambled that the large discount of      U.S. crude to world prices would continue enabling the      refinery to continue earning profits.''       Verleger concludes that PES lost the gamble and the growth      of U.S. crude exports has made it impractical and      unprofitable to move Midcontinent crude to East Coast sweet      refineries.       Verleger acknowledges that the RIN market isn't a      particularly efficient market, with inequities incurred by      small marketers who don't get RIN discounts passed along.      Distortions can create an unequal playing field. But finding      the source of the problems is a difficult task, with possible      flaws including hoarding by large traders in the credits.       But he suggests that rather than declaring amnesty on RIN      obligations, a more appropriate decision might be to scrap      the refinery, which was once headed for closure earlier in      the decade. Part-owner Carlyle Group gambled with its own      money (and some government funds) that it could profitably      rail crude to Philadelphia and make money. Instead, the      export ban was lifted, dooming that flawed strategy.
