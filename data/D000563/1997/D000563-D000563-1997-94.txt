I want to commend him for hishard work in this area since 1979 when he succeeded in instituting directives aimed at increasing the number of military organ donors. Senator DeWine's staff has also been most helpful in suggesting modifications to improve this amendment and we have incorporated all their suggestions into this amendment.  More than 50,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplants and hundreds of thousands more need tissue transplants. Every year, thousands die needlessly due to lack of donors. In 1996 alone, 3,916 people on the transplant waiting list died because no organs were available for them. Nearly one-fifth of all heart and liver transplant candidates die while waiting for organs. Every 18 minutes another person is added to the waiting list for organs. Each day, eight people die because an organ was not available. Yet since 1986, hospitals that participate in the Medicare or Medicaid Program are required to have in place policies to offer eligible families the option of organ and tissue donation. Last year at an HHS hearing on liver allocation and organ donation, Michael Evanisko, president of the Partnership for Organ Donation testified that at least half of the solution to the organ donor shortage could be achieved by focusing on hospital practices. The partnership's research with 11 organ procurement organizations and over 130 hospitals nationwide, in conjunction with the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, estimated that:       * * * if hospitals adopted optimal organ donation      practices, an additional 5,000 donors would result, bringing      the effectiveness of the donation system from one-third to      nearly 70%.  The major impediments to donation, according to Evanisko, are whether families are approached about donation and how the request is handled.  Last year, Senators Dorgan and Frist here in the Senate joined forces with myself and Dave Camp in the House and we added a section to the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Portability Insurance Act, which resulted in taxpayers who were receiving a tax refund this year, at the same time received an organ donation request card. An estimated 70 million Americans received this solicitation. Those of us who worked hard to incorporate that provision into the bill, certainly hope that it will increase the number of organ donors. However, increasing the numbers of individuals with organ donor cards alone will not save lives, if hospitals do not effectively identify these eligible donors. Approaching families in a sensitive manner about organ donation is also extremely important.  My amendment would ask HHS together with GAO, to survey 5 percent of the donor hospitals in order to ascertain how the program is working nationwide. This information could be used to determine best hospital practices. This amendment complements our previous efforts to maximize the numbers of lives saved for those in need of organ or tissue transplants.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to support an amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. The Senator's amendment calls for a report to identify the best ways to recover organs and tissue from those who have died suddenly so that the lives of others can be saved through organ transplants.  Today, more than 54,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant; and 10 Americans will die each day before an organ can be found. And the sad fact is that these deaths are preventable. We have the technology to give these people a second chance through transplants--but while we have the technology, we don't have the organs.  I am convinced that much of this problem can be solved by making people aware of this problem and educating them about the need for organ donation. And I have been working on that for some time.  However, just as important is looking at the system we have in place for organ procurement--to see if there are structural hurdles that we can help remove. The law today requires hospitals to have a protocol in place for organ procurement. Not all do. Those that do don't necessarily work with the organ procurement organizations [OPO's] in their local areas. These are the hurdles that Senator Durbin's amendment tries to address. The study that this amendment requires is an important one. I hope that it will provide us all with information about how best to identify appropriate organ donors and then, how best to approach their families. I would hope that this study would take into account the fact that these best practices may well be different in different parts of the country. To the extent the Secretary can identify these differences in her report, I think it would be meaningful to the hospitals and their respective OPO's.  When we fail to identify a potential donor or bungle our communication with a potential donor's family, we compound an already tragic situation. Already someone's family member--a mother, brother, or sister--has died. The second tragedy is that--despite that person's willingness to donate and save another's life--that wish is ignored or the request to the family is handled poorly, raising unnecessary doubts about donation.  I'd like to thank Senator Durbin--I appreciate his thoughtful efforts toward increasing organ donation and improving organ procurement. I also want to thank him for accommodating my concerns in his amendment. I look forward to working with him in the future on this issue that is so important to both of us.                           amendment no. 1086
