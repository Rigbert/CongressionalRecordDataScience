And I agree with the gentleman, and certainly want to join together in this effort. And the gentleman will observe, that's why we have adopted, readopted statutory PAYGO. We think that will constrain spending. That's why we've created a commission to look at spending and make recommendations to get a handle on the spending in this country and bring our deficit in line as it was in the nineties.  And that is why the President has submitted a budget that freezes discretionary spending at last year's levels. So we agree with you that we need to move in that direction and, in fact, we are.  I thank the gentleman.
