 The normal way we do business is for action to be going on on the floor, and additional action in committees at the same time. As a result of these objections, we have thwarted progress. We have thwarted progress on an energy bill, on a JOBS bill, on a disaster relief bill. Yesterday, an Intelligence Committee meeting had to be cancelled. Here we are in the middle of the war on terror and the Intelligence Committee was not allowed to meet.  Today's objections will shut down our meetings on the Energy bill, a closed CIA briefing on terrorism and proliferation of weapons in Iran, the Foreign Relations Committee, on strengthening America's workforce over at the Labor Committee, another Intelligence Committee shutdown by this action and, of course, the Judiciary Committee will not be able to continue its markup of the asbestos bill.  We are following the regular order. The majority leader simply called up ajudicial nominee to be considered by the Senate. There is nothing irregular in any way about the procedure that is being followed, and yet our friends on the other side of the aisle are shutting down the business of the Senate by making it impossible for committees to do the work of the American people on everything from intelligence matters to passing an energy bill when gas prices are at record highs. This is an incredibly irresponsible approach to the majority's efforts simply to move the people's business along by following regular order and moving toward a vote on the President's nomination for the court of appeals.  I yield the floor.
