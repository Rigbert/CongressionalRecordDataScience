 Hagel, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Levin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 36       Whereas the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear      Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968,      and entered into force March 5, 1970 (in this resolution      referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''),      codifies one of the most important international security      arrangements in the history of arms control, the arrangement      by which states without nuclear weapons pledge not to acquire      them, states with nuclear weapons commit to eventually      eliminate them, and nonnuclear states are allowed to use for      peaceful purposes nuclear technology under strict and      verifiable control;       Whereas the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the      most widely supported multilateral agreements, with 188      countries adhering to the Treaty;       Whereas the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty has encouraged      many countries to officially abandon nuclear weapons or      nuclear weapons programs, including Argentina, Belarus,      Brazil, Kazakhstan, Libya, South Africa, South Korea,      Ukraine, and Taiwan;       Whereas, at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference,      the states-parties agreed to extend the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty indefinitely, to reaffirm the principles      and objectives of the Treaty, to strengthen the Treaty review      process, and to implement further specific and practical      steps on non-proliferation and disarmament;       Whereas, at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the states-     parties agreed to further practical steps on non-     proliferation and disarmament;       Whereas President George W. Bush stated on March 7, 2005,      that ``the NPT represents a key legal barrier to nuclear      weapons proliferation and makes a critical contribution to      international security,'' and that ``the United States is      firmly committed to its obligations under the NPT'';       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is      responsible for monitoring compliance with safeguard      agreements pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty      and reporting safeguard violations to the United Nations      Security Council;       Whereas Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin stated      on February 24, 2005, that ``[w]e bear a special      responsibility for the security of nuclear weapons and      fissile material in order to ensure that there is no      possibility such weapons or materials would fall into      terrorist hands'';       Whereas Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty      calls for the fullest possible exchange of equipment and      materials for peaceful nuclear endeavors and allows states to      acquire sensitive technologies to produce nuclear fuel for      energy purposes but also recognizes that such fuel could be      used to secretly produce fissile material for nuclear weapons      programs or quickly produce such material if the state were      to decide to withdraw from the Treaty;       Whereas the Government of North Korea ejected international      inspectors from that country in 2002, announced its      withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003,      has recently declared its possession of nuclear weapons, and      is in possession of facilities capable of producing      additional nuclear weapons-usable material;       Whereas the Government of Iran has pursued an undeclared      program to develop a uranium enrichment capacity, repeatedly      failed to fully comply with and provide full information to      the IAEA regarding its nuclear activities, and stated that it      will not permanently abandon its uranium enrichment program      which it has temporarily suspended through an agreement with      the European Union;       Whereas the network of arms traffickers associated with      A.Q. Khan has facilitated black-market nuclear transfers      involving several countries, including Iran, Libya, and North      Korea, and represents a new and dangerous form of      proliferation;       Whereas governments should cooperate to control exports of      and interdict illegal transfers of sensitive nuclear and      missile-related technologies to prevent their proliferation;       Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level      Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that      ``[a]lmost 60 States currently operate or are constructing      nuclear power or research reactors, and at least 40 possess      the industrial and scientific infrastructure which would      enable them, if they chose, to build nuclear weapons at      relatively short notice if the legal and normative      constraints of the Treaty regime no longer apply,'' and      warned that ``[w]e are approaching a point at which the      erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become      irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation'';       Whereas stronger international support and cooperation to      achieve universal compliance with tighter nuclear non-     proliferation rules and standards constitute essential      elements of nuclear non-proliferation efforts;       Whereas sustained leadership by the United States      Government is essential to help implement existing legal and      political commitments established by the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty and to realize a     more robust and effective global nuclear non-proliferation      system; and       Whereas the governments of the United States and other      countries should pursue a comprehensive and balanced approach      to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation system,      beginning with the Seventh NPT Review Conference of 2005:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This resolution may be cited as the ``Reinforce the Nuclear      Non-Proliferation Treaty Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT OF THE NUCLEAR NON-                   PROLIFERATION TREATY.       Congress--       (1) reaffirms its support for the objectives of the Nuclear      Non-Proliferation Treaty and expresses its support for all      appropriate measures to strengthen the Treaty and to attain      its objectives; and       (2) calls on all parties participating in the Seventh      Nuclear NPT Review Conference--       (A) to insist on strict compliance with the non-     proliferation obligations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation      Treaty and to undertake effective enforcement measures      against states that are in violation of their Article I or      Article II obligations under the Treaty;       (B) to agree to establish more effective controls on      sensitive technologies that can be used to produce materials      for nuclear weapons;       (C) to expand the ability of the International Atomic      Energy Agency to inspect and monitor compliance with non-     proliferation rules and standards to which all states should      adhere through existing authority and the additional      protocols signed by the states party to the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty;       (D) to demonstrate the international community's unified      opposition to a nuclear weapons program in Iran by--       (i) supporting the efforts of the United States and the      European Union to prevent the Government of Iran from      acquiring a nuclear weapons capability; and       (ii) using all appropriate diplomatic and other means at      their disposal to convince the Government of Iran to abandon      its uranium enrichment program;       (E) to strongly support the ongoing United States      diplomatic efforts in the context of the six-party talks that      seek the verifiable and incontrovertible dismantlement of      North Korea's nuclear weapons programs and to use all      appropriate diplomatic and other means to achieve this      result;       (F) to pursue diplomacy designed to address the underlying      regional security problems in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and      the Middle East, which would facilitate non-proliferation and      disarmament efforts in those regions;       (G) to accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate      nuclear weapons-usable material to the highest standards to      prevent access by terrorists and governments;       (H) to halt the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian      reactors;       (I) to strengthen national and international export      controls and relevant security measures as required by United      Nations Security Council Resolution 1540;       (J) to agree that no state may withdraw from the Nuclear      Non-Proliferation Treaty and escape responsibility for prior      violations of the Treaty or retain access to controlled      materials and equipment acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes;       (K) to accelerate implementation of disarmament obligations      and commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty      for the purpose of reducing the world's stockpiles of nuclear      weapons and weapons-grade fissile material; and       (L) to strengthen and expand support for the Proliferation      Security Initiative.
