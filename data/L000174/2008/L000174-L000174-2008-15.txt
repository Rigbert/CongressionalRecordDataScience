President, I regret to have to inform the Senate of the passing of a truly great American: John W. Ripley, a retired Marine Corps colonel and hero of the Vietnam war.  Colonel Ripley will be best known for his achievements and self-sacrifice during the Vietnam war--particularly on April 2, 1972, when he singlehandedly blew up the Dong Ha bridge. That bridge over the Cua Viet River was a major thoroughfare for an invasion force from North Vietnam. Colonel Ripley, serving with a marine unit from South Vietnam, moved around the bridge like it was a trapeze and hung charges that would blow it up and prevent the enemy's advance.  That story is the subject of innumerable books and articles. It is an absolutely incredible feat, showing us how an act of individual bravery can have a large strategic impact that affects an entire force. Indeed, the removal of that bridge created a bottleneck that allowed allied forces to apply overwhelming air power and blunt that invasion.  After Vietnam, Colonel Ripley had a distinguished career that included going through some of the most challenging training programs among the world's militaries, including U.S. Army Ranger School. In his willingness to undergo the ardors of combat and training, he emerged a marine's marine, a steely and strong individual always ready to put his country and his fellow marines before himself.  John Ripley is a symbol for the vibrancy of the Marine Corps, one of the most storied military forces in the globe's history, and a testament to how--amid the enormity and vast confusion of war--a single person can make a difference.  I will miss seeing him at various events, including those of the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation. We will continue to honor his service through support of the Marine Corps and of all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.  I ask unanimous consent that an obituary on Colonel Ripley, which appeared in the November 4 edition of the New York Times, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 4, 2008]  Col. John W. Ripley, Marine Who Halted Vietnamese Attack, Dies at 69                           (By Dennis Hevesi)       John W. Ripley, a highly decorated former colonel who      entered Marine Corps lore when he single-handedly blunted a      major North Vietnamese offensive during the Vietnam War by      blowing up a strategically placed bridge, died Oct. 28 at his      home in Annapolis, Md. He was 69.       The cause has not been determined, his son Stephen said.       Colonel Ripley, who at the time was a captain and a      military adviser to a South Vietnamese Marine unit, blew up      the southern end of the Dong Ha Bridge over the Cua Viet      River on Easter Sunday, April 2, 1972. On the north side of      the bridge, which was several miles south of the      demilitarized zone, some 20,000 North Vietnamese troops and      200 tanks were poised to sweep into Quang Tri Province, which      was sparsely defended.       Going back and forth for three hours while under fire,      Captain Ripley swung hand over hand along the steel I-beams      beneath the bridge, securing himself between girders and      placing crates holding a total of 500 pounds of TNT in a      diagonal line from one side of the structure to the other.      The I-beam wings were just wide enough to form pathways along      which he could slide the boxes.       When the boxes were in place on the bridge, Captain Ripley      attached blasting caps to detonate the TNT, then connected      them with a timed-fuse cord that eventually extended hundreds      of feet.       ``He had to bite down on the blasting caps to attach them      to the fuses,'' John Grider Miller, author of ``The Bridge at      Dong Ha,'' said on Monday. ``If he bit too low on the      blasting cap, it could come loose; if he bit too high, it      could blow his head apart.''       Captain Ripley bit safely, and the timed-fuse cord gave him      about half an hour to clamber off the bridge. Moments later,      his work paid off with a shock wave that tossed him into the      air but otherwise left him unharmed.       By placing the crates diagonally along the bridge, Mr.      Miller said, Captain Ripley had created ``a twisting motion      that ripped the bridge apart from its moorings so it couldn't      fall back in place, but collapsed into the river.''       There were about 600 South Vietnamese marines near the      south end of the bridge. ``South Vietnam would have been in      big trouble,'' said Fred Schultz, senior editor of Naval      History Magazine, a publication of the United States Naval      Institute. ``The force numbers defending on that side could      not have held against that North Vietnamese force.''       The destruction of the bridge created a bottleneck for the      North Vietnamese, allowing American bombers to blunt what      became known as the Easter offensive.       Captain Ripley was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions      at the bridge. He served two tours in Vietnam and remained on      active duty until 1992, eventually rising to colonel. Among      other decorations, he received the Silver Star, two Bronze      Stars and a Purple Heart.       John Walter Ripley was born on June 29, 1939, and grew up      in Radford, Va., the son of Bud and Verna Holt Ripley. He      enlisted in the Marines out of high school in 1956, and a      year later received approval from the secretary of the Navy      to attend a preparatory school leading to his appointment to      the Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1962.       Besides his son Stephen, Colonel Ripley is survived by his      wife of 44 years, the former Moline Blaylock; a sister, Susan      Goodykoontz; two other sons, Thomas and John; a daughter,      Mary Ripley; and eight grandchildren.       ``Colonel Ripley is well known in marine circles,'' Mr.      Schultz said, ``but he's the most revered war hero no one's      ever heard of.''       ``This was 1972,'' he added, ``and people didn't pay too      much attention to war heroes at that time.''                          ____________________
