 President: I rise today to recognize basketball excellence. As you may know, basketball is a way of life in Kentucky. While people are most familiar with Kentucky's two Divison IA schools, our state also has its share of small schools that do not always receive the recognition they are due. It is one of those schools that I want to recognize today: the 1998 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Basketball Champions: the Tigers of Georgetown College, located in the town of Georgetown, Kentucky.  On March 23, led by NAIA first team All-America sophomore center Will Carlton, Georgetown defeated Southern Nazarene College 83-69 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After a roller coaster first half that included a thirteen point deficit, Georgetown took a one point lead into the locker room at halftime. Midway through the second half, the Tigers exploded for 17-2 run fueled by Carlton and teammate Barry Bowman, who combined for 15 of those 17 points. During the penultimate run, the offense of Carlton and Bowman was supported by solid defense that held Southern Nazarene to only two free throws in the six and a half minutes.  This national title is the first in Georgetown College basketball history. Having lost in the finals on two previous occasions--1961 and 1996--these Tigers, led by coach Happy Osborne finished their dream season with a record of 36-3. They steadily improved their play throughout the tournament, symbolized by their cutting their turnovers from 30 in the first round to only nine in the final.  While this National Championship was the result of a total team effort, it is worth noting that Carlton, a sophomore, and Bowman, a junior, were joined by senior David Shee on the all- tournament team. After averaging nearly 22 points and 12 rebounds in the tournament, Carlton received the Chuck Taylor Most Valuable Player Award for the tournament.  Mr. President, I congratulate Coach Osborne and his team on a marvelous season culminating in this NAIA National Championship, their version of March Madness. And with most ofthese Tigers expected to return next year, I look forward to Georgetown successfully defending their crown next year.                          ____________________
