I plan to work with the administration officials, with the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot], the chairman, and the House and Senate conferees in increasing the funding for this initiative.  As the gentlewoman has observed, by cutting the funding for this initiative and stretching it out, we will collect less funds. The reason last year we put this off-budget was because CBO and, in a bipartisan fashion, the Committee on the Budget agreed that this was a moneymaker, not a moneyloser, so that if we do not invest these funds, we will lose in terms of collections.  I share the gentlewoman's view and I will be pursuing that objective in conference.
