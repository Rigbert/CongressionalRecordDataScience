President, let me emphasize that it was cleared with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Appropriations Act. Let me begin by thanking the committee's distinguished chairman, Senator Inouye, and the ranking member, Senator Cochran, for their leadership in crafting this bill and for their strong commitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.  I am very proud of the work that the State of Maine does that contributes to our national defense.
