Chairman, I wanted to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for being such a strong supporter of alternative fuels and, obviously, with the gentleman's support, the Beltsville Research Station, the premiere agricultural research station in the country, is leading the rest of the Nation in this important arena.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for his own leadership as a member of the Committee on Appropriations in assuring that Beltsville understands the seriousness of this Congress in trying to move additional alternative fuels on-line for the sake, not just of the Beltsville station, but for the sake of the Nation. I want to thank the gentleman for taking the time today to place in the Record the actual research, the demonstration and the results of what has actually been accomplished at Beltsville.  Without question, the gentleman is placing a foundation there that can be built upon and transferred to other USDA sites, as well as the cooperative agreements that USDA can reach with all of our land grant universities across the country.  I just want to thank the gentleman for helping to spur these efforts forward and for helping Beltsville lead the rest of the Nation as it should.
