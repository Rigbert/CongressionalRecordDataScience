 President, I rise to speak briefly on the pending amendment No. 1052, which is the emergency supplemental funding for the veterans services which I spoke about earlier. I thank my colleagues, Senators Akaka and Kerry, for their remarks.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators to our amendment as cosponsors: Senators Jeffords, Salazar, Bill Nelson, Dayton, Rockefeller, and Harkin.
