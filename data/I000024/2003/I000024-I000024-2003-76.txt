I wanted to make sure he was aware, which I think he is, that the Bush request for 2004 is the second largest request since the date he mentioned being on the floor in 1980. I was not here until 1984. But right now his request is $1.38 billion. I first ask if the Senator is aware of that.  Secondly, as far as the tax is concerned, we have never left the idea of polluter pays. Right now, polluter pays. In 70 percent of the cases, if there is a polluter who can be identified, the polluter pays. The problem you are coming up with, when you talk about the tax--which expired in 1995 under the Clinton administration, and President Clinton did not ask for its reinstatement or for a tax--is that that is not polluter pays. That takes care of some orphan cases, either general funds or that tax.  Is that fair, to have businesses paying into a fund that pays for pollution cleanup that they didn't cause? That is a bad policy to do that. I wanted to be sure we were talking about the same thing.
