HATCH. Of course I will not. First, I have the floor and I am retaining the floor because I have questions from both sides. I am willing to take questions from your side. I am not ignoring those. It is about time the American people hear the truth. We have heard enough rubbish. Now we should hear the truth. In all honesty, that is what we are going to do this evening.  I have heard a lot of ridiculous remarks over there that do not really deserve listening to. So we are going to hear some remarks tonight that deserve being listened to, and we are going to get the facts. This unmitigated bullcorn that he has not answered questions is exactly that.  I think the distinguished Junior Senator from Tennessee tore the hide off the Democrats tonight. I was so doggone impressed, I want to compliment my colleague. But he was not the only one. I have had colleague after colleague stand up over here and tell the truth, and I have had colleague after colleague over there hide behind these phony issues they have raised.
