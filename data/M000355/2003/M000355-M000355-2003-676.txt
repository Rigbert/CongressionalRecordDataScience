 President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 11, the Patients First Act. Between now and 11:30, the time will be equally divided between the majority leader or his designee, and the Democratic leader or his designee.  At 11:30, there will be two consecutive rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the Patients First Act of 2003. Immediately following that vote, the Senate will proceed to executive session and vote on the nomination of Victor Wolski to be a judge on the U.S. Federal Claims Court.  Following those two votes, at 11:30, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 925, the State Department reauthorization bill. Amendments are expected to be offered to the bill. However, it is our hope, and the hope of Chairman Lugar, to complete this bill expeditiously. To accomplish this, Members who intend to offer and debate amendments should notify their respective chairman or ranking member so that the amendments can be scheduled for consideration.  Rollcall votes will occur throughout the day as the Senate considers the State Department authorization bill.  Again, it is our hope that we will be able to complete this bill early this week so we can begin the appropriations process prior to the end of this week. I encourage everyone to help make that possible.                          ____________________
