 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. I hope my friend, Senator Hatch, will debate the fine points of the law with the Senator from New York because I am not a lawyer. I have strong feelings on the issue of abortion which do not have to be expressed today. My friend, the Senator from New York, has opposite views on that issue and he has not expressed them and does not have to express them as far as this amendment is concerned. I oppose this amendment simply because it is not needed.  First, I will comment on the possibility of the Vice President of the United States having to vote today to break a tie. I predict that if the Vice President is in town and this vote is that close, the Vice President will be here and will have an opportunity to cast that vote. If the Vice President is in town to break a tie, there is going to be at least one person who supports that amendment who is going to vote against it just so we can have a tie vote, just so the President can cast his vote because the Vice President running for President of the United States is not going to break into his schedule with the tight vote he had in New Hampshire last night and avoid campaigning in the other States and waste his time here if he does not actually have to cast that vote.  We are in for not only political moments on this issue, but we are in for some very constitutional moments on this issue as well.  I like the theater that is going on this morning. We have seen it at least once before, and we may see it several times between now and November. I do not blame the people on the other side for creating this theater because I think the Vice  President is going to need it between now and the November election if he intends to be elected President of the United States.
