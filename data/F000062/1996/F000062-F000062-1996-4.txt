S. Senate. I hope we would have that opportunity. I think it is important that we do so.  Another candidate who has been waiting before this body since June 27, when she passed the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous vote, is Margaret Morrow, who has been nominated for District Judge in the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. She is a graduate of Bryn Mawr magna cum laude. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School, cum laude. She is a partner in a prominent Los Angeles law firm.  She has won the Bernard E. Witkin Amicus Curiae Award from the California Judicial Council in 1995. She has received the Ernestine Stalhut Award for the most distinguished woman lawyer in Los Angeles. She has received the President's award from the California Association of Court-Appointed Special Advocates. She has received the Pro Bono Advocacy Award from the Western Center on Law and Poverty. She has received a number of special awards.  She is the first woman president of the California Bar Association and served as president of the Los Angeles Bar Association. She was found also to be ``well qualified.''  Her nomination has been languishing in this body since June 27. I hope that in any arrangement that might be put forward, both Margaret Morrow as well as William Fletcher would be part of that arrangement. This is extraordinarily important to me.  Another Presidential nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is Richard Paez. Richard Paez has had a hearing on July 31. Action in the Judiciary Committee has not yet been taken. He was nominated by the President on January 25.  Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and the University of California Law School. He has had a distinguished career in Los Angeles, where he served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court from 1981 to 1994. He was chairman of the Los Angeles County Municipal Judges Association in 1990. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing and this Senate did appoint him to the District Court for the Central District of California in 1994, so he has had a hearing by the Judiciary Committee. He has been approved by them, and he has been approved by this body for the district court.  Now the President has seen fit to recommend him for appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope that action might be taken on his case prior to the end of this session.  There is one hardship case that I would like to raise at this time. The national average caseload for all cases is 448 cases per judge. The national average for criminal cases is 51 cases per judge. San Diego has a major caseload problem. In the Southern District of California, in San Diego, the average caseload is almost double that of the national average, 726 cases per judge. It is quadruple the national average in Federal criminal cases, with 213 criminal cases per judge.  Jeffrey T. Miller, who is one of my nominees, was nominated to be district judge for the Southern District of California. He is a sitting State superior court judge in San Diego, and has sat on that bench since 1987. Prior to that time, he was deputy attorney general in the California attorney general's office from 1968 to 1987. I took this up at the Judiciary Committee. I have asked for hearings to be able to consider his case. Judge Keep of the district court in San Diego has called and has indicated her concern about the caseload and asked if this body might be willing to take action to confirm this judge. With a criminal caseload that is quadruple the national average and overall caseload that is almost double the national average, I think on a hardship case that judge, as well, should be approved.  I would like to just end with one additional judge and that is Christina Snyder, nominated to be the U.S. district judge, District Court for the Central District of California, in hopes that her case might also be heard. I recognize she has not yet had a committee hearing and has been waiting for one to take place since May 15.  What I have tried to do is indicate two court of appeals judges who I think should be part of any final passage. Certainly, at the very least, one district court judge, Margaret Morrow, who has been waiting a long time, should be part of any final passage.  I wanted to make very clear to this whole body the importance of this to me, in considering any final passage of judicial appointments which might come before this body. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: My expectation is that the letter I      wrote Judge Mikva many months ago, urging the President to      nominate William Fletcher for a seat on the Ninth Circuit, is      a part of the file that your committee has in passing on that      nomination. It occurred to me, however, that it might be      useful for me to write you directly to say what a fine      appointment that is and how much I hope that it will be      confirmed by the Senate.       I do not doubt that Professor Fletcher is more liberal on      many issues than I am. That seems to me almost entirely      irrelevant. Over the years that I have known him and also      read his writing, what has greatly impressed me has been that      he has a quality that I regard as absolutely essential for a      scholar and that I regard as equally important for a judge.      This is the ability to put his own preferences aside and to      hunt objectively to see what answer the law provides.       Too many scholars approach a new issue with preconceptions      of how it should come out and they then force the data that      their research uncovers to support the conclusion they had      formed before they did any research. I think that is      reprehensible for a scholar and it is dangerous for a judge.       I am completely confident that when Fletcher finishes his      service on the Ninth Circuit we will say not that he has been      a liberal judge or a conservative judge but that he has been      an excellent judge, one who has brought a brilliant mind,      great powers of analysis, and total objectivity to the cases      that came before him.       Although you do not know me well, I believe that our      acquaintance over a number of years has been enough for you      to know that I would not say this merely because I think of      Fletcher as a friend, I have spent a lifetime working for the      improvement of the federal courts. I believe that the      nomination of William Fletcher will add strength to the Ninth      Circuit and I hope very much that he is confirmed.       It is wonderful to have you as Chairman of the Judiciary      Committee, I wish you well in that challenging task. Anytime      I can be of assistance to you or the Committee on the kinds      of matters on which I have some expertness, I would be      delighted to help.           Sincerely,     Charlie Wright.                                                                    ____                                           Harvard Law School,                                  Cambridge, MA, October 18, 1995.     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,     Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: We understand that William A. Fletcher,      Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley,      has been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for      the Ninth Circuit. We write to express our exceptionally high      regard for his abilities and our deep enthusiasm about the      prospect of his confirmation.       One of us (Daniel Meltzer) has known Mr. Fletcher for more      than 19 years, since the time they served together as clerks      at the United States Supreme Court. Though they now reside on      different coasts, they have maintained their friendship, and      because they teach the same law school course (Federal      Courts), they have been professional colleagues, discussing      academic matters, reading each other's publications,      exchanging manuscripts, and engaging in other forms of      academic collaboration.       Mr. Shapiro also knows Mr. Fletcher. Like Mr. Meltzer, he      too teaches Federal Courts and hence has long been familiar      with Mr. Fletcher's scholarship. Mr. Shapiro also served as      Deputy Solicitor General, from 1988-91, which gave him an      additional vantage point on both the work of the federal      courts and on Mr. Fletcher's contribution to scholarship in      that field.       In our opinion, Mr. Fletcher is a scholar of the first-     rank. His writing in the area of Federal Courts displays      intellectual rigor, mastery of the subject, and very sound      and balanced judgment about complex and controversial legal      matters. His voice is an important one that is broadly      respected by a wide range of scholars. His work reflects the      abilities not only of a creative scholar, but also of a      careful and thoughtful lawyer.       Mr. Fletcher's scholarly work extends also to the fields of      federal civil procedure and federal constitutional law. Thus,      the sphere of his interests and achievements as a scholar      constitute ideal preparation for the work of a federal      circuit judge.       Finally, Mr. Fletcher is a person of enormous integrity,      unfailing decency, and great personal warmth and good humor.      In light of those qualities, we believe that fellow judges of      all viewpoints would find him a congenial colleague, and      would develop for him the same professional admiration that      he has earned across the academic spectrum.       We hope that his assessment is helpful. Please let us know      if we can be of any further assistance.           Sincerely,     Daniel J. Meltzer,       Professor of Law.     David L. Shapiro,       William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law.                                                                    ____                                       University of Pennsylvania,                                               The Law School,                               Philadelphia, PA, October 23, 1995.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: As you know, the President has      nominated Professor William A. Fletcher to be a judge on the      United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Because      I have known Willy since we were college classmates and      because I have such high regard for his character and      abilities, I write to urge that you support his confirmation      by the Senate.       By way of background, I was a law clerk to the late Chief      Justice Burger in 1974-75 and have been on the faculty of the      University of Pennsylvania Law School since 1979. I teach and      write in the areas of civil procedure, conflict of laws and      judicial administration. I had the pleasure of meeting and      testifying before you and other members of the Subcommittee      on the Constitution of the Senate Judiciary Committee,      together with Chief Judge Clifford Wallace, in 1986. The      subject of that hearing, Senate Joint Resolutions that would      have altered in fundamental ways our arrangements for federal      judicial discipline, subsequently occupied my attention     as a member of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline      and Removal. On the Commission I worked particularly closely      with the Vice-Chair, Judge S. Jay Plager of the United States      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we co-authored      an article about the Commission's work.       As I mentioned, I knew Professor Fletcher as a student at      Harvard College, where he had a distinguished record,      graduating magna cum laude in history and literature (then      perhaps the most difficult major at Harvard) in 1968. He      earned another degree at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship and      then served on active duty in the Navy. Following law school      at Yale and clerkships with Judge Weigel and Justice Brennan,      Willy joined the faculty at Boalt Hall (Berkeley), where he      has been ever since (with occasional visiting appointments at      other schools).       Willy is a scholar of federal courts, constitutional law,      and civil procedure. Because our interests overlap to a      considerable extent, I have read almost everything he has      written. His work is both analytically acute and painstaking      in its regard for history. Indeed, love of and respect for      history shine through all of his work, as the history itself      illuminates the various corners of the law he enters. For      instance, Willy's article on the Rules of Decision Act is a      tour de force. He uses marine insurance cases from our early      days to show how differently the judges and other lawyers of      that period thought about law and hence to reveal current      interpretations of that very important statute as the product      of a philosophy (positivism) far removed from the minds of      the First Congress. Of greater current interest are his      writings on the Eleventh Amendment, which has attracted      volumes of teleological scholarship--what is sometimes      referred to as ``law office history.'' Willy's work is, by      contrast, scrupulous, balanced, and, I believe, persuasive.       If only because Willy has been nominated by this President,      for whose campaign in Northern California he served as unpaid      codirector, I wish to stress that the qualities of care and      balance characterize all of Willy's scholarship. He is also a      lucid writer. As a result, his Yale article on the      ``Structure of Standing'' may well be the best treatment of      that confusing subject in the literature, as well as the most      faithful to the history of the doctrine. It is also far      removed from the expansive approach of Justice Douglas and      other members of the Warren Court.       In sum, as to Willy's legal qualifications, I second the      views of Charles Alan Wright expressed in the enclosed      article from the Los Angeles Times. I would add only the      suggestion that, if you have any residual doubt, you solicit      the views of my colleague, Geoffrey Hazard. Geof recruited      Willy to work with him on his casebook in Civil Procedure,      the best evidence of the high regard of a demanding critic.      Of course you can make the judgment yourself.       Finally, believing as I do--particularly after service on      the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal--     that character is of equal importance with intelligence as a      desideratum in a judge, I can testify from thirty years of      knowing Willy Fletcher that he will bring great distinction      to the federal judiciary. He is a man of integrity and      compassion but one who knows that the law cannot (and should      not) solve all of society's problems.       Please let me know if I can provide any additional      information.       I hope that you are well.           Sincerely,                                               Stephen B. Burbank,         David Berger Professor for the Administration of Justice            and Acting Dean.                                                                    ____                 [From the New Republic, May 22, 1995]       On the other hand: After two years of lamenting President      Clinton's failure to appoint scholars to the federal courts,      we're delighted to note that he last week nominated U.C.-     Berkeley's William Fletcher to the United States Court of      Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.       Fletcher is the most impressive scholar of federal      jurisdiction in the country. His path-breaking articles on      sovereign immunity and federal common law have transformed      the debates in those fields; and his work is marked by the      kind of careful historical and textual analysis that should      serve as a model for liberals and conservatives alike.       If confirmed, Fletcher will join his mother, Betty, on the      Ninth Circuit but his judicial philosophy is more restrained      than hers. We hope he is confirmed as swiftly as possible.
