 President, I have one additional statement in regard to the Katrina situation.  As I said earlier before I read Craig's diary, I am a member of the Prairie Lakes Baptist Church at Cedar Falls, IA. Immediately after Katrina, our church in the following 3 weeks sent three different delegations--in other words, three different teams; a team the first week, a different team the second week, and a different team the third week--to go down to Brookhaven, MS, and help the First Baptist Church in Ocean Springs, MS, in their efforts to feed people who were in need and house people who were in need and do other things.  I have this letter which was sent to the pastor of our church, Pastor John Fuller, from the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Oceans Springs, MS.  It says:       Dear Pastor:       I have never had the privilege of meeting you--but I know      you because I have experienced the heart of your people. Mark      Sherwood, Mike and Denise Goyen, Dalen Grimm, indeed the      entire crew from Prairie Lakes Church manifested the heart of      Mary, the hands of Martha, the hope of Jesus.       My wife and I count our Iowa volunteers as among the best      of the best. They worked hard, they were sensitive to the      people's broken hearts, and they were a blessing to our      church, especially to my family and me.       It is my desire to come to Iowa, to thank you and your      people for the job well done.       Mike Barnett.  I ask unanimous consent to have that statement printed in the Record, along with the list of the people from my church who were in teams 1, 2 and 3, as well as an article from the Waterloo Courier which talks about this.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Prairie Lakes Responds to Hurricane Katrina       Dear Pastor: I have never had the privilege of meeting      you--but I know you because I have experienced the heart of      your people. Mark Sherwood, Mike and Denise Goyen, Dalen      Grimm, indeed the entire crew from Prairie Lakes Church      manifested the heart of Mary, the hands of Martha and the      hope of Jesus.

That's how Lincoln County residents partial to Brookhaven      introduce the southwest Mississippi town to strangers. ``It      might not look like it, but people like living here,''      boasted Clifford Britt, manager of the Brookhaven Lincoln      County Airport       A 17-person crew from Prairie Lakes Church in Cedar Falls      in town to help with hurricane relief hasn't had time to      assess Brookhaven's best features. They drove in late      Tuesday. They do have a deeper understanding of the disaster      they are facing as they share meals and conversation with      survivors of Hurricane Katrina.       ``All I've talked to have lost everything,'' said Nancy      Killian, 58, of Cedar Falls. ``We mingle with them, give hugs      when we can.''       Located 100 miles north of New Orleans, Brookhaven has been      an outpost for some 1,600 people displaced by the hurricane,      said Mayor Bob Massingill. Many evacuees have     moved on, but hundreds at the city's six shelters still need      housing.       One hub of activity is Easthaven Southern Baptist Church, a      shelter for 1l0, although for a time it served more than      twice that number. Former Cedar Falls resident Merrill Oster      initiated the relationship between Prairie Lakes and      Easthaven. He learned of Easthaven's challenge from family      members at that church. He called friends in the Cedar Valley      who were looking for a way to help.       The population in this town of 12,000 has swelled with      survivors and relief workers.       Members of the Indiana National Guard, shouldering M16s,      are on hand to keep the peace and lend a hand And then there      are the volunteers. Red Cross workers and Christians from      Tennessee have moved into Easthaven Baptist Church. And now      the Prairie Lakes contingent has arrived.       Prairie Lakes is partnering with Easthaven Baptist Church      to help with shelter and a transitional housing project. The      Cedar Falls church will send two more teams of volunteers in      the next two weeks.       ``We kind of answered the call to love people,'' said Adam      Graber, 23, Waterloo.       The warm Mississippi air was thick with humidity and ``love      bugs'' when volunteers started work Wednesday.       Men and women spent hours cutting and raking tall grass at      a former trailer home park, preparing the way for 14 travel      trailers. The units were purchased by Oster from Ace Fogdall      RV.       Oster orchestrated the project Trailers, which will house      displaced families, were filled with sheets, pots, pans and      other amenities by Prairie Lakes and Cedar Heights Baptist      congregations in Cedar Falls in two days.       Kim Oster of Easthaven Baptist, related by marriage to      Merrill Oster, said evacuees have brought new life to her      church, built specifically eight years ago to serve as a      disaster shelter. The joyful but weary servants at Easthaven      welcomed help from strangers up north.       ``We needed manpower. We really needed people to work,''      she said.       Trailer lots are rent-free for six months. Organizers hope      that is enough time for evacuees to achieve independence.      Five homes also are being prepared for family use.       About $157,000 has been raised toward the $300,000 project.       On Wednesday, Cedar Valley and Mississippi volunteers began      preparations for sewer, water and electricity at the trailer      park. At first, workers had trouble locating the existing      water line. Some Iowa jaws dropped as a tall and lanky      Mississippi man slowly walked back and forth across the      grass. Billy Crider strolled with arms outstretched, hands      clutching metal sticks that pulled toward an underground      line. The former Entergy Corp. employee was retired for more      than 5 years when he was called up by his company to help      after the hurricane.       Bystander Ron Williamson, a retired area school teacher and      volunteer cook at the shelter, vouched for the accuracy of      divining rods before ducking away to cook chicken for the      evening meal for evacuees and volunteers.       ``I love 'em God bless 'em all,'' Williamson said.       Volunteers are grateful to understanding employers and      teachers for letting them serve in the South, and for the      sponsorship of their churches.       Sara, 27, and Jerry Steele, 30, of Lytham, England extended      a visit with family in Iowa to make the trek south. Delta      Airlines let them delay their travel plans without extra      fees. Jared Coffin, 14, is missing class at Hoover Middle      School in Waterloo. He finished most of his homework on the      16-hour drive south.       ``They need people down here to do things like this. They      need people to donate clothes. It's just a matter of getting      plugged in,'' Coffin said ``We're going to be here for      awhile.''       Some Cedar Valley volunteers hoped to spend more time in      the shelter's kitchen and were surprised to learn more help      was available than expected. Some mentioned trekking further      south if the need is greater there, added Steve Coffin, 51,      of Cedar Falls.       ``We're just getting started,'' said Mark Sherwood,      volunteer coordinator from Cedar Falls. ``Every day can be      different.''       Brookhaven experienced tree damage and power outages but      was spared the destruction suffered by her southern      neighbors.       ``We've been inconvenienced, but their lives have      changed,'' said Massingill the mayor. ``People are ready to      go back to their homes.''       But not everyone can.       Despite what the highway signs near Brookhaven say, Kenner,      La, evacuees Herbert Lange and his wife, Cynthia, weren't      looking for paradise when they arrived at Easthaven Baptist.      They just wanted a safe place to wait for the storm to pass      and the water to recede so insurance and property issues can      be resolved. Housed in a Sunday school room and fed three      times a day, the Langes are convinced they have a little      piece of heaven.                          ____________________
