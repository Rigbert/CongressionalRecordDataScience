If, in fact, the healthcare bill were brought to the floor tomorrow, would it have a score from the Congressional Budget Office?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman clearly knows, there is a CBO score out there right now on the bill. As the gentleman knows, we are making progress; and as soon as we designate that, yes, we will move the bill, and I will notify the gentleman.
