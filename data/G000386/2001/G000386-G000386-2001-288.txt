 I am confident, however, that the budget resolution we passed has provided adequate funding for defense. This amendment would undo all of our efforts to provide significant cuts at all marginal rates. Besides, we have $500 billion in the contingency fund that we will be able to use to draw on if additional money for defense is needed.  I urge my colleagues to vote no.
