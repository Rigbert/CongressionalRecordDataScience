Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1036, the Copyright Royalty Judges Program Technical Corrections Act. This legislation amends certain technical aspects of the copyright act that were substantively amended by Congress' enactment of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004.  At the outset, it should be noted that H.R. 1036 was considered by the House under suspension of the rules last November and passed by a voice vote. The other body took up the bill in July and amended it to incorporate related noncontroversial language from the text of H.R. 5593, the Royalty Distribution Clarification Act of 2006.  Copyright Royalty Judges are responsible for distributing hundreds of millions of dollars in royalty payments to rightful copyright holders to make partial distributions of any noncontested royalties prior to the end of a distribution proceeding. The purpose of H.R. 5593 and the Senate amendment now before us is to provide the judges the ability to more efficiently administer their fiduciary duties and enable copyright holders whose works are used under the various compulsory licenses contained in title 17 of the United States Code to have greater access to their own funds.  Like the earlier version approved by the House, this iteration of H.R. 1036 makes only noncontroversial changes in the copyright royalty and distribution system.  The enactment of this bill will assist the CRJs and the Library of Congress in administering the copyright royalty and distribution system and help to resolve disputes in a more efficient, predictable, and rational and manner.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send it to the President for his signature.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
