Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, Congress is still in Washington, and we are here on a Sunday because the Republican leadership has simply failed to do their job. It is quite simple. For the first time in a quarter of a century, since the adoption of the Budget Act, Congress has failed to adopt even a first budget resolution.  The leaders of the House, otherwise known as the flatterer society, and the leaders of the Senate, perhaps a slightly more progressive group recognizing the shape of the earth, have failed to agree on the basics of a budget.  The leaders of the House want to have a huge tax cut raided from the Social Security trust funds. The leaders from the Senate somewhat prudently have not decided to do that.  But, then again, the leaders in the House, when confronted with anger across America from people being denied essential care for themselves and their loved ones, and physicians even rising in anger when they are being denied tests and care that they know that their patients want, with all that pressure, the insurance industry, which pretty much sponsors the other side of the aisle at election time, could not be fully protected.  So they passed, better than not, but not much of a patient and providers bill here in the House, an HMO bill. But even that was too much for the leaders in the Senate because it might jeopardize their fund-raising with the insurance industry in a year when they hope to make big gains in the Senate.  Of course tobacco, well, that did not go anywhere on either side with the Republican leaders, despite the fact that the American people are appalled to see the rise in teenage smoking and what that will yield 10 and 15 and 20 years down the road.  So here the Congress has no budget, many major bills denied. But at least we could salvage something. We could salvage the President's education initiative, something that all Members of Congress, no matter what side of the aisle they come from should be able to agree upon.  They should be able to go home to their own districts and see the fact that the schools are crumbling and overcrowded, and there are trailers parked on what used to be the playground because there are too many kids to fit in the school.  If they went inside the school, the public schools, they would find that the classes were about twice what they were when they were kids when they went to public school. A lot of people on the other side of the aisle did not. They would see that the teachers are carrying more classes and working harder. There is no counselors anymore in most of the schools. They would support the President's initiative to help add teachers to the schools, reduce class size, and rebuild our crumbling schools and make them safe for our kids.  But they tell us there is no money to do that. There is no money to do that. Wait a minute. Was it not the same leadership here on the House side just a couple of weeks ago who jammed through tax cuts that were paid for by raiding the Social Security Trust Fund, otherwise known as the budget surplus?                              {time}  1645  They could find money to do that. They could find money to cut taxes in an election year favoring the usual suspects. But no, there is no money for the schools and the kids and the teachers. They say there is no money.  Look at the Department of Defense appropriation this year. It adds $4.1 billion, not million, billion dollars of pork projects that were not requested by the Pentagon. This is the same Pentagon that has now come up to the hill and said, we need more money, we need gas for the tanks, the soldiers do not have ammunition, the housing is crumbling for the enlisted ranks. I want to take care of those things, but guess what, the Republican majority already spent that money. They spent it on pork projects that the Pentagon did not ask for. But they tell us there is no money for the kids and the schools and the teachers.  Now, somehow they can find money for the mythical space station that we are building with the former Soviet Union. This thing is only about 2,000, 3,000 percent over budget, 10 years behind schedule. We keep pretending that they are going to build parts of it over there. Now we have to pay them to build parts of it over there, in addition to building the parts over here, but pretending they are building them over there. It has no mission. There is $40 billion over the next 10 years. But there is no money for the schools and the kids and the teachers. What is wrong with these people? What is wrong with them? Where are their priorities?  Well, they do have some priorities when it comes to education. Eliminate the Department of Education, priority number one. Divert billions of dollars from public school funding to private school vouchers. That is their answer to the crumbling public schools. Andthe large class sizes and the lack of public funding, take that money and give it to the private schools. Cut school lunches for poor kids and end equal opportunity for higher education. Cut student loans, give higher subsidies to the banks so they will give some student loans.
