 President, today Senator Roberts and I are submitting a resolution on civic participation. The resolution has three provision: 1. It proclaims the week beginning September 15, 2002 as National Civic Participation Week; 2. It proclaims National Civic Participation Week as a week of programs and activities that encourage greater participation in elections and the political process; and 3. It requests the President to issue a proclamation calling on organizations and the people of the country to promote the use of technology in fostering civic participation through the dissemination of information.  The thrust of this resolution is to encourage activities among Americans, especially young people, to use technology to become more involved in the country's civic life.  As our Nation's leaders, it is our job to show Americans, especially young people, the importance of being involved in local, State, and national affairs.  Civic participation is the arena in which citizens can express their views and engage in dialogue and actions that, influence public policy and guide public officials to carry out the citizen's views and recommendations.  With advances in Internet technology and other computerized forms of communication, today we can offer citizens new and innovative ways of learning about and interacting with their local, State and Federal Government in an easily accessible way.  With only 65.9 percent of all Americans registered to vote in the 1996 Presidential election, according to the Federal Election Commission, the Civic Participation Week resolution will try to make more people aware of their right and responsibility to take an active role in government.  There is no question that we need more Americans involved in their government. In fact, our democracy depends on it. In the most recent Presidential election last year in the United States, only 50.7 percent of the registered voters actually voted, according to the November 9, 2000 Washington Post. This compares to 49 percent in the 1996 and 50.1 percent in the 1988 Federal elections.  Among young people, the voter turnout in this country is considerably lower. In the 18-21 age group, only 43.6 percent are registered to vote, and a dismal 18.5 percent actually voted in 1998, according to Federal Election Commission data.  In many other countries, the voter turnout is considerably higher than in the United States. According to the Federal Election Commission, in Kazakhstan's 1999 Presidential election, there was a 87.05 percent voter turnout. In Iceland, there was a 85.9 percent voter turnout in the 1996 Presidential election. The 1995 Presidential election in Argentina had a 80.9 percent turnout of registered voters.  Internet technology may be an especially effective way to reach young Americans because information is highly accessible. Available at the click of a mouse, and young people seem to prefer computers as an information-gathering tool over more traditional methods.  This use of new technology can help bring people together and can promote citizen participation in the political process through more volunteerism, easier access to information, and heightened activism in our Nation's civic life.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
