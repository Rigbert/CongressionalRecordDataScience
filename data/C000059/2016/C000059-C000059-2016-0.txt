Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the WIIN Act. The bill contains a number of provisions that help improve the water infrastructure across the country.  My home State of California continues to suffer from drought conditions and a water system that has failed to keep up with tremendous population growth. Thankfully, this bill contains a number of solutions that will help address California's water challenges.  In my experience, there are few things more difficult than water negotiations, and these negotiations over California water provisions proved to be no different.  I am also pleased that this bill includes legislation I introduced to finalize the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Water Rights Settlement.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senator Feinstein for making today possible, Chairman Shuster and his committee for their hard work, Kiel Weaver for his efforts to get California water across the line, and Ian Foley for his tireless work.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to engage the chairman and ranking member in a brief colloquy on behalf of the Connecticut congressional delegation and Long Island Sound.  The sound is a treasured and integral source, one that generates $9 billion annually through tourism, recreation, and economic activity, so the importance of dredging activities to our State and the larger region cannot be overstated.  Therefore, we seek clarification with the constant intent of section 1189 and the dredging provisions contained in the WIIN Act.  I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).
