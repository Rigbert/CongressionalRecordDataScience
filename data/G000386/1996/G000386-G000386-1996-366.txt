 President, I give myself 1 more minute, and the last minute I give to the Senator from Nebraska to close.  If we do not hold the Defense Department's feet to the fire, the savings will be frittered away on pork projects. Base closures and continued shrinkage in the force structure should have one inescapable result: lower infrastructure costs. I hope my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee will make sure that that happens.  I have referred to Senator McCain's white paper. Right at the top of Senator McCain's list of places to save money are infrastructure requirements. This is what he has to say:       Infrastructure and military force structure need to be      brought back into balance. Elimination of excess      infrastructure would reduce operating costs and free up funds      to maintain force readiness and to modernize our smaller      force.  I agree with my friend from Arizona 100 percent. I only hope that when we get to the defense authorization bill, he will help me find an enforcement mechanism. We need an enforcement mechanism.
