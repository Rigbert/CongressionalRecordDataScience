 President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding accomplishments and distinguished career of Mr. Arthur G. Stephenson upon his retirement as the Director of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. It has been a privilege for me to get to know Art. While retirement announcements are things that we do not like to hear when it involves someone who has been as vital to the success of an organization as Art has been to Marshall's, I would like to say how much I have enjoyed working with Art and his staff during his tenure as the Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.  As the Director of one of NASA's largest field installations, with more than 6,500 civil service and contract employees and an annual budget in excess of $2 billion, Art successfully managed a very broad range of activities for the U.S. space program. Some of these critical NASA initiatives included development of new reusable launch vehicles, space shuttle propulsion, advanced space transportation systems, second and third generation propulsion technology development programs, research in microgravity, and science payload operations aboard the International Space Station. He also oversaw the establishment of the National Space Science Technology Center, a partnership with universities and Federal agencies to conduct cutting-edge research. Art also oversaw the planning and establishment of the Propulsion Research Laboratory, a world-class laboratory for research into future space transportation and propulsion technology. Art has led the Marshall Center in numerous successful space shuttle launches in which Marshall was responsible for all propulsion elements. Under Art's direction, the Marshall Center has completed testing of the truss and pressurized modules for the International Space Station, and provided support for the construction and operation of the International Space Station, including Marshall's Payload Operations Center which controls all the science experiments aboard the space station.  Art brought more than 35 years of experience in the space industry to NASA and used it to the great benefit of the Marshall Center and the U.S. space program. I could list many additional achievements and professional accomplishments, and I believe that success is directly attributable to Art's record as an extraordinary leader throughout his career.  Art has been an important and respected member of the Huntsville community. I know that I speak for many people in Huntsville and everyone in the NASA family when I say that we all thank Art for his tireless commitment to NASA and to Marshall. We sincerely hope that he and his family will remain part of the Huntsville community for many years to come.                          ____________________
