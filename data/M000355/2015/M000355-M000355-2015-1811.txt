 President, reserving the right to object, just a correction to my good friend the majority leader. There is no Republican opposition to the consent request that the Democratic leader objected to. It is clear on our side. It would allow us to have a fair amendment process. If there are differences with the House, regular order has a remedy. It is called going to conference. None of this is possible while the Democrats continue filibustering even getting on the bill. So therefore, I object.
