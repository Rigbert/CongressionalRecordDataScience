 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me. The gentleman is correct in that we really want this bill to move as quickly as possible, get it through the other body, because contract letting is seasonal, particularly in the northern States and that contract letting needs to be done. So we are working as hard as we can to get this bill done.  Since this bill is very similar to the reauthorization that was passed in the last Congress, I would expect that the Committee on Rules would develop a rule that was very similar to that one that was used when we considered this bill last Congress which, if I recall, there were 23 amendments allowed under the rule, a manager's amendment. So we have to see what the Committee on Rules is going to do and see how we can divide the work between Wednesday and Thursday.
