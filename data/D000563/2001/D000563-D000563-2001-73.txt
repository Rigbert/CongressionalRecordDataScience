President, I ask the Senator to yield on this question as well: We have focused our discussion this morning on the question of tax policy and the impact of tax cuts on the people or companies that receive them. I want to ask the chairman of the Budget Committee to reflect for a moment on the difference between tax cuts and spending programs at this moment in our economy.  One of my colleagues noted that last night on the television they had the scroll that went across the screen and it said the difference between the economic stimulus package is that the Republicans are for tax cuts and the Democrats are for spending. That certainly doesn't express the contents or the direction of our own stimulus package, which includes tax cuts for working families as well as spending.  Could the Senator reflect on the effectiveness of spending contrasted to tax cuts when it comes to stimulating the economy? What value is there to providing a tax break of $1.4 billion for a major corporation, as opposed to saying we are going to take $1.4 billion and invest it in America? As a contrast, President Bush has proposed that to deal with bioterrorism we should give to State and local public health agencies nationwide $300 million.  That is supposed to respond to our concerns about bioterrorism. I think that is woefully inadequate.  Interestingly enough, the House Republican stimulus package gives $1.4 billion, almost five times as much, to one corporation, with no promise they will do anything in return.  So will the Senator from North Dakota comment on the use of spending for such things as school modernization, improving law enforcement at airports, protecting our infrastructure, and investing in public health to deal with bioterrorism as an economic stimulus?
