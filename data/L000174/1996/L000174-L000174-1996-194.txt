President, yesterday the Senate completed action on the fiscal year 1997 Defense appropriations bill. This is one of the most important annual appropriations bills and the largest; by itself it consumes about half of all discretionary spending. I had deep concerns about the bill because it added more than $10 billion to thePresident's request for defense. By my estimation this money was not necessary for our national security, especially when we are cutting nearly every other discretionary spending account as we move toward a balanced budget. I remain unconvinced that our defenses need vast infusions of new funds, and I disagree with some of defense priorities so ardently advocated by the majority.  Ballistic missile defenses receive $3.3 billion in this bill, which is $855 million above what the president requested. I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber who would argue against developing and deploying missile defense systems to protect our troops in the field. But many of my colleagues are anxious to embark on a missile defense spending spree that the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cost up to $60 billion. I would say to them that not only would that be a waste of taxpayer money, but could have the long-term effect of squeezing other necessary defense programs from the defense budget. It would be ironic if those who profess to care so much about our defenses end up undermining them instead.  I voted for a series of unsuccessful amendments to cut billions of dollars from both the Defense authorization and appropriations bills. However, I did vote for final passage of the Defense appropriations bill. While I disagree with the overall spending figures in the bill, Senators Stevens and Inouye did an excellent job of crafting legislation which will best serve our military. In particular, I am pleased that the bill includes $150 million for peer-reviewed breast cancer research, and $100 million for prostate cancer research. In addition, the bill provides a full 3 percent pay raise for our troops, as well as a 4 percent raise in the basic allowance for quarters. Finally, I worked hard to have money added to the bill so that Air National Guard F-16 units can maintain a cost-effective force structure.  In closing, I look forward to the results of the nonpartisan, independent National Defense Panel created by a 100 to nothing vote during the debate on the DOD authorization bill. This Commission will be tasked with reviewing our current defense program, and give an independent assessment of a variety of possible force structures through 2010. We owe it to the Nation to put the Defense Department through the same budgetary scrutiny that we are putting virtually every other category of Government spending.                          ____________________
