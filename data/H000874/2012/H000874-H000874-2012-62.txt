 You are so correct in studying the statistics of the Dow, having doubled. It's actually up now probably about 105, 110 percent. The Standard & Poor's is up more than double, and the NASDAQ is up more than double over those years. In January of 2009, I'm sure most people tragically remember, we lost 818,000 private sector jobs that month. Last month we gained 92,000 jobs.  Is there anybody who could say a loss of 818,000 jobs isn't a lot worse than the gain of 92,000 jobs--92,000 jobs is not enough. We need to do more. The President offered a jobs bill. It has not been brought to this floor, notwithstanding the fact in the Pledge to America they said this is a transparent Congress that would be allowed to work its will. That bill has not been brought to the floor.  For the last 30 months we have gained, straight, more jobs, 4.6 million jobs to be exactly correct, while 4.4 million jobs were lost in 2008 alone. Are we better off gaining 4.6 million as opposed to losing 4.4 million jobs?  We have had 12 straight quarters of economic growth. The last four quarters of 2008 in the last administration was a net 13 percent decrease in GDP. Yes, Mr. Speaker, the leader is correct. We're better off today, but we could be much better off. We ought to be better off if we hadn't walked away from a jobs bill, hadn't walked away from investing in an infrastructure bill that gave certainty.  We didn't even bring that bill to the floor. We walked away from making sure that the health care bill works properly, walked away--and I'm going to recognize Mr. Costa--walked away from the farmers of America, walked away this day as we have walked away in the past.  Mr. Costa is from farm country. He understands the pain being experienced in farm country, and he knows how terrible it is to have simply walked away, walked away from the House-passed bill out of committee and walked away from a bipartisan Senate bill. My friend is such a strong voice on this floor, such an active member of the Agriculture Committee and such a proponent of farm country, not only California, which he represents but through this country.  I yield to my friend.
