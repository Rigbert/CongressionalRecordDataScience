 President, it is my pleasure to support Judge Otis Wright, a distinguished nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  Judge Wright is nominated to a seat that has been designated as a judicial emergency. The Central District of California, based in Los Angeles, is the largest and busiest Federal judicial district in the Nation.  When this Congress began, there were five vacancies on this court more than twice as many as in any other judicial district in the country.  I am pleased that the Senate has already confirmed two new judges for the Central District this year, and I thank Chairman Leahy for moving the California judicial nominees quickly.  Judge Wright is a graduate of California State University at Los Angeles and of the Southwestern School of Law.  After graduating from law school, Judge Wright was a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice for 3 years. During that time he specialized in criminal appeals.  He went on to join the law firm of Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, where he became a partner during a career that spanned more than 20 years. He practiced civil litigation in many areas, with a particular focus on insurance coverage litigation.  While in private practice, Judge Wright was a volunteer attorney with the HIV AIDS Legal Services Alliance. His work on behalf of those with HIV and AIDS included housing and employment discrimination cases, as well as preparing wills for the terminally ill.  Judge Wright's public service has not been limited to his legal career: he was a deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department while attending college and law school, and before that he served in the U.S. Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserves.  He is one of only 16 African Americans who have been nominated to be federal judges in the 6 years that President Bush has been in office. During the first 6 years of the Clinton presidency, by contrast, 53 African Americans were nominated. Judge Wright will be a welcome addition to the bench.  In California we have developed a bipartisan process known as the Parsky Commission for selecting Federal district court nominees. Under this system, a committee of lawyers, including Democrats and Republicans, recommends qualified applicants to the President.  I am proud of this system and pleased to say that Judge Wright was recommended by the Parsky Commission. This gives me confidence that he comes to the bench without an ideological agenda and prepared to serve all the people of California.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Judge Wright's nomination.                   nomination of john preston bailey
