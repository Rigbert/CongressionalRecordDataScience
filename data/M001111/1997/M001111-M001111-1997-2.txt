 President, there are very few pieces of legislation that we will act on that has the kind of impact that S. 830 will have on improving the quality of lives for millions of Americans. Ultimately, this legislation will impact every Member of this body. S. 830 represents a historic piece of legislation that will reform and modernize the Food and Drug Administration.  This legislation will result in the more rapid approval of new, lifesaving drugs and medical devices without jeopardizing a strong public health protection role for the FDA. Millions of people will have access to break through medical technology faster. More children will also benefit from the rapid improvement in drugs and devices to treat serious and life-threatening illness. And, finally the FDA will be given the resources it needs to meet the challenges and demands of protecting the public health and approving safe and effective drugs in a more timely manner.  When I made the decision to seek a seat on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee I did so because I wanted to be directly involved in the development of education and public health reform. I am proud to have worked with Chairman Jeffords in his effort to shepherd through the FDA reform legislation. I know that at times this was a difficult task and his leadership and patience were truly tested. I want to thank him for his willingness to forge a bipartisan bill that addressed many of the concerns that I had early in the process. I also want to thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts on behalf of patients and consumers. Senator Kennedy's hard work and commitment to a strong public health role for FDA resulted in some real improvements in this legislation.  The fact that we have before us today a bipartisan reform agreement is in itself a historic accomplishment. Prior to the 105th Congress I thought that I had a pretty good understanding of how the agency worked and where improvements needed to be made. What I discovered is that the drug and device approval process from lab to patient is a complex process involving numerous steps. The pressure on the FDA to improve safe and effective drugs and devices with minimal delay is overwhelming. In addition, the FDA must regulate billion dollar industries that have almost unlimited resources. What I have learned from this process is that the FDA is by far one of the most important public health agencies, but it is also one that we all seem to take for granted.  S. 830 is not just about the reform or modernization of a Federal agency. The activities of the FDA effect every single one of us, every single day. Whether it is taking an aspirin or brushing our teeth the FDA was involved. It ensured that the aspirin and the toothpaste was safe and effective. The FDA manufacturing standards protect these products so that we can feel confident that they were not contaminated or tampered with prior to our purchase.  The agency is also involved in making sure that new technology to diagnosis or screen for life-threatening illnesses is reliable and that the claims made by the manufacturer are consistent with the available technology. The FDA must also ensure the safety and effectiveness of all drugs as well. When we pick up a prescription like an antibiotic at the pharmacy, we never think twice about the safety or effectiveness of the drug. We simply assume that if taken properly it is safe and effective at treating an ear infection. It is because of the success of the FDA that we do take so much of this for granted.  This is not to say that there have not been problems in the past. But, I believe the changes and improvements made by S. 830 addresses some of these problems and that the commitment made by the chairman to maintain aggressive and effective oversight of the agency will prevent significant problems in the future. I know that there are some who are skeptical of the reforms and modernization called for in this legislation and they point to past problems at the agency as their proof. I am not dismissing past mistakes by the FDA, but I also do not believe we can allow the past errors to paralyze the agency. We have to move toward the future, and learn from the mistakes of the past.  The agency has been given a daunting task with limited resources. However, it has become obvious over the years that a major modernization was necessary in order to keep pace with the rapid changes in drugs and devices and the globalization of the biotech industry. In 1992 the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA], the partnership between the agency and the prescription drug industry, was enacted. This major effort has proven to be a major success for the FDA, industry, and patients. I am pleased that we were able to include reauthorization of PDUFA in S. 830 that builds on the success of the 1992 legislation.  I am pleased that we have completed this process and are sending a solid, bipartisan bill to the President for signature. I am confident that enactment of S. 830, FDA Modernization and Accountability Act will prove to be one of the major accomplishments of the 105th Congress. I know that I am proud to have been directly involved in the development of this legislation.  I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy in the same bipartisan manner as we tackle other public health reform initiatives.                          ____________________
