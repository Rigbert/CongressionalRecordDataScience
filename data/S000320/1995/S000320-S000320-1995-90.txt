 The administration and the subcommittee have carefully reviewed the privatization issue. In February, OPM conducted a feasibility study and recently contracted out with another firm to present a business plan. That plan should address the steps OMP will take to ensure continued oversight of this important function.  However, my colleague from Illinois has raised several important points that I believe should be addressed. I will work to include language in the conference report that would require the GAO to study the questions raised by Senator Simon, including the potential impact on the quality of investigations, privacy issues, and national security concerns. I believe that before OPM moves to privatization, Congress should have the opportunity to review both the OPM and GAO reports on these issues.
