Speaker, I rise today to remind the House that Saturday, February 27, 1999 is National TRIO Day. That day has been set aside to focus the nation's attention on the needs of disadvantaged young people and adults aspiring to improve their lives through education. We recognize as a nation the importance of supporting our talented but needy citizens today if we are to benefit from their contributions tomorrow. I am sure the House shares my commitment to providing this support.  Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 generated a series of programs to help low-income, first generation, disabled Americans enter college and graduate. Initially, there were just three programs--hence the TRIO title. Today there are five. These include the Educational Opportunity Centers Program, the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, the Student Support Program, the Talent Search Program, and the Upward Bound Program.  TRIO Programs help students overcome class, social, academic, and cultural barriers to higher education and provide a variety of services critical to academic success, such as advising, career exploration, mentoring, and tutoring.  TRIO Programs make a difference. For instance, students in the Upward Bound Program are four times more likely to earn an undergraduate degree than students from similar backgrounds who did not participate in TRIO. Participants in the TRIO Students Support Program are more than twice as likely to remain in college as students from similar backgrounds who did not participate in the program.  Mr. Speaker, an excellent model of a TRIO Program can be found at an institution in my home district. At Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, participants in the Student Support Program have a remarkable track record of success. Their achievements include the following:  95% of all students who receive program services for two consecutive semesters return to school for a third semester.  More than 75% of undergraduates in the Student Support Program had grade point averages at or above 2.5 during the 1997-98 school year.  More than 98% of Student Support Program students who apply for graduation during their junior year graduate.  Statistics are a useful measure of the Student Support Program's success at Western Michigan University. However, stories of students' personal accomplishments in the face of adversity also testify to the program's impact on individuals lives. Consider, for example one shy and uncertain young woman who entered the Student Support Program three years ago as a freshman.  Unfamiliar with the academic world and undecided about her direction, she gradually gained confidence in her own potential and ability. Eventually she was inspired to help other students adjust to the demands of college life by becoming a Peer Mentor in the program. She is now knowledgeable and secure enough to offer others the support she once needed herself. Next year she will graduate with a bachelor's degree in Social Work.  Another bright and promising student in the program struggled with a learning disability that affected the way he processed information. In spite of this, he was determined to earn a degree in business. As he battled on through math and accounting, often repeating courses, his Peer Mentor provided unwavering support and encouragement. This young man overcame countless challenges and, in December 1998, realized his dream when he was awarded a bachelor's degree in business.  Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Student Support Program at Western Michigan University, these two students are examples of the thousands of students in a position to make their best contributions to our society.                          ____________________
