Speaker, I recall yesterday when the death tax repeal was on the floor. It was a similar rule, and the minority was offered a chance to offer a substitute. They offered a substitute which was voted on and debated in the House of Representatives. But that rule passed by voice vote. So the rule under which we considered the death tax repeal yesterday is the same type of rule that we are considering today, except that the minority on this bill decided not to offer a constructive alternative substitute.
