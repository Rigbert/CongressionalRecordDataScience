 On September 11, 2001, we endured the most atrocious and devastating attacks on our soil. After such tragic events, we searched for answers and solace and found leaders and hope. Amidst the rubble and ashes, have arisen tales of heroism, courage and compassion and we, as a nation, have emerged stronger and more united. Indeed, African Americans have contributed enormously to this outcome. As we celebrate Black History Month and honor those outstanding heroes of the past, we should also take this time to recognize the leaders of the present and their outstanding efforts.  In the political arena, leadership among African Americans has transcended political and racial lines. One need look no further than to Colin Powell, our Secretary of State and Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser to the President. Both have served the country ardently and tirelessly during our war against terrorism.  In times of economic uncertainty, we can look to Kenneth Chenault, the Chief Executive Officer of American Express; E. Stanley O'Neal, poised to become CEO at Merrill Lynch; and Richard Parsons, soon to become CEO at AOL Time Warner, all models of successful economic achievement and leadership.  From Washington, D.C. to Wall Street, African Americans have left an indelible impression on the face of American recovery and strength. Yet while these leaders have played their tremendous roles on the national stage, African Americans in communities across the country have made contributions of innumerable value. Let us not forget that the strength of our Nation is inextricably linked to the fabric of our communities.  In my hometown of San Francisco, Reverend Cecil Williams has served for 35 years as the Pastor of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church. Rev. Williams was one of five students to break the race barrier at Southern Methodist University in the 1950s and accompanied Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1963 civil rights march. Under his leadership, the Glide Church has over 9,000 members and has become the most comprehensive nonprofit provider of human services in the city. The church maintains a wide variety of community outreach and assistance programs, such as providing people with three meals a day, 365 days a year, substance abuse treatment, support against domestic violence, job re-entry help and a free health clinic.  In Los Angeles, one can find the headquarters of Operation HOPE, Inc., America's first non-profit social investment banking organization, founded by John Bryant. John is also the chairman of the board and CEO of the community-based banking organization, which strives to bring economic self-sufficiency and revitalization to inner city communities. In 1994, John was selected by Time magazine as ``One of America's 50 Most Promising Leaders of the Future'' and just last year he was the recipient of Oprah Winfrey's Angel Network ``Use Your Life'' Award. As a result of his hard work and ingenuity, Operation HOPE, Inc. has indeed become a symbol of hope to many.  Miriam Shipp-Tolliver-El has helped educate an estimated 1,200 students during her 36 years as a teacher of children from kindergarten through eighth grade in the Oceanside Unified School District and 25 years as an adjunct professor at Palomar College in Oceanside, CA. Miriam encountered many racial barriers during her childhood in North Carolina. While in high school in the 1940s, she hoped to become a Roman Catholic nun, but no convents would accept an African American woman. Her next choice of becoming a civil rights lawyer was also unfulfilled because law schools in her area would not admit African American students. So Miriam became a teacher and a very accomplished one at that. She was a co-founder of the North County NAACP chapter in Oceanside. She also created a multicultural program in Oceanside schools and started black studies classes at the college. Just last year, at the age of 73, Miriam was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the NAACP chapter and a commendation from the city of Oceanside for her endeavors and achievements.  These are but simply a few of the African American leaders that serve as wonderful role models present in our communities. Countless others serve each day in several capacities such as doctors, counselors, police officers and municipal workers and their constant contributions have helped make our country as strong as it has ever been.  As Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, stated:       If we accept and acquiesce in the face of discrimination,      we accept the responsibility ourselves and allow those      responsible to salve their conscience by believing that they      have our acceptance and concurrence.  If the events of September 11 have proven anything, it is that we must not harbor hatred nor tolerate discrimination. Now more than ever, we must embrace our differences and learn from one another. We have proven that we can stand together, united against the face of terror and threat of evil, and overcome. That determination, spirit and resolve would not be possible without the many contributions of African Americans at both national and local levels. I applaud their achievements and encourage my fellow Californians to do the same.                          ____________________
