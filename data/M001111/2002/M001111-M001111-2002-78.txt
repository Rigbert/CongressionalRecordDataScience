 President, I rise today with my colleague from the State of Washington to impress on this body just how important elements of this legislation are to the workers in the Pacific Northwest and the Nation.  As my colleagues know, Washington and Oregon have the highest unemployment rates in the Nation right now.  The economy of the Northwest has been struggling for some time and September 11 only made things worse.  Last year, Boeing, Washington's largest employer, announced they would be cutting 30,000 jobs within a year. Most of those jobs would be out of Washington State. To date, 10,000 dedicated Boeing workers have been handed their pink slips. That number doesn't include the thousands of jobs that are being lost by those dependent on Boeing.  Washington State is also a high-tech dependent State. The downturn in that sector has left many in the Northwest without a job.  These massive lay-offs, uncertainty in the economy, and fear of another terrorist attack have crippled the economies of the Northwest.  We are expecting that the layoffs may reach 40 to 65,000 by the end of this year.  So the importance of the legislation is paramount--but the devil's in the details--and so we have worked to make sure that the language passed by the House will provide the maximum stimulus possible to workers throughout this Nation.  My colleague, Senator Cantwell, has been diligent in monitoring this legislation and we have worked in tandem to ensure that States in such great need do not have their support decreased because those States have proactively made efforts to provide extended benefits to workers in advance of the passage of this legislation.  I understand that the majority leader has agreed to engage in a colloquy on this matter with myself and Senator Cantwell so that we may clarify that the legislation will, in fact, have it's intended stimulative impact on our State.  At this time, I yield back to the majority leader and look forward to his response.
