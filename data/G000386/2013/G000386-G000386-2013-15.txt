 President, we didn't have a chance to debate the change in rules, and we should have, so I am going to speak now on some things I think should have been said before we voted--not that it would have changed the outcome but because we ought to have known what we weredoing before we vote rather than afterward. So I will spend a few minutes discussing what the majority leader did on the so-called nuclear option.  Unfortunately, this wasn't a new threat. Over the last several years, every time the minority has chosen to exercise his rights under the Senate rules, the majority has threatened to change the rules. In fact, this is the third time in just the last year or so that the majority leader has said that if he didn't get his way on nominations, he would change the rules. Ironically, that is about as many judicial nominees as our side has stopped through a filibuster--three or so.  Prior to the recent attempt by the President to simultaneously add three judges who are not needed to the DC Circuit, Republicans had stopped a grand total of 2 of President Obama's judicial nominees--not 10, as the Democrats had by President Bush's fifth year in office; not 34, as one of my colleagues tried to suggest earlier this week; no, only 2 had been stopped. If we include the nominees for the DC Circuit, we have stopped a grand total of 5--again, not 10, as the Democrats did in 2005; not 34, as one of my colleagues tried to argue earlier this week but 5. During that same time we have confirmed 209 lower court Article III judges. That is a record of 209 judges approved to 5 who were not approved. So this threat isn't based on any crisis. There is no crisis.  I would note that today's Wall Street Journal editorial entitled ``DC Circuit Breakers: The White House wants to pack a court whose judges are underworked'' lays out the caseload pretty clearly.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial to which I just referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 21, 2013]                         D.C. Circuit Breakers              (By the Wall Street Journal Editorial Staff)       The White House wants to pack a court whose judges are      underworked.       We remember when a ``judicial emergency'' was the Senate's      way of calling attention to vacancies based on a court's      caseload. Those were the good old days. Now Democrats are      threatening to change Senate rules if Republicans don't      acquiesce to their plan to confirm three new judges to the      most underworked appellate circuit in the country.       That's the story behind the fight over the D.C. Circuit      Court of Appeals, with the White House trying to pack the      court that reviews much of its regulatory agenda. On Monday      Senate Republicans blocked the third nominee to the D.C.      appellate court in recent weeks, and Democrats with short      memories of their judicial filibusters in the Bush years are      claiming this is unprecedented. Majority Leader Harry Reid      and other Democrats are threatening to resort to the so-     called nuclear option, which would let the Senate confirm      judicial nominees by a simple majority vote.       This is nothing but a political power play because the D.C.      Circuit doesn't need the new judges. It currently has 11      authorized judgeships and eight active judges--four appointed      by Democratic Presidents and four by Republicans. The court      also has six senior judges who hear cases varying from 25% to      75% of an active judge's caseload. Together they carry the      equivalent caseload of 3.25 active judges, according to      numbers from Chief Judge Merrick Garland. That means the      circuit has the equivalent of 11.25 full-time judges.       That's more than enough considering that the court's      caseload is the lightest in the country. For the 12-months      ending in September, the D.C. Circuit had 149 appeals filed      per active judge. By comparison, the 11th Circuit had 778      appeals filed per active judge for the same period. If all      three nominees to the D.C. Circuit were confirmed, the number      of appeals per active judge would be 108, while a full slate      on the 11th Circuit would be 583 appeals per judge. The      national average of appeals per active judge is 383. The      closest to the D.C. Circuit is the 10th Circuit, at 217      appeals.       Liberal Senator Pat Leahy claims that these comparisons      don't matter because the D.C. Circuit handles complex      rulemakings by federal agencies and sensitive national      security cases. But the truth is that all the circuits handle      complicated cases. And even many regulatory cases have been      migrating to other circuits as some of the D.C. Circuit's      stars have taken senior status.       According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,      42.9% of the D.C. Circuit's caseload is made up of      administrative appeals of federal rules or regulations, the      highest percentage of any circuit. In raw numbers, the D.C.      Circuit is not carrying the heaviest load. That honor goes to      the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.       Democrats are in a rush to confirm as many judges as      possible because they know the clock is ticking on the Obama      second term. Liberals have criticized the White House for its      slow pace of nominations, but that isn't the fault of      Republicans. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking      Republican on Judiciary who has led the fight against more      D.C. Circuit confirmations, has been entirely consistent. In      the Bush years he opposed the nomination of a twelfth judge      for the court on workload grounds.       GOP Senators watched for years as Senate Democrats blocked      George W. Bush's nominees to the D.C. Circuit, including the      eminently qualified Miguel Estrada and Peter Keisler.      Republicans are right to say that the D.C. Circuit now has a      full complement of judges following the unanimous      confirmation of Obama nominee Sri Srinivasan in May.       Mr. Reid and his fellow Democrats are claiming that even if      they establish a new standard of 51 votes to confirm      appellate judges and executive-branch officials, they can      keep the 60 vote standard for the Supreme Court. They're      kidding themselves. If they change the rules to pack the D.C.      Circuit, Democrats should understand they are also setting      that standard for future Supreme Court nominees opposed to      Roe v. Wade.
