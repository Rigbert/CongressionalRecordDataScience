 Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We want to follow precedent as to how we want to approach the debate on the budget, and certainly I do not want to make decisions for the Committee on Rules. They are more than capable of making their own decisions about how to bring the budget to the floor and what kind of debate we will have. But as the gentleman has already noted, we have always been open to alternatives to the majority's budget as laid out by the Committee on the Budget.  The Congressional Black Caucus has always had a substitute and others have had substitutes. I think this is because it is such an important issue, the budget of this Nation and its government; and we are hoping to have as open a debate as possible.
