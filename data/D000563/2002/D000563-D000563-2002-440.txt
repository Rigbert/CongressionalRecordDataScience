President, I rise today to speak as a cosponsor of an amendment by my colleague, Senator Santorum, regarding puppy mills. This amendment is based on legislation we introduced last October, S. 1478, known as the Puppy Protection Act.  For more than three decades, Congress has given the responsibility of ensuring minimum standards of humane care and treatment of animals to the Department of Agriculture, under the Federal Animal Welfare Act.  The current guidelines within the Animal Welfare Act do not go far enough to protect puppies at large breeding facilities, they merely provide for water and food, and that is questionable. By amending the Animal Welfare Act our amendment will better control the practices of puppy breeding in large facilities and address cruel puppy treatment.  In these large facilities, puppies are often kept in cramped, dirty cages, sometimes stacked on top of each other, exposed to the elements in extreme cold and heat, forced to breed incessantly; and deprived of adequate food, water, veterinary care, and any semblance of loving contact. I have a chart that outlines the top 10 violations committed by commercial dog breeding facilities according to the USDA. These 10 points underscore the fact that something has to be done to stop the cruel treatment of puppies. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my chart, and a letter from the Humane Society of the United States be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
