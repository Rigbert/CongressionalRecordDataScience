 President, last week, more than 1200 students from across the nation came to Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program. I am proud to announce that the competing class for Kentucky represented Louisville Male High School. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in the Commonwealth.  The distinguished members of the class who represented Kentucky were: Angela Adams, Perry Bacon, Katherine Breeding, Will Carle, Eric Coatley, Courtney Coffee, Brian Davis, Mary Fleming, Matt Gilbert, Amanda Holloway, Holly Jessie, Heath Lambert, Gwen Malone, Kristy Martin, Brian Palmer, Lauren Reynolds, Shane Skoner, LaVonda Willis, Bryan Wilson, Darreshia Wilson, Beth Wilson, Janelle Winfree, Treva Winlock, Jodie Zeller.  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandy Hoover, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The state coordinators, Deborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, and the district coordinator, Dianne Meredith, also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the class reach the national finals.  The ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of adult judges.  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People . . .'' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers.  The ``We the People . . .'' program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic dispositions or traits of public and private character conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government.  I want to commend these constitutional experts on their academic achievements as participants in the ``We the People . . .'' program and commend them for their great achievement in reaching the national finals.                          ____________________
