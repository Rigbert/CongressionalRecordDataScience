Chairman, let me say that I support her amendment because what her amendment does is it applies the DOD contracting rights that were passed in last year's defense authorization bill to procurement by the other Federal agencies that would be covered by this bill. So there is a uniform standard of agency contracting rights. And we would not have one set of rules for the Defense Department and another set of rules for the rest of the government agencies.  I believe that this amendment is a constructive addition, and I am pleased to support it.
