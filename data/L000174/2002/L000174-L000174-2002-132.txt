In less than 15 months we have confirmed more judges that the Republican majority confirmed in its final 30 months in the majority. We have been more than twice as productive as they were and Republicans are nonetheless complaining that we have not worked three or four times as fast as they did to fill vacancies their inaction perpetuated.  The Senate has now confirmed more judges than were confirmed in all of 1989 and 1990, the first two years of the first Bush Administration, and almost 40 percent more confirmations than in the first 15 months of the Reagan or Clinton Administration, both of which were cooperating with a Senate majority of the same political party.  Another stark comparison would be between how we have proceeded this year and how the recent Republican majority proceeded in the years they were in the Senate majority but the President was a Democrat. In the 1996 session for example, the second full year in which the Republican majority was in control of progress on President Clinton's judicial nominees, the Republican majority allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed the entire year. Not a single circuit court judge was confirmed that entire session all year--not one. By contrast, just since January, in this the second session of this Congress, this Democratic Senate has already confirmed 180 percent more judges than were confirmed in the second year of the Republican majority. We have also already confirmed seven judges to the circuit courts, which is seven more than were confirmed in the 1996 session.                          ____________________
