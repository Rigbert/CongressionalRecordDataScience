 Let me say, Mr. Majority Leader, I know there has been discussion on your side and my side of the aisle. I know Mrs. Lowey is working with Mr. Rogers to effect an omnibus appropriations bill.  As we all know, not a single appropriations bill has been adopted. We are operating under a continuing resolution. That is not giving the stability that we need to give to the agencies to know what resources they have to accomplish the objectives we expect.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not his expectation is we will proceed with an omnibus out of the Appropriations Committee before December 11?  It is not on the schedule for next week. My presumption it would be, therefore, hopefully on the schedule for the first week in December when we get back so that we can send it to the Senate to be adopted.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is right. We did pass seven of the 12 and 11 of the 12 out of committee. Unfortunately, the Senate had passed none.  The best way for this House and this country to work is through regular order, and we hope to be able to get that back with the new Senate.  The gentleman is right. It is not scheduled for next week. No decisions are made, but there is a possibility that we could end on an omnibus in December.
