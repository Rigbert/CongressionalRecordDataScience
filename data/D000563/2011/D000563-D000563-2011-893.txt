President, 3 years ago today, a mentally disturbed gunman walked into a campus lecture hall at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb and shot 22 students, killing 5 of them.  John Peters, the president of Northern Illinois University, the students, families, faculty, and employees pulled together after that tragedy, and I joined them at an observance with then Senator and now President Obama to acknowledge the grief they all felt and we shared. I am proud to report that the Northern Illinois University community is stronger and more resilient today than ever.  In the aftermath of the shooting, we asked a lot of questions about what led to it. Naturally, there were so many innocent victims. We asked what we could have done to prevent it. Three years later, we are still trying to make sense of it.  Some believe that nothing can be done if a disturbed person is determined to commit an act of violence. But I believe something can be done.  For a long time, we have overlooked a very obvious and very compelling fact. Many young people do not demonstrate serious mental illness until they have left their home and high school and go off to college. We have overlooked the mental health of students on campuses.  Many mental illnesses manifest in this period when young people leave the security of home, regular medical care, and the support of a network of family and friends.  A friend of our family, a young man, went to the same university over 30 years ago. Gary was a peculiar kind of his own type of person in high school. But within 30 days at the university, living in a college dorm, certain mental illnesses we were not even aware of manifested themselves and he suffered from schizophrenia the rest of his short life. It manifested itself at that campus.  It is easier for a young person's problems to go unnoticed when they are away from parents, old friends, and the high school community. Sometimes they get worse. People do not even notice.
