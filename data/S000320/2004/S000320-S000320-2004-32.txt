 President, I rise today to recognize the University of Alabama School of Law for their outstanding ranking among the country's law schools. U.S. News and World Report recently released its annual list of the Top 100 Law Schools, and ranked the University of Alabama School of Law fortieth in the Nation. This ranking places the Law School in the top tier of law schools nationwide, which is phenomenal considering the institution was ranked in the third tier just 8 years ago in 1996. As a graduate of the law school myself, I am proud to see their elevation to one of the premier law schools in the Nation.  I believe that much of the school's success must be attributed to the dean of the Law School, Kenneth Randall. Dean Randall holds four law degrees, including a doctorate from the Columbia University School of Law, 1988; a master's from Columbia, 1985; a master's from Yale University, 1982; and a juris doctor degree from Hofstra University, 1981. Additionally, Dean Randall received a bachelor of arts degree in English literature from Aldelphi University on Long Island. Indeed, his educational background is outstanding, and he has demonstrated a true enthusiasm for the law.  Since taking the reins as dean in 1993, Dean Randall has provided a clearvision for the institution. He takes great pride in the success of the law school, and has done so since joining the faculty in 1985. I am hopeful that his career path keeps him here in Tuscaloosa for many years to come.  The education of our young people is critical to the success of our Nation, and the University of Alabama School of Law is committed to providing students with the tools necessary to succeed. I believe the dedication of Dean Randall, the administration, faculty, and alumni has created an environment that allows students to achieve their goals and exceed their own expectations.  I extend my sincerest congratulations to the University of Alabama School of Law for its remarkable success and look forward to celebrating more achievements in the future.                          ____________________
