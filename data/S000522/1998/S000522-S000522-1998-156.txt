Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation of the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the Child Custody Protection Act.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues may recall that when the partial-birth abortion ban became an issue, many pro-abortion organizations, including Planned Parenthood Federation of America and their research arm, the Guttmacher Institute wrote a letter saying there are 500 partial-birth abortions every year in the entire country. That statement, just like other statements that they made, turned out to be bogus, turned out to be a lie.  It was a New Jersey newspaper that broke the story that just one clinic in my State, the Metropolitan Medical Associates in Englewood, did about 1,500 partial-birth abortions each and every year, many of them on teenagers.  Now we find that the Metropolitan Medical Associates and other abortion mills in the State of New Jersey advertise and market their business in Pennsylvania and elsewhere and use the fact that New Jersey does not have a parental consent or parental notice statute as a way of luring young girls to that clinic and to other clinics. If we look at this ad, it stresses that pregnancies are terminated up to 24 weeks without parental knowledge or consent.  These ads are telling teens ``Hey, we can end your pregnancy and your baby's life and your parents don't have to know.'' But if a teenager's secret abortion leads to complications, what happens then? Where is it written that the person driving the frightened and vulnerable 13 or 14-year-old to an abortion mill is responsible? No, her parents will be responsible for and involved in her care after the abortion--when the disaster hit. They should have had the chance to be involved at the beginning--and they would have if the state law had not been evaded.  We need to say that the law does matter. We need to say that parents matter. And we need to help those vulnerable children who are being carried across state lines and pushed into abortion clinics by relative strangers who, in most cases, have their own reasons for making sure that these girls get abortions.  Support the Child Custody Protection Act.                          ____________________
