Speaker, it is my honor to commend to you and my other distinguished colleagues, Ms. Irene Ketchum, an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District. Irene is a shining example of commendable dedication to voluntarism. At the end of 1996, in recognition of her unselfish commitment to the community of northwest Indiana, Indiana State Representative Dan Stevenson of Hammond, IN, presented Irene with Indiana's highest honor designated by Governor Evan Bayh, the Sagamore of the Wabash. This distinguished award was bestowed upon her at a Democratic precinct open house at the Wicker Park Social Center.  Irene's distinguished career includes being managing editor of the Herald Newspapers in Gary, IN, from 1950-55. From 1956 to 1979, Irene served as clerk treasurer for the town of Highland, and in 1980, she became a trustee and board secretary of the Lake County Public Library.  Over the years, Irene has devoted her time to many community service organizations. She has served as treasurer of the Highland Community Events Council, president of the Highland Women's Democratic Club, and auditor of the Highland Democratic Club. Moreover, Irene has served as treasurer, secretary, vice president, and president of the Indiana League of Municipal Clerks and Treasurers, and she is a lifetime member of the Girl Scouts of America USA. In 1995, the Girl Scouts Calumet Council honored Irene with its Woman of Distinction Award.  Irene unselfishly spends 1 day a week at an east Chicago, Indiana church rectory, doing office work, and 1 day a week at Our Lady of Grace school library. Irene also aids the Hammond Public Library with the program for seniors once a month. Currently, Irene is treasurer for the St. John Deanery Council of Catholic Women, and she is president of the Our lady of Grace Court 80, National Catholic Society of Foresters.  In a country that benefits immensely from voluntarism, Irene has proven that unselfishness has unlimited rewards that do not go unrecognized. Irene can be proud of her efforts to enrich the caliber of life in Indiana's First Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in commending Irene for her lifetime devotion to community service.                          ____________________
