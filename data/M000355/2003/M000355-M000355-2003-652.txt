 President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2658, the Department of Defense appropriations bill. The chairman and ranking member were able to work through several amendments today, and the Senate will continue the amendment process tomorrow morning. Several Senators still wish to speak on the bill, and I encourage all Members who wish to offer an amendment to contact the chairman or the ranking member so they can schedule an orderly consideration of all amendments. We remain hopeful that the Senate can complete action on this vital appropriations bill during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
