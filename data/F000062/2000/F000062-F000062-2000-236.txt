 President, on January 3rd, 2000, Charles Schulz published his last daily ``Peanuts'' comic strip ending a remarkable fifty year run. To commemorate Charles Schulz's extraordinary career, I urge my colleagues to join me in awarding him a Congressional Medal of Honor.  Charles Schulz's body of work in the ``Peanuts'' strip deserves recognition as a national treasure. For half a century, his cartoon illustrations have inspired millions of Americans with its wry humor and endearing cast of characters. Who has not been touched by the trials and tribulations of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and the rest of the ``Peanuts'' family?  At its peak, Peanuts appeared in close to 3,000 newspapers in 75 countries and was published in over 20 different languages to more than 355 million daily readers. Charles Schulz's television special, ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' has run for 34 consecutive years. In all, more that 60 animated specials have been created based on ``Peanuts'' characters. Four feature films, 1,400 books, and a hit Broadway musical about the ``Peanuts'' characters also have been produced.  Charles Schulz's achievements are all the more remarkable because, throughout his career, he has worked without any artistic assistants, unlike most syndicated cartoonists. Schulz has painstakingly drawn every line and frame in his comic strip for 50 years, an unparalleled commitment to his art and profession.  In 1994, while speaking before the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz said of his comic strip, ``There's still a market for things that are clean and decent.'' Charles Schulz has given generations of children a cast of colorful characters to grow up with and to teach the small and large lessons of life.  Seventeen Americans from the arts and entertainment world have been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their achievements in the enrichment of American culture. I urge that Charles Schulz become the eighteenth individual so honored. Please join me in recognizing the lifetime contributions of Charles Schulz by awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal.                                 ______                                       By
