I'll tell you, actually, thatI live in a region that has a number of dormant volcanoes--not extinct, but dormant--and it is crucial.  Three Sisters has got a bulge on it. We're watching that all the time. There is the potential for a big lahar that could wipe out some communities and people downstream. Certainly, up in the Seattle area, there are concerns about Mt. Rainier. We have Mt. Hood and others.  So all of these attacks on emergency services seem to come with all of the juice that Bobby Jindal got out of criticizing volcano monitoring. Well, I think it's pretty darned important to monitor volcanoes, too.
