 President, I rise at this time to introduce two bills. Both bills are designed to encourage what is known in the legal world as arbitration, which is a type of alternative dispute resolution and a means of settling differences instead of litigating them in the costly environment and adversarial environment of the courts.  Our great American leader, Abraham Lincoln, wrote over 140 years ago, in 1840: ``Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.'' That is exactly what these two bills are designed to do.  For over 20 years now, all three branches have looked for ways to alleviate the courts' crowded docket and to enable a civil litigant to have his complaint heard in a more expedient fashion. In 1976, in search of alternatives, Chief Justice Burger convened the Pound Conference on the Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice and asked its members: ``Isn't there a better way?''  There is, and that way is called alternative dispute resolution. Most State and Federal bar associations now have alternative dispute resolution committees. Some have even elevated consideration of ADR approaches to a matter of professional ethics or its equivalent. Almost all law schools across the country now offer their students classes in ADR. Many graduate programs, especially business schools, have added ADR courses to their curriculum. And numerous legal and business publications are committed exclusively to the topic of alternative dispute resolution.  Contracts, be they between nations, major corporations, or even private individuals, now more often than not include arbitration clauses. There are numerous professional and trade associations under the umbrella of alternative dispute resolution. ADR is not a legal vogue, nor is it second-class justice. ADR is an intelligent and efficient alternative to litigation, and it is a way to ensure that civil matters can be handled as quickly as possible with low cost to the parties and with an outstanding settlement and satisfaction rate among all entities involved. Arbitration in particular combines procedural protections with the informality necessary for parties to discuss their positions in a manner that promotes settlement and allows for a detailed exploration of the issues.  In 1990, Congress enacted bills to authorize implementation of ADR programs throughout the administrative agency apparatus and to ask Federal courts to consider ADR as a means to reduce cost. For example, on November 15, 1990, President Bush signed into law a bill which I introduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. This act authorized and promoted the use of alternative dispute resolution by Federal Government agencies.  Almost immediately, the success of the bill became evident. In 1992, for example, agencies reported that over 70 percent of the disputes submitted to ADR reached settlement. Often mere discussion of what ADR techniques to apply led to agreement between the parties. Last year, in a unified showing of support for the idea of ADR, including arbitration, we permanently reauthorized that 1990 act. 1990 also saw the passage of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, which authorized the use of negotiated rulemaking as an alternative toadversarial rulemaking in Federal agencies, and the Civil Justice Reform Act, which required every Federal district court to develop a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan.  To test the ADR waters in the article III courts, in 1988, Congress amended the Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Act and authorized pilot programs in 20 Federal district courts. The amendment made court-annexed, nonbinding arbitration mandatory in 10 districts and voluntary in the other 10. The results are in, and they are more than encouraging. Therefore, the first bill I am introducing today will permanently extend authorization of these pilot programs so that these courts can continue to provide litigants with efficient and successful alternatives to trial. Senator Specter, whose own home State of Pennsylvania has participated in this program, is joining me in this effort.  Over half of the Nation's 94 districts currently offer some type of alternative dispute resolution. This number seems low, and the reason for that is because many districts are not sure whether courts other than those authorized by statute may offer ADR. Therefore, to eliminate this uncertainty, the second bill I am introducing not only authorizes district courts across the Nation to implement arbitration programs and procedures, it demands such implementation. It will then be left to the discretion of each judge, however, whether to make use of the implemented programs and procedures.  The major goal of arbitration is to encourage litigants to settle their disputes without going through the lengthy and costly process of a full-blown trial. This will not only lessen the burden on the judicial branch, but also enable people who feel they have been wronged to get a decision without waiting months for the usual verdict and without spending tons of money on attorney's fees.  Let me just give an example, and this is according to the National Law Journal. It was an article that was published last year. It has been determined that out of every dollar spent in asbestos litigation, only 39 cents goes to victims, with approximately 33 to 50 percent of the awards collected allocated as attorney's fees.  My arbitration bills are designed to curb exactly this type of ``plaintiff-milking.'' In the pilot program districts, the majority of arbitration cases closed before even reaching the arbitration hearing level and over two-thirds did not return to the court's regular calendar, thus saving not only the litigants, but also the courts and, therefore, the public both time and money. In the New Jersey program, about 20 percent of the civil case filings qualified for mandatory arbitration over the 8-year period which the program operated. Less than 2 percent of those cases required trial; in other words, 98 percent of those cases could be settled via arbitration.  A majority of the attorneys involved in arbitration cases agreed that referring the case to the program directly resulted in earlier settlement discussions and, most important, in avoiding litigation. For the parties involved, that means their issues were resolved from 2 to 18 months sooner than if the case had gone to trial. In the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as an example, the median time until a dispute is resolved through ADR is 5 months. Only 7 percent of the district's arbitration cases lasted beyond 9 months and the percentage of cases tried de novo is less than 10 percent.  Litigants, attorneys, and judges all are more than laudatory of the program's results. As a matter of fact, positive reaction could be documented almost as soon as the program was implemented. A 1990 report by the Federal Judicial Center illustrates this point. Over 80 percent of the litigants surveyed praised the fairness of the ADR process; 84 percent of attorneys surveyed said that they approved of arbitration both as a concept and, more important, as implemented in their specific districts.  Also, an overwhelming 97 percent of the judges involved in the program agreed that their civil caseload was reduced since less than a third of the arbitration caseload returns to the regular trial calendar. The resounding consensus was that other districts should also adopt this outstanding program as a result of this experiment.  Let me give you another example of the success of ADR. A November 1996 study of the Judicial Council of California, on California's Civil Action Mediation Act, showed that litigant satisfaction for arbitration in the Los Angeles County Superior Court was 84 percent and that 94 percent of the overall respondents would use arbitration again.  Incidentally, that same study showed that the program's mediation process within 2 years produced savings five times higher than what the California Legislature had targeted for 5 years. In other words, California had targeted $250,000 after 5 years to consider the mediation program a success. ADR saved the courts a total of $1.3 million in just 2 years. Whether it is mediation, arbitration, or any other of the ADR techniques, alternative dispute resolution undoubtedly is successful in creating huge savings for both the public and the litigants.  The benefits of arbitration, not only to the judicial branch, but, more important, to the litigants, are impossible to ignore. Skeptics argue that the litigant will feel he is being subjected to second-class justice, but, quite frankly, the opposite is the case. Litigants feel that they are much more closely involved in the process than would be the case if there was formal adjudication. Litigants can participate much more actively and have much more control over what is decided and how it is decided. Negotiation, rather than adjudication, is the goal. And when all is said and done, unlike after a trial, the parties on opposite sides of the table often still have some type of positive relationship.  On top of that, the process is private, unlike the public trial. In such a private, somewhat informal setting, the parties involved have much more flexibility, not only regarding procedure but also remedies. Generally, as we know, an article III court in a civil matter will limit remedies to a dollar figure. Arbitration can go beyond that. Often all a plaintiff wants might be an apology, or the injured worker who can't perform his job any more just wants another job. Arbitration can give a party those results.  Arbitration is a legal concept that makes sense, saves time, and saves money. As a matter of fact, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, one of the pilot programs, estimates that arbitration has produced a 5-to-1 savings in private and public costs.  So the two bills that I am introducing today will, therefore, help give the public efficient and expedient access to the Federal courts and will help alleviate the caseload burden on the judicial branch.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that my two bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 996       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
