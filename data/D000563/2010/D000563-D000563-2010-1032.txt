But for him to say he wants to dictate how this is going to be paid for from sources that, frankly, many of us believe are not realistic in any way whatsoever--he wanted to take the money from the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that has already been committed to construction projects and to tax cuts across America; he wants to take that money and reduce tax cuts for working families--I would vote against that. I think that is very shortsighted and would hurt the economy rather than help it. If he wants to make across-the-board cuts in appropriations bills, he ought to have an opportunity to offerthat amendment, and he has had that opportunity. But he doesn't choose to do that. He wants to be guaranteed he will win.
