 President.  I rise in strong support of this amendment and offer my congratulations to the Senator from Illinois for bringing this critical issue to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of the Nation. Certainly it is an issue of safety and health for many children across our country. For all of us who go out and visit schools on a regular basis, we see classrooms that are in cafeterias, in gymnasiums, and in closet space--of all things--all across this country, and that is wrong. This is an issue that has to be addressed.  Let me also bring to the attention of my colleagues the issue that many of us hear about--the high number of jobs that are available today in the area of technology. The ITEA recently put out a study showing there are 200,000 job openings today. These are $40,000- to $60,000-a-year jobs available in technology, yet we don't have the skills or students with the skills available to go into these jobs because they haven't had the education and the experience in their schools.  I have worked very hard to bring technology to the floor of the Senate as an issue. We have put computers into our schools, technology into our schools. In a few minutes, the Labor Committee will be working on the Reauthorization Act that includes my language to train teachers in technology throughout our schools, but if we don't pass the issue of school construction, far too many of our children will never have access to these skills because they are in classrooms where you cannot plug in a computer.  This issue is critical and I urge my colleagues to support it. I, again, thank my colleague from Illinois for bringing it to our attention and appreciate her long concern and work on this issue.
