  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, what a difference a week makes. Last week, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Foley) and others berated the Senate here on the floor of the House, and they touted the sham fake-accounting reforms passed by the House in March.  But today, the most dangerous place in Washington, D.C. is in front of a crowd of rank-and-file Republicans in their rush to embrace the Senate's Sarbanes bill and to take up real reform of the accounting industry and take care of the disasters on Wall Street. But thank God for the GOP leaders.  ``Hill GOP Leaders Fight Audit Plan. One day after the Senate unanimously passed broad overhauls of corporate securities laws, top House Republicans said they will try to delay and likely dilute some of the proposed changes.''  At least someone in the Republican Party is true to their corporate sponsors, benefactors, and contributors.                          ____________________
