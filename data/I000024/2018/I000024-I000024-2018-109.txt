President, today I wish to recognize my good friend and former staffer, Mr. Frank Fannon, who has been confirmed to lead the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources.  We have seen how expanding U.S. energy exports to Eastern Europe has supported our allies and curbed Russia's influence in the region. As Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources, Frank can use his leadershipand expertise effectively to advance American energy dominance and enforce energy sanctions, like those against Russia and Iran.  Frank served as energy counsel to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works from 2003 to 2007. While at EPW, his knowledge on energy issues was vital. He drafted key provisions of the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005, legislation that helped to unleash American innovation and set the conditions for today's energy abundance.  I want to congratulate Frank Fannon on this well-deserved confirmation and wish him well in his new role at the State Department.                          ____________________
