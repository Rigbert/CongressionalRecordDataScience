Lois J. Carson has served as Executive Director of the Community Action Partnership (CAP) of Riverside County for 30 years. After three decades of service, Lois will retire at the end of December and I thank her for years of dedicated public service. In her honor, a grateful city has declared December 14, 2010, as ``Lois J. Carson Day.''  In July 1980, Lois was first appointed by the Board of Supervisors as the first Executive Director of CAP of Riverside County, then known as the Department of Community Action. For 30 years CAP has worked toward reducing poverty in Riverside County. In 2005 and under Lois' direction, Riverside received the National Community Action Partnership's Award for Excellence, to date the only Community Action Agency (CAA) in California, and the only public CAA in the nation, to receive this award.  Lois has been recognized as an innovator who always worked diligently on behalf of the city and in her role with CAP. Through the years CAP has touched the lives of thousands of low-income residents in Riverside, helping them gain footing through programs such as Individual Development Accounts, Building Links to Impact Self-Sufficiency (Project B.L.I.S.S.), Earned Income Tax Credit, and Weatherization and Access to Assets.  Lois has received numerous awards recognizing her accomplishments, including being named a ``Distinguished Alumnus'' by California State University, San Bernardino and by the University of California, Riverside. She was also a first year recipient of the Riverside YWCA ``Woman of Achievement'' award. In addition, Lois was named the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County's ``Champion of Justice;'' honored with the Business Press' ``Leader of Distinction'' award; named a 2001 Papal Medalist; earned the Woman of the Year for the 62nd Assembly District; awarded the 2007 Lyndon Baines Johnson ``Human Services Award'' which is highest honor of the National Community Action Partnership; and was named the 2009 ``Spirit of the Entrepreneur'' Award from Social Entrepreneur.  She also served as a trustee for the San Bernardino Community College District for 24 years during which time she was named ``Top Trustee in the U.S.'' in 1991 by the Association of Community College Trustees. She remains an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, National Council of Negro Women and is a Black Future Leaders mentor. She is also the longest serving member of the Riverside County Workforce Investment Board.  Lois' tireless passion for community and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Lois a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.                          ____________________
