 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 22. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then begin a period for morning business for up to 90 minutes, with the first 45 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee and the final 45 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; provided further that following morning business, the Senate proceed to Executive Calendar No. 815, the nomination of Porter Goss to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as provided under the previous order.
