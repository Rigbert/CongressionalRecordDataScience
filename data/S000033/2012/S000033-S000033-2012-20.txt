 President, I am delighted that Father Marcel Rainville has offered the opening prayer for the Senate this morning, and I thank him very much for joining us in doing so.  Father Rainville is a native of Vermont. He is a distinguished member of the Society of St. Edmund, an order which has a very long history in our State. Established in Vermont first at Keeler's Bay in 1891 and then in Swanton in 1895, the Society of St. Edmund still has its headquarters in Vermont.
