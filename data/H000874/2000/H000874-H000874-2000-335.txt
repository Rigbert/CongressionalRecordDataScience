Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this resolution with my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Kolbe, and a bi-partisan group of 30 other Members. This resolution supports affordable housing for all Americans and promotes free trade of softwood lumber between the United States and Canada.  This resolution expresses the Sense of the Congress that the 1996 U.S./Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) should not be extended when it expires in 2001. The President should continue discussions with the Government of Canada to promote open and competitive trade between the United States and Canada of softwood lumber, and that all stakeholders should be included in discussions regarding trade of softwood lumber.  The Softwood Lumber Agreement of 1996 was intended to promote free trade; however, it appears to have had the opposite effect. More importantly, the expansion of this agreement is directly affecting consumers by increasing the cost of lumber used for homebuilding. For many Americans owning a home is a dream come true, but if lumber prices climb and homes are not affordable, for many Americans it will remain a dream unfulfilled.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution that will help ensure affordable housing for all Americans.                          ____________________
