 The amendment which the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, as well as the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, Senator Leahy of Vermont, and I want to offer to this legislation even addresses it, I think, with more persuasion because the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which we are pushing as an amendment to this bill, is supported not only by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce but by the AFL-CIO as well. Business groups and labor groups have come together and said: If you are going to address the issue of immigration, jobs, keeping the economy moving, don't stop with the H-1B, 195,000; deal with American workers who are here who need to be treated fairly.  Am I correct in saying to the Senator from Nevada, this is one of the rare examples I have seen on an immigration issue where business and labor have come together so strongly, saying to us this is the best thing for workers and their families and the economy, the amendment we are cosponsoring--the amendment being resisted by the Republican leadership, is it the same amendment?
