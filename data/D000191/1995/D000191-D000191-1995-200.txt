  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman referenced the balanced budget. He cannot get to a balanced budget while increasing military spending, cutting taxes for the wealthy and the largest corporations, and here is the proof, the Republican budget.  It is impossible to do that unless, unless you want to gut virtually every other program of the Federal Government from child nutrition to student loans, to Federal law enforcement, to veterans benefits, Medicare, and, yes, Social Security.  They will all take a massive cut so the Pentagon can continue its wanton spending and the wealthy can put another BMW in the garage. I expected that kind of a budget, but never, never did I expect that the Republicans would go back on their pledge to not touch Social Security.  Buried deep in this budget is a little change in the COLA factor, just a little change. It will cut future retirement benefits for veterans, future retirement benefits for military retirees, future benefits for every Civil Service retiree. And yes, Social Security benefits, too, starting in 1999 will be reduced by their budget.                          ____________________
