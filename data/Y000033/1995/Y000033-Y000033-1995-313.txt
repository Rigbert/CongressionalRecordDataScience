Mr. Chairman, their land has no longer any value because the Government has decided it is wetland. If anything I have heard enough about the Government today, in the last 3 or 4 weeks, if you wonder why there is an unrest out there, and it does exist today, regardless of what our President says or what I hear from certain Members on this floor of the House, is because of the heavy-handedness and the lack of recognition of this Congress that the individual rights of a person or a select group of individuals who were given property by this Congress has to be protected, yet we do not recognize that.  I am going to suggest to the gentleman from New York you have got to go out and walk in their moccasins; he ought to be able to look at their land, and say, ``We gave it to you, but we are going to take it back because I think it is wetland. For the good of the environment, we are going to protect it.'' I say to the gentleman from New York that is absolutely immoral and wrong. We have an opportunity in the original bill, as passed out of this committee as a good bill, to protect those wetlands, and those are the good wetlands that will be protected, but if, in fact, in the national interest they are that valuable, that individual shall be compensated.  This amendment should be voted down, turned down overwhelmingly.
