 I have talked to people, young students who are 4.0 students; I have talked to students in juvenile detention centers. The one thing they all say in common is they believe that in this country today, adults do not care about them.  Mr. President, we have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the Kerry-Murray amendment to put dollars back into our education account and show our young people they are a priority to us. I can think of no better investment in this country to invest in the education and training of our young people.  I urge my colleagues to support that amendment. I remind my colleagues, this is a way we can make a difference for this country. I yield the floor.
