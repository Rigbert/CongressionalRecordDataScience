  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. My good friend from Massachusetts could not be more wrong. The amendment does not take $23.9 million out of the State Department; $17.1 million of the funds are drawn from the NIS account, an account we substantially increase over the House level.  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, if we are going to continue this program, which has been extremely effective, the only way to do it is the way that we have done it in the underlying bill. The FBI--the letter from Director Freeh to me of September 18 makes the point, ``The FBI does not have funding for these international training efforts in our budget. It is from the support that you and your colleagues provided last year that we were able to undertake these endeavors. Because the FBI has no separate appropriation for this purpose, we must rely upon the Department of State for grants.'' That was the situation last year, Mr. President.  Let me tell you what happened, Mr. President and Members of the Senate. Last year the Senate provided $30 million for this purpose. The FBI had begged for the money from the State Department. The State Department begrudgingly gave them $6 million.  In other words, the State Department does not like this project. They are against this project. The $12.6 million earmark in this underlying bill will support the International Law Enforcement Center in Budapest, as well as short-term training sessions in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kyrgystan, and Slovenia. They are earmarked for the FBI but will support the DEA, BATF, Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies working in the center in Budapest.  What is this about, Mr. President? Russian organized crime is impacting us here in this country. And if there is any provision in this foreign operations appropriations bill that directly affects us here at home, it is the efforts the FBI has been making to help the Newly Independent States begin to deal more effectively with their own criminal problem which is spilling over to our shores.  Now, some people say that foreign aid is something they have a hard time understanding. They have a hard time seeing how it has any impact here. Well, of all the items in this bill, the one that has the most direct bearing on us here at home is the efforts we are making with the Russians and with the others in that part of the world to begin to get a handle on an extraordinarily serious crime problem that is spilling over to our shores.  The reason these earmarks are necessary is because if it is left up to the State Department like it was last year, Mr. President, they will not give this program anything or very little, because they do not care about it.  This is about priorities. And what the underlying bill says is that it is a priority for us to help them do a better job of dealing with an organized criminal effort that not only adversely affects them, but adversely affects us. So the Kerry amendment is completely inappropriate, and I certainly hope that it will not be approved.  Earlier this week the Russian Ambassador was in my office, and we discussed a number of issues, including this very issue, the devastating impact that crime was having on Russia's economic and political process. And Ambassador Vorontsov lamented the fact that corruption and violence over there has reached epidemic proportion. Last Tuesday, the New York Times provided a disturbing analysis of the weaknesses of the banking sector over there.  To quote the New York Times article:       Banking in Russia has developed a reputation as a risky      business, especially for bankers who are gunned down--  Gunned down--     with horrifying frequency by mobsters intent on intimidation      and extortion.  At the end of August, the Washington Post ran an editorial titled, ``Murder Inc. in Moscow.'' The editorial called attention to an unusual demonstration outside the secret police headquarters. Middle-aged businessmen with briefcase and bodyguards in tow were protesting the murder of a colleague Ivan Kivalidi. As the Post pointed out, Mr. Kivalidi, chairman of the Russian Business Round Table, was a ``notable figure in the world of Russian finance; a casualty in the war now underway between the two kinds of private enterprise in Russia--the legitimate and the violently criminal.''  Although a $1 million reward was offered for information on his murder, his colleagues were pessimistic.  One commented: ``We have grounds to think that the police are closely related to the killings. None of the investigations of contract killings in the last year produced results.''  When Prime Minister Chernomyrdin announced new tough anticrime measures, he was scorned--scorned--by the local news media. Izvestia questioned the 70 pages of crimefighting declarations already issued by the Government, and the result, they asked? ``The government is unable to fight crime.''  Now, everyone is impressed by the remarkable progress Russia has achieved. But as the Washington Post warns, if the crime trend continues, ``Russians are going to believe that democracy means confusion and that respect for law means weakness. Uncontrollable violent crime is turning into a greater threat than any political force now on the scene.''  This is not a new problem. Since our trip to Moscow in 1993, Senator Leahy and I have repeatedly raised the crime problem. It was the principal concern expressed by the business community, our business community. Indeed, the principal impediment to expanding foreign investment over there--the principal impediment; there are plenty of impediments to Americans doing business in Russia--but the principal impediment is this: Beginning in 1993, we encouraged the administration to provide adequate funds to support legal reforms and the drafting and implementation of a tax, criminal, and commercial code.  Last year, Mr. President, we voted 100 to 0 to support this effort by earmarking resources for the FBI and for local law enforcement training. We were just beginning to see how problems in the NIS were spilling over and infecting Europe.  We were also beginning to see evidence that the 5,000 organized criminal enterprises which were strangling Russia were expanding their bank fraud, smuggling and narcotics trafficking to U.S. shores.  Mr. President, Russian crime is now American crime. There are no longer borders or boundaries. The problem has swept across the ocean and arrived here at home.  In July, the FBI arrested five Russians in New York City involved in a string of international extortion and murder cases.  And extortion is not the worst of the problems we can expect. For the past 2 years, Judge Freeh has warned of the ominous rise in arrests of individuals involved in smuggling nuclear material--smuggling nuclear material, Mr. President.  Yet the administration keeps citing the need for flexibility, just as they did last year when they prevailed upon the conferees to strip out $30 million for law enforcement activities.  In the meantime, the problems have gotten worse. Crime is a serious problem. The solution requires a serious effort and investment on our part.  This spring with congressional support, the FBI opened an international law enforcement training center in Budapest. In addition, the FBI cobbled together short term, in country training programs. But those activities have been ad hoc and funded on a shoestring.  Concerned about this crazy quilt approach, I asked the FBI for an unofficial and rough estimate of the costs for several initiatives which would address our interests in the region.  Roughly $12 million is needed to sustain training, exchanges and investigative and technical assistance both at the center in Budapest and in country. I believe these programs should be complemented by an ongoing presence of legal attaches in the region, so I have also provided funds to support legal attaches in Estonia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Given the magnitude of the problem, this is really a relatively modest investment.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent exchange of letters I had with Judge Freeh about my decision to expand the Bureau's role and an August 26, 1995, newspaper article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Senate          Appropriations Committee.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to advise you the      Departments of State and Justice are adamantly opposed to any      earmarking of funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation      in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related      Programs Appropriation Bill, 1996. Pursuant to those      objections, I respectfully request the Committee not to use      this mechanism to fund the FBI programs in question.       The programs for which this funding is being made available      remain critically important and the FBI remains committed to      the democratization process in Central Europe, Russia, and      the New Independent States. Quite frankly, it has been      through the support and commitment of people like yourself      that the FBI in the past year has been able to make a      significant impact in the region. As you know, in the past      year, we have brought training to over 1,700 middle to upper-     level police officers in their countries, at the FBI Academy      in Quantico, and through innovative efforts at our newly      created International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest.       As we continue our efforts, we are hopeful that the      Department of State will continue to support our efforts to      confront the problems of international organized crime, drug      trafficking, nuclear trafficking, and terrorism.           Sincerely yours,                                                   Louis J. Freeh,     Director.                                                                    ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of this date.      My view, remains that the law enforcement training      initiatives we have undertaken and cop-to-cop relationship      that will flow from these endeavors are absolutely essential      to the long-term public safety and national security of the      United States. In addition to the contributions these efforts      provide toward democratization, we have seen tangible results      from the joint investigations and subsequent prosecutions of      international criminals made possible only because of these      initiatives.       The FBI does not have funding for these international      training efforts in our budget. It is from the support that      you and your colleagues provided last year that we were able      to undertake these endeavors. Because the FBI has no separate      appropriation for this purpose, we must rely upon the      Department of State for grants.       In a related issue, I understand that the Commerce, State,      Justice appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1996 would      provide some funding that could be used for limited expansion      of our Legal Attache program. These offices are essential in      our effort to combat international crime.       I hope this information has been helpful to you.           Sincerely yours,                                                   Louis J. Freeh,     Director.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,     Director,     Federal Bureau of Investigation,     Washington, DC.       Dear Judge Freeh: I have received your letter of September      15th, and appreciate the difficult circumstances you find      yourself in.       As you know, I share your belief that combating the growing      international crime problem is essential. I am sympathetic to      the State Department's objections to earmarks but worry that      eliminating this provision would deny funds to this      worthwhile effort. Would the FBI be able to fund these      programs without support from the Foreign Operations      Appropriation Bill?       I look forward to your reply, and congratulate you on the      success this initiative has enjoyed to date.           Sincerely,                                                  Mitch McConnell,     United States Senator.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 26, 1995]                         Murder Inc. in Moscow       As demonstrations go in Moscow, it was decidedly unusual.      The participants were middle-aged businessmen carrying      briefcases, surrounded by their bodyguards, gathered near the      building that houses the secret police for the purpose of      protesting the murder of a banker--and calling attention to      the very slight chance that justice will ever catch up with      the people who did it. The victim, a man named Ivan Kivelidi,      was also chairman of the Russian Business Round Table and a      notable figure in the emerging world of Russian finance. He      was a casualty in the war now underway between the two kinds      of private enterprise in Russia--the legitimate and the      violently criminal.       Mr. Kivelidi's death is important because it is typical of      many in a country where racketeering has become pervasive.      Anyone who hopes to see Russia develop as a prosperous      democracy can only read with dread about this epidemic of      killings, the great majority of which remain unsolved. If      Russia's elected government cannot organize effective law      enforcement, it risks being replaced by other kinds of      government as public fears increase.       Russia's police and system of justice is disorganized and      demoralized, frequently corrupt and generally ineffectual.      The post-Soviet government has, with reason, wanted to change      it from the instrument of repression that it used to be into      something else. But      the transformation has gotten bogged down, leaving the system uncertain      and incompetent, with salaries eroded by inflation and with      no consensus regarding its purpose and its powers.       If this condition continues, Russians are going to begin to      believe that democracy means confusion and that respect for      law means weakness. Russia is an inherently rich country,      with immense natural resources and a well-educated      population. In less than four years since the collapse of the      Soviet Union, its private sector has grown with remarkable      speed. After a sharp economic decline, a recovery now seems      to be well underway.       But this promise of growth and steadily improving living      conditions depends on political and social stability.      Uncontrollable violent crime is turning into a greater threat      to it than any political force now on the scene. That little      funeral demonstration on a summer evening in Moscow, in      memory of Mr. Kivelidi, was a warning. Anarchy is not a      popular form of government.  Mr. McCONNELL. On Monday, Judge Freeh wrote to advise me that the State Department and the Justice Department opposed earmarking funds for the FBI in the foreign operations bill. Frankly, he felt obliged to register their concerns. He did go on to point out, however, that congressional support last year was what was responsible for training over 1,700 middle- to upper-level police officers at Quantico and at the new center in Budapest.  I wrote back and asked Judge Freeh if these programs were important and whether they could be sustained from existing FBI resources. And here is what he said, Mr. President.       Judge Freeh: My view remains that the law enforcement      training initiatives we have undertaken and cop-to-cop      relationships that flow from these endeavors are absolutely      essential to the long-term public safety and national      security of the United States.  Of this country.       In addition to the contributions these efforts provide      toward democratization, we have seen tangible results from      joint investigations and subsequent prosecutions of      international criminals made possible only (only) because of      these initiatives.  This is Judge Freeh now. ``The FBI does not have the funding for these international training efforts in our budget.'' The recent arrests in New York provide just one more example of the joint investigations which produced concrete results protecting American interests.  No doubt some of my colleagues will want to sidetrack this important earmark into a debate about the FBI's role somewhere else. I would rather see the FBI live up to its potential, and I think that this particular amendment is absolutely essential if we are going to help achieve something not only for the Russians but ourselves in the law enforcement area.  Obviously, I hope the Kerry amendment will be defeated overwhelmingly. I think it is a very bad amendment. It obviously takes us in the wrong direction.  Mr. President, we have about 10 minutes left. I suggest we split the remaining 10 minutes.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I might inquire of the manager of the bill for a moment----  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.  Mr. D'AMATO. If I might have 2 minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining 10 minutes before the vote be divided equally.
