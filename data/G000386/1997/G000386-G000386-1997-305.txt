 President, I rise today to introduce important tort reform legislation. Tort reform is needed for many reasons--one of which is to free our courts of frivolous lawsuits. Frivolous lawsuits take the courts' time away from trying legitimate lawsuits, and deprive the truly injured of timely resolution of their claims.  Mr. President, our courts are supposed to be venues for resolving disputes. Lawsuits are supposed to be the means by which injured parties seek relief--they are not intended to be used as weapons to harass, delay, or increase the cost to the other party. Too often entire lawsuits, or claims within ongoing lawsuits, are used as weapons. The bill that I introduce today takes a stab at these lawsuits. It toughens the penalties for filing frivolous lawsuits and insures that if someone files a frivolous lawsuit, that someone will pay.  Our front-line defense against this misuse of the legal system is rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule is intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. The power of rule 11 was diluted in 1993. This weakening is unacceptable to those of us who want to preserve courts as neutral forums for dispute resolution and who believe that lawsuits are not weapons of revenge, but a means for an injured party to gain relief.  Senator Brown introduced a bill very similar to this legislation in the last Congress. The Senate adopted the text of his bill as an amendment to the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act. His amendment passed by a vote of 56 to 37.  The bill that I am introducing today is similar, but not identical to Senator Brown's bill. The civil rights community raised some concerns with his bill, and my version of the legislation is responsive to these concerns. The provision that was opposed reinstated the rule 11 requirement that allegations contained in motions and other court papers be well grounded in fact when filed, rather than allowing a ``reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.'' Unlike Senator Brown's bill, my bill does not change this subsection of rule 11.  My bill does take strong steps to thwart frivolous lawsuits. First, my bill makes sanctions for the violation of this rule mandatory. One of themost harmful changes that took effect in 1993 was to make sanctions for proven violations of this rule permissive. This means that if a party files a lawsuit simply to harass another party, and the court decides that this is in fact the case, the offending party still might not be sanctioned. This is unacceptable. The offending party might not be punished at all, which provides no deterrence for this offending party or anyone else who wants to misuse the courts. My bill reinstates the requirement that if there is a violation of this rule, there are sanctions.  My bill also removes the limitation on sanctions, and allows sanctions to be paid to the injured party for more than attorneys' fees and expenses. In addition, this legislation allows the sanctioning of attorneys for arguing for an extension of current law if their actions violate this rule. Again, if the rule is violated, there needs to be sanctions.  Mr. President, this bill will not, by itself, stop the misuse of our courts. It is, however, a good first step. It is a necessary step. It is a bill that we must pass to sanction those who use the legal system to harass and torment others. That is not what the courts were established to do. We must protect the integrity of the courts and preserve them for proper use.                                 ______                                       By
