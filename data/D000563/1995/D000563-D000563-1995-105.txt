Chairman, the last comment made by the gentleman from California, chairman of the subcommittee, suggested that we would not bring this to closure and debate and vote today. It is my understanding with the time limitation that the chair announced that we can conclude this before 3 p.m. which I understood was the time when we wished to adjourn.
