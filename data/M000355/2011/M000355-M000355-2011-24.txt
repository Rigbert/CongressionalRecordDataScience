 This year, the town of Somerset has graciously chosen to honor the Akin family by accepting their donation of a 20-foot cherry spruce tree to be displayed in the town's Fountain Square as the county Christmas tree. More important, however, is the solemn but heart-warming story of the tree's origin, and the inspiration it brings to the people of the community.  The tree, known as ``Jacob's Tree,'' was planted in remembrance of Jacob Akin, who was tragically killed in a terrible accident on December 6, 1994. Five-year-old Jacob was playing with his older brother, Abraham, in a house when a chimney unexpectedly collapsed on top of him. Thus, the holiday season each year is especially burdensome for his family, as it serves as a constant reminder of the horrific accident that took place 17 years ago.  A year after his death, his family decided to plant a tree to honor young Jacob. Over the years, the tree has helped bring comfort and peace to the family. ``We decided to put up the tree in memory of my son,'' Jacob's mother, Rebecca Buis, says. ``I felt like as the tree grew, I could keep up with theyears and somehow see how my son might have grown. It's kind of a reminder, and it helps with the grieving process to plant something in memory of someone you love.''  Almost two decades later, Jacob's spirit remains ever-present in the magnificent 20-foot cherry spruce tree that Rebecca hopes will bring a joyful light to the community on Fountain Square. ``Over the years, it just grew and grew,'' she says. ``It's a beautiful, well-rounded tree and would make a wonderful Christmas tree.''  On December 3, Jacob's Tree was scheduled to be lit for the first time in Fountain Square in a special tree-lighting ceremony during this year's annual Christmas parade. In the spirit of the season, Jacob's family hopes that the community will come together around the tree and share in its joy. ``Christmas is a time of giving,'' Rebecca said.  The story of Jacob's Tree and the selflessness of the Akin family is truly inspirational. I would like to extend my personal blessing to Jacob's mother, Rebecca Buis, his father, David Akin, and his brother, Abraham Akin, this holiday season. And I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in wishing the family a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It is my hope that the tree brings them comfort, and that it shine especially bright in honor of young Jacob.  The Commonwealth Journal, a Somerset-area publication, recently published an article telling the story of Jacob's Tree. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:       [From the Commonwealth Journal, Nov. 25, 2011]            `Jacob's Tree' Will Warm the Spirit This Season                           (By Chris Harris)       The Christmas season is seen as a time of miracles, a time      of redemption for mankind.       This year, one of Somerset's proudest symbols of the      Christmas tradition will be its own miracle of sorts--a      chance to redeem joy and light out of the clouds of tragedy.       The Christmas tree in the town's Fountain Square is      scheduled to be lit in a special ceremony on Saturday,      December 3, as is the annual custom.       This year's tree comes from the yard of Rebecca Buis, known      to local bank customers as a branch manager and loan officer      at First & Farmers National Bank in Somerset.       Anyone who has driven down Denham Street lately has      probably noticed the towering cherry spruce standing out with      its bold green hue, even as the trees around it have shed      their leaves and stand bare and bland.       The tree was planted around the holiday season of 1995--one      year after a horrific accident that changed Buis's life      forever.       On December 6, 1994, Jacob Akin, Buis's 5-year-old son, was      killed in what his mother can only call a ``freak accident.''       Jacob and his brother Abraham, who was 10 at the time, were      playing in a house on Newton Street in Ferguson that their      father was in the process of razing.       ``(The father, David Akin) did construction work,'' said      Buis. ``This wasn't anything that was new to (the children).      They were used to playing around that kind of stuff.''       This time, however, was different.       After Abraham exited the structure to ask his father a      question, a chimney crumbled and collapsed on top of young      Jacob.       A parent's worst nightmare had come to pass--and during the      holiday season meant to be a happy time for families.       The memories remain painful to this day.       ``They couldn't find my son underneath the bricks,''      recalled Buis, who still finds herself overcome with emotion      when talking about the incident. ``They had to pull them off      brick by brick until they found him.''       According to then-county coroner Alan Stringer, Jacob died      of multiple skull fractures as a result of the toppled      bricks. Buis noted that Jacob's neck was broken immediately,      which meant that death came quickly. This and the fact that      Abraham survived provided the only sources of solace in that      terrible time.       ``My worry was that he suffered, and they told me he had      not,'' said Buis. `` I'm lucky in the sense that I felt like      God could have taken both my boys that day, playing in the      house together. I could have lost them both.''       Still, the holiday season was unalterably affected for Buis      and her family.       ``I wasn't able to focus on Christmas at all,'' said Buis.      ``We didn't put up a tree that year.''       For one thing, Buis felt like she had to stay strong for      her other son's sake. The necessity of putting on a brave      face took its own toll on the devastated mother.       ``You have to carry on because you have two children,'' she      said. ``Kids grieve differently. It's not an easy thing to      deal with; kids don't usually tell you, but they feel      responsible. I tried hard not to show grief because I didn't      want (Abraham) to feel responsible. Nobody could have done      anything. It was a freak accident.''       Buis recalls Jacob, in kindergarten at Hopkins Elementary      at the time, as ``a funny little young man,'' as well as one      who was both handsome and intelligent.       ``He was a very smart young man,'' she said. ``He      understood lots of things, I think.''       The calendar pages turned, and soon enough, it was the      Christmas season again. Buis decided it would be appropriate      to pay some kind of tribute to Jacob, and decided to plant      the household Christmas tree, only about five feet tall at      the time, in the ground outside their home.       ``We decided to put up the tree in memory of my son,'' she      said. ``I felt like as the tree grew, I could keep up with      the years and somehow see how my son might have grown. Every      time I would pull in the driveway, I would see the tree.''       ``It's kind of a reminder,'' she added. ``It helps with the      grieving process to plant something in memory of someone you      love.''       Today, the majestic tree stands about 20 feet tall. It's      ``reached its potential,'' as Buis put it, and has      ``overgrown the place.''       As such, Buis decided it might be the perfect time to      inquire about donating ``Jacob's Tree,'' as it's called, to      use on the Fountain Square as the county's official Christmas      tree. County officials happily obliged.       ``Over the years, it just grew and grew,'' said Buis. ``I'd      been thinking for some time about (donating it), and just      decided, `You know, it's time to cut the tree down.' ''       Buis said she also took Abraham's feelings into      consideration. Now 27, still in Pulaski County working in      construction, Abraham ``thinks it's a good idea,'' according      to Buis, but she wanted to make sure he was okay with the      choice to donate the tree given the effect Jacob's death had      on him as well.       Much as the tree reached its adult size, Jacob would have      been 22 years old this year. However, his legacy has managed      to live on in other ways as well.       After Jacob's death, Buis decided to donate his corneas and      heart valves to help save the lives of other individuals.      ``(Christmas) is a time of giving,'' she said, noting that      Jacob's untimely passing was able to give hope to others.       ``I received letters telling me that one of Jacob's corneas      went to a child who was born with a birth defect, and another      went to an older man in his 60s with an eye injury from a      work accident,'' said Buis. ``His heart valves also went to      adults. I didn't realize how important heart valves were to      people who need them (until then).''       ``It's a hard decision to make because you have to make it      quickly,'' she added, referring to the decision to donate      Jacob's organs. ``You can't think about it for days. You have      to know at the time of death, and it's a very hard time.''       Just as Jacob's body was donated to bring a new light of      hope to those in need, his spirit remains in the tree that      has now been donated to bring a similarly joyful light to the      community.       ``It's a beautiful tree,'' said Buis. ``It's well-rounded      and would make a wonderful Christmas tree.''       Citizens can see ``Jacob's Tree'' lit for the first time on      December 3. The annual Christmas parade, sponsored and      organized by the Chamber of Commerce, begins at 5 p.m. with      the tree lighting activities set for 7 p.m.       As a Chamber Ambassador, Buis is looking forward to the      yearly festivities that are so beloved by locals--but      especially since she will get to see that special memorial to      her son shining in all its glory.       ``I just hope that (those who see it) will enjoy the tree      and that it will be beautifully decorated,'' said Buis. ``I      hope that people will get a warm feeling from the tree, and      know that it's given in a good spirit.''                          ____________________
