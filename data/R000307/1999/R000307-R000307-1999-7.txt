I know the same is true of all around the country. They also complain that their financial problems have been exacerbated--that is a fancy word that means a whole lot worse--by a host of new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA--my favorite agency in Washington--including the implementation of something called OASIS--I have the report--that they are requiring nurses to fill out. Oasis, if you look in the dictionary, is a desert island somewhere or in the middle of the desert; you come to an oasis and you get relief. Oasis is not relief. You don't spell relief by spelling oasis: a new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds, sequential billing, overpayment recoupment, and a new 15-minute increment reporting requirement that is a doozy. What about all these reporting requirements in addition to the IPS problem? What about OASIS?
