 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the generosity of yielding to me.  I also support the Sewell amendment to increase funding for the President's civil rights initiative. I remain a strong supporter of the President's initial request for $50 million for the civil rights initiative. While the gentlewoman's amendment would increase funding by $7 million, we still have a long way to go to get the adequate funding for these very important sacred places, I might add, in our Nation's history, to protect them.  I appreciate the majority's willingness to accept this amendment, and I thank the sponsor for offering it.  I thank the gentleman, once again, for his kindness in yielding.
