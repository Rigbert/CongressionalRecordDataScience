 President, let me also congratulate Senator Murray for her work and particularly my good friend, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, for his usual flawless effort in moving legislation across the floor. This was a challenging bill with a lot of interesting issues that divide the Senate in many ways. I express my gratitude and appreciation for the fine work of Senator Cochran.
