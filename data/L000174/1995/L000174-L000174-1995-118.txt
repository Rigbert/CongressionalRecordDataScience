President, in these continuing resolutions, we have even arranged a way to do the LIHEAP program. I will give you some idea of what happens when you do not pass your appropriations bills on time.  The LIHEAP program is to provide heating assistance for those of us in States with severe weather, none more severe than the Senator from Alaska, obviously. But in my own State we have 25- and 35-below-zero days. This is to give heating assistance to the people, aid in heating to the poorest people in our States, to help them weatherize their homes, or whatever else. Not only is the program cut substantially, but it is set up so you can pay out only \1/365\ per day. So, in other words, if you are in Montana or Alaska or Vermont and it is 25 or 30 below zero in January, you are told: Sorry, we do not have enough, but come back in June and we will probably be able to take care of you.
