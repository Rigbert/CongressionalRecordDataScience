Speaker, I am pointing out that when the gentleman says we didn't pass the appropriations bills, when I said we passed all 12 through the House, we did not shut down government. We ultimately got to a resolution of the differences between us.  Mr. Speaker, I ask the majority leader, what is his plan to do that?  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, my plan to do that is I need 60 votes in the Senate.
