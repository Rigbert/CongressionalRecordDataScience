 I have had questions about this project, the planning process, its economic justification, and the potential for environmental harm for a number of years. I further understand that the State of Delaware's capital bond bill committee in July indicated in writing its intention to withhold all state money for the Deepening project until the State's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is satisfied and necessary permits obtained.  I believe we need to continue to pursue a resolution to these environmental issues and that the Corps should not move forward to construction unless and until appropriate permits have been issued, and the Congress has before it the information needed to determine that the project is safe and truly justified.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, several letters from the Delaware DNREC which discuss the State's concerns.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2000.     Mr. David Walker,     Controller General, General Accounting Office, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Walker: We are writing to request that a cost-     benefit and environmental analysis be conducted as soon as      possible on plans by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) to      bring the depth of the Delaware River to 45 feet. This      channel deepening project was authorized as part of the Water      Resource Development Acts of 1992 (section 101(6)) and 1999      (section 308).       The Plan is estimated to cost $311 million, two-thirds of      which would be provided by the federal government. Proponents      of the Plan argue that the channel needs to be deepened to      accommodate the next generation of cargo ships and that cost      saving benefits will be realized by area oil refineries.      However, many of our constituents have called into question      these benefits and the necessity of channel deepening in      keeping the port competitive. Therefore, we are eager to      identify the benefits of this project to the nation, and      whether these justify the taxpayer cost.       In addition to this central and legally mandated issue of      national benefit, we would like to request an analysis of      three additional issues by the General Accounting Office      (GAO).       First, there is a question as to whether the project      sponsors have complied with all of the provisions of the      National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Environmental      Impact Statement associated with this project appears to be      deficient in five ways: (a) there was no assessment of the      ecological issues pertaining to the disposal sites for      dredged materials because the sites were not identified when      the EIS was done: (b) there was no assessment of the impact      of any dredging of the private berths of the oil refinery (if      any takes place) which is functionally a part of this      project; (c) the habitat assessment part of the EIS may not      adequately assess the impact of the project on essential fish      and oyster habitats; (d) ``used mean values'' (averages) were      improperly used to assess the level of toxins in River      sediment and in so doing masked the existence of toxic ``hot      spots''; and (e) threats to drinking water supplies and water      quality have yet to be adequately analyzed and addressed.       Second, the Delaware dredging project reportedly will      produce 33 million cubic yards of dredged materials. Ten      million yards are scheduled to be used for beach restoration      in the State of Delaware. The remaining 23 million cubic      yards will simply be dumped on the New Jersey side of the      river.       With little effort, the planners of this project were able      to find a beneficial use for 10 million cubic yards of this      material. We are concerned that insufficient efforts has been      made to find more beneficial uses for the remaining 23      million cubic yards and that New Jersey has been asked to      bear too great a burden in its disposal. Thus, we request      that the GAO look at both the environmental and economic      impacts of placing 23 million cubic yards of dredged      materials on the riverfront of these New Jersey communities.       Third, we also ask the GAO to investigate why almost no      commitments have yet been received from the businesses who      stand to benefit from this dredging. The argument has been      made that this project is necessary to keep shipping commerce      on the Delaware River. Yet few of these businesses have made      commitments to dredge their ports on the Delaware River to      match the depth of the main channel. If these businesses      truly need this project, we are curious as to why they are      not also working to make room for the larger ships this      project is meant to accommodate.       As you can see, there are still many questions to be      answered regarding this project. Time is of the essence.      Congress will consider as part of its FY 2001 Appropriations      cycle future funding for this project. It is imperative that      this project receive objective scrutiny by the GAO      immediately. We offer our assistance in any way possible to      facilitate a cost-benefit analysis and evaluation of      environmental impacts in a timely manner. Thank you in      advance for your efforts and we look forward to your report.           Sincerely,                                             Robert G. Torricelli,                                            United States Senator.                                                Robert E. Andrews,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                     U.S. Environmental Protection                                             Agency, Region 2,                                      New York, NY, June 30, 1999.     Mr. Robert Callegeri,     Director, Planning Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/         Philadelphia District, Wanamaker Building, Philadelphia          PA.       Dear Mr. Callegeri: I am writing in reference to the      proposed Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project. In      particular, we have recently become aware of potential issues      associated with the project through letters from the Delaware      River keeper, and discussions stemming from the April 16,      1999 forum facilitated by the Delaware River Basin      Commission, as well as the June 11, 1999 meeting convened by      Congressman Castle's office.       We have carefully considered these issues. For the most      part, we do not believe that they necessitate revising the      conclusions reached in the previous environmental impact      statement (EIS) process for the project. However, we believe      that the following two issues require further consideration      and effort prior to the project proceeding: the project's      benefit/cost (B/C) ratio and environmental issues raised      which may not have been fully evaluated or resolved during      the prior planning process.       With regard to the project's B/C ratio, the original      project scope included six petroleum facilities as project      beneficiaries. Consequently, the benefits to these facilities      were included in the project's B/C ratio. However, we have      seen no documentation that any of these facilities plan to      dredge their private channels. To the contrary, the limited      documentation we have indicates that one or more of the      petroleum companies believe that it is not in their best      economic interest to participate. Accordingly, we would like      to see additional documentation showing any commitments made      by the companies involved and more explanation of how their      participation (or lack thereof) affects the B/C ratio      calculations. Moreover, if these     facilities are not committed to participate, we would argue      that the scope of the project would be modified, which would      require the Corps' to recalculate the B/C ratio.       In addition to the economic questions, numerous      environmental concerns about the project continue to be      raised. While we believe that many of these concerns have      been adequately addressed through the prior EIS process,      there may be a need for additional environmental analyses for      certain issues not fully covered in the prior EIS      documentation. For example, impacts related to the dredging      of the private facilities discussed above and several port      facilities owned or operated by the local sponsors, and      potential impacts associated with the development of new      sites for dredged material disposal were not fully evaluated      in the original EIS. Accordingly, these activities will have      to be evaluated under NEPA.       Our final concern about the project relates to the      potential impacts associated with the dredging and disposal      operations. EPA, however, believes that these impacts can,      and should, be addressed through the development of specific      monitoring/management plans for the various dredging and      disposal phases of the project. The plans should be developed      to address specific goals and objectives designed to detect      and prevent adverse impacts from the proposed dredging and      disposal operations. At a minimum, monitoring for turbidity      changes using in situ recording devices during dredging and      disposal operations, bathymetry and sediment profiling      imagery at the aquatic disposal locations, and ground water      monitoring should be included. Additionally, the monitoring/     management plans should provide for appropriate contingency      actions in the event that unforeseen circumstances (e.g.,      high levels of contaminants) are encountered during the      dredging and disposal operations. We are available to assist      as necessary in the development of monitoring/management      plans. At the very least, we request the opportunity to      review such plans as they are being developed. Furthermore,      the monitoring/management plans must be in place prior to the      start of any dredging activity.       We look forward to working with you as this project      progresses. Should you have any questions concerning this      letter, please contact Mark Westrate of my staff at (212)      637-3789.           Sincerely yours,                                               Robert W. Hargrove,     Chief, Strategic Planning and Multi-Media Programs Branch.                                  ____                                     House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2000.     Mr. David Walker,     Comptroller General of the United States, General Accounting          Office, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Walker: On May 2, 2000, Representative Robert      Andrews and Senator Robert Torricelli wrote to you requesting      the General Accounting Office (GAO) review the cost-benefit      and environmental analysis of the U.S. Army Corps of      Engineer's (USACE) project to dredge the Delaware River to 45      feet. In addition, they asked you to evaluate whether the      Corps of Engineers has complied with all provisions of the      National Environmental Policy Act, the environmental and      economic impacts of placing 23 million cubic yards of dredged      materials on the New Jersey riverfront, and why almost no      commitments to deepen their side channels have been received      from the oil refineries who are identified as receiving 80%      of the projects benefits. We support the request by      Representative Andrews and Senator Torricelli, and ask that      you address several other critical issues dealing with the      accuracy of the USACE's study of this project.       Throughout this project, oil facilities located along the      Delaware have been identified as the major beneficiaries.      However, five of the six facilities have made no commitment      to invest the funds necessary to deepen their side-channels      and have indicated they are unlikely to do so. Therefore, we      request the GAO to recalculate the cost-benefit ratio of this      project if the oil facilities do not deepen their side-     channels.       The USACE has identified other potential beneficiaries of      the deepening project to include the Port of Philadelphia and      Camden. We ask that the GAO utilize its expertise in port      infrastructure and competitiveness and conduct a study      focusing on shipping trends in the North Atlantic Region. In      particular, we request the GAO to evaluate the viability of      the Port of Philadelphia and Camden becoming a major regional      hub port for deep draft container ships if the Delaware River      were deepened from 40 to 45 feet. There is no guarantee that      the new generation of container ships will ever call at the      Port of Philadelphia and Camden at a depth of 45 feet.       In addition, studies prepared by the USACE Waterways      Experiment Station (WES) to determine the potential for      saltwater flow into the C Canal and the Delaware River may      have reached inappropriate conclusions to minimize potential      environmental impacts of the project. The studies have since      been sent back to the WES for reanalysis. We ask that the GAO      investigate discrepancies between the studies and determine      how they came about. We would also like the GAO to examine      all current Corps studies on the Delaware River Deepening      Project to determine if similar discrepancies exist.       This information will be critical in helping Congress      determine whether the project's national economic benefits      are sufficient enough to invest over $200 million. Since      Congress will consider future funding for this project in the      FY2001 appropriations cycle, it is essential this project      receive objective scrutiny by the GAO immediately. We offer      our assistance in any way possible to facilitate a cost-     benefit analysis, evaluate of environmental impacts, and a      review of the accuracy of the USACE studies of this project      in a timely manner. Thank you for your efforts and we look      forward to your report.           Sincerely,     Jim Saxton,       Member of Congress,     Frank A. LoBiondo,       Member of Congress.                                  ____         Department of Natural Resources and Environmental            Control,                                        Dover, DE, March 31, 2000.     LTC Debra M. Lewis,     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building,          Philadelphia, PA.       Dear Lieutenant Colonel Lewis: I am writing to follow up on      our numerous conversations and correspondence regarding the      proposed deepening of the Delaware River Main Channel. I      appreciate your willingness to address these issues and to      work constructively with the State of Delaware to ensure that      this project will not go forward unless it complies with our      environmental laws and that any environmental impacts from      this project will be minimal.       This letter summarizes the remaining environmental issues      that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental      Control (DNREC) believes need resolution. In particular, it      is essential that the Corps demonstrate conclusively that the      project will comply with State of Delaware Surface Water      Quality Standards, the Wetlands Act, and the requirements of      the Subaqueous Lands Act. We also are beginning to formulate      the requirements for testing and monitoring that would apply      before, during, and after completion of the project should it      move forward.       As you are aware, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration regulations (15 CFR 930) require that this      project be consistent with the Delaware Coastal Management      Program (DCMP) policies. That program issued a conditional      Federal Consistency determination to the Corps on 1 May 1997.      The extensive scope of this project necessitated that DCMP      review the project in phases. Now that the final design and      specification phase is underway, it is an appropriate time to      address remaining issues regarding the project. The      conditional approvals did not obviate the need to meet the      substantive requirements of other state permits.       The outstanding issues include construction of material      placement facilities, placement of sandy dredged material on      beaches, the wetland creation project at Kelly Island,      various monitoring and reporting requirements, fisheries      concerns, and future maintenance burdens for the project.            I. Construction of Confined Disposal Facilities       Prior to any construction, it will be necessary to identify      and describe in detail the functions of all confined disposal      facilities (CDFs) to be used for the project--whether located      within the land area of the State of Delaware or discharging      into Delaware waters. It is our understanding that the only      Delaware-land sites slated for use are Reedy Point North and      South, both currently in existence. This list identifying the      disposal sites must include a description of the current      status of each site, expected future capacity, amount of      material to be deposited during the initial dredging cycle,      and ability to accept material for future maintenance cycles.      Additionally, there must be reasonable assurance that the      site is designed and operated in a manner which can ensure      compliance with Delaware State Water Quality Standards. The      rationale and justification supporting this assurance must be      provided in detail.       In addition, an Erosion and Sediment Control plan is      required from the Division of Soil & Water for any landward      disturbance of 5000 square feet or more. Several of the      principles regarding erosion and sediment control are      included for general reference:       An approved erosion and sediment control plan must be      followed. Any modifications to the plan must be approved as      revisions to the approved plan.       Any site or portion thereof on which a land-disturbing      activity is completed or stopped for a period of fourteen      days must be stabilized either permanently or temporarily      following the specifications and standards in the Erosion and      Sediment Control Handbook.       Unless an exception is approved, not more than 20 acres may      be cleared at any one time in order to minimize areas of      exposed ground cover and reduce erosion rates.       A land-disturbing activity shall not cause increased      sedimentation or accelerated erosion off-site. Off-site means      neighboring properties, drainageways, public facilities,      public rights-of-ways or streets, and water courses including      streams, lakes, wetlands, etc.       More specific criteria for vegetation and berm      stabilization can be found in the Delaware Erosion and      Sediment Control Handbook for Development.       The Corps must also comply with any additional requirements      of the State NPDES program. A permit regulating the discharge      of effluent from the CDFs is likely. Additional     NPDES Storm Water Regulations apply, since a NPDES      certification is required for land disturbing activities.      The ``Regulations Governing Storm Water Discharges      Associated with Industrial Activity, Part 2--Special      Conditions for Storm Water Associated with Land Disturbing      Activities'' (1998) states that ``Land disturbing      activities shall not commence and coverage under this Part      shall not apply until the Sediment and Stormwater      Management Plan for a site has been approved, stamped,      signed and dated . . .''.           2. Placement of sandy dredged material on beaches       To date, DNREC has not received official word of which      beaches have been chosen to receive sand from the southern      portion of the project. This information should be made      available as soon as it is determined so that we can evaluate      the permits and requirements needed. Please be advised that      DNREC expects that consideration be given to a number of      shoreline locations previously unnourished. A Section 401      Water Quality Certification and State Subaqueous Lands permit      will be necessary for beach nourishment activities. Our      intent is to ensure that state Water Quality Standards are      met. DNREC also wants to ensure that beach replenishment      activities will not take place during critical horseshoe crab      spawning periods (April 15-June 30). Also, sand placement      activities should not use barriers (i.e. silt fences,      bulkheads, rocks, etc.) that would interfere with spawning.        3. Wetland creation/enhancement project at Kelly Island       DNREC anticipates coordinating with the Corps on the final      design and monitoring plan for Kelly Island at a meeting on 5      April 2000. However, the following describes general      principles which would be applicable regardless of the      specific design criteria.       An Erosion and Sediment Control plan is required from the      Division of Soil & Water Conservation. The general      requirements are listed above under item 1.       The Corps must also comply with any additional requirements      of the State NPDES program. This includes the NPDES Storm      Water Regulations as well as the State Sediment and      Stormwater Regulations, since a NPDES certification is      required for land disturbing activities.       Because the beneficial use project at Kelly Island will      take place in an existing wetland area, a Wetlands Permit      will be required from the Division of Water Resources. In      addition, a Subaqueous Lands Lease will also be necessary.      There are several standard conditions for mitigation projects      which should apply to the wetland creation/enhancement taking      place at that site. For example, standard mitigation projects      must demonstrate 85% survival of the planted vegetation after      the second growing season. If 85% is not achieved then a      report outlining corrective action must be submitted. Other      parameters for stabilization and flow should be developed by      Corps engineers and submitted to DNREC for final review and      approval.       The Corps must also commit to maintaining the integrity of      the created site at Kelly Island and to do what is necessary      to evaluate and ensure the function of the new/enhanced      wetland area. In addition, the beach constructed at the      perimeter must be able to withstand a significant storm      event. The project should be examined and monitored annually      in order to ensure berm stability, vegetation viability,      flushing, and general ``success'' of revitalizing the wetland      habitat at that site. A monitoring report to this effect will      be required annually.       The DNREC, Division of Fish and Wildlife, has concerns      about increased silt load and sedimentation of adjacent      oyster habitat during construction of the perimeter sand sill      at Kelly Island and while the confined disposal area is being      filled. Seed beds of concern include ``Drum Bed,'' ``Silver      Bed,'' and ``Pleasanton's Rock,'' as these are the closest      seed beds to Kelly Island. Should an impact be noted on these      beds, it would indicate a need to monitor ``Ridge Bed'' which      is farther from the project area but has historically been      very productive.       Monitoring of oyster population conditions and habitat      quality should begin prior to construction and continue      throughout. Checking for changes in sedimentation patterns      should be extensive and focused at broad areas of each bed      rather than be limited to discrete sections. In addition, it      may be necessary to monitor oyster habitat on leased grounds      south of the Mahon River mouth as they may be impacted by      sediments moved south by ebb tide currents.                      4. Monitoring and reporting     Monitoring at confined disposal facilities       Monitoring of confined disposal facilities (CDFs) must be      performed to determine whether return flows from the CDFs      cause or contribute to violations of Delaware Surface Water      Quality Standards. This is an issue of concern for the      Department because CDFs often discharge return flows into      ecologically sensitive, shallow water habitats which have      limited dilution and dispersion capacity. To evaluate whether      return flows are causing or contributing to violations of the      Standards, the Corps will need to collect data on flow rate,      duration, concentration, and toxicity of CDF discharges and      then determine the resulting concentration and toxicity in      the receiving water through a combination of fate and      transport modeling and in-stream sampling. Both near-field      (i.e., mixing zone) and far-field (i.e., complete mix)      concentrations and toxicity resulting from the discharges      must be determined and compared to applicable Standards.       Sampling and analysis for the CDF should follow the general      approach taken by the Corps in evaluating the Pedricktown CDF      (i.e., ``Pedricktown Confined Disposal Facility Contaminant      Loading and Water Quality Analysis,'' June 1999). The Corps      will need to submit a sampling plan/scope of work to the      Department for review and approval prior to proceeding with      this work and prior to discharging from the CDFs. Close out      reports detailing the findings of the sampling and analysis      will also need to be submitted to the Department for review      and approval. If violations of applicable Standards are      identified, then the close out report should identify the      steps the Corps intends to take in order to eliminate future      violations. Based upon the findings of the initial studies,      the Department will determine the nature and extent of      subsequent testing that will need to be performed at the CDFs      in order to assess compliance with Delaware Surface Water      Quality Standards.       In addition to the testing described above, the Corps will      also need to collect contaminant data for surface sediments      in the CDFs and assess potential impacts to terrestrial and      avian species that may use the disposal areas. A plan to      accomplish this work should be submitted to the Department      for review and approval, as should a close out report. If      unacceptable risks are identified as a result of this      assessment, then the Corps will need to develop a plan to      limit access to the site.       Finally, the Corps will need to submit an annual letter to      the Department which summarizes the operational history and      structural integrity of any CDF used over the previous year.      The letter should address the following factors:       Condition of containment berms, dewatering and stormwater      weirs, and other structures.       Summary of disposal operations at the CDF over the past      year, including volumes of material placed into the CDF, as      well as volumes, mass loading, duration, and timing of return      flows.       Summary of maintenance and management activities conducted      at the CDF.       Summary of any material removed from the site.       Analysis of available remaining disposal capacity at the      site.       Summary of surface and groundwater monitoring programs not      otherwise covered in the study identified above.     Monitoring during dredging operation       It will be necessary to monitor during dredging operations      in order to ensure that the predictions of ``no significant      impacts'' are fulfilled. Therefore, the Corps should submit a      sampling plan to the Department for review and approval.       Measuring the exact position of the dredge at all times is      essential to ensuring that the channel and bends are deepened      based upon the footprint of the original project. Sampling in      the water column surrounding the excavation will require, at      a minimum, collection of data on total suspended solids      concentrations, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and any      contaminants of concern identified in the pre-dredge      evaluation. Suspended solids must be maintained between 25      and 250 mg/l at the edge of a two-hundred foot regulatory      mixing zone in order to meet water quality standards,      according to the report Metal Contamination of Sediments in      the Delaware River Navigation Channel (Greene, 1999). The      results from all sampling data must be compared to applicable      Delaware Surface Water Quality Standards, and any exceedances      must be reported immediately.       The Corps must also work with DNREC to develop a protocol      that will come into effect if water quality violations are      identified. This would include events where total suspended      solids are higher than those determined to be sustainable      around the point of excavation.       Additionally, the Corps must follow established protocol if      turtles, sturgeon, or other species of concern are identified      in the dredge slurry or if there is indication that these      species are excessively impacted.       Standard best management practices should be used to the      extent practicable during the dredging operation in order to      minimize sediment suspension, impacts to aquatic organisms,      and water quality exceedances.       If the Corps intends to use the practice of economic      loading during the Main Channel Deepening project, this must      be discussed with the DNREC. Permission must be granted for      economic loading and will be limited by geographical location      and material characteristics. Additional monitoring will also      be required.     Bi-Annual Reporting       In addition to the annual reporting information stated      above, I request that the Secretary of DNREC receive a bi-     annual report detailing the progress of the Main Channel      Deepening project, including the locations dredged in the      previous twelve months, the status and capacity of CDFs, and      any unforeseen consequences and their remedies. I would      expect members of my staff to be in regular contact with      their peers at the Corps in order to ensure that the project      satisfies the requirements of the State of Delaware's      laws, regulations, and standards.               5. Fisheries and living resource concerns       Aquatic species of concern include sea turtles, several      species of whales, and shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon, along      with several others. The Corps must follow the recommended      dredging windows as established     by the Delaware River Basin Fish and Wildlife Cooperative and      as reported in the 1997 Supplemental Environmental Impact      Statement.       In addition, the following concerns from the Division of      Fish and Wildlife must be addressed:       Striped bass spawning is a concern from the Delaware      Memorial Bridge to Philadelphia April 15 to June 15. The      Delaware Basin Fish and Wildlife Cooperative May 1997 policy      entitled ``Seasonal restrictions for dredging, blasting and      overboard disposal in the mainstream of the Delaware River''      should be followed in order to protect anadromous spawners      such as striped bass.       Atlantic sturgeon spawning sites are located over rocky      bottom in the deepest portion of the river. Spawning season      is April 15 to June 15. Because the eggs adhere to the hard      surfaces, rock should not be blasted or removed from the      river through the end of June to protect sturgeon eggs and      larvae.       Atlantic sturgeon wintering areas are located from      Artificial Island to Chester, Pennsylvania.       An observer should be placed on hopper dredges to monitor      for sturgeon impacts on overwintering fish in the wintering      areas.       The Corps will need an ``incidental take statement'' from      NMFS as required under the Endangered Species Act for sea      turtles and shortnose sturgeon. The Corps should ensure that      their agreement with NMFS reflects the most up-to-date      requirements. A copy of this statement should be provided to      the Division of Fish and Wildlife.       In addition, a turtle observer should be on board the      dredge during the period of the year when sea turtles are      known to be present in our area. The report from this      observer, as well as any identified turtle parts, should be      forwarded to the Division of Fish and Wildlife as well.                         6. Future Maintenance       If the Main Channel is deepened, there will be increased      volumes of material removed during each maintenance cycle in      order to achieve the project depth. This material will place      additional burden on existing disposal areas, causing them to      fill at a more rapid rate than with the forty-foot project      depth. As a result, new disposal facilities must be sited or      beneficial uses must be developed for the material currently      contained in the facilities. The Corps must be prepared to      address dredged material placement needs in the context of      future maintenance related to the proposed deepening.       We look forward to continuing our dialogue and working to      resolve the above issues before any plans for actual      construction take place. As the Department of Natural      Resources and Environmental Control, it is our mission to      ensure that projects are designed to avoid or minimize      adverse impacts on air and water quality, habitat, and living      resources. The above requests and requirements are in keeping      with this charge as it applies to the proposed deepening of      the Delaware River Main Channel.           Sincerely,                                           Nicholas A. DiPasquale,     Secretary.                                  ____         Department of Natural Resources and Environmental            Control,                                         Dover, DE, July 14, 2000.     LTC Debra M. Lewis,     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building,          Philadelphia, PA.     Re: Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project       Dear Lieutenant Colonel Lewis: The Department of Natural      Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has reviewed your      letter of June 9, 2000 and the updated matrix entitled      ``Assessment of Environmental Issues'' that you provided in      response to my March 31, 2000 letter regarding the deepening      of the Delaware River Main Channel. This letter also      addresses issues raised in your most recent correspondence to      me of July 9, 2000. Let me begin by thanking you and your      staff for meeting with me and members of my staff, discussing      our concerns and providing the organized response. Overall,      we appear to be in agreement on the means to resolve many      issues. Clarifications of DNREC requirements for specific      issues are outlined below. We still have several remaining      concerns.       The following are comments from the Department regarding      the matrix ``Assessment of Environmental Issues.'' Comments      are organized by section.     1.0  CONFINED DISPOSAL FACILITIES           1.1 & 1.2  The Corps will need to follow the              requirements for Delaware permit processing,              regardless of the eventual enforcement mechanism.              DNREC uses EPA Application Form 1--General              Information; EPA Application Form 2D--New Sources and              New Discharges and EPA Application Form 2E--             Facilities Which Do Not Discharge Process Wastewater              to collect information to control discharges such as              those from CDFs. These forms must be filled out and              submitted to the Division of Water Resources for all              discharges that could impact Delaware waters. Copies              are attached.           1.3  Procedures for effluent monitoring must be              submitted to DNREC for review and comment. This              should be sent along with the information required              for permit processing (above). State of Delaware              water quality standards attached.           1.4  It appears that DNREC's concern for contaminants              might be deferred until post project. DNREC's              original comment reflected two concerns: potential              contaminant discharge during de-watering and              potential longer term impacts after de-watering.              These concerns need by addressed by the Corps before              the project commences.     2.0  SAND PLACEMENT ON DELAWARE BEACHES           2.1  See Attachment A for a list of Delaware's              preferred locations for sand placement.           The FEIS does not address the impacts of placing              material on Delaware beaches. The EIS will not be              complete until it is amended to address this issue.           2.2  It is unclear from your response whether you              intend to apply for Subaqueous Lands permits. Does              your acknowledgement of 401 Water Quality              Certification requirements include agreement on              Subaqueous Lands permits? A Subaqueous Lands permit              or its enforceable equivalent is needed.           2.3  DNREC is satisfied with the agreement regarding              horseshoe crab protection measures.     3.0  WETLAND CREATION/ENHANCEMENT           3.1  If tidal wetlands are to be impacted during the              construction of Kelly Island, the substantive              requirements of a State of Delaware wetlands permit              must be obtained before any work can commence.           If the de-watering of Kelly Island necessitates a              discharge into surface waters, the Crops will be              required to complete the same application forms              required for CDFs.           3.2  DNREC will continue working with the Corps until a              final wetland design plan can be approved. Work              cannot commence until this plan is finalized.              Regardless of what the Kelly Island project is              referred to, we are targeting the survival rates              outlined in the March 31, 2000 letter as measures of              success.           3.3  A post-construction monitoring plan to ensure              protection of water quality standards must be              developed by the Corps and submitted to DNREC for              review and approval before the project can commence.              In addition, the Corps must clarify how long it              intends to maintain the beach constructed in front of              the wetland area.           3.4  A Subaqueous Lands permit or its enforceable              equivalent is required.     4.0  OYSTER HABITAT MONITORING           DNREC is awaiting the final oyster-monitoring plan from              the Corps for review and comment. The monitoring plan              should include widespread measures of sediment              coverage.     5.0  WATER QUALITY MONITORING           DNREC requires that a sampling plan at the point of              dredging be submitted for review and comment. This              plan is to include steps to be taken if TSS exceeds              250 mg/l.           Corps regulations require that an EIS address water              quality impacts in states adjoining areas where side              channels and berthing areas are to be dredged. The              Corps is to assist the states where this dredging is              to occur in obtaining Section 401 Water Quality              Certification from the State where there could be              adverse impacts on water quality. The Corps has not              done this for the dredging that will occur at Marcus              Hook.     6.0  ENDANGERED SPECIES           6.1  DNREC requires the submission of protocols for              monitoring potential impacts to sea turtles and              short-nose sturgeon for review and comment before the              project commences.           6.2  DNREC is satisfied with agreements regarding              protections of sea turtles.     7.0  DREDGING           7.1  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging              windows.           7.2  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging              windows for striped bass.           7.3  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging              windows for Atlantic sturgeon.           7.4  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging              windows for Atlantic sturgeon.           7.5  DNREC is satisfied regarding Atlantic sturgeon              overwintering monitoring for hopper dredge              activities.           7.6  The extent of economic loading needs to be              finalized and approved by DNREC before the project              can commence.           * Please note final comments regarding female              overwintering blue crabs.     8.0 REPORTING           8.1.  An outline for the CDF Annual Operational Report              must be submitted to DNREC for review and comment              before the project may commence.           A description of current CDF site conditions must also              be submitted.           8.2  DNREC is satisfied with agreements for bi-annual              progress reporting.           8.3  DNREC is satisfied with agreements for CDF              capacity for maintenance.       Please share with us as soon as possible the Corps'      proposed dredging schedule and dredging techniques. Over the      past years, we have discussed many dredging closure windows      and investigated the impacts of economic loading. If the      Corps plans to dredge the lower Delaware Bay during the      winter, we need to know what measures will be put in place to      avoid and reduce impacts to overwintering female blue crabs.      During cold winters female blue crabs hibernate in the      channel, particularly on the channel sides. They may be      torpid and unable to move away from the dredge as stated in      the Supplemental EIS. This, combined with the possibility of      economic loading depositing a burdensome amount of sediment      on top of them, should be accounted for and avoided. This      most important fishery must be protected.       Also, we have gotten conflicting information regarding the      final quality of rock available after blasting. As you may be      aware, our conditional consistency determination required the      Corps to make this rock available to Delaware for habitat      improvement. This rock is a resource that belongs to      Delaware. Placement of rock in Delaware's eleven permitted      reef sites could serve as partial mitigation for unavoidable      fisheries impacts sustained during the dredging process.       Additionally, a preliminary DNREC review of berthing area      sediment toxicity data has shown contamination levels of      concern. We are just now bringing this issue up because of      the length of time it took the Corps to provide the requested      data and the time it took our staff to convert the raw data      to an electronic format to facilitate analysis. I trust you      have shared this information with the state environmental      agencies of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It is our      understanding that Corps regulations and Section 401 of the      Clean Water Act require that an EIS address water quality      impacts in states adjoining areas where side channel berthing      areas are to be dredged and that the Corps is to assist      states to obtain Section 401 Water Quality Certification from      the affected state. DNREC requests that you document      potential effects to waters of the State of Delaware from      dredging activities in side channel/berthing areas in      adjoining states.       Finally, as previously discussed on numerous occasions and      as we have maintained over the past decade, the State of      Delaware continues to assert that the Corps is subject to      state permitting requirements for this project. We have      provided your legal and technical staff with appropriate      statutory and regulatory requirements and permit application      forms. Before we will entertain any further discussion about      alternative mechanisms for satisfying these remaining      environmental and regulatory requirements, the U.S. Army      Corps of Engineers must provide to the Delaware Department of      Natural Resources and Environmental Control a written legal      justification that articulates why the Corps should be exempt      from applying for required State of Delaware permits.           Sincerely,                                           Nicholas A. DiPasquale,                                                        Secretary.                 Solar and Renewable Energy Activities
