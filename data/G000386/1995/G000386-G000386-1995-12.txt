 President, I would like to speak briefly on the conference report on the Department of Defense [DOD] appropriation bill.  The amount of money provided in this measure is too high.  I argued for a lower figure when we debated the budget resolution.  And I argued for a lower figure when we debated the defense authorization bill.  The cold war is over.  The Soviet military threat is gone.  We are closing military bases. Our force structure is shrinking.  Defense budgets should be coming down--not going up. But we lost that battle.  For unknown reasons, Congress decided on the higher number, and that's that.  Mr. President, I didn't come here to argue about the size of the defense budget.  I come to the floor to thank my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, for his advice and assistance with the DOD unmatched disbursements problem.  Last year, with the help of my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, we began the process of trying to fix the $30 billion unmatched disbursement problem.  We established thresholds at which DOD must match disbursements with obligations--before making a payment.  This year, Senator Stevens helped to reenergize and continue that process. He is helping to keep the pressure on.  And DOD Comptroller John Hamre is doing his part. He's helping, too.  In the coming months, both the General Accounting Office [GAO] and DOD Inspector General [IG] will be conducting detailed reviews of DOD's emerging capability to prematch disbursements.  Next year, at this time, I hope we are in a position to lay out a road map for ratcheting down the thresholds.  Next year, I hope we can move the threshold to zero.  Mr. President, as I have said many times, with $30 billion in unmatched disbursements, there are no effective internal controls over a big chunk of the DOD budget.  That means those accounts are vulnerable to theft and abuse.  Mr. President, we must keep the pressure on and keep moving down the road toward the time when all DOD payments are prematched.  I thank Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and Mr. John Hamre for their help in trying to fix this problem.  Mr. President, I would also like to seek the advice and assistance of the committee's leadership on another issue.  I am concerned about the possible existence of a slush fund at the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA].  Recent press reports suggest that bureaucrats in just one CIA office--the National Reconnaissance Office [NRO]--accumulated a pool of unspent money that totaled between $1 and $2 billion.  Now, I know that the committee has taken certain steps in this bill to recover some of the money.  The bill also includes restrictive language governing the availability of CIA appropriations.  The restrictive language is embodied in section 8070 of the bill.  I commend the committee for taking these important steps.  However, in my mind, the action taken in the bill is a short-term fix.  We need to get at the root cause of the problem.  We need to understand the mechanisms that allowed bureaucrats in the NRO--and possibly other CIA offices--to accumulate huge sums of money.  And we need to develop a long-term solution.  Mr. President, we must not allow the CIA to accumulate huge sums of money in a honey pot that lies outside of the law.  The CIA must handle unspent appropriations in ways that are consistent with the requirements of title 31 of the United States Code, and in particular, the M account reform law.  Senator Roth and I have sent a letter on this matter to the committee chairman, Senator Hatfield.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to Senator Hatfield, along with an article from the Washington Post on the same issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1995.     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mark: We are writing to express concern about the      possible existence of a slush fund at the Central      Intelligence Agency (CIA) and to seek your help in launching      an independent review to determine the origins of the money      and root cause of the problem.       The source of our concern is a series of reports that      appeared recently in the Washington Post and New York Times.      These reports suggest that one office within the CIA--the      National Reconnaissance Office--has accumulated ``a pool of      unspent money'' that totals between $1 billion and $1.7      billion and that some of these funds may have been used for      unauthorized purposes.       In the wake of these disturbing revelations, unnamed      intelligence officials readily admitted: ``The agency's      financial practices were governed by custom, not by written      rules. . . . Many of the financial practices were time-     honored, but they were not documented. . . . They were just      folklore'' [New York Times, September 25, 1995, page 11].       On the surface, based solely on these very sketchy news      reports, we have to conclude that the CIA's books need more      scrutiny. A potential multi-billion dollar slush fund in just      one CIA office plus a possible breakdown of discipline and      integrity in accounting equals a recipe for abuse.       We must not allow the CIA to accumulate a ``pot of gold''      that lies outside of the law.       As you may remember, back in the late 1980's, Congress      discovered the infamous M account slush fund at the      Department of Defense (DOD) and at other agencies as well.      The M accounts, which were also known as the ``honey pot,''      were being used by DOD to circumvent the law--primarily the      Anti-Deficiency Act (31 USC 1341)--and to fund cost overruns      and other unauthorized activities beyond the purview of      Congress. DOD, for instance, had stashed at least $50 billion      in these accounts.       After holding extensive hearings that examined abusive M      account practices as revealed in audit reports prepared by      the Inspectors General and General Accounting Office,      Congress took decisive steps to close down the entire M      account operation.       The M account reform legislation was signed into law by the      President on December 5, 1990. It is embodied in Sections      1405 and 1406 of Public Law 101-510. It closed the M      accounts, canceled billions in unspent balances in ``merged      surplus authority,'' and place strict limits on the      availability of ``unspent'' appropriations of the kind      described in the above-mentioned press reports. To the best      of my knowledge, this law applies to all government agencies,      including the CIA.       The M account reform law in combination with all the other      laws governing the use of appropriations--as spelled out in      Title 31 of the U.S. Code--are supposed to make it very      difficult--if not impossible--to create a slush fund within      any government institution.       If the CIA is indeed ``hoarding'' money, as White House      Chief of Staff Leon Panetta has suggested, and stashing it      away for a rainy day, then Congress needs to know about it.      We should know about it because we have passed a law that is      designed to prevent bureaucrats from accumulating money      outside of the law. If the CIA has succeeded in doing that,      then we would like to understand exactly how it was done.      There may be a loophole in the law that needs to be plugged.       For these reasons, we are seeking your advice and      assistance on how to initiate an independent review of the      CIA's accounting records pertaining to balances of      unobligated and unexpended appropriations.       We need to know if the CIA is complying with the M account      reform act. Toward that end, certain questions need to be      answered: Were the agency's merged surplus and M accounts      closed and balances canceled as required by law? Are expired      appropriation account balances being canceled after five      years as required by law? Is the agency protecting the      integrity of expired appropriations accounts as required by      law? Have the agency's no-year accounts been handled      according to law? No doubt, there are other important      questions, but these are the ones that immediately come to      mind.       Between August 1991 and October 1992, the GAO conducted an      audit of residual M account monies throughout the government.      The results of this audit were published in a report entitled      ``Agencies Actions to Eliminate M Accounts and Merged Surplus      Authority'' in June 1993, Report Number AFMD-93-7.      Unfortunately, the CIA was not among the agencies reviewed.      The GAO, we are told, cannot get the access needed to audit      CIA accounts. The inability of the GAO to audit the CIA's      books leaves a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding      government-wide compliance with the M account reform law.       Mark, we would like to feel confident that the monies      Congress appropriates for the CIA are being controlled and      used in ways that are consistent with the requirements for      Title 31 of the U.S. Code, and in particular, the M account      reform law.       We have never examined a financial management issue at the      CIA and need your advice on how to proceed with such a      review.       Your assistance in this matter would be appreciated.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.     William V. Roth, Jr.,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 1995]               Defense Gives Its Accounting System a `3'                            (By Dana Priest)       Despite efforts to turn around what the Pentagon concedes      is an error-prone, cross-eyed financial accounting system,      top Defense Department officials yesterday said that on a      scale of 1 to 10, the ability to track where $260 billion is      spent each year rates only a sorry ``3.''       ``We are far short'' of being able to produce clean,      auditable annual financial statements, Richard F. Keevey,      director of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told      a congressional panel yesterday.       Summoned by a subcommittee of the House Committee on      Government Reform and Oversight--called in part to respond to      Washington Post articles about the problem in May--the      department's top financial officers and investigators from      the General Accounting Office and the inspector general's      office explained, defended and criticized the way the      department manages the money Congress gives it.       Only three members of the subcommittee showed up, and one      only briefly, perhaps a testimony to how arcane and      complicated the subject can be.       Chairman Rep. Steve Horn (R-Calif.) described the state of      Pentagon bookkeeping as something not even up to the      standards of ``every Mom and Pop store in America.''       ``What you're telling us today is a disgrace to the      American fighting men and women,'' said ranking minority      member Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), her voice rising in      frustration before she bolted out the door for a quick floor      vote. ``I'm sorry, I'm a little upset.''       What was upsetting to Maloney and Horn was good news to the      Pentagon officials who      point out that their accounting problems are decades-old and are only      now getting better. For instance:       The accumulated amount of payments that cannot be traced      with certainty to particular purchases has fallen from $50      billion in June 1993 to $20.5 billion in September.       The department now refuses to pay any bill larger than $1      million without the proper bookkeeping. The threshold used to      be $5 million, although the higher figure still applies to      its major, trouble-plagued Columbus, Ohio, check writing      center because contractors there complained that a new      standard would dramatically slow payments.       On the other hand, department Inspector General Eleanor      Hill testified the financial data ``for the vast majority of      [Defense Department] funds remain essentially not in      condition to audit,'' according to Hill's written statement.       ``The same types of system problems and internal control      weaknesses that hamper preparation of annual financial      statements,'' she said, ``also impair the efficiency of day-     to-day operations.''       So concerned is the IG's office about the problems that it      is deploying 700 auditors to snoop around the finance and      auditing areas at the department. Still, it does not expect a      significant turnaround until the year 2000, she said.
