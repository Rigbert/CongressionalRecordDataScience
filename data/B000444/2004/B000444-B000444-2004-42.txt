 President, Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner's requests for Federal disaster relief following Henri and Isabel was approved and FEMA was on the ground in Glenville immediately to assist.

The State of Delaware and New Castle County have now stepped in with $15 million each to purchase and destroy flood-damaged homes.
