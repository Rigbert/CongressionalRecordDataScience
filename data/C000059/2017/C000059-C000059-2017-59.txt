Chairman, I would reiterate that California has done more to clean air than virtually any other State in the Union based upon its regulatory structure that we created and I continue to support.  But technologies do not exist to meet standards that have been set out by the Obama administration. So this gives us time to do what we need to do, and that is to clean up ozone, and that is exactly what we are going to do. But this is not the amendment that is going to do that.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose that amendment strongly and urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
