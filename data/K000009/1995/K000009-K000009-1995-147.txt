Speaker, in my 13 years as a Member of Congress, I have never experienced what happened yesterday in this House. Instead of doing the people's business, this House adjourned yesterday at 3:50 in the afternoon, in the middle of a workday afternoon when most Americans are still on the job. Why? Money, and millions of dollars of it. That is right. Congress adjourned early yesterday so that Republican Members with Speaker Gingrich at the helm could fly to New York to attend a GOP fundraiser aboard the Intrepid Sea and Air Space Museum, where wealthy givers paid $1.7 million to hobnob with Republican Members who did not work a full day yesterday, but were not docked for their pay.  During the first 2 months of this year, the Republican Campaign Committee has raised over $11 million. That is over $123,000 a day. Maybe it is time to ask ourselves who is fighting for America here in Washington, and should not those Members who left early be docked on their pay?                          ____________________
