 President, I would like to continue my discussion on the integrity of the Department of Defense budget.  Yesterday, I examined accounting disconnects in four key areas of the defense budget.  Now, I would like to turn to the budget/future years defense program disconnect or the plans reality mismatch, as it is sometimes called.  This is about the disconnect between the Future Years Defense Program or FYDP and the President's budget.  I first became aware of this problem in the early 1980's, after hearing about the work of Mr. Chuck Spinney--an analyst in the Pentagon's Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation.  Mr. Spinney treated the Senate Armed Services and Budget Committees to a stack of his famous spaghetti diagrams at a special hearing held in the Caucus Room in late February 1983.  This was an unprecedented event.  It was the only joint Armed Services/Budget Committee hearing ever held.  Moreover, it took place despite a concerted effort by certain DOD officials to suppress Mr. Spinney's work and block the hearing.  In a room filled with TV cameras and bright lights, Chuck Spinney engaged the Reagan defense heavyweights in battle.  Cap Weinberger was the Secretary of Defense at the time.  When the day was over, Mr. Chuck Spinney had skewered them with their own spear.  Mr. Spinney had used Secretary Weinberger's own FYDP data to expose the flaws in his massive plan to ramp up the defense budget.  This was the crux of Mr. Spinney's Plans/Reality Mismatch briefing:  The final bill for Weinberger's fiscal year 1983-87 FYDP would be $500 billion more than promised.  Mr. Spinney's outstanding performance won him a place on the cover of Time magazine on March 7, 1983.  That was 12 years ago.  Again, all of this stuff happened before 54 of my colleagues ever set foot in this chamber.  Well, the brawl over the build-up led to a slew of reform initiatives: The Carlucci Initiatives; the Grace Commission; Nunn-McCurdy legislation; two Packard Commissions; Goldwater-Nichols legislation; and the Defense Management Review.  We were told that these initiatives would cure the disease, but they didn't.  The same old problem persists. Nothing has changed. Nothing has been fixed.  And things may be getting worse--as the budget vise is tightened down.  The money gap between the Pentagon programs and the budget persists.  Today, the GAO figures that the FYDP is overprogrammed by at least $150 billion.  That's a conservative estimate, too.  The CBO has come up with a somewhat lower estimate but a gap nonetheless.  There is a consensus on the problem but not on the solution.  Should we pump up the defense budget to close the gap--as some of my Republican colleagues suggest?  My Republican friends seem bound and determined to start up that slippery slope toward higher defense budgets.  They want to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's.  They want to rip open the national money sack at both ends and get out the big scoop shovel.  But why and for what?  The Soviet military threat is gone.  The cold war is over.  We need to begin balancing the budget.  And DOD's finance and accounting operation is flat busted.  And if it is really busted like I think it is, then DOD does not know how much money it needs right now.  Nor does anybody else.  Leadership and better management are the only solution--not more money.  Well, in the 1980's--at the height of the cold war, Congress did approve major increases in the defense budget.  That is true.  But Congress refused to close the massive gap between the Pentagon FYDP's and the Reagan budgets.  The gap was just too big.  Yet that is exactly what some of my Republican colleagues want to do today.  Cap Weinberger was Secretary of Defense when we argued this out 10 years ago.  He kept asking for more and more money.  But Mr. Spinney's analysis of DOD's own data showed that the military was getting less and less capability.  The topline kept rising.  But so did the gap.  The money sacks were piled high on the Pentagon steps, but there was never enough.  By the mid-1980's, Secretary Weinberger's 5-year funding roadmap topped out at $2 trillion. That was the fiscal year 1986 FYDP.  Congress just did not buy it.  Congress put the brakes on and slapped a lid on defense spending.  With the help of my Democratic and Republican allies, I was able to put a freeze on defense spending in 1985.  We were convinced that all the extra money was just making matters worse.  It was generating waste and abuse rather than more military strength.  The spare parts horror stories kept pouring out and finally and completely discredited the defense budget buildup.  Congress literally carved up Secretary Weinberger's ambitious 5-year plans.  Take, for example, the fiscal year 1983-87 FYDP.  It's price tag was a staggering $1.6 trillion plus.  Congress balked and cut the plan back to $1.1 trillion.  The final amounts appropriated were $600 billion below Weinberger's request.  We never got close to the $400 to $500 billion a year defense budgets that Secretary Weinberger wanted.  Mr. Weinberer's plans were unrealistic. They were not affordable, and they were totally out of line with what was really needed.  That is exactly where we are today.  Mr. President, that concludes my statement for today.  Tomorrow, I hope to complete my discussion of the Program/Budget mismatch.  I yield the floor.                            ____________________
