Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).                              {time}  2130  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, this past winter, families across the Northeast saw their budget stretched to the limit by skyrocketing home heating oil costs. Over 50 percent of families in Connecticut depend on oil to heat their homes in the winter months. For middle-class working families in my State and throughout the Northeast, the increase in home heating oil prices broke the bank.  I received thousands of calls from my constituents asking for help. For example, I received a call from Thomas Marcarelli of East Haven. He has a family with four children, ages three, six, seven and nine. In order to pay for heating oil, he has had to send in his mortgage payment late, cut back on his family's groceries, and drop his thermostat by 10 degrees with children in the house to stretch out his supply.  It appears that Mr. Marcarelli and his family and families across the Northeast may face another very cold season. This winter they are estimating that home heating oil will increase by another 10 percent.  My concern is, and I support this amendment, but we had an opportunity several weeks ago with the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) when he offered such an amendment and was defeated by two votes. In terms of allowing the President the authority to release the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Kilpatrick) offered this amendment in committee just a few days ago.  I support this amendment, but my concern, as always, is that we try to play politics with these issues when families in my part of the country and families in other parts of the country are suffering because, in fact, the Republican leadership has not allowed us to create an energy policy in this country. It fails to reduce our dependence on oil.  That is the direction that we need to move in. We need to support this amendment tonight. But we also need to do something about solar renewable energy. We also need to do something about providing the opportunity for an energy policy that meets the needs of the people in this country.
