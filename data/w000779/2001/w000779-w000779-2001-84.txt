Hillman.  Deputy Hillman was tragically killed in the line of duty 1 year ago when the van he was driving was hit by a truck, killing Deputy Hillman and the three prisoners he was transporting. Deputy Hillman's defensive driving actions during that terrible incident helped save the life of a U.S. Marshals Service guard traveling with him that afternoon.  The U.S. Marshals Service and Oregon experienced a great loss with the death of Deputy Hillman. His 14-year U.S. Marshals Service career began in 1986 in San Jose, California. He later transferred to the Eastern District of California in Fresno. It was there that he was given the nickname ``The Hillmanator'' for his relentless efforts in apprehending narcotics fugitives.  Whether his duties entailed lending support to members of the community in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Marilyn, apprehending fugitives during ``Operation Sunrise,'' providing security at a high-threat trial in Montana or at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, he gave his all in everything he did. Deputy Hillman was a dedicated and courageous man with an enthusiasm for life. His name is now engraved on the Marshals Service's ``Roll Call of Honor,'' along with nearly 200 other dedicated and brave individuals who have set a standard of excellence for all United States Marshals and Deputy Marshals.  Today is the anniversary of Deputy Hillman's death, so I would like to take this opportunity to express my sorrow to the family of Deputy Marshal Hillman. I know they miss him dearly, and I want them to know he has not been forgotten.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in expressing gratitude to the family of Deputy U.S. Marshal Peter Hillman for his service to our country. Displaying valor in both his life and his work, Deputy Marshal Hillman is a tribute to this great nation.                          ____________________
