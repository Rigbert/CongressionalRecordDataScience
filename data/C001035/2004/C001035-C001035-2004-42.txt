President, Don Nickles first came to the Senate in 1980 as a young man of 31 with a vision. He now leaves us, 24 years later, with a record we all can envy and a reputation we all should emulate. There are a lot of words that can be used to describe this man. Perhaps these five describe him best: ``As good as his word.''  In his eloquent eulogy to Ronald Reagan this summer, Don said that those who came to Washington after the watershed election of 1980, ``considered ourselves part of the soldiers in the field trying to get an agenda done to expand freedom.''  There is no more noble an agenda than the expansion of freedom, and he has been a devoted soldier to that cause. He has been a strong advocate for our Armed Forces, dedicated to the defense of our Nation and to the expansion of liberty around the world.  He has been equally devoted to the freedom that comes from responsible, less intrusive and more accountable government. He is a champion of effective economic-growth policies, and of tax reform that encourages investment and helps build strong families and communities. Don Nickles has always been of the side of the American people. His tenure as chairman of the Budget Committee will long be held up as a model of effective leadership, a cooperative spirit wedded to rock-solid principles.  Don comes from a small State and from a background in small business. That we have not always agreed on every issue is insignificant. What does matter is the values we share and the friendship that is the result.  Don is much more than just an especially effective legislator and a very good friend. When Oklahoma City was struck by a heinous act of terrorism in 1995, he was there for the people of his State, offering comfort and support. The rebuilding, both material and spiritual, would not have been so quickly and thoroughly accomplished without the strength of Don Nickles.  He came here as a young man and, despite the passage of 24 years, leaves as a young man. And, I might add, as a pretty fast man. In the New York Marathon last weekend, Oklahoma's senior senator finished in the top half of a field of more than 36,000 runners. If there was a caucus for Senators able to run more than 26 miles in less than 4\1/2\ hours, I believe it would be the smallest in the history of the republic.  Thank you, Senator Don Nickles, for your service to this institution and to this country. Whatever path the future sets before you, I know you will be at the front of the pack.                            ernest hollings
