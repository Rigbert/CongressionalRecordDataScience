 President, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the students of Glendale High School on becoming the U.S. representative at the Junior G8 Summit.  For the first time in 30 years, the annual G8 Summit will include an official exchange between children aged 13 to 17 and G8 leaders. Glendale High School beat out 14 other schools for this once-in-a-lifetime chance to represent the United States at the Summit.  The Junior 8 Youth Forum will provide the participants from all over the world a platform from which they can express their opinions on issues such as infectious diseases, violence, corruption, education, energy, and security. The U.S. team and their international counterparts will meet in order to draft a communique which eight of them will present to the G8 leaders.  These students could not have achieved this memorable accomplishment without tremendous support and encouragement from their dedicated teachers and parents.  I would also recognize team members Shaunt Attarian, Rigo Benitez, Edgar Hernandez, Sergio Maciel, Viannca Montesino, Elaine Panlaqui, Diana Perez, and Kelly Velasquez for their poise and determination in working towards receiving this honor.  All eight team members have spent time and energy for over 6 months preparing to represent the United States with respect and intelligence at this prestigious event. The Glendale High School Junior G8 team should be commended for their efforts and stand as an inspiration to us all.  Once again, I would like to honor the entire Glendale High School Junior G8 Team on a well-deserved victory. Each of these students holds wonderful promise, and I applaud them for their many achievements. Their futures are bright, and their performance will continue to serve as a model for those who follow in their footsteps.                          ____________________
