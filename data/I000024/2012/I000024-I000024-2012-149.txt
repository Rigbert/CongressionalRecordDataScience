Yuan, of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, who announced on April 25, 2012, the donation by his government of 1,150 metric tons of rice to Kenya through Feed the Children, a well-known and respected charity based in my home State of Oklahoma.  The food emergency in the Horn of Africa is a stark humanitarian crisis and Kenya simply has not received enough rain to feed its people. Record-high food prices, internal conflicts, and insecurity in the region have exacerbated the situation. With malnutrition and disease on the rise, dane Kenyan families are required to travel long distances in search of food. It is evident that outside help must be provided.  The people of Taiwan are providing that help. Its generous gift will have an immediate impact on relieving the hardships brought on by this first drought of the 21st century.  Ronald Reagan once said that ``a hungry child knows no politics,'' meaning that the American people are always willing to open up their hearts and the blessings of their bounty to the less fortunate around the world. The people of Taiwan are doing the same thing today through this generous donation.  Some may say that this gracious donation of rice is a mere drop in the bucket compared to the overall need in Africa. Yet one must remember that every mighty wave starts with a tiny ripple.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record remarks from Ambassador Jason C. Yuan.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Ambassador Jason C. Yuan's Remarks at the Twin Oaks Estate                             Apri1 25, 2012       Mr. Steve Whetstone, Congressman Dan Burton, Ms. Barbara      Schrage of AIT/W, Mr. Mark Powers and Ms. Kiersten Powers of      Senator James Inhofe's Office, ladies and gentlemen, good      morning!       On behalf of my government, I am pleased to announce that      the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of      China (Taiwan), in cooperation with the Red Cross of the      Republic of China and Feed the Children have decided to form      an alliance to donate 1,150 metric tons of rice to Kenya, a      country currently suffering a famine. This partnership will      allow the rice donation from Taiwan to be distributed with      the help of FTC in refugee camps, to ongoing relief efforts      in Turkana and to primary schools in Mombasa, Kenya.       Feed the Children is one of the largest international      charities, with its headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,      and based on Christian values. It has been dedicated to      providing hope and resources for those without life's      essentials throughout the United States and the world for      decades.       Taiwan and FTC have associated in the past and successfully      cooperated in 2005 to deliver 10,000 metric tons of rice to      the tsunami ravaged areas in Indonesia. In 2006 Taiwan      donated 52 containers of new clothing to FTC worth      approximately US $17.6 million, which were later distributed      to more than 16,000 children, orphans, elderly, abandoned and      others in need in 11 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua,      Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia,      Azerbaijan, Russia, Armenia, and Ukraine). In 2007, Taiwan      donated 5,000 metric tons of rice to Kenya and 5,000 metric      tons of rice to Malawi through FTC, to help people in those      two countries suffering from famine. In 2011, Taiwan donated      100 metric tons of rice to restart the Mombasa Kenya School      Feeding Program, benefiting 27,000 children for 2 school      terms.       Enhancing Taiwan's contributions to international      development is one of the three lines of defense that      President Ma Ying-jeou has outlined for the ROC's national      security. As a maturing democracy and thriving economy,      Taiwan has been shouldering our own responsibilities in the      world. Humanitarian work has become an especially important      platform for Taiwan's contributions to the international      community. Taiwan's democracy and economic prosperity have      combined to give rise to a vibrant society of numerous non-     profit organizations. In almost every major disaster relief      program that has occurred in the world recently, Taiwan has      been an important contributor, whether this meant providing      financial aid to help rebuild homes in Sichuan, or giving      life-sustaining medical aid to Haitian children. Taiwan was      also one of the first to arrive with emergency relief      supplies and rescue teams when Japan was struck by the triple      disaster of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear incident. In      fact, Taiwan ended up donating more than US $200 million to      the Japanese people.       Last week, President Ma just wrapped up a 12-day official      visit to Burkina Faso, Gambia and Swaziland, our three allies      in Africa. Pursuing a policy of viable diplomacy that      requires that all foreign assistance must be justified,      legitimate and efficient, President Ma announced a donation      of US $2.1 million worth of support to Mali refugee      assistance efforts in Burkina Faso, and US $3 million to      emergency food programs in Gambia. The project ``A Lamp      Lighting up Africa'' also helps the students of our West      African allies study at night with LED lamps.       The Republic of China used to be a country that received      economic assistance from other countries, particularly the      United States. Now that we are better off, the least we can      do is to help other people in need. So we look forward to      future cooperation with Feed the Children or other NGOs in      the United States for the good cause. Thank you!                          ____________________
