Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Juanita Millender-McDonald) for championing this effort this evening and so many of the other initiatives that she has taken as a sparkling Member of this House, certainly the cause of women in this case, in her role as co-Vice Chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus to bring us all to the floor this evening to talk about Social Security, Medicare, and women in America.  I also want to acknowledge the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Rosa DeLauro), the assistant Vice Chair of our caucus, and so many of the other women that have joined us this evening, our good friend the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Carrie Meek), the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Karen Thurman), the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Eva Clayton), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn Maloney), and it literally goes from coast to coast.  Without question, Social Security is the lifeboat for a majority of seniors in our country and certainly for women. And even with Social Security, the poorest people in America today are women over the age of 80. So even the current program, as critical as it is to families and to citizens across our Nation, could be made stronger.  Certainly for women, we know that in the way that the formulas were written in past years they do not always receive as much as men because, when they did work, their pay was less. Others this evening have talked about women spending more time out of the work force raising their children, caring for their families, often caring for sick relatives. Women often work in jobs that have no pensions.  I was amazed to go into a little cookie shop in an airport in Chicago a couple years ago and I approached someone who worked there and I said, ``How much do you pay?'' And they said, ``Minimum wage.'' And I said, ``What are my health benefits?'' They said, ``You would not get any of those or retirement. Only management gets that.'' I said, ``I guess I would not want to work here.''  But often one of the young women I was talking to did not know the answers to those questions. She had to go back and ask the manager back behind the swinging doors. So many women who are working do not ask the important question, ``What are my pension benefits?''  We know that most women who have lost their jobs as a result of ill-fated trade agreements, like NAFTA, lose their pensions as a result and, in fact, most of those who have lost their jobs under trade agreements like this, because they are minimum wage jobs and entry level jobs, are mainly minority women across this country.  We also know that most women do not begin saving for their retirement and they think it will not matter to create a savings account that would be a supplementary account to Social Security. And if they do have a little savings account or an investment account, they do not hold it long enough so that it would grow in a little bit of a larger nest egg. I want to say something about that this evening.                              {time}  2130  We also know that women who do manage to have a little bit of cash, if they have any at all, often do not look at other investments that they might make during their working years, for example, in buying a home.  Today, with interest rates the way they are, many, many people, if they check it out, this is not just women but people working across this country and paying rent, you would be surprised if you really looked at all the available programs, through your city, through your county, through your locality. You would find you could buy a home today cheaper probably than you could rent it. You ought to check that out. Because a home can become a very important source of equity. You own it. It does not belong to someone else.  It is very important this evening that all of us participate in this session to help educate the American people, and certainly women, about retirement planning. It is important if you are applying for a job to find out if that employer has a pension plan. Is it just Social Security? Or Social Security plus something else, like a 401(k) or an individual retirement account. If they do have a retirement account, what kind of plan is it? And are you, in fact, participating in that plan? Were you asked about it? Did you ask about it?  You really also, if you are married, need to know what your spouse's plan is. I cannot tell you how many women have come to me after the death of their husband and they say, ``He didn't check the little box.'' That means thatmy retirement pay from the company, putting Social Security aside for the moment, is less. And they, of course, do receive lower payments from Social Security on the death of a spouse.  So it is very important to know what your benefits are. You need to know which Social Security benefits you are entitled to. And the Social Security Administration will tell you that if you fill out the little card, they will be able to tell you how many quarters you have in, what your potential benefits might be, and you can get ready for that moment ahead of time. One of the biggest mistakes women make is not asking and not finding out soon enough.  Another issue women have to be concerned about, and the American Association of Retired Persons recommends these tips for women in addition to Social Security, think of your retirement security as a necessary expense, and no matter how small your check, take a few pennies or dollars out of that every month and put that in a pension program that is separate from Social Security, that can augment Social Security, which should be your base plan.  Think about setting up an Individual Retirement Account. Your banker, your credit union preferably, your employer can help you do this. But make sure that you control that money and that the employer does not control that money. Make sure you have a voice in that.  Also, figure out ways to try to control your spending. Create a budget with savings in mind, cut unnecessary expenses and pay credit card balances. If you can, think about resoling your shoes rather than buying new shoes or moving up or down the hem in your skirt rather than buying a new one. There are lots of ways to put a little bit of money aside for the future.  Really, it is a good idea to have a budget. Then you will come close to it or perhaps meet it, and you will begin to set up this little extra nest egg.  Whatever you do, invest with inflation in mind. When women tend to invest, they do so in very low-yielding assets. They find out that the income from those assets in later years really does not cover inflation and taxes.  So I think this evening is very important in helping women to think a little bit about planning for retirement. I know when I hold sessions in my own district on women and money, it is the most popular session that we have. Actually, more people attend that than the sessions we do on health. That is because women, though they have tremendous financial responsibilities in our schools, we do not always teach how to manage personal finances anymore. They used to have courses called home economics. Those are sort of outdated now, but we really need to have financial planning for all of our citizens, including women. I know every woman in this country has the ability to do that.  So I think my message tonight as a part of this excellent session that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) has organized along with the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) is that Social Security is your base plan, and those of us here will make sure that Social Security remains sound as a promise between generations. It is an insurance program, a program of promise to the Nation.  If there are seniors listening this evening, do not get high blood pressure, do not worry about Social Security. You do not have to contribute to any of those groups that make you pay money to say they will lobby for you here in Washington. We are your best lobbyists. Use us. You pay us through your tax dollars to do your work for you. Save those dollars that you are paying all those lobbying groups. Put it in an investment account for yourself to augment your Social Security.  The most important thing you can do to preserve Social Security and Medicare is to elect the right people to Congress. You know who they are, because they are right at home where you live. You do not have to come here to Washington to meet them.  Then if you have the ability, especially if you are younger or even if you are not that young, to set a little bit of extra money aside in a special savings account that earns interest, get a little bit of advice on that. Talk to some of your friends. Have some sessions where you live, in your neighborhood, in your church, in your senior retirement building. Start little clubs where you talk about investing money and take some of those bingo chips and take some of those little earnings that you have from bridge, even if it is a few dollars, and think about putting those dollars away and seeing what they will earn. Maybe you can do it as a group working with some of your credit union advisers, let us say, in your area.  It is important for you to learn about money. As you learn more, your children will learn, your grandchildren will learn, and the best teachers in America are our mothers and grandmothers. So they can do a lot to help those who are younger than they are to plan for their own retirements.  I really believe you can start saving at a very early age and you can start thinking about your future years, whether it is saving for education or saving for your retirement.  I want to compliment the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) for holding this special order this evening. She is doing a big favor to all the women and families of our country.
