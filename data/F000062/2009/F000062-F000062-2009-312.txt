 President, I rise to give some views on Guantanamo. I have had the privilege of serving with the distinguished Senator who has just concluded his remarks on the Intelligence Committee of the Senate. But I strongly disagree with him. I would like to have the opportunity to make the case.  First of all, Guantanamo is not sovereign territory of the United States. Under a 1903 lease, however, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over this naval base.  In December 2001, the administration decided to bring detainees captured overseas in connection with the war in Afghanistan and hold them there outside of our legal system. That was the point: To hold these detainees outside of the U.S. legal system.  This was revealed in a December 2001 Office of Legal Council memorandum by John Yoo of the Justice Department.  He wrote this:       Finally, the Executive Branch has repeatedly taken the      position under various statutes that [Guantanamo] is neither      part of the United States nor a possession or territory of      the United States. For example, this Office [Justice] has      opined that [Guantanamo] is not part of the ``United States''      for purposes of the Immigration and Naturalization Act . . .      Similarly, in 1929, the Attorney General opined that      [Guantanamo] was not a ``possession'' of the United States      within the meaning of certain tariff acts.
