Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments. As we all know, the Committee on Rules is the least representative committee in terms of distribution of numbers, and that was true when we were in charge, so I understand that. It is not a criticism. That is the way the Committee on Rules is run. It is an agent, if you will, of the majority. It is how the majority runs the House.  We are not deluded on our side, anymore than you were when you were in the minority, deluded to the fact that you would be able to make an impact in committee. So very frankly, taking under consideration seriously our request is interesting and we are appreciative that you will take it under consideration.  But more basically than that, the gentleman has sole authority to do it. You can do it any way you want. We understand that. But our expectation is that on a bill of this magnitude and importance, that we will be allowed not only to offer a substitute, but amendments.  I will tell the gentleman that we understand the strictures of the Republican budget and, by the way, our budget, both of which have close numbers, we had $528 billion and I think you had $5 billion in terms of a number of items in your budget. But the fact is, we understand those strictures. And if those are the only strictures which we are confronted with, we will work within those restraints.
