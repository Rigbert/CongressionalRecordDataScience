 They urge a no vote on cloture. They say this is not a vote for cloning but rather for reasoned debate that draws upon the wisdom of scientists and medical experts:       Senators should also take time to hear from patients and      their families who yearn for cures and treatments for life-     threatening diseases. A rush to legislate in this area could      have serious consequences for research that could benefit the      lives of millions of Americans.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Alliance for Aging Research,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein, The Alliance for Aging Research      strongly supports your efforts and those of Senator Kennedy      to legislate responsibly in the area of somatic cell nuclear      transfer technology. You and Senator Kennedy and others have      proposed a ban on human cloning without threatening vital      research efforts into cellular technologies that could      produce cures and valuable therapies for Alzheimers Disease,      Parkinsons, would healing, age-related blindness and many      other medical problems of the elderly. The not-for-profit      Alliance applauds your efforts on behalf of research, and we      urge you to vote ``no'' when a motion to cut off debate on S.      1601 comes to the Senate this week.       The Alliance for Aging Research strongly opposes the      cloning of a human being on moral grounds, as does every      responsible health advocacy organization we know. However,      the Lott-Bond-Frist bill is written so broadly as to halt      cellular technology that could be a significant tool in      developing therapies for scores of age-related diseases and      disabilities.       The Alliance is also concerned there has not been      sufficient discussion and debate to allow reasoned      consideration of this highly technical and complicated issue.      A ``no'' vote on cloture is not a vote for cloning, but      rather for a reasoned debate that draws upon the wisdom of      scientists and medical experts. Senators should also take      time to hear from patients and their families who yearn for      cures and treatments for life-threatening diseases. A rush to      legislate in this area could have serious consequences for      research that could benefit the lives of millions of      Americans.           Respectfully,                                                     Daniel Perry,                                               Executive Director.
