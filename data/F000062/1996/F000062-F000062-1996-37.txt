 President, today I introduce the Open Campus Police Logs Act of 1996.  Mr. President, every year around this time thousands of students leave home to begin their pursuit of a college degree. These students--and their parents--expect not only a quality education, but also a campus on which they can study and live in safety. Yet, statistics show that during a 4-year-period, one in four college students will become a victim of violent crime. And according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the number of crimes on college campuses are on the rise.  Under the Campus Security Act of 1990, colleges and universities are required to make crime statistics available to students, applicants and school employees. However, under-reporting of crime statistics by school administrators and the utilization of internal campus disciplinary systems, which are protected by privacy laws, have rendered the existing law ineffective.  All too often, we hear stories of college administrators who pressure victims to use discretion and to settle cases internally--without resort to the criminal justice system. Offenders then come before the campus tribunal, and are never publicly processed for the crimes. Sometimes, even the victims themselves cannot find out what happened in these internal trials.  And all too often, Mr. President, colleges and universities concerned about their image have been found to underreport crime and hide the true statistics from applicants and the media.  Students are unable to discover the true rate of campus crime, and are therefore unable to make informed decisions about where to go and how safe certain areas truly are.  The bill I am proposing today would extend the current law, in order to further inform students of the crimes occurring on college campuses so that they can better protect themselves.  This bill would continue to require that schools receiving Federal money compile statistics on crimes like murder and rape. However, it would also require schools to maintain a daily log--one that is open to public inspection--of all crimes committed against person or property.  These daily logs would chronicle not only the time, place and date of the crime, but also the names and addresses of all those arrested by the campus police or security force. No more could colleges hide statistics in annual reports and with secret, unreported disciplinary hearings. Every student or employee would have access, every day, to information about every arrest occurring on campus.  Some colleges and universities will argue that this bill is too burdensome. But this legislation should not be viewed by college administrators as an added burden for the campus security office, but rather as an effective tool to better inform the collegiate community. Students and employees have a right to know what dangers they face on campus. It is through this improved awareness that students and faculty will be able to better protect themselves. After all, one of the best weapons we have for deterring crime is accurate and timely information.  A New York Times reporter recently wrote about a woman who had been raped in February of last year--by a fellow student at her university in Ohio. Although the university's disciplinary board found the accused guilty of violating the student code regarding sexual assault, he was merely placed on student probation. He never went through a criminal trial.  As a result, the offending student was free to come and go on a campus where most women did not--and indeed could not--realize that he had committed any crime at all.  At this same school, Mr. President--where the student rapist was placed on probation--possession of a beer by an underage student can result in automatic suspension.  Furthermore, when the university published their official crime statistics later that fall, no rapes were reported. It is clear that compliance with reporting requirements could be far better.  Colleges and universities have made it their mission to provide a quality education in a suitable environment to America's students. By failing to disclose the true nature of crime on their campuses, administrations are not living up to this goal. We must make our campuses safer, by allowing students to better protect themselves from potential crime through the daily, public disclosure of past incidents and potential dangers.  Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact that today's students must take care to protect themselves from serious crime on our college campuses. Yes, protecting the privacy of accused students is important. But protecting the safety of potential victims is equally vital to providing an enriching and safe experience for each and every one of the many children who leave home each year in search of a future full of promise and prosperity.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2065       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Open Campus Police Logs Act      of 1996''.     SEC. 2. DAILY RECORD AND DISCLOSURE OF REPORTED CRIMES.       (a) Amendment.--Section 485(f) of the Higher Education Act      of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1092(f) is amended by adding at the end      the following new paragraph:       ``(8) Each institution participating in any program under      this title which maintains either a police or security      department of any kind shall make, keep, and maintain a daily      log, written in a form that can be easily understood,      recording in chronological order all crimes against persons      or property reported to its police or security department,      the date, time, and location of such crimes, and, if an      arrest has been made, the names and addresses of all persons      arrested and charges against such persons arrested. The      provision of this paragraph shall not be construed to require      an institution to identify in its log, unless otherwise      provided by law, the names of the persons reporting the      crime, the victim or victims, any witnesses or suspects who      have not been arrested, or other information relating to any      investigation of the crime. All entries in such daily logs      shall, unless otherwise provided by State or Federal law, be      open to public inspection.''.
