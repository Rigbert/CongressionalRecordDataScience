 President, 40 years ago this week, Christine Catucci set out to spend her summer as a tour guide at the Capitol. She still remembers her first day in the summer of 1976. It was a much different time back then, without the screening protocols and limitations on where visitors could go as we have today. Christine parked her car and walked straight up the main Rotunda steps, ready to work.  She didn't have intentions of staying past the summer, much less for four decades. But today, some 16 Sergeants at Arms and 7 Presidential administrations later, Christine is still a smiling, friendly face to those who enter, which is important because, as director of the Senate Appointment Desk, she is often the first person a visitor sees when visiting the Capitol.  As the years have gone by, Christine's responsibilities and admiration for the Senate have grown. She still considers it an honor and a privilege to help those visiting the Capitol, and that is true, she says, ``whether it is an official business visitor or a `starry-eyed' tourist.'' She says that she loves seeing the awe people have when they visit the Capitol and she is proud to be a part of that experience.  The joy this institution and this career have brought to Christine obviously made a pretty big impact on the love of her life, her daughter Nichole. Nichole works just one floor up from her mom, and in Christine's words, she is ``a constant reminder . . . that family comes first.''  Today, Christine's Senate family would like to congratulate her on this notable milestone. We thank her for her four decades of steadfast service, and we look forward to seeing the impact she will continue to make here in the Capitol.                            ____________________
