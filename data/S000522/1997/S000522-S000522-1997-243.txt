Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation in conjunction with my colleague, Mr. Sanders of Vermont, to end a wasteful corporate welfare policy which uses taxpayer money to subsidize defense contractor mergers. This legislation--the Payoffs for Layoffs Corporate Welfare Elimination Act of 1997--will put a stop to the practice of artifically stimulating layoffs with taxpayer funds.  As some of you know, under the guise of an obscure Clinton administration policy change made in July 1993-at the specific request of four CEO's representing America's top defense contractors--DOD began to allow defense contractors to begin charging the taxpayers for the merger-related costs of laying off workers and shutting down plants. The premise behind this policy is as dubious now as it was back then: that unless Uncle Sam dishes out big corporate subsidies, defense contractors would rather remain uncompetitive and risk going out of business than use their own money to pay for mergers and restructuring.  Already, 11 defense contractors have put in 17 requests totaling $817.3 million, and the meter is running. Lockheed Martin alone could eventually claim $1.2 billion in merger subsidies, according to statements by their CEO, Norman Augustine. When the Loral, McDonnel Douglas, Rockwell International, Texas Instruments, and Hughes merger subsidy requests come in, this total will skyrocket into the billions.  DOD claims that by paying more money on contracts now, DOD will realize savings due to lower overhead at some unspecified time in the future. This justification is really nothing more than an updated and more sophisticated version of the old cartoon character adage of ``I'll gladly pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today.''  The fact of the matter is that claims of savings are greatly exaggerated. Indeed, the very concept of savings assumes the contractor will put off or delay restructuring unless they are given subsidies. In December 1996, an investigation by CBS's 60 Minutes correctly pointed out that, ``Even without the subsidy, defense companies are required by law to pass savings back to the Government when they reduce their overhead.''  My legislation does not hinder or prevent mergers from happening. It simply states that mergers should happen on their own and without DOD prompting and use of our tax dollars. I concur with the Honorable Don Yockey, who was Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology during the Bush administration, when he stated ``the defense department would be better served if they simply did not discourage acquisition, but stayed at arms length in the encouragement of the business financial process. If the deal does not make sound stand alone business sense the company should not proceed. To rely on Government-subsidized support is the worst of reasons to merge.''  While we must always be concerned when government subsidies warps business decisions, equally disturbing is the fact that the so-called savings to be realized from restructuring have thus far been mostly illusory. Not a single weapon system can be truly identified as having a lower cost due primarily to corporate restructuring. The fact of the matter is that DOD's very own report on restructuring stated: ``it is not feasible to isolate completely the effect of restructuring from other complex determinants of the difference between projected and actual costs over a long period of time.'' In plain English, DOD essentially admits that savings cannot be attributed to restructuring.  What we really have here is a policy with unknowable assumptions and unverifiable effects. GAO found that in just one case, contractor estimates of savings fell 85 percent short of initial claims. And that is just the estimates--there is no way of knowing if there will ever be real savings. GAO also has stated on more than one occasion that contractors have been projecting future increases--not decreases--in overhead rates.  While savings cannot be attributed directly to these subsidies, additional layoffs have unquestionably resulted from the policy. In the first merger analyzed by GAO, it found that ``the contractor's proposed savings were based entirely on work force reductions.''  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues--on all sides of the aisle--to join with me to put a stop to this payoffs for layoffs policy. Not only is this policy not really saving any money, it actually increases the deficit because DOD is spending hundreds of millions of our tax dollars chasing after savings to which it is entitled to receive anyway. This type of corporate welfare is unconscionable and Members with defense contractors in their districts should be especially wary of it. In my district alone, over 3,200 jobs will be lost because of this policy. If you have a plant in your district, you should not have to worry about your own tax dollars being used to encourage it to shut down.                          ____________________
