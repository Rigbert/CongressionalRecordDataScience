President, if the Senator would yield briefly for a question, 21 years ago, I went up to Prince William Sound to see the Exxon Valdez spill. I say to the Senator, I know he knows, as a native of Alaska, firsthand how terrible these spills can be, the impact they can have in the short and long term. But I commend the Senator for his statement because we can do more than one thing if we are working together. If we are divided and at war politically, we do not accomplish much.  What the President wants us to do is deal with the gulf oilspill but also not ignore the need for a national energy policy that is going to make us stronger, create more jobs, and make us less dependent on foreign oil.  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his comments.
