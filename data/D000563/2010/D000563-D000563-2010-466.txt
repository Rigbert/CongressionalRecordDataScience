President, I rise today to honor my dear friend Marca Bristo and recognize her work as a disability rights activist and the community-based disability agency, Access Living, that she founded 30 years ago in my home State of Illinois.  Access Living opened its doors in 1980 to ensure that people with disabilities had equal rights.  Three decades ago, people with disabilities faced a world of dependency. Even though Congress had enacted important legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prevent discrimination and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 to expand learning opportunities for those with disabilities, people with disabilities still lacked equal rights. Social prejudice fueled discrimination against people with disabilities in housing, employment and basic public accommodations. The concepts of independent living, wheelchair accessible public transportation and quality jobs were not yet part of everyday life.  Access Living was founded to insist on independent living options and higher quality of life for people with disabilities. The agency is governed and staffed by people with disabilities and operates under a fundamental belief that people with disabilities must become a political force if they are to effect social change. Marca Bristo, Access Living's president and CEO, knows that pride and commitment to social change is the most effective way to ensure that civil rights are enforced.  This passion stems from a personal experience. A diving accident at the Pratt Boulevard Beach pier left Marca partially paralyzed in 1977. Through this tragedy, she re-imagined her capabilities to work and thrive from a wheelchair. However, the adjustment was not always easy, because cultural and even physical barriers stood in her way.  Early in Marca's disability, the city of Chicago lacked curb cuts on public streets, which made it hard for her to travel up and down city blocks in her wheelchair. This restriction prevented Marca from accomplishing basic errands such as a trip to the grocery store or a pick-up from the dry cleaners and from using public transportation to commute to work.  Marca and Access Living's vision of equality led to architectural and attitudinal changes in the city of Chicago and throughout the country. Years of litigation led the Chicago Transit Authority to add wheelchair lifts to their mainline buses. The city has also incorporated scrolling marquees, audible street announcements and thousands of curb cuts to make transportation feasible for people with disabilities.  Beyond these physical changes, Marca has also worked tirelessly to break down cultural barriers and integrate people with disabilities into community life. Access Living's work fosters dignity, pride, and self-esteem in people with disabilities. With that in place, they can choose individualized, satisfying lives.  It turns out, I am not the only person who has been impressed by Marca's leadership and vision for change. She was appointed by President Clinton to chair the Nation Council on Disability. She was here, fully engaged in the fight, when Congress wrote the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. She has also served as president of the National Council on Independent Living and is currently president of the U.S. International Council on Disabilities--USICD.  But the ADA means only as much as its implementation. We have work to do eliminating discrimination in employment, public services and public accommodations in the United States. As the ADA turns 20 in this month, we recognize the law's and Access Living's work to increase the visibility of people with disabilities in our country.  We as a Nation should also look to be global leaders in this arena. Through her work with USICD, I am confident that Marca will continue to focus the energy, expertise and resources of the U.S. Government and disability community to improve the lives of people with disabilities worldwide.  Fair and equal treatment is a cornerstone of our society and political system. Access Living and Marca Bristo's dedication to ending discrimination against people with disabilities have improved the lives of families in Chicago and nationwide.                          ____________________
