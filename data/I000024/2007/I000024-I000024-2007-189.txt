President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado and I have each had 5 minutes on my amendment. I have not had 5 minutes in rebuttal of the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. Let me tell you what is going on. I know a lot people in this Chamber are going to think no one is going to figure this out. I am going to say it over and over again after this is over if the outcome is as I anticipate it will be.  First, this is probably the first time in 20 years we have had an honest effort where we can make English our national language in the United States of America. This is something all the polling data shows is in the nineties--91 percent, 93 percent of the people in America who want to have this amendment adopted.  In fact, a Zogby poll last month in May showed 76 percent of the Hispanics in America want to have English as the national language.  The Salazar amendment is precisely what the underlying bill is. The underlying bill--and I can read it to my colleagues, but I have done it three times on the floor already--yes, it does put into law the controversial Executive Order 13166. My colleagues have heard a lot about this from their constituents.  It says you are entitled to have your information, if you receive Government money, in any language of your choosing--Swahili or any other language. That is what is in the underlying bill. That also is in the Salazar amendment.  This is what is going to be happening. My colleagues have a chance to change all of this when they vote on the Inhofe amendment, which is I believe the third amendment in line tonight. What I don't want my colleagues to do is vote for my amendment and then vote for the Salazar amendment. All that does is put it right back where the bill is now. In other words, it would do away with my amendment and put it back as the language is in the underlying bill.  So there is no reason in the world to do it, unless someone is trying to cover up their true position. If my colleagues believe we should join the other 50 countries, such as Kenya, Ghana, and other countries around the world, that have English as their official language, then this is a chance to do it. If my colleagues do not believe it, then this is their chance to vote against the Inhofe amendment.  It is an act of hypocrisy if colleagues vote for the Inhofe amendment and then vote for the Salazar amendment to undo the Inhofe amendment. That happened a year ago. Democrats and Republicans did that. However, this time it will not go unnoticed.  It is interesting that every President back to and including Teddy Roosevelt in 1916 said very emphatically that we should have English as our official language, as our national language. It was said by President Clinton, it was said by the other President Roosevelt, by both President Bushes, and everyone has been for it.  I have a listing I wish to make part of the Record that shows all of the polling data in the last 5 years. It shows that between 85 and 95 percent of the American people want this amendment adopted. My colleagues can turn their backs on them or they can try the old trick they do around here all the time: Vote for the Inhofe amendment, and then turn around to vote to undo it if they want.  One thing that was stated by the Senator from Colorado was there are a lot of statutes this would negate. I remind my colleagues, if they read this bill, it says: Unless specifically provided by statute, no person has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, perform, or provide services or provide materials in any language other than English.  I have a list I also want to be made part of the Record that shows there are many statutes where they mandate languages other than English. A good example is the Court Interpreters Act. That is put in there to protect the sixth amendment to the Constitution, so people can be advised of their rights.  Again, my colleagues are going to have the opportunity to vote to make English our national language. I hope they will adopt this. They will certainly be serving their constituents well if they do. But if they do, they shouldn't turn around and undo what they just did because that is not going to go unnoticed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the polling information and the list of selected Federal laws requiring the use of languages other than English be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    National English Amendment Polls       Polls: All types of pollsters of all groups, liberal and      conservative, immigrant and nonimmigrant, with all wordings      show consistently high levels of support for making English      the official language of the United States:       1. A Zogby Poll conducted on May 17-20, 2007 showed that 83      percent of Americans favor official English legislation,      including 76 percent of Hispanics. 94 percent of Republicans,      72 percent of Democrats, and 83 percent of Independents are      favorable to official English legislation.       2.

Latino immigrants support the concept of Official English:       1.

A March 2006 Zogby poll found that 84 percent, of      Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics, believe English      should be the official language of government operations.       3. My favorite poll is this one: In 2004 the National      Council of LaRaza found that 97 percent strongly (86.4      percent or somewhat (10.9 percent) agreed that ``The ability      to speak English is important to succeed in this country.''
