 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record these statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am inserting their statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues. Statement By Isaac Evans-Frantz and Alina Lyon Regarding Gay-Straight                                  Issues       Isaac Evans-Frantz: Growing up gay, lesbian or bisexual can      be very difficult in the society that we live in. Many gay      teenagers are subjected to homophobia every day of their      lives. 93 percent of Vermont educators reported that      homophobic name-calling takes place with great frequency and      intensity in their schools. We can assure you that these      educators are absolutely correct.       Gays are frequently harassed at school, and many drop out      as a result. Those kids who hide their sexual orientations      because of fear sometimes suffer just as much. It is not      surprising that suicide is the leading cause of death among      gay youth. An overwhelming percent of gay and lesbian youth      experience severe social isolation. It is often difficult for      these students to find the resources and support that they      need within their schools.       The silence about homosexuality not only affects gays, but      affects our entire society. We are caught in a cycle of fear      and hatred, which comes from ignorance. It is obvious that      the bigoted remarks about gays that are so prevalent in our      hallways are the result of an education we have not had.       Aliana Lyon: Prism, Brattleboro's Gay-Straight Alliance,      was started two years ago as the answer to an urgent need of      support for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth. The Gay-Straight      Alliance is open to all who wish to attend, and sexual      orientation is not discussed unless initiated by the      students. The Alliance plays two major roles--it acts as a      support group and an activist group.       Our group is composed of about twenty students and is      supported by trusted faculties and community members. Prism      is a comfortable atmosphere of caring people where issues of      harassment, sexuality, homophobia and personal fears are      freely discussed. When we are not sharing stories or      concerns, we are planning our next project to make people      aware of homophobia in our school or society.       We started working within our school first. We led      discussions on homophobia in the freshman health classes,      trying to create an awareness of our group's existence and      the social issue. To involve the community, we showed an      educational video called `It's Elementary.'' It discusses      homosexuality with elementary school children, asking them      what they think the definition of gay, lesbian or bisexuality      means. It is followed by a sharing of experiences, ideas and      information.       We have visited other gay straight alliances in Vermont and      Massachusetts to inform each other of events happening, along      with difficulties and successes of having an alliance in      public schools. Statewide, Prism has visited the Vermont      State House twice for Teen Day at the legislature. The second      visit, we facilitated a workshop in how to start an alliance,      and how to find the support needed to sustain an alliance. We      are not funded by the school for any of these activities, and      we have paid for our own expenses by grants and donations.       Isaac Evans-Frantz. There are still many schools that      provide little assistance for gay, lesbian and bisexual      students. We feel that this support is important to their      social and academic well-being. We would like to see our      governments--local, state, and national--provide financial      backing for schools to initiate gay-straight alliances.       Massachusetts has done just that. In 1992, the Governor and      Lt. Governor established a commission to research problems      affecting gay and lesbian youth. As a result, the      Massachusetts government offered monetary incentives for      schools to start groups for gay and lesbian and straight      students. Hopefully, the work of Massachusetts will serve as      a model for Vermont and the country.       Our state has made progress towards making schools safer      for gay students. In March, our Governor and Commissioner of      Education wrote a letter to Vermont school principals urging      them to stop the harassment of gay and lesbian students. He      reminded schools that Vermont law requires every school to      maintain a policy prohibiting the harassment, including      harassment of homosexuals.       We hope that one day, gay and straight alliances will no      longer be necessary. Until then, we ask that our schools, our      state, and our nation take an active role in making our      schools places where all students are safe, valued, and      respected.       Congressman Sanders: A very good job.                                  ____      Statement by Scott Radimer Regarding the E.U. and Free Trade       Scott Radimer: Good afternoon, for those of you that are      left.       I would like to take this chance today to talk about      something that I found most people don't know about, which is      the European Union, 15 countries in Europe, including      England, Germany, Italy and France, along with others who are      joining together--this has been in the works for the last 40      years, I think, moving towards one market, one currency, and      becoming one economic power.       As this has gone along, it has become one of the biggest      markets in the world. The gross domestic product of the      European Union in 1992 was higher than that of the United      States or Japan. The reason that this is important, it is not      affecting us right now, but it will be affecting us in years      to come, when I am in the work force, when the rest of us      are, is that we are going to have to compete with Europe.      Many people talk about Japan and trying to compete with      Japan, and this is going to be even bigger.       There are a few things that we can do. We could try and      expand things, such as NAFTA, whereas Europe is moving more      together, and North America could try and do similar things.      We could also try and work just within the United States, or      just Canada, or the rest of the parts of the world. The      important things is not necessarily that we find a solution      right now, but that we are at least aware that this exists      and it is something we are going to have to deal with. It is      better to start looking at these things now, before we have a      huge trade deficit with a country now, instead of later.       Thank you.       Congressman Sanders: Scott, thanks very much.                                  ____          Statement by Daniel Nelson Regarding Troubled Teens       Daniel Nelson: Thank you, Mr. Sanders, fellow youth. I      apologize, I have a little bit of a cold I'm getting over.       An issue that has been big on my mind is a lot of young      people that are placed under state's custody. Young people      that aren't necessarily troublemakers are getting into      trouble and have troubles at home. I was one of those young      people. I am still young, but not in that position anymore. I      was placed in a group home, not in a foster home, but there      are problems with both.       A lot of the times, young people are taken out of a home      environment that might not necessarily be good. They can      escape from physical abuse, but they don't escape mental      abuse. There are a lot of restrictions put on these young      people, when, really, they don't need restrictions; they need      to be encouraged, shown that they can succeed, and that they      do have potential. That is the last thing these young people      get in group homes and a lot of foster homes.       I am not a person that likes to whine about things; I like      to do things and make changes. This is something I don't know      how to change myself, at least at this point in my life.      After college, I hope to try and do that. But my suggestion      would be if there is some way that these group homes and      foster homes could be evaluated more effectively. These      people that are condescending, say mean, hurtful things, and      impose restrictions that are really not necessary, that they      be removed from these environments. They are damaging young      people that could be very effective in society, and I think      would like to, if given the opportunity.       And that is about all I have to say.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you.
