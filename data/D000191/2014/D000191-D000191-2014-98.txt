Well, they didn't have the money. They said: sorry, guys, can't build it.  This is Emil Schweitzer's farm field. For 3 years, people crashed through the barrier at the end here and went into his field, until Dwight David Eisenhower, a Republican, passed the national highway transportation bill with a trust fund.  That would be undone by Paul Ryan. He says States can opt out. They don't even have to collect the 18.4 cents Federal tax; they can do whatever they want with that money.  Madam Speaker, counties are actually ripping up paved roads and turning them back to gravel because they can't afford them. There are 140,000 bridges that need repair or replacement. Forty percent of the national highway system has pavement that has totally failed.  There is a $70 billion backlog on our transit systems. These are millions of jobs foregone--productivity foregone, and if you are so darn proud, as I heard on that side, why aren't you proud of the future of America, putting people back to work and competing with the rest of the world with a world class, 21st century transportation system? You're going to kill it.
