 President, I rise to introduce legislation on a subject that we will be spending a great deal of time talking about on the floor this week--youth violence. At the outset, I would like to make clear that this bill is not a comprehensive one that addresses every aspect of this complex area. Other of my colleagues already have introduced legislation broadly addressing these issues with many good ideas that I support.  My bill today recognizes the need to get tough on juvenile crime and violence. But this bill goes farther. It also recognizes that the best thing the Federal Government can do in dealing with youth crime and violence is to focus on prevention. In other words, it ensures that what we do about juvenile crime and youth violence is a balanced approach. My colleagues and I have heard over and over again from law enforcement, prosecutors, and juvenile judges alike that the best way to deal on the front lines with juveniles who are committing or are at risk of committing crimes is to implement prevention as well as sanctions.  What the Federal Government does best in the area of fighting crime--and the significant drop in crime as a result of the 1994 crime bill is proof of this--is for it to provide local law enforcement, prosecutors, juvenile courts, schools, and community-based organizations funds for them to develop creative, comprehensive strategies on juvenile crime that are tailored for their community. It is important to hold kids accountable when they commit crimes. But it is equally--if not more--important to keep kids out of trouble, to keep kids out of the juvenile justice system in the first place.  Before I get to the specifics of what my bill does, I want to highlight the importance of early prevention in curbing youth violence.  To put the youth violence problem in some context, I would like to begin by outlining the specific--and different--challenges we are facing when we discuss ``youth violence.'' Distinguishing among these different problems is important because each demands a different response.  To be specific--we are really facing three separate issues when we confront youth violence:  First, we have some number of children who are tragic cases--so violent that we really have no choice but to get them behind bars and keep them there, for a long time.  Second, we have kids who have already started down the crime path. They aren't committing violent crimes, but they are clearly getting into trouble. And, while the evidence is that most will never go on to commit violent crimes, it is clear that we have to reach these kids and turn them around.  Unlike the first category where public safety requires very severe, very long sentences, the key strategy for turning this second category of kids around appears to be certain, graduated punishments, as well as anything we can do which lessen the factors which may be pushing them deeper into the crime stream--keeping them away from drugs, away from guns and out of gangs.  Third, we have a category of children in what the demographers call the ``baby-boomerang.'' In a report I offered in December of 1995, I detailed what inevitably lies ahead--39 million children now younger than age 10. Each of these 39 million children--the children of the baby-boomers--stand on the edge of their teen years, exactly those years when they are most at-risk of turning to drugs and crime.  The implications of this demographic inevitability--even if we do everything right, and the rate at which kids commit crimes does not rise at all, we will have a 20% increase in juvenile murders by 2005, which will mean an increase in the overall murder toll of about 5%.  Clearly, most of these 39 million will never turn to drugs and crime. But, equally clear, we have a rising number of at-risk children--at-risk of turning to drugs, at-risk of being the victim of violence, and at-risk of turning to crime.  For this third category--the rising number of at-risk children--I believe we have to incorporate prevention as a key part of our strategy to combat youth crime and violence.  These three categories--lost, violent kids; kids just falling into the crime stream; and at-risk kids who may be nearing the edge of the crime stream--outline the targets of, and basic strategies for, a successful effort against youth violence.  As we begin to debate strategies for addressing youth violence, let's get at least some idea of the size, the magnitude, of each of these three segments of the youth violence question.  Starting in reverse order--with the third category of at-risk kids. Of course, all 39 million children in the ``baby-boomerang'' will not fall into this at-risk category. But, equally clear, that number of at-risk children will be at least a few million.  For the other two categories, the facts are that there are relatively few children in the ``lost'' category and while a significant number are in the ``falling into the crime stream'' category--both categories are much smaller than the few million in the ``at-risk'' category.  The facts for the youngest juveniles: In 1994, 379 juveniles younger than 15 years old were arrested for murder, 39,000 were arrested for a violent crime but more than 260,000 were arrested for a non-violent property crime.  For older teens, the pattern holds: 2,700 juveniles aged 15 to 17 were arrested for murder, 86,000 were arrested for a violent crime, but more than 350,000 were arrested for a non-violent property crime.  In sum: About 3,000 kids were arrested for murder--clearly ``lost'' children;  Another 115,000 kids were arrested for a violent crime--all are not irretrievable, but plainly all must be subject to serious punishment;  About 600,000 kids were arrested for a non-violent property crime--not lost to us yet, but clearly falling deeper into the crime stream; and  At least a few million children are in the at-risk category.  It is my hope that throughout the debate on youth violence that we will not lose sight of these fundamental facts about what we are talking about when we say ``Let's do something about youth violence.'' I believe that is the goal we all share, so let's be smart. Let's keep our eye on the ball.  In short, just as it would be foolish to spend all our efforts and money on the millions of at-risk kids and do nothing about the lost, violent kids--it would be equally foolish to spend all our efforts and money on the lost, violent kids and ignore the millions of at-risk kids.  Local officials throughout the country have looked at the facts, they have been smart, they have used their resources from the 1994 crime law--and guess what: adult violent crime has plummeted. We now have the lowest murder rate since 1971. That says one thing--if we are smart, we can make a difference on a problem everyone thought was unsolvable: violent crime. We ought to be able to do the same when that violent crime is committed by children.  We even have real world, working models of how to do so. Look to the experience in Boston--an experience that the judiciary committee recently heard about again in a hearing on juveniles and guns. In Boston, a combination of tough enforcement, cracking down on illegal gun dealers, focusing the forces of police, prosecutors and probation officers, and comprehensive community-based prevention efforts have slashed youth violence.  I have outlined the three basis elements of the youth violence problem. So let me turn to the specifics of what I believe we must do to address each of these three basic elements.  Tough punishment of the first group of kids--the ``Almost lost, already violent kids''--is necessary--for public safety purposes we really must look first to incapacitate very violent criminals, just getting them off the streets.  For the second group of kids--the ``just getting into trouble kids''--we must provide certain, graduated sanctions--so that instead of our current system of not punishing a kid until he has 10, 15 or 20 arrests, we give the kid at least some sanction from the very first offense.  And finally, for the third group--the ``baby bomberang kids''--who are not getting in trouble yet but are ``at-risk'', we must target the factors which push kids into--or deeper into--the crime stream:  Getting kids off drugs and alcohol through drug testing and follow-up with supervision and treatment;  Keeping kids out of gangs; and  Cracking down on the flow of guns to kids.  We must also keep as many at-risks kids as possible from turning to drugs and crime in the first place--in most practical terms, this means keeping kids busy and supervised during the 3:00 to dinnertime hours.  Those 3 hours represent about 12% of the day, about 20% of the hours when kids are awake--but at least 40% of juvenile crime occurs during those hours.  Here is what the bill I am introducing today would do:  It creates a block grant for use by States and local governments to develop strategies that are aimed at all three of the categories of kids I just described. That block grant does the following:  First, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop more effective ways to investigate, prosecute, and punish those kids in the first group I described, who are already committing violent crimes.  Second, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop more effective ways to ensure accountability through graduated sanctions and other means, and to address risk factors such as drug and alcohol abuse, truancy, or involvement with gangs.  And third, it gives resources to States and local governments to develop programs targeted for at-risk kids for prevention--to keep these kids out of trouble, out of the juvenile crime system, and diverted from going down the path to becoming a career criminal.  To do these three things, my bill authorizes $450 million. Of that amount--  25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prevention and drug and alcohol treatment.  25 percent--$112.5 million--must be spent on prosecutors and courts.  The rest--$250 million--can be spent on a variety of uses, including graduated sanctions and prisons.  My bill also separately authorizes $50 million to hire, train, and fund programs run by prosecutors. We have heard over and over again that prosecutors, who are on the front lines in dealing with juvenile offenders, across the country are developing innovative, comprehensive approaches to juvenile crime that are resulting in significant drops in the juvenile crime rate.  For example, in Jacksonville, Florida, the state prosecutor there has developed a multi-tiered approach. Those programs provide schooling and counseling, they intervene with first time juvenile offenders to divert them from the system, they provide prevention programs for at-risk kids that include mentoring and talking to judges and kids already in jail, and they fight truancy.  It contains a ban on gun ownership by persons who, before their 18th birthday, adults who have been adjudicated to have committed a serious drug offense or violent felony. This provision, popularly known as ``Juvenile Brady'', is an important step towards keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. Violent juveniles who commit serious crimes should be stopped--early--from getting access to weapons to commit such crimes as adults.  Extending the Violent Crime Trust Fund to 2002. The Violent Crime Trust Fund--created in the 1994 crime bill--has been the key to our successful fight against crime over the past few years. It has been the vehicle for providing billions of dollars to State and local governments to implement a variety of law enforcement and crime-fighting--from the Cops Program to the Violence Against Women Act to youth violence initiatives. The Violent Crime Trust Fund is due to expire in fiscal year 2000--my bill extends it to 2002. Without the trust fund, we will fail in the future to replicate and to surpass our past successes in combating crime, including juvenile crime, in the future.  We must renew our efforts to save our Nation, our communities and our children from crime and violence. We must begin by ensuring that our children are safe--safe from both the temptation of crime and safe from those who commit crime and horrific acts of violence.  We must protect our children through meaningful prevention and intervention programs, a crackdown on drugs and the violence that accompanies them, and we must insure that meaningful, appropriate and swift punishment is imposed on all juvenile offenders. I believe that the bill I introduce today, while not a comprehensive answer to every part of the juvenile crime problem, will go far in addressing one of its key components--prevention.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 993       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
