 President, I am the one who was reluctant to enter into a time agreement and/or a formal agreement on the motion to recommit. It is fully within the right of the Senator from Mississippi to do that. The reason I did not wish to do that is that it sets a precedent. As long as I have been here, I do not recall us moving to recommit a judicial nominee unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee.  The second point that I make to my friend is that I have no intention of doing anything to delay the vote on this motion to recommit.  I would like at the appropriate moment to explain why I believe Justice Dennis is qualified and should be confirmed and why there is no need to recommit. My colleagues from Louisiana, who have a genuine interest in this nomination, are both here, and I would look to them to speak to the qualifications of Justice Dennis and why a recommittal motion would be in effect a very bad precedent.  I wish to make it clear to my friend from Mississippi that the Senator from Delaware does not have any other agenda. I do not have any intention of slowing up a vote on this. This is a slightly different procedure from the general tradition of the Senate that when a nominee comes up from a committee the Senate debates and votes on the nominee. However, I will not object to this motion to recommit Justice Dennis because it seems to me a version of what the North in the War Between the States had hoped for for many years, that is, that two States in the heart of Dixie would fight over an issue that the rest of us think is not worthy of a fight.
