 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who is one of the finest legal scholars of his generation. Danny J. Boggs, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, has served on the bench for 20 years, and over the course of his stellar career he has made many friends and impressed all who know him--this Senator included.  Judge Boggs is renowned for having an engaging, active mind, with which he tackles not only the law but a host of other subjects. Well-read in history, geography, literature, mathematics, and political science, he is a true Renaissance man. And not only does he voraciously ingest knowledge, he loves to share it with others.  Ask any clerk or former clerk of Judge Boggs, and he or she will tell you: They are liable to be asked a question any time, on anything. One of his former clerks, who now works in my Washington office, recalls a time when Judge Boggs called in to the office while on a business trip to find out the population of Montana not the present-day State but the Montana territory.  Judge Boggs delights in hiring clerks of any and all political persuasions, as long as they have a keen mind and are always ready for debate. Of course, these poor clerks know that Judge Boggs will almost always win. But his interest is not winning or losing. It is in ensuring that the final product--the legal brief--is as rigorous as it can be.  Judge Boggs is infamous for giving a trivia quiz to his clerkship applicants although perhaps ``trivia'' is not the right word for it. He prefers the term ``general knowledge'' test. But I don't think there is anything general about the scope of Judge Boggs's knowledge. Just listen to one question from a recent test of his: ``If the moon were made of green cheese, and if green cheese floats in water, what is the most that the moon could weigh (within a factor of 10)?''  Believe it or not, most of Judge Boggs's clerks actually enjoy running this intellectual gauntlet--so much so that three of them appeared as contestants on the popular television game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Two of them picked Judge Boggs to be their ``phone a friend'' lifeline a superior mind to turn to for a particularly difficult question. Judge Boggs himself has tried to be a contestant on the show, so far without success, but I suspect his true calling may be to work for the show and write the questions.  Born in Havana, Cuba, Judge Boggs grew up in Bowling Green, KY, and earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1965. He earned his law degree in 1968 at the University of Chicago while being elected to Order of the Coif. After graduating, Judge Boggs taught at the University of Chicago Law School the following academic year--quite an accomplishment for a newly minted lawyer.  Judge Boggs answered the call of public service in several capacities before he attained his current post. After a few positions in Kentucky State government, he ventured to Washington, where he served as Assistant to the Solicitor General, Assistant to the Chairman of the Federal Power Commission, and Deputy Minority Counsel for the Senate Energy Committee. Judge Boggs also worked in private practice, in the White House as a Special Assistant to the President, and from 1983 to 1986 as Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy.  President Ronald Reagan appointed Judge Boggs to his current position in 1986, and on October 1, 2003, Judge Boggs became the Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit. Many times, his opinions have been upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, both when he is written in the majority and in dissent.  He has taught American jurisprudence in the Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Russia. Chief Justice of the United States William H. Rehnquist appointed Judge Boggs to several important postsin the Judicial Conference of the United States, and Judge Boggs also served as chair of the Appellate Judges Conference of the American Bar Association from 2001 to 2002.  Judge Boggs entire career has been marked by energy, accomplishment, and scholarly brilliance. His fertile, polymath's mind has unlocked a love of learning in countless others. And his 20 years of distinguished service on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has inspired us all. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Judge Danny J. Boggs for his 20 years on the bench and for his continued service to the law and his country.                          ____________________[Pages S5112-S5113]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE DANNY J.
