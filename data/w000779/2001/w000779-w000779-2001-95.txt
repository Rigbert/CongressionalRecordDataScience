President, today Senator Craig and I are introducing legislation that uses a simple, scientifically sound and entirely voluntary approach to combat global warming. It's not revolutionary, and it's not regulatory. We believe growing more trees, bigger trees and healthier trees is one of the most effective ways to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect the earth's climate. The Forest Resources for the environment and the Economy Act of 2001 will expand the nation's forested lands and put our forests on the frontlines in the battle against global warming.  Investing in healthy forests today is an investment in the well-being of our planet for decades to come. In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more than critical environmental resources--they are also a cornerstone of our economy. In debates about forest policies, there are those who have advocated an exclusively environmental pathway, and others who have stressed an exclusively economic pathway. This bill is part of what I believe is a third pathway through the woods, a path to both stronger rural economies and healthier forests.  I introduced this bill with Senator Craig in the 106th Congress. Though there have been numerous changes to the bill to address specific concerns, the underlying functions of the bill remain the same: this bill will reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and help protect our global climate for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. It will provide improved wildlife and fish habitats and protect our waterways. It will enhance our national forests by reducing water pollution within their watersheds. It will provide jobs in the forestry sector in areas that have been hard hit by declining timber harvests. And it will grow additional timber resources on underproductive private lands.  The legislation does all of this through entirely voluntary, incentive-based approach. The bill makes new resources available to private landowners through state-operated revolving loan programs that provide assistance for tree planting and other forest management actions. I know that this approach works because of the leadership of my home state, Oregon. The loanprogram is modeled after the innovative Forest Resource Trust, which was established in Oregon in 1993, and is just one of the many ways Oregon continues to lead the nation in state actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am introducing this bill to make sure that we take advantage of these opportunities across the country and encourage more businesses to invest in the nation's forests.  The bill is based on recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences to overcome the capital constraints that prevent non-industrial, private forest land owners from growing healthy forests. Almost 10 million landowners in the United States own 42 percent of the non-industrial, private forest land in parcels of less than 100 acres. Access to the low-interest loans provided by this bill can empower these landowners to improve their lands while providing global environmental protection.  In addition to establishing the state revolving loan programs, the bill makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to strengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas reductions from forestry activities. The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective methods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas reductions. These guidelines will be developed with the input of a new Advisory Council representing industry, foresters, states, and environment groups.  As I said above, numerous changes have been made to the bill since its introduction in the 106th Congress. By a process of intellectual give and take between various Congressional offices, stakeholder groups and environmental organizations, this bill has been improved to offer greater environmental protection opportunities and better science. The bill now requires that all funded projects have ``a positive impact on watersheds, fish habitats, and wildlife diversity.'' It promotes reforestion activities for species that are native to a region. Also, the bill now allows flexibility in the loan repayment requirements that encourage the longer rotation, and permanent protection, of lands reforested under this program. In addition, the new Advisory Council will have three independent scientists instead of one and the members must have an expertise in forest management; carbon storage reporting will include monitoring requirements to assure the net increase of carbon storage; and the bill allows for the incorporation of the latest scientific and observational information. Overall, this bill is a solid step forward in the long journey towards addressing global climate change.  As in the last Congress, this bill will pay for itself by taking the money that polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and use it to expand our forests, protect streams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. In fiscal year 1998, $45 million of these environmental penalties were assessed against polluters. There are currently no guarantees that these penalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve our environment. This bill would make this money available as loans to small and medium landowners to cover the upfront costs of tree planting and other activities that aid in the growth of healthy, productive forests and provide better wildlife habitats.  We cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our global climate. The total amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere depends, in part, on the efficiency of forests and other natural ``sinks'' that absorb carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--from the atmosphere. The implications are as simple as they are scientifically sound--if we grow more trees, bigger trees, and healthier trees, we will remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect the global climate. According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United States are only storing one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately store. Just tapping a portion of this potential by expanding and increasing the productivity of the nation's 737 million acres of forests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow global warming. This bill takes an important first step toward sequestering greenhouse gases on Federal lands: it directs the Forest Service to report to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in our national forests.  It is hard to believe that nine years ago, during the first Bush Administration, both Democrat and Republican Senators proclaimed their support for taking action to protect the climate system and reducing the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the Senate, Senators from both parties came to the floor to applaud this commitment to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And then-President Bush supported that position as well. We cannot afford to let the current debates about international treaties paralyze this Congress when their are opportunities here at home to protect our environment in ways that also provide jobs and economic growth.  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. It's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable forestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for rural communities. For these reasons, the bill has already received positive reactions from timber companies and environmental organizations alike, including the National Association of State Foresters and the Society of American Foresters, American Forest and Paper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense Fund, Governor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, PacificCorp, The Nature Conservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust.  I look forward to pursuing this common-sense step toward protecting the environment and supporting our forest workers. This bill will have a sequential referral to both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee. These Committees share jurisdiction over all our nations forests, public and private. They represent the interests of the people who use our forests from the National Forest visitor, to the large industrial land owner, to the small woodlot owner. Through the combined efforts of both of these Committees, I am sure that the bill will receive a thorough hearing. I look forward to starting this process with a hearing in early May in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-section analysis of the Forest Resources for the Environment and the Economy Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 820       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The bill      achieves these purposes through three major actions: (1)      Guidelines for Accurate Carbon Accounting for Forests.--The      bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Forest      Service, to establish scientifically-based guidelines for      accurate reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon      storage from forest management actions. The bill establishes      a multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council to      assist USDA in developing the guidelines.       (2) Report on Options to Increase Carbon Storage on Federal      Lands--The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, through      the Forest Service, to report to Congress on forestry options      to increase carbon storage in the National Forest System.       (3) State Revolving Loan Programs/Cooperative Agreements--     The bill provides assistance to plant and manage      underproducing or understocked forests to increase carbon      sequestration. Assistance is provided through Cooperative      Agreements with State or local governments, American Indian      Tribes, Alaska natives, native Hawaiians, and private-     nonprofit entities; or through loans to nonindustrial private      forest landowners. The Federal share of funding for      Cooperative Agreements and the loan program will come from      penalties that are being assessed against violators of the      Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act (civil penalties      assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45 million).                         section 1. short title       The title of the bill is the ``Forest Resources for the      Environment and the Economy Act''.                    SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES       This section states the findings of the bill, including:      there is a need or additional information opportunities to      increase carbon     storage on public land through improvements in forest land      management; monitoring and verification of forest carbon      storage can provide employment opportunities for rural      communities; and the sustainable production of biomass energy      feedstocks provides a renewable source of energy that can      improve the energy security of the United States.       This section also states the purposes of the bill: to      increase carbon sequestration in forests; to provide      employment and income to rural communities; and to improve      the energy security of the United States by providing      opportunities for development of renewable biomass energy                         section 3. definitions       This section defines terms used in the bill, including the      following: ``Carbon sequestration''; ``Forestry carbon      activity''; ``Forest carbon program''; ``Forest carbon      reservoir''; ``Forest carbon storage''; ``Forest land'';      ``Forest management action''; ``Invasive species'';      ``Nonindustrial private forest''; ``Reforestation''; and      ``Revolving loan program''.  section 4. carbon management on federal land; carbon monitoring and                         verification guidelines       This section amends Title XVI (``Global Climate Change'')      of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.       (a) Definitions: This subsection amends the Energy Policy      ACt to add the definitions for ``carbon      sequestration''``forest carbon storage,'' ``forest carbon      program,'' ``forest carbon reservoir,'' and ``forest      management action'' that were specified in Section 3.       (b) Carbon Management on Federal Land: This subsection      directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress on      the quantity of carbon contained in the forest carbon      reservoir in the national forest system. The report will      include an assessment of forest management actions that can      increase carbon storage on these national forest system      lands. Finally, the report will include an assessment of the      role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contributions of      forestry to the global carbon budget. This subsection is      accomplished by amendment to section 1604 of the Energy      Policy Act (``Assessment of Alternative Policy Mechanisms for      Addressing Greenhouse Gas Emissions'').       (c) Monitoring and Verification of Carbon Storage. This      subsection amends section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act      (``Voluntary Reporting''). It directs the Secretary of      Agriculture to review the existing Federal guidelines on      reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon storage      from forest management actions and to make recommendations to      the Secretary of Energy for amendment of the guidelines.       Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council: This subsection also      directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a 16-     member, multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory      Council for the purpose of advising the Department of      Agriculture on: the development of the guidelines for      accurate voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas sequestration      from forest management actions, and for other purposes.       Criteria: The guidelines developed by the Secretary of      Agriculture must take account of additionality and leakage.      The guidelines must include recommended practices for      monitoring, measurement and verification of carbon storage      that are scientifically sound and cost-effective.       State Forest Carbon Programs: The guidelines will include      guidance to States for reporting, monitoring and verifying      carbon storage achieved under the carbon storage program      established in Section 5 of the bill.       Biomass energy projects: The guidelines will include      guidance on calculating net greenhouse gas reductions from      biomass energy projects.       Amendment of guidelines: The subsection directs the      Secretary of Energy to revise the existing voluntary      reporting guidelines to include the recommendations provided      by the Secretary of Agriculture.       Review of guidelines: Guidelines must be reviewed at least      every 24 months, and as necessary for consistency with any      future Federal laws that credit for reductions of atmospheric      greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from forest      management actions.       Monitoring of Forest Carbon Programs: Participants in the      Forest Carbon Program established in Section 5 of the bill      must report annually to the Secretary of Agriculture on the      results of the program. Reports that are certified to comply      with the guidelines in this section will be submitted to the      Department of Energy for inclusion in the 1605(b) voluntary      reporting data base.    section 5. forest carbon cooperative agreements and loan program       This section authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to      enter into cooperative agreements and directs the Secretary      to provide assistance to States to establish revolving loan      funds to undertake forestry carbon activities.       (a) Forest Carbon Activity Cooperative Agreements. This      subsection authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter      into cooperative agreements with willing State or local      governments, American Indian tribes, Alaska natives, native      Hawaiians, and private-nonprofit landowners for forest carbon      activities.       (b) Forest Carbon Activity Revolving Loan Program. This      subsection establishes a program to provide assistance      through State established revolving loan funds to      nonindustrial private forest land owners (NIPF) for eligible      forest carbon activities. Requirements include:       Eligibility: Funds may be used to support eligible forest      carbon activities on not more than 5,000 acres of an NIPF      landowners' holdings.       Loan terms: Loans must be repaid with interest at a rate      not to exceed a 3 percent real rate of return. They must be      repaid when the land is harvested, although the owner may pay      off the loan prior to harvesting. Loans must include a      transferable lien on all timber, forest products and biomass.      The State assumes the risk of loss of timber due to natural      disaster. A loan agreement must include recognition that,      until the loan is paid off, all reductions in atmospheric      greenhouse gases achieved by projects funded by the loan are      attributable to the entity that provides funding for the      loan.       Permanent conservation easements: Loan recipients can      cancel the loan by donating a permanent conservation      easement.       Reinvestment of funds: All repayments collected by a State      must be reinvested in the program and used by the State to      make additional loans.       Records: The State Forester shall maintain all loan records      and make them available to the public.       Matching funds: A State must match Federal funding by at      least 25% beginning in the second year of participating in      the program.       Loan Funding Distribution: The Secretary will report to      Congress on a formula under which Federal funds will be      distributed among eligible States. The distribution formula      will give priority to States that have experienced or are      expected to experience significant declines in employment      levels in the forestry industries due to declining timber      harvests on Federal land.       Private funding: A revolving loan fund may accept any funds      provided by nongovernmental organizations, businesses or      persons for the purpose of this Act.       Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): States served by BPA      (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana) may apply for funding      from BPA for purposes of funding loans that meet both the      objectives of this Act and the fish and wildlife objectives      of BPA under current law.       (c) Requirements: This subsection specifies requirements of      any financial assistance arrangement for forest carbon      activities.       Eligibility: This gives a general definition of eligible      forestry carbon activities.       Guidance: The Forest Service, in collaboration with the      States, will provide guidance on eligible forestry carbon      activities.       Activities require under law: Funding shall not be provided      for activities required under existing laws.       Pre-agreements: Funding shall not be provided for costs      already incurred.       Limitation on land considered for funding: No funding shall      be provided for reforestation of land that has been      harvested, if the landowner received revenues from the      harvest sufficient to reforest the land.       Eligible tree species: Planted tress must be native or non-     invasive species.       Forest management plan: Priority shall be given to projects      on land under a forest management plan or forest stewardship      plan.       Use of funds: Funds shall be used for planting of trees and      their management.       Financial assistance amount: Cooperative agreements or      loans may cover up to 100 percent of total project costs, not      to exceed $100,000 during any 2-year period.       Authorization of appropriations: Authorizes funding from FY      2001 to FY 2010 at amounts equal to civil penalties collected      under the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, which      currently revert to the Treasury as General Revenues. In      fiscal year 1998, $45 million in penalties were assessed.       Allocation of funds: The Secretary shall allocate 15      percent of available funds for cooperative agreements and the      remaining 85 percent for the State revolving loan fund.                                 ______                                       By
