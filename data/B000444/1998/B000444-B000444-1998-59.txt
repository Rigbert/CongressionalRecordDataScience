 President, I will be very brief. I want to thank the Senator from Arkansas. He has been a gentleman.  His amendment is, I think, a good amendment and I thank him for considering some of the suggestions that I and a few others had.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin of Michigan, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator Biden of Delaware be added as cosponsors.
