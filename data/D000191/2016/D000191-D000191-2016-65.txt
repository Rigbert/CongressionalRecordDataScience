Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman for bringing this forward.  We are one of the last refuges in the United States free of the zebra mussel, which is incredibly destructive and expensive. This will help us protect the integrity of our vital riverine resources.  I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this forward, and I fully support it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
