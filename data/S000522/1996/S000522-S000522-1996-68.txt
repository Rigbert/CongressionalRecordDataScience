Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment No. 20 offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey: Page      87, after line 3, insert the following new section:       Sec.   . None of the funds available to the Department of      Defense under this Act may be obligated or expended to pay a      contractor under a contract with the Department of Defense      for any costs incurred by the contractor when it is made      known to the Federal official having authority to obligate or      expend such funds that such costs are restructuring costs      associated with a business combination that were incurred on      or after August 15, 1994.
