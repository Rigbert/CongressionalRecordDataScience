President, if the Senator will yield a moment, I thank the Senator from Kansas and others for passing this bill. I know this has been a major cause of our retiring colleague from the other body, Bruce Vento. We had this before the Judiciary Committee this morning. I thank Senator Hatch and the others who helped make it possible to bring it out. It rights a grievous wrong, and it is a good piece of legislation.
