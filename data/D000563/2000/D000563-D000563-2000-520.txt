President, in my hometown of Springfield, IL, we have extraordinary people who have made noteworthy contributions in service to others.  Julie Cellini, a freelance writer and community activist, has written many profiles which highlight the lives of these fine neighbors in our state capital.  Recently, Julie shared the life story of such a person: Sister Agnes Clare, O.P.  At 103 years of age with a sharp mind, an enduring will to savor each day of her life and an irresistible Irish charm, Sister Agnes Clare is more than a living legend. She is an eyewitness to a century of history in Springfield; a young observer of Washington, D.C., as the daughter of a U.S. Congressman; and most of all, a vivid illustration of the legacy of a life of giving as a member of the Dominican Sisters of Springfield.  In this week before the celebration of St. Patrick's birthday, I would like to share with the Senate Julie Cellini's recent feature story on Sister Agnes Clare from the Springfield State Journal-Register. As you read it, you will learn of the Grahams, a great Irish-American family, and a woman who has touched so many lives with so much goodness.  Mr. President, I ask that this article be printed in the Congressional Record.            [From the State Journal-Register, March 5, 2000]                Golden Opportunities--Sister Agnes Clare                           (By Julie Cellini)       Agnes Graham was 11 years old when the race riot of 1908      broke out in Springfield.       ``I remember the smashed dishes and glass from the windows      of Loper's Restaurant strewn across South Fifth Street,'' she      says. ``My mother tried to keep me from reading the      newspapers so I wouldn't know all that happened. She always      thought children should be trouble free, but it wasn't      possible to avoid what was going on.''       Now at 103 years old, Agnes Graham has been Sister Agnes      Clare O.P. of the Cominican Sisters of Springfield for 80      years. She has lived during three centuries of Springfield      history, but her voice still carries a hint of the same      incredulousness she might have felt some 92 years ago when      she watched her hometown erupt into violence that culminated      in the lynching of two black men.       ``There was a mob. They became very angry when they      couldn't get to the black prisoners in the county jail. They      said a black man raped a white woman, but it wasn't true. The      town was just torn apart.''       By the time the two-day upheaval ended, seven people,      blacks and whites, were dead,     and 40 black homes and 15 black-owned businesses were      destroyed.       Whether the race riot is her worst memory from more than a      century of living, Sister Agnes Clare won't say. Her voice is      steady, but she moves quickly to other events, often telling      stories about her childhood in the leafy confines of what      once was called ``Aristocracy Hill.''       Born in 1987 in a handsome, Lincoln-era house that sill      stands at 413 S. Seventh St., Agnes Graham was the youngest      of seven children--three girls and four boys. She grew up in      an adoring, achieving family headed by James M. Graham, an      Irish immigrant who co-founded the family law firm of Graham      & Graham. James M. Graham served in the Illinois General      Assembly and as Sangamon County state's attorney before being      elected to Congress, where he served from 1908 to 1914.       Sister Agnes Clare's earliest memories are of life in the      Victorian-style, painted-brick house, where water came from a      backyard pump and transportation meant hitching up a horse      and buggy. She frames them from the perspective of a much      loved child who appears to have been the favorite of her      older siblings.       She recalls the Christmas she was 5 years old (``about the      age when I started doubting Santa Clause'') and too sick with      the flu to walk downstairs to open gifts. Her brother Hugh, a      law student at the University of Illinois, wrapped her in a      blanket and carried her in his arms down the long, curved      staircase with its polished walnut banister.       ``My father had given me a big dollar bill to buy eight      presents, she says, ``I spent 30 cents for three bottles of      perfume for my mother and sisters, and the place smelled to      high heaven. I bought my father two bow ties for 10 cents. I      think they were made of paper, and they fastened with safety      pins. When I got downstairs, I saw a cup of tea for Santa      Claus.       ``When I was very young, my father went on a ship to      Ireland to visit. I asked him to bring me back a leprechaun,      but he said he didn't want me to be disappointed if the      leprechauns were too fast for him to catch. What he did bring      back was a leprechaun doll in a box, with gray socks and a      pipe and bat. He told me it was a dead leprechaun, and that      the salt water had killed him. I think I half-believed him,      and I went around the neighborhood showing my dead leprechaun      to my friends. One of their mother told my mother, `Agnes'      imagination is growing up faster than she is.''       ``The leprechaun went back into a box,'' she says, ``but      he'd get to come out on my birthdays and special occasions.''       Now a family heirloom, the doll resides with her great-     niece, Sallie Graham.       Sister Agnes Clare says he Springfield she grew up in      wasn't a small town. There were 50,000 people living here at      the beginning of the 20th century. Downtown was populated      with family-owned businesses, and people tended to stay at      the same job all of their lives.       The streets were paved with bricks that popped up without      warning. People waited all year for the biggest event on the      calendar: the Illinois State Fair.       ``My mother baked hams and fried chickens so we had safe      food to take to the fair. Lots of people got sick from eating      at the fairgrounds because there was no refrigeration. At      night, the area around the Old Capitol would be filled with      fair performers who put on shows. Acrobats, singers and      actors would perform on one side of the square. Then we would      rush to the other side to get a front row seat on the ground.      Everyone in town seemed to come out, and all the stores      stayed open late so people could ship.''       A rare treat was a little cash for ice cream, usually      provided by big brother Hugh because there was an ice cream      shop across from the Graham law office.       A change meeting with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis      was a highlight of the years Sister Agnes Clare spent in      Washington as the young daughter of an Illinois congressman.      She tells how Brandeis and her father worked together to      investigate and remove corrupt agents who were swindling the      residents of Indian reservations.       ``Justice Brandeis came to our home because he was leaving      Washington and he wanted to tell my father goodbye. I      happened to be hanging on the fence in the front yard, so he      gave me his business card and told me to give it to my      father. He said my father was a great man.''       ``Indians would show up at my father's office in full      native dress. My father spent a lot of time away from      Washington inspecting the reservations. He told me stories of      Indians so badly cared for (that) their feet left bloody      footprints in the snow. One agent my father got removed gave      an Indian a broken sewing machine for land that had oil and      timber on it. The Indians were so grateful, a tribe in South      Dakota made my father an honorary member with the title Chief      Stand Up Straight.''       Years later, when the Graham family home in Springfield was      sold, she says, relatives donated her father's papers from      that period to Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.       In adulthood, Sister Agnes Clare attended college and was a      librarian and a founding teacher at a mission and school in      Duluth, Minn. However, her long lifetime often has been      attached to a small geographic area bounded by the      neighborhood where she was born and extending a few blocks      west to the places where she attended school, spent much of      her working career and retired to the Sacred Heart Convent in      1983.       Within those confines, she has lived most of a full, rich      life that shows few signs of diminishing.       ``Sister Agnes' bones don't support her, so she moves      around in a wheel chair,'' says Sister Beth Murphy,      communication coordinator for the Springfield Dominican      order.       ``Other than that, she has no illnesses, and her mind is      sharp and clear.''       The order has had other nuns who lived to be 100, but      Sister Agnes Clare holds the longevity record.       ``She's amazing,'' says Sister Murphy. ``She continues to      live every day with interest and curiosity. She listens to      classical music and follows politics and current events on      public radio. She reads the large-print edition of The New      York Times every day. Recently I dropped by her room to visit      and couldn't find her. She had wheeled herself off to art      appreciation class.''       Sister Agnes Clare's gaze is steady and assured and her      face is remarkably unlined. She occupies a sunny room filled      with photos and religious keepsakes. Less than a block away      is the former Sacred Heart Academy (now Sacred Heart-Griffin      High School), where she worked as a librarian for nearly 60      years.       ``No, I didn't plan on becoming a nun,'' she says matter-     of-factly. ``I always thought I'd have a lot of children and      live in a fairy-tale house. No one lives that way, of course.       ``I always loved books, so when I graduated I went across      the street from my family's home and got a job at Lincoln      Library. The librarians were patient and put up with me while      I learned how to do the work. One day I was alone when a man      with a gruff voice and a face that looked like leather came      in and asked to see the books written by Jack London. Of      course, we had `Sea Wolf' and `Call of the Wild' and all the      popular London books. I showed him, and then I asked who he      was.       ``He said he was Jack London. I was so astonished, I forgot      to ask for his autograph.''       Sister Agnes Clare brushes aside any suggestion that she      was a writer, despite her essays published in Catholic Digest      and other publications. She once sold an article to The      Atlantic Monthly. The piece was a rebuttal to one written by      a nun critical of convent life. The editors asked for more of      Sister Agnes Clare's work but World War II intervened and      life became too busy for writing articles.       She has been a prolific letter writer to four generations      of Grahams. Carolyn Graham, another grand-niece says each of      her four adult children treasures letters from their Aunt      Agnes.       ``Whenever my kids come home,'' she says, ``they always      check in with her. They think she's extraordinary and she      is.''       After a lifetime that has seen wars and sweeping societal      changes and the invention of everything from airplanes to the      Internet, Sister Agnes Clare isn't offering any advice on how      to live longer than 100 years.       An academically engaged life with good health habits      probably has helped, and so has genetics. She comes from a      long-lived family. Her father lived to age 93 and her brother      Huge died at 95. A nephew, Dr. James Graham, continues to      practice medicine at age 91.       There are, she admits, perks attached to being among the      rare triple-digit individuals called centenarians.       ``People ask you questions when you get to be my age,'' she      says, smiling. ``They even listen to my answers.''                          ____________________
