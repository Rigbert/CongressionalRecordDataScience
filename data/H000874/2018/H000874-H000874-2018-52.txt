Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that observation.  My presumption, therefore, is, if the conference cannot come to agreement, I would presume that we would have an extension on those three bills and others that might need that. Is that accurate?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.  I do not want to slow the conference for their work and others, but I would like to see us finish that. And, of course, we do not want those items to expire, so we would deal with that at the appropriate time. But as of now, if we can solve them and vote for the continuation, I would take that up first.
