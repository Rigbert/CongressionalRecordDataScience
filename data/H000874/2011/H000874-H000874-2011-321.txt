 I've heard that argument that you just made made in 1981, in 1989, and again in 2001. I tell my friend, my experience has been that it hasn't worked, and we have incurred substantial trillions of dollars of debt pursuing the Rules Committee philosophy that is represented in your rule.  On the other hand, a bill that you opposed, and every member of your party opposed in 1993, which you say was pursuing a job-killing policy, in fact created more jobs than any other administration since you and I have served here, some 22 million jobs and, additionally, balanced the budget. Did we work together to do that? We did.  But I will tell you my experience and yours has been that we did, in fact, balance the budget on the philosophy of statutory PAYGO.
