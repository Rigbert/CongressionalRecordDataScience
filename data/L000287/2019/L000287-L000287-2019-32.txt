Henry Cole of Washington, D.C. will celebrate his centennial birthday.  Mr. Cole and his nine siblings were born and raised right here in the nation's capital, where he developed a love for his family, his hometown, and his nation. During World War II, Mr. Cole honorably served in the United States Navy and was stationed at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii.  After the war, he returned home to Washington, D.C., where he continued his pursuit of the American Dream. Mr. Cole worked as a machinist at the Washington Navy Yard, opened a family-owned restaurant with his sister, and eventually retired from the United States Postal Service in 1980 after a long, distinguished career in public service.  I believe one of the most moving and inspirational aspects of Mr. Cole's legacy and life is the love affair he shared with Gloria, his beloved wife of 68 years. Together, they raised seven children--Theodore, Shelia, Sylvia, Linda, Rex, Alice and Don. Those seeds planted with love continue to flourish in their 25 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, there is an African proverb that says, ``What you help a child to love can be more important than what you help him to learn.'' Mr. Cole adored his family, his country, and his community; however, he never restricted his devotion and wisdom to his immediate family and maintained an open door and served as a father figure and role model to countless others.  As we strive towards realizing the dream of a nation at peace with itself and her neighbors, Mr. Cole witnessed and was an agent of change. On the behalf of a grateful nation, I thank this beloved patriarch for embodying courage, character, compassion for the last century.  For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I am proud to join the family and all who know and love Mr. Henry Cole in honoring him on the occasion of his 100th birthday.                            ____________________
