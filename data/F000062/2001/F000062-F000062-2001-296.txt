 President, since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more than 17 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, one half the population of California, have died from AIDS.  To begin to address this catastrophe, Senator Feingold and I introduced an Amendment to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act that would have helped ensure access to generic AIDS drugs for nations in sub-Saharan Africa ravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  Despite the fact that this amendment was approved by the Senate, it was stricken from the final Africa Trade Conference Report.  Subsequently, the Clinton Administration issued an Executive Order that ensured that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa could provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.  And, two weeks ago, I am pleased to note, the Bush Administration indicated that it would not seek to overturn this Executive Order.  Now, Senator Feingold and I have developed the ``Global Access to AIDS Treatment Act of 2001'' which, among other provisions: Codifies the Executive Order into law; Directs that the law must apply to the 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa; and Expands the scope of the law to cover all developing nations facing a catastrophic AIDS crisis.  Unless the United States takes a leadership role in recognizing, as does the WTO TRIPS agreement, that there is a moral obligation to put people over profits, the human devastation and social instability that has already begun in countries facing an AIDS crisis will grow to unfathomable levels.  Until recently, many people have been unaware of the depth of the global loss being caused by this epidemic.  The HIV virus has infected over 36 million people worldwide, with over 95 percent of those infected living outside of the United States.  Over 21.8 million people have died from HIV/AIDS world-wide since the beginning of the epidemic, 3 million in 2000 alone.  In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70 percent of all deaths from HIV/AIDS have occurred, 17 million people, as I said before, have died from HIV/AIDS since the epidemic began, and 2.4 million in the year 2000.  To address this pandemic, Senator Feingold and I have developed legislation to address the crisis. This legislation does the following:  First, this legislation directs the U.S. Government to refrain from seeking the revision of any law, imposed by a government of a developing nation facing an AIDS crisis, that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.  This will ensure that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable and more available to those most in need.  Second, this legislation authorizes $25 million a year for programs to develop and strengthen health care infrastructure in developing countries.  Third, the legislation calls upon the World Health Organization and UNAIDS to take the lead in organizing efficient procurement of compulsory licences of pharmaceutical patents, active ingredients of drugs, and finished medications for countries that require this assistance.  Fourth, this legislation calls on the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to work with developing countries and international service providers to develop best practices for delivering pharmaceuticals to those who need them.  Fifth, this legislation requires the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, and NIH to develop and maintain a database for information on drugs, patent status, and treatment protocols to assist health-care providers from around the globe in providing the best care possible to all patients.  And finally, this legislation provides $1 million a year to encourage American physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, public health workers, pharmacists, and other health professionals to provide HIV/AIDS care and treatment in developing countries.  This legislation will allow countries facing an HIV/AIDS crisis to better determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.  It is clearly in the national interest of the United States to prevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS, and I believe that this legislation is necessary to continue to assist the countries of the developing world to bring this deadly disease under control.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 463       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Access to AIDS      Treatment Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Since the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, it has claimed      21,800,000 lives.       (2) Over 17,000,000 men, women, and children, have died due      to AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.       (3) Over 36,000,000 people are infected with the HIV virus      today. Over 25,000,000 live in sub-Saharan Africa.       (4) By 2010, approximately 40,000,000 children worldwide      will have lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS.       (5) Access to effective treatment for HIV/AIDS is      determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure,      and sustainable financing.       (6) In January 2000, the National Intelligence Council      released an intelligence estimate that framed the HIV/AIDS      pandemic as a security threat, noting the relationship      between the disease and political and economic instability.       (7) The overriding priority for responding to the HIV/AIDS      crisis should be to emphasize and encourage prevention.       (8) An effective response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic must      also involve assistance to stimulate the development of      health service delivery infrastructure in affected States.       (9) An effective United States response to the HIV/AIDS      crisis must also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS      vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease.       (10) The innovative capacity of the United States in the      commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is      unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these      sectors will be a critical element in any successful strategy      to respond to the global HIV/AIDS crisis.       (b) Declaration of Policy.--Congress declares that it is      the policy of the United States that the United States will      not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or      revision of intellectual property or competition laws or      policies that regulate pharmaceuticals or medical      technologies used to treat HIV/AIDS or the most common      opportunistic infections that accompany HIV/AIDS in any      foreign country undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health      crisis if the laws or policies of that foreign country--       (1) promote access to the pharmaceuticals or medical      technologies for affected populations; and       (2) provide intellectual property protection consistent      with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual      Property Rights referred to in paragraph (15) of section      101(d) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C.      3511(d)(15)).     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.       It is the sense of the Senate--       (1) to encourage the World Health Organization and the      Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to carry      out HIV/AIDS activities in foreign countries that are      undergoing an HIV/AIDS-related public health crisis,      including activities that are consistent with the policy      described in section 2(b); and       (2) that the World Health Organization and the Joint United      Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) should lead the      international organization of the manufacture and      distribution of pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for      HIV/AIDS, including the global registration of products and      the organization of the efficient procurement of compulsory      licenses, active ingredients, and finished products for      foreign countries that require such assistance.     SEC. 4. PARALLEL IMPORTING AND COMPULSORY LICENSING.
