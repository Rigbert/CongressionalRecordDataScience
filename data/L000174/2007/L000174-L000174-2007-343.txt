President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to correct a most unfortunate piece of legislation that was slipped into an appropriations bill several years ago, which will restore the Federal courts to their proper position in considering certain trademark issues. I joined Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Roberts on a version of this bill in the 109th Congress. That bill did not reach final passage, but its importance demands our renewed attention. Together, we are reintroducing the Judicial Powers Restoration Act of 2007.  We will repeal Section 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill of 1999. Section 211 was slipped into that appropriations bill at the eleventh hour, under the radar of most members of the Senate. It was done in a way specifically intended to bypass the normal legislative process. Its intent was to affect the outcome of a dispute over the ``Havana Club'' trademark for rum. Section 211 prohibits the registration or renewal of registration of a trademark of a business that was expropriated by the Cuban Government. It also disallows ``any assertion of rights'' by Cuban entities, or a foreign successor in interest to a Cuban entity, with respect to trademarks of expropriated businesses. Finally, the provision states that no U.S. Court may recognize the attempt by a Cuban entity or its successor in interest, from asserting treaty rights with respect to an expropriated mark unless the owner expressly consents.  I am not here to help out a liquor company. Rather, I am here to ensure that intellectual property protections recognized by our laws are honored in our courts. I am here to ensure that U.S. courts may consider trademark cases arising under U.S. laws. Most importantly, I am here because the legislative process needs to take place in the open and in front of the people, not under cover of darkness and behind closed doors.  I have been working with Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Roberts for more than three years on this issue, and I hope we can move quickly to pass this bipartisan legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1806       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Judicial Powers Restoration      Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to restore to the judiciary the      power to decide all trademark and trade name cases arising      under the laws and treaties of the United States by repealing      the prohibition on recognition by United States courts of      certain rights relating to certain marks, trade names, and      commercial names and impediments to registration of such      marks.     SEC. 3. REPEAL.       (a) In General.--Section 211 of the Department of Commerce      and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained      in section 101(b) of division A of Public Law 105-277; 112      Stat. 2681-88) is repealed.       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall      issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the      repeal made by subsection (a), including removing or revoking      any prohibition on transactions or payments to which      subsection (a)(1) of section 211 of the Department of      Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999      applied.                          ____________________
