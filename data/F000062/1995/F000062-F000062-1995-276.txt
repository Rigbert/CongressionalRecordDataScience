 President, I was recently privileged to address the convention of the United Nations Association during its conference in San Francisco, coinciding with the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. I took the opportunity to make some observations about the past, present, and future of U.N. peacekeeping, and I offer them here for the record.             The U.N. Mission: A Trend Toward Peacekeeping  When we look at the 50-year history of the United Nations, certain facts and trends become evident. One of these is the increasing trend toward peacekeeping. In the first 43 years of its existence, from 1945 to 1988, the United Nations launched 13 peacekeeping missions in places such as Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, the then-Congo, Cyprus, between India and Pakistan, and along Arab-Israeli borders. While the results of these missions were not uniformly successful, the United Nations proved it was able to play an important role in resolving, or at least containing, a number of dangerous conflicts.  And yet, during this period, the United Nations faced certain realities, the largest of which was the superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. As conflicts developed, the countries involved were forced, either through external or internal forces, to align themselves with one superpower or the other. In this environment, the United Nations was often left on the sidelines. When United States and Soviet interests collided, each could cancel out the other's initiatives with their Security Council vetoes. When conflicts involved vital United States and Soviet interests, the two powers did not hesitate to take it upon themselves to try to resolve the conflict in their favor rather than seeking a negotiated resolution through the United Nations.  There is no question that the cold war was a time of serious international insecurity. The specter of two superpowers, with weapons of immense destructive capability aimed at each other, competing for influence across the globe, lasted for nearly 45 years, ending startlingly in 1990 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Even today, many people share the misconception that the demise of the Soviet Union has created a more secure world. I do not believe that this is necessarily the case.  The cold war, for all its dangers, had the unintended effect of discouraging many smaller countries, nationalities, and ethnic minorities from fighting one another. The danger that any uprising could, and would with certainty, be put down brutally by the Soviet Union, clearly contained insurrections and civil wars in areas like the former Yugoslavia. If Tito were in power today, under Soviet control, the civil war would most probably not have happened. A dying vestige of this cold war control is seen today in Chechnya, where a weakened Russia is brutally struggling to contain and vanquish Chechen rebels.  However, the potential for nuclear war also had a deterrent and stabilizing effect on both major superpowers in their dealing with each other.  Today, with these cold war constraints gone, an equally, if not more dangerous scenario has developed whereby smaller conflicts that had been festering just beneath the surface have now emerged, many erupting with unprecedented force and brutality. Though the numbers vary almost weekly, through most of 1994 and 1995, there have been over 30 wars raging simultaneously across the world.  Trouble spots seem to crop up everywhere. Some fizzle quickly, while others spread into larger regional conflicts. Once again, genocide, starvation, ethnic cleansing, mass rape, torture, and millions of homeless people confront all of us. From Bosnia and Croatia to Rwanda and Burundi, from Afghanistan to Algeria, and from Sudan to Tajikistan, ethnic, religious and national grievances are taking a tremendous toll in human life. And whether these conflicts are internal or across borders, they all contribute to the deepening sense of international insecurity.  In this increasingly complex and dangerous environment, there has never been a greater need for the United Nations to provide leadership. No other body, and certainly no single nation, is equipped to deal with the problems of ancient territorial disputes, ethnic and religious rivalries, inherent in the host of newly emergent independent nations, many with ruthless dictators.  For this reason, peacekeeping is fast becoming the most important and significant function of the United Nations. As the world community grapples for ways to deal with these burgeoning conflicts, multilateral peacekeeping is increasingly seen as the best or the only viable recourse. As such, the United Nations alone is also seen--and rightfully so--as the only body with the structure, the experience and the international mandate to make a nonpartisan peacekeeping effort succeed.  The numbers bear out this trend: After 13 peacekeeping missions in its first 43 years, the United Nations has performed 25 such missions in the last 7 years alone. Today there are 16 concurrent peacekeeping missions underway. In 1988 there were 9,000 soldiers from different countries participating in peacekeeping missions. Today there are more than 61,000 from over 80 countries.  I believe that on this anniversary, we should pause, take stock, and reevaluate where events mandate change in both the role and mission of the United Nations. Clearly, peacekeeping has become a major and expanding role. The question is: Can the blue-helmeted observer of the past and present effectively be the peacekeeper of the future?  For a moment, let us look at some peacekeeping successes.  In Cyprus, U.N. peacekeepers have helped since 1964 to prevent a resumption of hostilities that could lead to war between two of our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey.  On the Golan Heights, U.N. peacekeepers have helped make the Israeli-Syrian border one of the quietest in the Middle East for the last 21 years.  In El Salvador and Cambodia, U.N. peacekeepers helped to safeguard the reconciliation process at the end of those countries' civil wars, and helped provide the order necessary to conduct free and democratic elections.  Clearly, these were, and are, successful missions. When peacekeeping works, it can stabilize, reduce tension and hostility, and provide the backdrop needed before which peacemaking can succeed.  It is worth noting here that, today, even with the dramatic increase in peacekeeping missions, U.S. troops constitute only about 5 percent of total U.N. peacekeeping efforts around the world--about 3,300 out of over 61,000.  Now let's look at some of the problems.  As peacekeeping missions increase in numbers, more funding is required to keep it going. In 1988, the [U.N.] peacekeeping budget was $230 million. In 1994, the budget grew to $3.5 billion.  Here, the United States makes its primary contribution to U.N. peacekeeping in financial terms, paying 31 percent of all assessed costs, although Congress has mandated that the U.S. share be reduced to 25 percent this October. In 1988, the U.S. contribution for assessed peacekeeping cost was $36.7 million. In 1994, the U.S. share rose to $991 million -- a huge increase.  Clearly not all peacekeeping operations have been successful. We can and should learn from the tragedies of Bosnia and Somalia--perhaps the two most difficult examples of U.N. peacekeeping in the last 50 years. Why have they been so difficult? I would submit that not all peacekeeping missions are the same, and they often become confused. Different peacekeeping missions require different types of peacekeeping efforts. You cannot lump them all together.  For example, in Somalia, the United Nations started out engaged in a successful humanitarian mission to prevent hundreds of thousand from starving to death, but the mission soon changed into one of nation-building and political involvement, finally resulting in confrontations with the warring factions.  The U.N. forces in Somalia proved unable to respond to a shifting set of dynamics. The dynamics in one country are not going to be the same as the dynamics in another, and the dynamics within a country can change overnight. The blue-helmeted observer that cannot fire back to protect himself or civilians, without a convoluted approval process, cannot maintain peace when warring factions want to have at each other.  Somalia was a classic lesson in that regard. We saw a renegade warlord who was prepared to circumvent the peacekeeping mission one way or another. The U.N. forces, when challenged, could not fight back effectively. The result was more than 100 U.N. peacekeepers and 18 U.S. Army Rangers killed during that 24 month mission, and the United Nations and the United States pulled out with mixed results.  But the ultimate challenge in this century to peacekeeping has been the war in the former Yugoslavia. There the United Nations faces insurmountable problems and dilemmas. Literally, more than 800 year of animus, hatred, and territorial disputes have combined to provide UNPROFOR Its most difficult and challenging mission in U.N. history.  Perhaps in 1878, Benjamin Disraeli said it best when he offered these words, in the British House of Lords:       No language can describe adequately the condition of that      large portion of the Balkan peninsula--Serbia, Bosnia,      Hercegovina and other provices--[the] political intrigues,      constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit . .      . hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions and      absence of any controlling power . . . nothing short of any      army of 50,000 of the best troops would produce anything like      order in these parts.  And that was 117 years ago.  On one hand, there has been a dramatic decrease in civilian casualties in that terrible conflict--from 130,000 in 1992 down to 3,000 in 1994. On the other hand, it is in Bosnia that we begin to see the major shortcomings of United Nations forces as peacekeepers.  We saw it on May 25 in Tuzla, a ``U.N. Safe Area'' when 71 young people, all under age 28, were killed by a single Serb shell--one of many instances when Serb forces have eroded safe areas with attacks--without any retaliation, despite a Security Council resolution authorizing such responses.  We saw it when 377 U.N. troops were recently taken hostage after a NATO airstrike on a Serbian ammunition dump.  We saw it when Captain O'Grady's F-16 was shot down, the second plane lost in Deny Flight operations, without response [as] scores of hostages were still held captive.  We see it every day, as U.N. peacekeepers attempt to protect innocent civilians, sometimes successfully, but often not.  And we saw it, most poignantly, on June 10, when the United Nations mission in Sarajevo announced it would not respond to protect Muslim enclaves from attack without the consent of the Bosnian Serbs.  I believe it is fair to say that U.N. forces have neither the training, the equipment, nor the rules of engagement, to allow them to sufficiently respond to attacks against them or against civilian populations. They are meant to be observers--not fighters.  These problems have taken their toll on U.S. congressional support. And they have taken their toll, I think unfairly, on support for the UNPROFOR troops. In the Congress, there has been continuing debate over whether a unilateral or a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia, or the withdrawal of UNPROFOR troops altogether is the humane or the inhumane action to take. And, because the United States has no troops on the ground in Bosnia, we have less leverage in influencing nations that do have troops on the ground.  It is my belief that the United Nations must address peacekeeping efforts more realistically in view of the variety of situations they find themselves in, and provide a speedy and effective response dependent on the individual situation. The rapid reaction force recently created for Bosnia should help. We all hope they can be moved into the scene speedily, and that they will be properly empowered and commanded, in order to have an effective and immediate impact.  The idea of rapid response units has been discussed repeatedly over the past 50 years. At the international seminar hosted by the Netherlands Government in the spring of 1995, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Mr. Hans van Mierlo, presented a proposal of how such a force might work. Mr. van Mierlo's plan proposes a permanent rapid response nucleus, which would be able to be sent to a critical area of the world on very short notice. Such a force, if headed by a well-trained commanding officer with field experience, could provide a robust response to any aggressive action.  So my first point here today is that the entire United Nations peacekeeping structure must be reexamined, and perhaps redefined and restructured. Those of us who consider ourselves friends of the United Nations, and who believe that the world needs the United Nations, and vice versa, are prepared to make a case for continued U.S. participation, even for payment of our dues, but our success depends upon the willingness of the U.N. leadership to meet and discuss these issues with the Congress, and on their willingness to make improvements in the way peacekeeping is conceived and carried out.                    peacekeeping versus peacemaking  The second point I would like to make here involves peacekeeping versus peacemaking. Clearly the record on peacekeeping over 50 years has been, by and large, successful. The record on peacemaking is less clear.  I believe that the United Nations has an important and viable role in peacekeeping. And at times, the U.N. leadership has proven to be able mediators, and have helped parties in conflict reach a negotiated settlement. At other times it has been unsuccessful. But I do not believe that the United Nations is set up for peacemaking, because sometimes peacemaking requires force, or at least the ability to bring force to bear. The United Nations generally lacks the ability to bring such force to bear--whereas states, and alliances of states, have a greater capacity to do so.  So, I would suggest that peacemaking efforts also be reevaluated. This reevaluation should begin with an assessment of regional and political imperatives that lend themselves toward specific peacemaking alliances. Regional political forces, in the form of strong geographically based alliances, can more effectively spearhead diplomatic and military efforts to promote peacemaking than can the United Nations alone.  For example, peace has reigned in Europe for five decades since World War II, primarily because of the strong NATO alliance. NATO has been an important framework for making and maintaining peace between longtime adversaries--like Greece and Turkey, or Germany and France, and it has deterred aggression and conflict between East and West.  When peacemaking, rather than peacekeeping is called for, the United Nations needs to work with alliances like these to bring about the desired result. The United Nations can even foster the creation of such alliances, as indeed it did through a series of resolutions during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis. When the situation calls for peacemaking, the United Nations must understand whether diplomacy is sufficient, and where it is not, the United Nations must cooperate with individual states and alliances of states that can bring the necessary force to bear.  I am one that believes that the solution in Bosnia must be a negotiated one. In other words, a diplomatic solution rather than a military solution. Why? I can think of no military solution that would solve these 800-year old animosities without enormous bloodshed and loss of life. Nor can I think of a diplomatic solution that will work without the force of military action to compel it and, perhaps, to maintain it.  Warren Zimmerman, former Ambassador to Yugoslavia, in a recent article in the Washington Post, laid out what I believe is the only realistic goal: Give the Bosnian Serbs a limited time and certain deadline to agree to the plan advanced by the so-called contact group of five nations--a plan to which Mr. Milosevic has already agreed--which divides Bosnia virtually in half between the Serbs and their adversaries. But, as Ambassador Zimmerman correctly concludes, this outcome is only realistic if the Bosnian Serbs believe the West means business.  If this solution remains unacceptable to the Bosnian Serbs, there appears to be no other choice but a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo and an expedited removal of UNPROFOR forces.  Based on briefings I have had, I can find no acceptable rationale for a unilateral lifting of the embargo that would not involve the massive loss of life, or one without America being forced to arm and train Muslim forces, with the probability of a major spread of conflict in Croatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia.  In Bosnia, the single biggest problem for UNPROFOR has been that it is trying to carry out its mission with its hands tied. I truly believe that if a U.N. peacekeeping operation is unable to respond to hostile action taken against it, then it is unlikely to succeed.  UNPROFOR troops, through no fault of their own, have had to stand by and watch civilians get picked off by sniper fire, have their own equipment stolen and used against them, and finally, have 377 of them become hostages themselves.  The primary lesson of Bosnia for U.N. peacekeeping is that U.N. military commanders on the ground must have the authority, the weapons, and the trained fighting personnel to respond to hostile action with sufficient force to protect civilians and peacekeepers, and deter attack. This may require the establishment of permanent rapid response teams within U.N. peacekeeping missions, which will protect the mission and enable it to carry out its mandate.  In addition, peacekeepers need to be able to adapt to changing conditions. No matter how well a mission is planned, warring parties can force the United Nations to change its mission, and U.N. troops need to be able to respond. In this case, NATO's military response in the form of airstrikes is based on a ``dual key'' decisionmaking process, whereas both the United Nations and NATO commanders decide upon and coordinate the response. Targeting and execution are joint decisions by United Nations authorities and NATO military commanders.  The final point I'd like to make is that there is a need to develop alternative structures and alliances that can be employed both for peacekeeping and peacemaking.  Neither the United States, nor any other member state, can participate in every U.N.-sponsored effort to resolve every conflict. But I do believe that the United Nations can proceed most effectively if it is able to develop solid back-up among regional groupings and alliances.  Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has suggested that regional groupings like NATO, the Organization of the American States [OAS], and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] could appropriately take on peacekeeping responsibilities for certain types of missions in their regions. Other organizations that might contribute include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union. There is a healthy logic to putting together specific alliances in specific areas of the world, so that peacekeeping is carried out with some geographical relationship. Such missions would be strengthened by the political determination of neighbors--who could be affected should a war spread--to see that peace is the only result.  There are successful models that should be considered. One such case involved the United States, Israel, and Egypt, who, in the 1979 Camp David Accords, jointly established a private, United States-led peacekeeping operation in the Sinai peninsula--the Multinational Force and Observers [MFO]. This successful mission, undertaken without U.N. involvement, goes on to this day. It might serve as a model for other missions.  I have little doubt that the value of the United Nations to the international community and the United States will continue to grow. The United States simply does not have the support of its people, nor the resources, to assume the role of world-caretaker for the settlement of all disputes. The recognition of this fact will always bring people back to the conclusion that the United Nations is the best institution we have for dealing in a collective way with problems that affect the security of the United States and others.  Therefore, the United States has an obligation to work with the United Nations--not against it--to improve it, strengthen it, and make it more successful. With U.S. leadership, U.N. peacekeeping can indeed become more effective, better defined, and more realistically employed.                          ____________________
