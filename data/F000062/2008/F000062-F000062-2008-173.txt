 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Martinez to introduce legislation that takes a major step forward in curbing the abusive lending practices which contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis. With foreclosures at record levels, the housing market in steady decline, a global credit crunch, and the economy nearing recession, it is imperative that we act quickly to restore confidence in the American dream of home ownership.  Our legislation will eliminate bad actors from the mortgage business, and require that brokers and lenders meet minimum national standards which ensure they are professional, competent, and trustworthy.  First, it would create a comprehensive database of all residential mortgage loan originators. This includes mortgage brokers and lenders, as well as loan officers of national banks and their subsidiaries.  Second, it would establish national licensing standards to ensure that mortgage brokers and lenders are trained in legal aspects of lending, ethics, and consumer protection.  Our bill is similar to H.R. 3012, introduced in the House by Representative Spencer Bachus, the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Financial Services. The national licensing concept for loan originators has enjoyed bipartisan support and was included in the comprehensive mortgage reform bill, H.R. 3915, which recently passed the House.  A combination of low interest rates and sophisticated mortgage products, among other factors, helped increase home ownership to record levels just 3 years ago.  Subprime and exotic mortgages allowed millions of Americans--many with little or no down payment and questionable credit--to purchase homes by using adjustable-rate products with low initial monthly payments.  There was explosive growth in the use of these sub-prime loans: in just 2 years, from 2004 to 2006, the number of subprime mortgages in California increased 110 percent, from 273,000 to 573,000--29.4 percent of total mortgages in the State.  While the majority of lenders and brokers offered these mortgages in a responsible fashion, many others relied upon predatory lending tactics to place unsuspecting borrowers in mortgages they could not afford. Competitive pressures and lax oversight resulted in loans of increasingly poor quality being written.  To make matters worse, consumers were not adequately protected from bad actors in the mortgage industry.  The FBI recently reported that complaints of mortgage fraud have skyrocketed over the last few years.  In 2003, the number of suspicious activity reports reviewed by the FBI economic crimes unit numbered 3,000. The number of mortgage fraud complaints increased to 48,000 last year, representing a jump of 1500 percent.  Most mortgage brokers and non-bank lenders are only lightly regulated by State agencies. Standards of accountability have not kept pace with the increasing sophistication of the mortgage industry.  As adjustable-rate mortgages reset to higher rates, many American families find themselves in homes they can no longer afford. The percentage of homeowners currently behind on their mortgage payments is at its highest level in 21 years.  Mr. President, 2.2 million homeowners filed for foreclosure last year and many lenders have gone out of business or sought bankruptcy protection.  It is projected that as many as 2 million Americans will be forced to file for foreclosure before this crisis abates, representing $160 billion in lost equity. The Center for Responsible Lending has projected that one out of every five subprime loans issued between 2005 and 2006 will fail.  California has been especially hard hit. Mr. President, 5 of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation are in California. The foreclosure rate in California is roughly twice the national average, with 1 foreclosure filing for every 258 households in the State.  Lenders repossessed 84,375 California homes last year, a sixfold increase from 12,672 in 2006. Default notices--the initial step in the foreclosure process--increased 143 percent between 2006 and 2007, rising from 104,977 in 2006 to 254,824 in 2007. In San Diego County alone, foreclosures were up 353 percent in 2007.  According to the FBI economic crimes unit, California has been identified as one of the top 10 ``mortgage fraud hot spots'' in the Nation.  American families are hurting, and Californians are at the center of the storm. With close to 500,000 adjustable-rate mortgages scheduled to reset in California over the next 2 years, the situation is likely to worsen in 2008.  The subprime mortgage crisis has threatened both the global economy and the American dream of home ownership. Accountability, professional standards, and oversight must be enhanced for everyone in the mortgage industry.  This bill will make it so, and will help to ensure such a crisis never happens again.  Specifically, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act would require that all residential mortgage loan originators are licensed, providing fingerprints, a summary of work experience, and consent for a background check to authorities.  Additionally, minimum criteria are established that individuals must meet to obtain a license, including: no felonyconvictions; no similar license revoked; a demonstrated record of financial responsibility; successful completion of education requirements, 20 hours of approved courses, to include at least 3 hours related to Federal laws, 4 hours on ethics and consumer protection in mortgage lending, and 2 hours on the subprime mortgage marketplace; and, passage of a written exam, the exam must be at least 100 questions and a minimum score of 75 percent is required to pass.  The Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must also register all residential mortgage loan originators employed by national banks.  Lastly, State regulators must develop a satisfactory licensing system within 1 year following enactment of this legislation.  If this does not occur, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary is empowered to develop the national registry and license, generating revenue for its implementation through fees to license applicants.  The subprime mortgage crisis is wreaking havoc on American homeowners and the national economy. The damage is truly staggering--more than 2 million foreclosure filings last year and another 2 million expected before this year is over.  Many Americans simply cannot keep pace with adjustable-rate mortgages that are resetting, and some were steered into these obligations by unscrupulous actors.  It is essential that this body take action to address some of the factors that got us here.  This legislation does not assign blame, but rather provides a workable solution to protect homebuyers and begin to restore confidence in the American dream of homeownership.  I hope that my colleagues will join us in moving this important bill through the Senate quickly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2595       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Consideration of Factors and Procedures.--In      establishing the registration procedures under subsection (a)      and the protocols for assigning a unique identifier to a      registered loan originator, the Federal banking agencies      shall make such de minimis exceptions as may be appropriate      to paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of section 4(a), shall make      reasonable efforts to utilize existing information to      minimize the burden of registering loan originators, and      shall consider methods for automating the process to the      greatest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of      this Act.     SEC. 8. SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT BACKUP                    AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A LOAN ORIGINATOR                    LICENSING SYSTEM.       (a) Back up Licensing System.--If, by the end of the 1-year      period, or the 2-year period in the case of a State whose      legislature meets only biennially, beginning on the date of      the enactment of this Act or at any time thereafter, the      Secretary determines that a State does not have in place by      law or regulation a system for licensing and registering loan      originators that meets the requirements of sections 5 and 6      and subsection (d) of this section, or does not participate      in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, the      Secretary shall provide for the establishment and maintenance      of a system for the licensing and registration by the      Secretary of loan originators operating in such State as      State-licensed loan originators.       (b) Licensing and Registration Requirements.--The system      established by the Secretary under subsection (a) for any      State shall meet the requirements of sections 5 and 6 for      State-licensed loan originators.       (c) Unique Identifier.--The Secretary shall coordinate with      the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry to      establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each      loan originator licensed by the Secretary as a State-licensed      loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and      uniform identification of, and public access to, the      employment history of and the publicly adjudicated      disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan      originators.       (d) State Licensing Law Requirements.--For purposes of this      section, the law in effect in a State meets the requirements      of this subsection if the Secretary determines the law      satisfies the following minimum requirements:       (1) A State loan originator supervisory authority is      maintained to provide effective supervision and enforcement      of such law, including the suspension, termination, or      nonrenewal of a license for a violation of State or Federal      law.       (2) The State loan originator supervisory authority ensures      that all State-licensed loan originators operating in the      State are registered with Nationwide Mortgage Licensing      System and Registry.       (3) The State loan originator supervisory authority is      required to regularly report violations of such law, as well      as enforcement actions and other relevant information, to the      Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.       (e) Temporary Extension of Period.--The Secretary may      extend, by not more than 12 months, the 1-year or 2-year      period, as the case may be, referred to in subsection (a) for      the licensing of loan originators in any State under a State      licensing law that meets the requirements of sections 5 and 6      and subsection (d) if the Secretary determines that such      State is making a good faith effort to establish a State      licensing law that meets such requirements, license mortgage      originators under such law, and register such originators      with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.       (f) Limitation on HUD-Licensed Loan Originators.--Any loan      originator who is licensed by the Secretary under a system      established under this section for any State may not use such      license to originate loans in any other State.       (g) Contracting Authority.--The Secretary may enter into      contracts with qualified independent parties, as necessary to      efficiently fulfill the obligations of the Secretary under      this Section.     SEC. 9. BACKUP AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A NATIONWIDE MORTGAGE                    LICENSING AND REGISTRY SYSTEM.       If at any time the Secretary determines that the Nationwide      Mortgage Licensing System and Registry is failing to meet the      requirements and purposes of this Act for a comprehensive      licensing, supervisory, and tracking system for loan      originators, the Secretary shall establish and maintain such      a system to carry out the purposes of this Act and the      effective registration and regulation of loan originators.     SEC. 10. FEES.       The Federal banking agencies, the Secretary, and the      Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry may charge      reasonable fees to cover the costs of maintaining and      providing access to information from the Nationwide Mortgage      Licensing System and Registry, to the extent that such fees      are not charged to consumers for access to such system and      registry.     SEC. 11. BACKGROUND CHECKS OF LOAN ORIGINATORS.       (a) Access to Records.--Notwithstanding any other provision      of law, in providing identification and processing functions,      the Attorney General shall provide access to all criminal      history information to the appropriate State officials      responsible for regulating State-licensed loan originators to      the extent criminal history background checks are required      under the laws of the State for the licensing of such loan      originators.       (b) Agent.--For the purposes of this section and in order      to reduce the points of contact which the Federal Bureau of      Investigation may have to maintain for purposes of subsection      (a), the Conference of State Bank Supervisors or a wholly      owned subsidiary may be used as a channeling agent of the      States for requesting and distributing information between      the Department of Justice and the appropriate State agencies.     SEC. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION.       (a) System Confidentiality.--Except as otherwise provided      in this section, any requirement under Federal or State law      regarding the privacy or confidentiality of any information      or material provided to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing      System and Registry or a system established by the Secretary      under section 9, and any privilege     arising under Federal or State law (including the rules of      any Federal or State court) with respect to such information      or material, shall continue to apply to such information or      material after the information or material has been disclosed      to the system. Such information and material may be shared      with all State and Federal regulatory officials with mortgage      industry oversight authority without the loss of privilege or      the loss of confidentiality protections provided by Federal      and State laws.       (b) Nonapplicability of Certain Requirements.--Information      or material that is subject to a privilege or confidentiality      under subsection (a) shall not be subject to--       (1) disclosure under any Federal or State law governing the      disclosure to the public of information held by an officer or      an agency of the Federal Government or the respective State;      or       (2) subpoena or discovery, or admission into evidence, in      any private civil action or administrative process, unless      with respect to any privilege held by the Nationwide Mortgage      Licensing System and Registry or the Secretary with respect      to such information or material, the person to whom such      information or material pertains waives, in whole or in part,      in the discretion of such person, that privilege.       (c) Coordination With Other Law.--Any State law, including      any State open record law, relating to the disclosure of      confidential supervisory information or any information or      material described in subsection (a) that is inconsistent      with subsection (a) shall be superseded by the requirements      of such provision to the extent State law provides less      confidentiality or a weaker privilege.       (d) Public Access to Information.--This section shall not      apply with respect to the information or material relating to      the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated      disciplinary and enforcement actions against, loan      originators that is included in Nationwide Mortgage Licensing      System and Registry for access by the public.

The Secretary, any State official or agency, any Federal      banking agency, or any organization serving as the      administrator of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and      Registry or a system established by the Secretary under      section 9, or any officer or employee of any such entity,      shall not be subject to any civil action or proceeding for      monetary damages by reason of the good-faith action or      omission of any officer or employee of any such entity, while      acting within the scope of office or employment, relating to      the collection, furnishing, or dissemination of information      concerning persons who are loan originators or are applying      for licensing or registration as loan originators.     SEC. 14. ENFORCEMENT UNDER HUD BACKUP LICENSING SYSTEM.

(b) Examination Authority.--       (1) In general.--If the Secretary establishes a licensing      system under section 8 for any State, the Secretary shall      appoint examiners for the purposes of administering such      section.       (2) Power to examine.--Any examiner appointed under      paragraph (1) shall have power, on behalf of the Secretary,      to make any examination of any loan originator operating in      any State which is subject to a licensing system established      by the Secretary under section 8 whenever the Secretary      determines an examination of any loan originator is necessary      to determine the compliance by the originator with this Act.       (3) Report of examination.--Each examiner appointed under      paragraph (1) shall make a full and detailed report of      examination of any loan originator examined to the Secretary.       (4) Administration of oaths and affirmations; evidence.--In      connection with examinations of loan originators operating in      any State which is subject to a licensing system established      by the Secretary under section 8, or with other types of      investigations to determine compliance with applicable law      and regulations, the Secretary and examiners appointed by the      Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations and examine      and take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter      in respect to the affairs of any such loan originator.       (5) Assessments.--The cost of conducting any examination of      any loan originator operating in any State which is subject      to a licensing system established by the Secretary under      section 8 shall be assessed by the Secretary against the loan      originator to meet the Secretary's expenses in carrying out      such examination.       (c) Cease and Desist Proceeding.--       (1) Authority of secretary.--If the Secretary finds, after      notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is      violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision      of this Act, or any regulation thereunder, with respect to a      State which is subject to a licensing system established by      the Secretary under section 8, the Secretary may publish such      findings and enter an order requiring such person, and any      other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the      violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or      should have known would contribute to such violation, to      cease and desist from committing or causing such violation      and any future violation of the same provision, rule, or      regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a person      to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation,      require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect      compliance, with such provision or regulation, upon such      terms and conditions and within such time as the Secretary      may specify in such order. Any such order may, as the      Secretary deems appropriate, require future compliance or      steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for      such period of time as the Secretary may specify, with such      provision or regulation with respect to any loan originator.       (2) Hearing.--The notice instituting proceedings pursuant      to paragraph (1) shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30      days nor later than 60 days after service of the notice      unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Secretary      with the consent of any respondent so served.       (3) Temporary order.--Whenever the Secretary determines      that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified      in the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to paragraph      (1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in      significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant      harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the public interest      prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Secretary may      enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to cease and      desist from the violation or threatened violation and to take      such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation      and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets,      significant harm to consumers, or substantial harm to the      public interest as the Secretary deems appropriate pending      completion of such proceedings. Such an order shall be      entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing,      unless the Secretary determines that notice and hearing prior      to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public      interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon      service upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited,      or suspended by the Secretary or a court of competent      jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending      the completion of the proceedings.       (4) Review of temporary orders.--       (A) Review by secretary.--At any time after the respondent      has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order      pursuant to paragraph (3), the respondent may apply to the      Secretary to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended.      If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-     desist order entered without a prior hearing before the      Secretary, the respondent may, within 10 days after the date      on which the order was served, request a hearing on such      application and the Secretary shall hold a hearing and render      a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.       (B) Judicial review.--Within--       (i) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a      temporary cease-and-desist order entered with a prior hearing      before the Secretary; or       (ii) 10 days after the Secretary renders a decision on an      application and hearing under paragraph (1), with respect to      any temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior      hearing before the Secretary,     the respondent may apply to the United States district court      for the district in which the respondent resides or has its      principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia,      for an order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the      effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court      shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent      served with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered      without a prior hearing before the Secretary may not apply to      the court except after hearing and decision by the Secretary      on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A).       (C) No automatic stay of temporary order.--The commencement      of proceedings under subparagraph (B) shall not, unless      specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the      Secretary's order.       (5) Authority of the secretary to prohibit persons from      serving as loan originators.--In any cease-and-desist      proceeding under paragraph (1), the Secretary may issue an      order to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and      permanently or for such period of time as the Secretary shall      determine, any person who has violated this Act or      regulations thereunder, from acting as a loan originator if      the conduct of that person demonstrates unfitness to serve as      a loan originator.       (d) Authority of the Secretary To Assess Money Penalties.--       (1) In general.--The Secretary may impose a civil penalty      on a loan originator operating in any State which is subject      to licensing system established by the Secretary under      section 8, if the Secretary finds, on the record after notice      and opportunity for hearing, that such loan originator has      violated or failed to comply with any requirement of     this Act or any regulation prescribed by the Secretary under      this Act or order issued under subsection (c).       (2) Maximum amount of penalty.--The maximum amount of      penalty for each act or omission described in paragraph (1)      shall be $5,000 for each day the violation continues.     SEC. 15. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.       Nothing in this Act may be construed to preempt the law of      any State, to the extent that such State law provides greater      protection to consumers than is provided under this Act.     SEC. 16. REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS.       (a) Annual Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the date      of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the      Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the      effectiveness of the provisions of this Act, including      legislative recommendations, if any, for strengthening      consumer protections, enhancing examination standards, and      streamlining communication between all stakeholders involved      in residential mortgage loan origination and processing.       (b) Legislative Recommendations.--Not later than 6 months      after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall      make recommendations to Congress on legislative reforms to      the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, that the      Secretary deems appropriate to promote more transparent      disclosures, allowing consumers to better shop and compare      mortgage loan terms and settlement costs.     SEC. 17. STUDY AND REPORTS ON DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES.       (a) Study Required.--The Secretary shall conduct an      extensive study of the root causes of default and foreclosure      of home loans, using as much empirical data as is available.       (b) Preliminary Report to Congress.--Not later than 6      months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary      shall submit to Congress a preliminary report regarding the      study required by this section.       (c) Final Report to Congress.--Not later than 12 months      after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall      submit to Congress a final report regarding the results of      the study required by this section, which shall include any      recommended legislation relating to the study, and      recommendations for best practices and for a process to      provide targeted assistance to populations with the highest      risk of potential default or foreclosure.                                 ______                                       By
