President, I am not going to take much time. I certainly hope the Senator from Minnesota did not cut his remarks short because he certainly is articulating something in which we are all very interested. I would do what I could to protect his rights to get a vote if he needed a vote, the same as I ask my rights be protected to either get a vote or to object to a unanimous consent request, which I have been doing with regularity in the last few days.
