Speaker, there are some seeds for potential bipartisan agreement. We do need to reauthorize, update, and improve Endangered Species Act. I think there is some fair consensus on that. But we also do not want to go to a time where we have the next passenger pigeon, for instance, where we extirpate a species forever. That is a long time. I wore my eagle tie today in the hope that we will continue to protect the bald eagle, the symbol of our country.  There are some serious problems with the bill that was unveiled last week, hastily pushed through the Committee on Resources, and further changed last evening by a manager's amendment which few have seen. Among them, and one that has to give pause to this body as we wrestle with how we are going to pay for Hurricane Katrina and other essential things here, and how much money is being borrowed in the name of future generations, is a section regarding compensation.  Now, I had hoped to offer an amendment to say that we would compensate people for foregoing the usual historic and accustomed use. If you grow timber and you cannot cut the trees, you get compensated for the trees. If you ranch and you cannot graze the cattle, you get paid the value of the area on which you cannot graze your cattle. If you grew a crop and there is some sort of restriction and you cannot grow that crop, then you would be compensated.  But the bill goes so far beyond that, it is extraordinary. It goes to speculative, proposed, possible, potential use. This is going to create a wonderful new market for speculators. If people across America thought that this was going to become law as written, which it will not, it will be changed dramatically after the Senate acts, if they do act, they would be out right now purchasing, on a speculative basis, or getting options on property that in any way was restricted by the Endangered Species Act. Because they could say, well, it is true that was a tree farm, but actually I was going to build a destination resort on that tree farm. And my destination resort would have provided me with a profit of $1 million a year for the next 30 years. Please pay me $30 million. And the government has 180 days to come up with that money.  Now, there is a low-ball estimate for this new entitlement, and who knows how they came up with it, but they are saying, oh, no, it will only be $5 million to $10 million a year. Come on, only $5 million to $10 million a year? This is going to be hundreds of millions, if not billions a year of a new entitlement. And, remember, the compensation is in an amount no less than the fair market value.                              {time}  1045  So taxpayers are going to be obligated to borrow money for speculative, possible potential future profits, and maybe even a little on top of that because the Secretary cannot compensate less than the fair market value. It does not say that the Secretary is restricted to the fair market value; if the Secretary feels generous, borrow more money and pay more than the fair market value. It is binding only on the Secretary as I understand in the new manager's amendment.  So the taxpayers are on the hook; but if the property owner says my speculative value was $2 million profit a year for the next 30 years, then that person could go to court. But the government could not go to court to say wait a minute, this is crazy, you really were not going to make $2 million a year on a destination resort on that tree farm. We will compensate you for the loss of harvest of the trees, but we are not going to pay for that speculative value.  I cannot believe that any Member of this House is going to open the doors to the Treasury so wide for potential speculation. That is not compensating landowners for usual, historic, and customary use. If that amendment had been allowed, I think many more Members could support this bill; but that amendment was not allowed here in the House of Representatives today.  There will be only one substitute and a manager's amendment, no other amendments are allowed. This is a perfect bill. After all, it was just introduced last week. It had no hearings. It was marked up one day in committee, and now it has been changed further by a manager's amendment last night which no one has seen. It is a perfect bill, and no amendment should be allowed here on the floor, but we are going to put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars.
