 President, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, this afternoon I would like to discuss an issue of very serious concern to tens of millions of Americans; that is, the Republican effort to cut Social Security disability insurance benefits and perhaps benefits for Social Security retirees. In my view and in the view of seniors throughout the State of Vermont, this is a very bad idea.  As you know, on the very first day of the new Congress, House Republicans passed a rule--later adopted by the full House--which would prevent the common practice of rebalancing funds from the Social Security retirement program to the Social Security disability program. This rule adopted by the Republicans in the House would lay the groundwork for a 19-percent cut in disability benefits next year.  President Obama, in his budget, did exactly what has been done on 11 separate occasions in the past, always--and here is the point I want to make time and time again and why this is a manufactured crisis--this has been done 11 times in the past, always in a noncontroversial way, and that is to rebalance the funds between the two programs. This is not a big deal. The Republicans are manufacturing a crisis where none exists. Time and time again, Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, with absolutely no controversy, have done what President Obama has proposed. This was done in 1968 under President Johnson; in 1970 under President Nixon; in 1978, 1979, and 1980 under President Carter; in 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1987 under President Ronald Reagan; in 1994, 1996, 1997, 2000, and beyond under President Bill Clinton. In other words, this is a totally noncontroversial process that has been done time and time again under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents.  What the President is suggesting today is that we reallocate funds from the senior retirement fund to the disability fund. But interestingly enough, of the 11 times the funds were reallocated, it turns out that on five occasions it was money going from the disability fund to temporarily help out the retirement fund.  There are some people who sadly are trying to divide the senior population from the disability population. What they are saying in a way that is untruthful and unfair is that by reallocating money into the disability fund, we are taking funding away from seniors and the retirement fund. This is absolutely untrue because, as I have indicated, on 11 occasions we have seen this reallocation, and sometimes, in fact, it comes from the disability fund to help the retirement fund.  I am very happy to tell you that virtually every senior organization in America--organizations representing tens of millions of senior citizens--has made it clear that we must reallocate funds, we must prevent a cut in disability benefits, and we must do what has been done time and time again.  Let me briefly read a letter from the AARP. The AARP is the largest senior organization in America. This letter was written on July 22, 2014. It went to chairman Ron Wyden and ranking member Orrin Hatch of the Finance Committee. What the letter says:       As the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization      representing the interests of Americans age 50 and older and      their families, we write in advance of the Committee's      legislative hearing on the Social Security Disability      Insurance program (SSDI) to express our support for Social      Security, including its disability insurance functions, and      our support of rebalancing payroll taxes to ensure the earned      benefits of 11 million disabled Americans and their families      are not reduced or put at risk.  Once again, AARP: We ``support the rebalancing of payroll taxes to ensure the earned benefits of 11 million disabled Americans and their families are not reduced or put at risk.''  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         AARP,                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2014.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch: As the largest      nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing the      interests of Americans age 50 and older and their families,      we write in advance of the Committee's legislative hearing on      the Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) to      express our support for Social Security, including its      disability insurance functions, and our support of      rebalancing payroll taxes to ensure the earned benefits of 11      million disabled Americans and their families are not reduced      or put at risk. AARP recognizes the need to address the      overall funding shortfall     facing Social Security in the next 20 years, and we stand      ready to engage with Congress, our members and other      Americans on ways to strengthen Social Security, now and in      the future. But, we also recognize that without rebalancing      in the near-term, SSDI beneficiaries are at risk of      significant benefit cuts. This is of particular concern to      older workers who are most likely to rely heavily on SSDI in      part because of higher rates of chronic illness and      disability at older ages.       Income support in the event of a disability is a critical      lifeline for millions of American families. Congress wisely      added disability insurance protection to the Social Security      system in 1956, under President Eisenhower, and has since      then modified and improved the program many times. It should      be noted that since the creation of the SSDI program in 1956,      the United States workforce has more than doubled from 62      million to over 140 million workers, and women today      represent half of the workforce and almost half of the SSDI      beneficiaries.       By law, Social Security maintains two trust funds--the Old-     Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the Disability      Insurance (DI) trust funds--and they operate independently.      Congress has faced shortfalls in both the OASI and DI trust      funds many times in the past. Most recently, in 1994,      Congress rebalanced the allocation of Social Security payroll      taxes between the OASI trust and the DI trust, estimating the      rebalancing would adequately fund SSDI benefits for      approximately 20 years. Congress forecast accurately, as the      Social Security Trustees estimate that the payroll taxes      allocated to the Disability Insurance trust fund will cease      being adequate to pay full benefits in late 2016. After that,      according to the Social Security Actuaries as of 2013,      ``[p]rojected revenue from non-interest income specified for      the DI program is sufficient to support 80 percent of program      cost after trust fund depletion in 2016, increasing slightly      to 81% of program cost in 2087.'' CBO maintains similar      projections.       Many experts, including the Congressional Budget Office,      have estimated the shortfall is largely due to: 1) general      population growth, 2) women's entrance into the labor force      and consequent eligibility for SSDI benefits, 3) the increase      in the Social Security normal retirement age from 65 to 67,      and 4) the aging of the Baby Boom population leading to a      higher percentage of older people vulnerable to illness and      disability. All of these factors also contribute to other      challenges in the SSDI program.       One of the most significant challenges facing the SSDI      program is the unacceptably long delay in processing      applications of disabled workers who have earned the right to      their benefits. A large and growing backlog both at the      initial claims and appeals level has caused lengthy delays      and imposes severe hardships on disabled workers and their      families. AARP has long urged an increase in funding to meet      the increase in the administrative workload. We also      recognize that the SSDI program needs greater program      integrity efforts both over initial eligibility approvals and      continuing disability reviews. AARP has been among the      staunchest advocates requesting program integrity funding; we      regret that in recent years this funding has been cut,      reducing the Social Security Administration's ability to      maximize integrity efforts.       The Committee's upcoming hearing is a welcome opportunity      to examine the resources that will be needed to ensure the      continuing success of the SSDI program. We believe SSDI      program reforms and improvements can be identified that would      both improve the fairness of the process for disabled      claimants and encourage greater work participation for those      who have limited ability to work. We support and will      continue to urge that Congress provide adequate resources for      the Social Security Administration to conduct timely initial      and continuing disability reviews. But, the highest priority      in the near term is to ensure that SSDI beneficiaries--most      of whom are older Americans--are not at risk of a 20% benefit      cut in the very near future. To prevent any imminent      reductions in SSDI benefits, we urge you to rebalance the      allocation of Social Security payroll taxes between the OASI      trust and the DI trust, as Congress has done with success in      the past.       Because of SSDI, millions of disabled Americans are able to      live their lives with dignity and support their families. We      look forward to continuing to work with you and the other      members of the Committee to ensure that all aspects of the      Social Security program remain strong for future generations      of American workers and their families.
