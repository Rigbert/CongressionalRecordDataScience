President, I want to make clear how extensive the efforts have been on the part of Senator Smith and myself to work with the Senator from Arizona, to work with all of our colleagues on this issue. We have tried again and again. The distinguished Senator----  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? Has the Senator ever said a word directly to me about his amendment?
