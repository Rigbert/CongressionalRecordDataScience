We are talking about extraordinarily difficult, technical issues under the best of circumstances. While I respect the majority leader, to just be told we will have plenty of time to read it, what I can say--coming on top of the fact that we didn't have a single hearing on the actual legislation, nothing with regard to specifics--I think on this side of the aisle we have a right to some sense of when we will actually be able to see this. It strikes me as a reasonable and pretty straightforward request, given the fact that the American people have been kept in the dark about this for so long.  So, again, I respectfully ask the majority leader: When will it be possible to see the full text of this bill?  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Oregon, there were 4 days of hearings on the bill in committee with the committee report sent out at least 2 weeks ago. I am totally confident our friends on the other side are fully familiar with almost all aspects of this. He will certainly have an opportunity to read the final version, but he is very familiar with the various parts of this.
