President, let me say one last time that we can ban landmines. We can ban landmines certainly within this century. We can ban them if the most powerful nation on Earth, the United States, takes the leadership role that it must in this. If we do what so many other countries have already done, and if we, instead of following them, step out ahead of them, we can ban these landmines once and for all. If we do, our men and women, when sent into harm's way, will be safer. Our humanitarian workers will be safer, and millions of children and innocent civilians around the world will become safer.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 1996]                  An Open Letter to President Clinton       Dear Mr. President: We understand that you have announced a      United States goal of the eventual elimination of      antipersonnel landmines. We take this to mean that you      support a permanent and total international ban on the      production, stockpiling, sale and use of this weapon.       We view such a ban as not only humane, but also militarily      responsible.       The rationale for opposing antipersonnel landmines is that      they are in a category similar to poison gas; they are hard      to control and often have unintended harmful consequences      (sometimes even for those who employ them). In addition, they      are insidious in that their indiscriminate effects persist      long after hostilities have ceased, continuing to cause      casualties among innocent people, especially farmers and      children.       We understand that: there are 100 million landmines      deployed in the world. Their presence makes normal life      impossible in scores of nations. It will take decades of      slow, dangerous and painstaking work to remove these mines.      The cost in dollars and human lives will be immense. Seventy      people will be killed or maimed today, 500 this week, more      than 2,000 this month, and more than 26,000 this year,      because of landmines.       Given the wide range of weaponry available to military      forces today, antipersonnel landmines are not essential.      Thus, banning them would not undermine the military      effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of other      nations.       The proposed ban on antipersonnel landmines does not affect      antitank mines, nor does it ban such normally command-     detonated weapons as Claymore ``mines,'' leaving unimpaired      the use of those undeniably militarily useful weapons.       Nor is the ban on antipersonnel landmines a slippery slope      that would open the way to efforts to ban additional      categories of weapons, since these mines are unique in their      indiscriminate, harmful residual potential.       We agree with and endorse these views, and conclude that      you as Commander-in-Chief could responsibly take the lead in      efforts to achieve a total and permanent international ban on      the production, stockpiling, sale and use of antipersonnel      landmines. We strongly urge that you do so.         General David Jones (USAF; ret.), former Chairman, Joint            Chiefs of Staff;         General John R.
