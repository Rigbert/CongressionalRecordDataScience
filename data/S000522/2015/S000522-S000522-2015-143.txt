Mr. Speaker, at a time when the administration seems keen to reach a nuclear accord that relies on trust in the Iranian regime and perhaps even a de facto collaboration in the fight against ISIS, it is wise to consider and scrutinize the dismal human rights record of this country with which we are currently conducting negotiations based on good faith. How they treat their own people is illustrative of how they see and will treat outsiders. A hearing I convened yesterday provided a critical examination of human rights in Iran--which is important and necessary in its own right--and also placed it in the context of the administration's efforts to partner with this regime on critical issues.   According to a report by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, between July 2013 and June 2014, at least 852 people were executed in Iran. Shockingly, some of those executed were children under the age of 18. Iranian human rights activists place the number of people executed by the Iranian regime at 1,181.   The current Department of State human rights report states that Iranian human rights violations include disappearances; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, including judicially sanctioned amputation and flogging; rape, politically motivated violence and repression, harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities, with instances of deaths in custody; arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention, sometimes incommunicado.   While the Iranian constitution grants equal rights to all ethnic minorities and allows for minority languages to be used in the media and in schools, minorities do not enjoy equal rights, and the regime consistently denies their right to use their languages in school. In addition, a 1985 law, the Gozinesh (selection) law, prohibits non-Shia ethnic minorities from fully participating in civic life. That law and its associated provisions make full access to employment, education, and other areas conditional on devotion to the Islamic Republic and the tenets of Shia Islam.   The regime disproportionately targets minority groups, including Kurds, Arabs, Azeris, and Baluchis for arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, and physical abuse. These groups report political and socioeconomic discrimination, particularly in their access to economic aid, business licenses, university admissions, permission to publish books, and housing and land rights.   Because of severe religious freedom abuses, our Government has designated Iran as a Country of Particular Concern since 1999. The frequent arrest and harassment of members of religious minorities has continued, following a significant increase in 2012. The government severely restricts religious freedom, and there have been reports of imprisonment, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination based on religious beliefs. There have been continued reports of the government charging religious and ethnic minorities with ``enmity against God,'' ``anti-Islamic propaganda,'' or vague national security crimes for their religious activities. Those reportedly arrested on religious grounds faced poor prison conditions and treatment, as with most prisoners of conscience.   One of those imprisoned on religious grounds is Pastor Saeed Abedini, a U.S. citizen and father of two--Rebekkah Grace and Jacob Cyrus--and a Christian imprisoned in Iran because of his faith. Pastor Abedini was imprisoned by the Iranian regime nearly 1,000 days ago, when members of the Revolutionary Guard pulled him off of a bus and placed him under house arrest. He was later taken away--in chains--to Evin Prison, where he has endured periods of solitary confinement, beatings, internal bleeding, death threats, and continued psychological torture, all because he would not deny his Christian faith.   What was Pastor Abedini's crime? According to the court, he was a threat to the security of Iran because of his leadership role in Christian churches in 2000-2005. President Obama promised Pastor Abedini's son Jacob that he would do all he can to gain his father's release by the boy's birthday next month. Earlier this week, Secretary of State John Kerry, in answer to my question on this matter, said the administration was working quietly to gain Pastor Abedini's release as soon as possible. Let's hope.   Meanwhile, Iran is repeatedly cited for virtually unrelenting repression of the Baha'i community, which Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views as a heretical sect. Baha'i number about 300,000-350,000. At least 30 Baha'is remain imprisoned, and 60 were arrested in 2012. A February 2013 UN report said in that 110 Baha'is were in jail, with 133 more expected to start serving jail time. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the regime has executed more than 200 Baha'is. The regime frequently prevents many Baha'is from leaving the country, harasses and persecutes them, and generally disregards their property rights. Iranian regime officials reportedly offer Baha'is relief from mistreatment in exchange for recanting their religious affiliation.   Iranian courts offer no recourse to the monstrous violation of human rights because without an independent judiciary, Iranians (and foreigners tried in those courts) are routinely denied fair public trials, sometimes resulting in executions without due process. This also results in ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies and allows arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence.   This is the regime the administration trusts to make agreements and honor them. I call on the administration to do more than acknowledge these facts--it must take more seriously the blatant disregard of the rights of people and factor this into any interactions we have with this predatory regime. How can we make any binding agreement with such a dishonorable regime? That question remains to be answered.                          ____________________
