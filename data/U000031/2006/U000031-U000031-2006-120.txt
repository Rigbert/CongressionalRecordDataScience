Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 150th anniversary of the founding of a storied community in Southwest Michigan, Chikaming Township. This Saturday, members of the community will come together to celebrate the township's sesquicentennial.  The earliest known residents of Chikaming Township were the Miami Indians, who were first encountered by the European explorer, Father Jaques Marquette, in 1675. By the early 1820s the land was ceded to the U.S. Government and Chikaming was formally established on March 6, 1856. The first pioneers to settle there were lumbermen who harvested trees that were used to build the piers that extend out into Lake Michigan--a source of great pride for all Michiganders who reside on the lakeshore. As time passed, the first of many successful farmers and growers in Southwest Michigan took advantage of the soil and climate of Chikaming by harvesting a variety of fruits and vegetables. The magnificent weather and scenic beauty of the land attracted families to vacation on the lake's shores and continues to be a popular summer escape today.  Chikaming Township has also long been an important center of commerce for Southwest Michigan. Forestry and agriculture are only two of the many industries that have strengthened Southwest Michigan's economy. The beautiful beaches and friendly residents have been bringing generations back to the township for years.  I would like to congratulate the residents of Chikaming on their sesquicentennial. Know that your vital community will continue to be a blessing and an asset to our comer of Southwest Michigan for many years to come.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1478]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO CHIKAMING TOWNSHIP                                 ______                                                             HON.
