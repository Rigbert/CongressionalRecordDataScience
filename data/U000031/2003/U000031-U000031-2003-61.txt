Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1320) to amend the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to facilitate the reallocation of spectrum from governmental to commercial users, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1320       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Spectrum      Enhancement Act''.     SEC. 2. RELOCATION OF ELIGIBLE FEDERAL ENTITIES FOR THE                    REALLOCATION OF SPECTRUM FOR COMMERCIAL                    PURPOSES.       Section 113(g) of the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C.      923(g)) is amended by striking paragraphs (1) through (3) and      inserting the following:--       ``(1) Eligible federal entities.--Any Federal entity that      operates a Federal Government station assigned to a band of      frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and that incurs      relocation costs because of the reallocation of frequencies      from Federal use to non-Federal use shall receive payment for      such costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance      with section 118 of this Act. For purposes of this paragraph,      Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) that      choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for      reallocation pursuant to subsection (a), are eligible to      receive payment under this paragraph.       ``(2) Eligible frequencies.--The bands of eligible      frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:       ``(A) the 216-220 megahertz band, the 1432-1435 megahertz      band, the 1710-1755 megahertz band, and the 2385-2390      megahertz band of frequencies; and       ``(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from      Federal use to non-Federal use after January 1, 2003, that is      assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of      the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), except for      bands of frequencies previously identified by the National      Telecommunications and Information Administration in the      Spectrum Reallocation Final Report, NTIA Special Publication      95-32 (1995).       ``(3) Definition of relocation costs.--For purposes of this      subsection, the term `relocation costs' means the costs      incurred by a Federal entity to achieve comparable capability      of systems, regardless of whether that capability is achieved      by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing      an alternative technology. Such costs include--       ``(A) the costs of any modification or replacement of      equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training      costs, or regulations that are attributable to relocation;       ``(B) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software,      site acquisition and construction costs, as well as any      legitimate and prudent transaction expense, including outside      consultants, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the      Federal entity that are attributable to relocation, including      increased recurring costs associated with the replacement      facilities;       ``(C) the costs of engineering studies, economic analyses,      or other expenses reasonably incurred in calculating the      estimated relocation costs that are provided to the      Commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection;       ``(D) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment      reasonably necessary to accommodate commercial use of such      frequencies prior to the termination of the Federal entity's      primary allocation or protected status, when the eligible      frequencies as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection      are made available for private sector uses by competitive      bidding and a Federal entity retains primary allocation or      protected status in those frequencies for a period of time      after the completion of the competitive bidding process; and       ``(E) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement      of systems and equipment if such acceleration is necessary to      ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency      assignment.       ``(4) Notice to commission of estimated relocation costs.--       ``(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18      months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible      frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior      to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf      of the Federal entities and after review by the Office of      Management and Budget, shall notify the Commission of      estimated relocation costs and timelines for such relocation.       ``(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA      shall provide such entity with information regarding an      alternative frequency assignment or assignments to which      their radiocommunications operations could be relocated for      purposes of calculating the estimated relocation costs and      timelines to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to      subparagraph (A).       ``(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with      national security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the      information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the      geographic location of the Federal entities' facilities or      systems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or      systems.       ``(5) Notice to congressional committees and gao.--The NTIA      shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of      relocation costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A),      submit to the Committees on Appropriations and Energy and      Commerce of the House of Representatives, the Committees on      Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of      the Senate, and the Comptroller General a copy of such      estimate and the timelines for relocation.       ``(6) Implementation of procedures.--The NTIA shall take      such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of      Federal entities' spectrum-related operations from      frequencies defined in paragraph (2) to frequencies or      facilities of comparable capability. Upon a finding by the      NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability      of systems by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by      utilizing an alternative technology, the NTIA shall terminate      the entity's authorization and notify the Commission that the      entity's relocation has been completed. The NTIA shall also      terminate such entity's authorization if the NTIA determines      that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the      timeline for relocation submitted by the Director of the      Office of Management and Budget under section      118(d)(2)(B).''.     SEC. 3. MINIMUM AUCTION RECEIPTS AND DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS.       (a) Auction Design.--Section 309(j)(3) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (D);       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (E)      and inserting ``; and''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in      section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C.      923(g)(2)), the recovery of 110 percent of estimated      relocation costs as provided to the Commission pursuant to      section 113(g)(4) of such Act.''.       (b) Special Auction Provisions for Eligible Frequencies.--     Section 309(j) of such Act is further amended by adding at      the end the following new paragraph:       ``(15) Special auction provisions for eligible      frequencies.--       ``(A) Special regulations.--The Commission shall revise the      regulations prescribed under paragraph (4)(F) of this      subsection to prescribe methods by which the total cash      proceeds from any auction of eligible frequencies described      in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and      Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C.      923(g)(2)) shall at least equal 110 percent of the total      estimated relocation costs provided to the Commission      pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.       ``(B) Conclusion of auctions contingent on minimum      proceeds.--The Commission shall not conclude any auction of      eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of such      Act if the total cash proceeds attributable to such spectrum      are less than 110 percent of the total estimated relocation      costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section      113(g)(4) of such Act. If the Commission is unable to      conclude an auction for the foregoing reason, the Commission      shall cancel the auction, return within 45 days after the      auction cancellation date any deposits from participating      bidders held in escrow, and absolve such bidders from any      obligation to the United States to bid in any subsequent      reauction of such spectrum.       ``(C) Authority to issue prior to deauthorization.--In any      auction conducted under the regulations required by      subparagraph (A), the Commission may grant a license assigned      for the use of eligible frequencies prior to the termination      of an eligible Federal entity's authorization. However, the      Commission shall condition such license by requiring that the      licensee cannot cause harmful interference to such Federal      entity until such entity's authorization has been terminated      by the National Telecommunications and Information      Administration.''.       (c) Deposit of Proceeds.--Paragraph (8) of section 309(j)      of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) is      amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or subparagraph      (D)'' after ``subparagraph (B)''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(D) Disposition of cash proceeds.--Cash proceeds      attributable to the auction of any eligible frequencies      described in section 113(g)(2) of the National      Telecommunications and Information Administration      Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) shall be deposited in      the Spectrum Relocation Fund established under section 118 of      such Act, and shall be available in accordance with that      section.''.     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND AND PROCEDURES.       Part B of the National Telecommunications and Information      Administration Organization Act is amended by adding after      section 117 (47 U.S.C. 927) the following new section:     ``SEC. 118.
