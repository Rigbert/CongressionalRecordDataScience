I won't use 12\1/2\ minutes, I don't think.  Mr. Chair, I appreciate you being here tonight and the Members, knowing that we are going to debate a number of amendments and vote on final passage tomorrow morning.  We have all thanked a lot of people here, a lot of great staff, terrific staff, a lot of good Members. I am not sure anyone has actually thanked the leadership on both sides.  I want to thank John Boehner, the Speaker, not only for giving us H.R. 6, but his strong support all the way; Kevin McCarthy, our majority leader; Steve Scalise, our whip; Cathy McMorris Rodgers, our conference chair; and on the Democratic side, too, Nancy Pelosi, former Speaker, has been terrific; Steny Hoyer has been in the trenches every day on this issue, came and participated in our very first roundtable more than a year ago to see this bill move forward. It is, indeed, a bipartisan bill.  Every one of us here, as we think about the 434 of us here in the House, every one of us has taken a different path to get here. We each represent diverse districts, and despite our differences geographically and politically, whether we have an R or a D next to our name, I daresay that there is one thread that indeed binds us all.  We are all here to improve the lives of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members at home.                              {time}  1900  This is Brooke and Brielle. I am in the middle. So look at just Brooke and Brielle. They and so many of our friends, neighbors, and family members are why we are here today. These two little girls from my district in Michigan are bravely battling SMA. They are two of the brightest stars that I know.  Our 21st Century Cures effort seeks to capture just a sliver of the hope and optimism that countless patients like Brooke and Brielle exude, despite insurmountable odds.  A year and a half ago, we had an idea. We sat down, Republicans and Democrats, and it was time for Congress to do something positive to boost research and innovation and deliver real hope for more cures by expediting the approval of drugs and devices. That is what this bill does.  We traveled the country. We had probably 40 or 50 different roundtable and subcommittee hearings all over the place, and we appreciated Republican and Democratic participation. We visited with patients, researchers, innovators, and health experts from across the health spectrum. We listened, and we put pen to paper, and then we listened some more. And that is why we are here today.  There is not a single person in this Chamber or watching at home tonight who has not been touched by disease in some way, and it is about time that we actually do something about it.  So as we begin debate on this landmark bill, I can't help but think of the patients who are sitting across from their doctors right now about to get news that certainly is going to change their world.  It is not just the disease that makes them feel powerless and vulnerable. The very system designed to help them has not kept pace with scientific advances. They need the next generation of treatment and cures, but they don't have until the next generation to wait.  They aren't interested in debating why the timelines, the failure rates, the size and the costs of conducting clinical trials are at all-time highs. They know that, despite the promise of scientific breakthroughs, they can't get the therapy that might save them. That is why we need this bill.  We have all said too many early good-byes--too many--and we have seen families robbed of a parent that is never going to get to see their child's milestones, like not see them walk down the aisle, maybe not see a graduation, maybe not see a career, maybe not see them raise a family of their own, and we have seen children that are born without the gift of a future. Life is not always fair. We know that, but we have got to try and do better.  The last century and the century before it brought just remarkable medical breakthroughs. From x rays and anesthesia to pacemakers and transplants, the tools to diagnose and treat patients have been transformed over and over and over again; yet for every single disease that we defeat, every condition we cure, there are thousands more still plaguing our people. Of the 10,000 known diseases, 7,000 of which are rare, there are treatments for only 500.  The history of health innovation is indeed remarkable, but now we have got our sights set on this bill, 21st Century Cures. The bill is about making sure that our laws, regulations, and resources keep pace with scientific advances.  So what does it take to vanquish a disease? Yes, often billions of dollars, millions of hours--that is for sure--thousands of researchers, and hundreds--maybe thousands--of failed attempts can go into the development of yet just one single treatment or cure. It is daunting, it seems impossible, but still, patients like Brooke and Brielle hold out hope.  They battle through pain, transcend physical limitations, and live lives filled with joy and optimism. Our brothers and sisters, moms and dads, grandparents and friends, they all keep faith in the future, in spite of suffering. This bill, the 21st Century Cures initiative, is for them. It is for those that we lost, those who grapple with sickness today, and those who will be diagnosed tomorrow.  In this, the greatest century in the world on the greatest country on the planet, Americans deserve a system that is second to none. We can and must do better. It is about hope--hope that the burden for patients and caregivers is less tomorrow than it was yesterday--and it is about time.  So as Brooke and Brielle always say with a smile and a sparkle in their eyes, ``We can, and we will.'' The time for 21st Century Cures is now.  Please join us, Republicans and Democrats, leaders on both sides of the aisle, for the patients that we want to solve these diseases for, by supporting this bill, by working with our colleagues in the Senate, but really listening to the voices that call for us to do something well. This is it, H.R. 6. Please vote for it tomorrow.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the 21st Century CuresAct. I thank Chairman Upton and my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for all the work they've done advancing this important initiative.  For the past year and a half, we have been listening to experts and patients across the country detail how we can proactively address America's growing health care needs and areas where cures and therapies are lacking.  The single best thing we can do? Make sure that our ultimate goal should not be to provide lifelong treatment, but to find life-saving cures.  It shouldn't take 15 years and billions of dollars to maybe get a new medical innovation approved. We need to remove the unnecessary barriers between Americans and life-changing innovation.  This means prioritizing resources, cutting through red tape, and empowering scientists and researchers so they can discover, develop and deliver medical breakthroughs. 21st Century Cures does this.  I'm proud to have authored six major provisions in the Cures package. These are bills that modernize HIPAA laws, accelerate the discovery of new cures, create research consortia to treat pediatric disorders, and bring our regulatory framework into the 21st century by embracing technologies that focus on patient-specific therapies and the potential for powerful indicators, like Biomarkers.  Mr. Chair, we have a unique opportunity here today. Today we are offering hope for the millions of Americans suffering from currently incurable and untreatable diseases.  Hope for the Eastern Washington dad with ALS who just wants to see his kids grow up.  Hope for the high school student with cancer waiting for the FDA to approve a clinical trial.  This is our chance to help foster an environment where innovation is accelerated, not stifled. Where discovery and high paying jobs are here in the United States, not abroad.  This is our chance to offer the promise of real solutions to the American people.  Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues join me in taking advantage of this tremendous opportunity, and passing 21st Century Cures.
