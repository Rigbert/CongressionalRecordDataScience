McCollum), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues are once again bringing a bill to the floor in response to the terrible news coverage on their shutdown.  Now, I am very confident that every single Member of the House of Representatives supports our Guard and Reserve men and women. We all want them to receive the pay that they have earned. We could do just that really quickly by passing a clean CR to fund the entire Federal Government and put an end to this GOP shutdown. But Republican leadership isn't serious about stopping the shutdown.  We all know that this bill is not a solution. It is just a distraction. For example, this bill claims to support military pay during the shutdown. However, while this bill does provide them a paycheck, it fails to provide them the materials essential for doing their job.  Let me give you an example of a few of the things that it doesn't fund: it doesn't fund the maintenance of existing equipment, and we need that for readiness; the procurement of new equipment if something needs to be replaced in order to continue a training drill or to be fully prepared; research and development to keep the technology superiority of the U.S. forces; and then, as the ranking member pointed out, keeping the facilities and maintenance moving forward.  This bill fails to ensure that our servicemen and -women will have the equipment and other support materials that they need. It certainly won't ensure that our other Federal law enforcement at the FBI or the DEA are paid even as they continue to work to keep America safe.  Mr. Speaker, this Republican government shutdown needs to end. The entire government needs to be funded. The American people don't want the Tea Party picking winners and losers, deciding what government services are necessary.  Let's do what is right for the American people and pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the entire Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, I enter into the Record the Minnesota Air and Army National Guard Government Shutdown Impact in its entirety.MN Air and Army National Guard Government Shutdown Impact (Version 2--2                              October 2013)                            Addressed from:       Less than 15 days (short term) and       Greater than 15 days (long term).                 Federal Full-Time Staff (FTS) Impact:       Emergency Furlough--Number of Federal Personnel Impacted       Army Technicians: 701 (655 Furloughed--93.4%)       Air Force Technicians: 445 (381 Furloughed--85.6%)       Total Force Impacted: 1146 (1036 Furloughed--90.4%)       Short Term impact:       Benefits processing delayed (in processing, retirements,      return to duty) AGR and TECH       1,036 Technicians not at work and not receiving pay       General personnel actions delayed, AGR and TECH       Scheduled travel/training TDY will be cancelled       No new hires or job announcements       Leave accrual stops for technicians after 80 hours (48      already used during furlough)       Over 30 Active Duty Operational Support/Active Duty for      Special Work (ADOS/ADSW) will not report to work       Long term impact:       FTS will incur a debt for benefits       FTS personnel not attending required training courses for      positions       Delayed hiring actions will compound the turmoil of      personnel turnover       Labor relations with union and union members stressed       Personnel readiness will drop due personnel actions not      taking place       Moral of technician force is greatly diminished with      another furlough       Animosity of technician force towards the AGR force       AGRs do not receive Mid-month and subsequent pay until      furlough complete.       Bottom line for Full-Time Staff (FTS) is that very limited      personnel actions will be able to be supported and will be      greatly delayed during a furlough.       FTS Top Three Concerns:       Benefits Processing       Pay       Loss of trained FTS forces due to cancelled training     Personnel Readiness/Soldier-Airman and Family Services Impact:       Short Term Impact:       Family Programs initiatives and support efforts will be      significantly impacted due to unavailability of all      personnel.       Reduce current ability to provide deployment related      services to soldiers and family members by 62%       Reduction in our ability to provide ID cards to soldiers      and family members in select locations.       No retiree counseling services       Slowed processing for GI bill requests and issue resolution       Longer processing times for routine medical readiness      activities due to employees' taking on the responsibilities      of furloughed personnel.       Long Term Impact:       Technicians will incur a debt for benefits       FTS personnel training to be qualified in their positions       Delayed hiring actions further compound turmoil of      personnel turnover       Morale of Technician force is greatly diminished with 2nd      furlough in one year       Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) soldiers may not receive      mid-month and subsequent pay.       Units that deploy within the next two months (Oct-Nov) or      who are currently deployed will experience significant impact      on deployment and family readiness support. Yellow ribbon      events may need to be cancelled due to contracting for venue,      food or lack of child care.       Remaining Defense Travel System (DTS--travel      reimbursements) Vouchers for Soldiers and Military Families      for FY13 will be delayed for payment.       Funeral Honors Team will cease operations.       Reduced capacity in processing enlisted promotion actions       Outside agencies may have to process Federal Tuition      Assistance requests.       Potential loss of ability to deliver timely medical      readiness events across the state, reducing medical readiness      of the force.       Potential reduction in personnel readiness ratings for all      reportable units due to eroded medical readiness ratings.                           Logistics Impact:       Maintenance--All Maintenance activities in the MNNG will      cease during shutdown. All Maintenance facilities will be      closed.       Short Term impact:       Maintenance Readiness of the MNNG will decline due to      inability to repair dead-lined equipment while Dual Status      Technicians are furloughed.       Upgrades to MNNG M1A1s will be deferred until funding      resumes.       BFT/JCR Fielding--Fielding team is issuing all remaining      equipment to the USPFO effective 30 Sep 13. USPFO and J4 will      then complete the install and fielding.       Long term impact:       Blue Force Tracker upgrades will be delayed, systems will      go off line after 90 days of non use. Blue Force Tracking is      a United States military term used to denote a GPS-enabled      system that provides military commanders and forces with      location information about friendly (and despite its name,      also about hostile) military forces. If they are not synced      with the satellite once every 90 days they lose their      identity and it costs us more manpower to re-sync them.       Supply:       Short Term impact:       $54,334 of Class 1 (food) has been ordered supporting 23      units in an IDT status for the weekend of 4-6 OCT. These      orders will need to be canceled.       $8,717 for seven commercial bus requests for the weekend of      4-6 OCT canceled.       Long term impact:       An additional $16,198 in Class 1 (food) orders will be      canceled from the local vender if shutdown continues till 30      Oct.       Training:       Short Term impact:       New Equipment Training (NET) for 1/34 Armored Brigade      Combat Team will be suspended based on Inactive Duty Training      and Annual Training restrictions, suspending NET for Bradley      Fighting Vehicle Crews       Training needs to be deferred to colder weather months,      less desirable.                      Training/Operations Impact:       Short Term Impact:       Cancellation of upcoming drill weekend will cancel weapons      qualification for many units scheduled to do this at Camp      Ripley. These units will be challenged to re-schedule as      ranges are usually booked first quarter of the fiscal year.      Will be an opportunity for units to re-schedule yet in Oct      short term. Units that have Periodic Health Assessments (PHA)      and Dental events will have to re-schedule. Will negatively      impact personnel readiness.       School cancellations. We will daily be cancelling travel to      schools that start this FY. It will be case by case that we      find school seats later in the FY that troop will be able to      attend. This will be a readiness issue if it goes long term.       Long Term Impact:       Personnel readiness will begin to suffer more as we cancel      schools and medical readiness events. Begin building a larger      pool of Soldiers/Airmen that will need new schools dates and      units will begin to see a larger backlog of troops that need      periodic physicals and dental. The challenge with schools is      that some lower density schools and longer schools will have      fewer opportunities to re-schedule this FY. This becomes a      readiness issue.                  Camp Ripley Training Center Impact:       Short Term Impact:       No Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) or Technicians       Long Term Impact:       After 21 days loss of State Employees paid under the Master      Cooperative Agreement.       Operations--Section is reduced by 50% (2 Technicians, 1      State Military) resulting in reduced support to customers and      no new leases agreements.       Range Control: Reduction 55% (6 ADOS), resulting in reduced      customer support for range safety briefings, general customer      support, and response for Range Safety Checks delayed       Automated Target Systems: State Military, potentially 50%      reduction immediately. Automated Target Personnel would not      be available resulting in limited automated ranges or target      maintenance for military customers and very limited support      to state agencies with signed leases.       Air Operations: Reduction of 100% (3 Technicians and 2      ADOS), resulting in the airfield, UH-60 Simulator being      closed and no fueling operations.       Arden Hills Army Training Site: Reduction of 50% of the      full time staff, resulting in reduced support to customers      and availability.       Logistics (other than billeting which is self supporting)--     Reduction of 100% (17 Technicians), resulting in:       Supply & Services being open 2 days a week.       Housing: Limited AGR Employees will need to Inventory &      Inspect the Troop Issue Buildings when they need to be      turned-in.       Fuel Support: Retail Fuel Points will run out of fuel.       Ammo Supply Point: No ammo for military customers.       Department of Public Safety--No initial impact. After 21      days the section would reduce from 12 guards to 9 guards      resulting in reduced services and ability to man only one      gate.       Joint Visitors Bureau/Public Affairs Office--Reduction of      80% (4 Technicians and 1 ADOS), resulting in no ID Cards, no      Command or Department of the Army photos, reduced protocol      visits and public affairs/community support operations.       Signal Support--100% reduction (1 Technician), resulting in      no on site support for computers, radios, frequency      management, and other support.       Budget--100% reduction (2 Technicians), resulting in only      emergency budget issues being addressed by non-budget      personnel.       Safety--Reduction of 100% (1 Technician), resulting in all      safety issues reverting back to the state level for oversight      by the State Safety Manager.       Environmental--limited initial impact with the loss of 1      Technician. After 21 days the section would reduce 100% (9      State and 2 Contract), resulting in all Hunt Programs for      Deployed Soldiers will being cancelled at both Camp Ripley      (Dec 2-4) and AHATS (Oct 25-27) and (Dec 6-8). No Native      American Consultation meeting. (Annual Requirement NHPA) REPI      (ACUB) Report to NGB will not get completed. Annual update to      the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) will      not get completed (Annual Requirement--Sikes Act). No      Environmental Review (National Environmental Protection Act      Requirement) for Sustainment Restoration and Modernization      (SRM) and Military Construction (MILCON) projects will not      take place due to no staff available. All Conservation and      Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Projects will be      impacted.                           Air Bases Impact:       Short Term Impact:       No local flying training operations during any shutdown      period--impact on perishable flying skills       No Mission Ready Airlift or Joint Airborne Air      Transportability Training (JA/ATT)       No Aircraft Maintenance or fuel support presence capable of      preparing aircraft for response to state or national      emergency       No Air Operations Supervision, planners, or instructors to      support response to real world contingencies or training      events       Reduced to an AGR force only, there is no support for any      function beyond maintenance & protection of the facility       Long Term Impact:       Depending on duration of shutdown, aircrew members may go      non-current, non-mission ready along with instructor force      leaving unit with no local means to regenerate an operations      force (unless AMC/ANG issue training waivers)       Medical Readiness requirements, if not completed, render      members non-deployable       Impact on SORTS for any units unable to complete upgrade or      continuation training       Impact on construction projects, such as the contract for      the water line replacement, if we do not have staff to      supervise the operations       Pilot currencies become affected if the shutdown continues      for longer period. Proficiency begins to fade (depending on      experience) after a couple weeks. Additionally, the ``Ready      Aircrew Program (RAP)'' currencies are tracked on a monthly      basis. As pilot currencies expire, they will no longer be      qualified to sit alert. For that reason, we have submitted a      listing of approx. 128 essential employees that we will      require in order to maintain currency for 20 of our 29      pilots. This group will be needed if the shutdown continues      for an extended.              State/Department of Military Affairs Impact:       Number of State Personnel Impacted       State Military Employees (Short Term 2 Oct 2013): 5       State Civilian Employees (Long Term 22 Oct 2013): 131       Total Force Impacted: 136       Over the short term, the direct cost to the State of      Minnesota in lost assistance for payroll through the Master      Cooperative Agreement is just under $300,000.00 per week.      This means that the cost to simply cover the amount of      federal funding unavailable to the state for the 21 days      required per the bargaining agreements to provide notice to      our employees of a layoff will approach $1,000,000.00.       During the notification period, costs will be incurred by      the agency to manage the seniority moves that will be      generated by the layoff. Once the 21 day notification period      ends, costs to the agency will stabilize, but the services      provided by the laid off employees will not be available to      the agency or the people of Minnesota. Efficiency will be      negatively impacted as the seniority moves are made, and      employees must be trained for their new responsibilities. If      the Federal Government shutdown is resolved, then we will      need to unwind whatever management activities we initiate to      comply with the bargaining agreements, causing further      disruption to routines, negative impacts on productivity, and      morale.       If the shutdown continues over the longer term, the      Adjutant General must then decide if any of the services      provided by the employees normally supported by the master      cooperative agreement are essential to state agency      operations. If they are, then the agency will need to      determine how to fund the activities within our existing      state budget, and since we do not carry an aggressive      reserve, other agency activities will need to be cut to fund      the services deemed necessary.       Additionally, the agency will be responsible to pay the      unemployment benefit costs for all laid off state employees      for the duration of layoff.
