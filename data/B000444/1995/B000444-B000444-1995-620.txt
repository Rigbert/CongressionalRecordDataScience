 Now, let us get it like the homeowner does. Let us say a homeowner decides, I want to retire, and I am just going to leave the State of Delaware or the State of New Jersey. I want to sell all my assets and pay all my debts. OK. Well, what he or she has to do is sell the house, sell everything they own. They take everything, all their income, that year. They pay everything off. And whatever they have left means they are either in debt as they leave town on borrowed money for an Amtrak ticket or they have money in their pocket.  Now, how about if you put the State of New Jersey or any other State, or the Federal Government in the same situation.  What happens now? In order for the State of New Jersey to pay off all that it owes, that is, its bond indebtedness, in 1 year, and all that it costs to operate the State for 1 year, it has to go and take money out of the pension fund. They could, if they took all the money out, settle all their debts. But now there is no money left for my uncle when he retires.  Now, I do not call that solvency.   It may be that technically it is solvent, but it sure puts a lot of people in jeopardy.  I do not want to carry this too far except to say, look, there is nothing sacrosanct about the way this amendment is written--this main amendment is written. It makes sense to make sure we do not shift the incentive from accumulating debt on our children's backs so they have to pay interest on the debt, to denying them the ability to have any infrastructure left where they can make this country competitive.
