 If one would want to suppress the election, suppress the vote in the 2008 election, one would vote for this because this measure goes into effect January 1, 2008. It provides that everybody who votes essentially would have to have a photo ID. If you want to suppress the minority vote, the elderly vote, the poor vote, this is exactly the way to do it. I urge a ``no'' vote. Many of these people do not have driver's licenses. This amendment would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to actually carry out. It is a grant program to the States, but it goes into effect--surprise--January 1, 2008. I urge a ``no'' vote.  The pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of order pursuant to sections 305(b)(2) and 310(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
