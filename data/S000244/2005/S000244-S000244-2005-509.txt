Speaker, I noticed in the last roll call that the author of the motion to recommit voted in favor of passage of H.R. 3402. At the time he rose to offer the motion to recommit, he stated clearly that he was opposed to the bill in its present form; and during my arguments against the motion to recommit, I reminded him and other Members that in order to make a motion to recommit, one must be opposed to the bill.  This is in direct contravention of House rules and the admonition of the Speaker several months ago when the author of another motion to recommit on another bill voted in favor of the passage of the bill.  I would hope that Members would be cognizant of the rules and precedents of the House and not repeat what has just happened.                          ____________________
