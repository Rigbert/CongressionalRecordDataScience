First of all, the Senator from California was talking about the dismal record in Superfund of this administration, and the fact that not enough money has been spent. I want to suggest that there is no correlation between the money raised when they had the tax and the money spent on Superfund cleanups.  In 1996, during the Clinton administration, the tax fund was at its highest level. Yet money spent by the Clinton administration for cleanup was near a 10-year low.  To contrast that, in President Bush's 2004 budget, the money for actual cleanup is near a 10-year high, while the fund is at a low point. In fact, the 2004 request of the President is $1.38 billion, which is higher than 7 of the 8 years of the Clinton administration. So I don't think there is anything to that particular argument.  I also remind the Senator of this: When she talked about people praising the President for his environmental record, many of these people praising the President are not Republicans, they are not pundits. These are Democrats and liberals, who are giving him credit, such as Gregg Easterbrook, senior editor of the liberal New Republic magazine, as I have mentioned.  At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.
