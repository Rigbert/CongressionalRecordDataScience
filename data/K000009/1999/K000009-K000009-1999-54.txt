Speaker, I would urge Members to vote no this morning on H.R. 1907, the so-called American Inventors Protection Act of 1999. This bill is being brought up under suspension. It should be brought up under regular order. It is a very consequential bill.  Last night the bill was brought on this floor at 9:17 p.m. as the last item of business. Those who had concerns about the bill and did not even have a chance to read it were limited to 10 minutes on a bill with constitutional consequences.  This is not the bill that cleared the Committee on the Judiciary on May 26, 1999. I think our U.S. patent system deserves more than this cursory treatment by the leadership of this institution.  At stake are the constitutional rights of our inventors, intellectual property rights into the next millennium, the rights to sue that are inherent in our legal system, and in fact, the independence of the Patent Office itself.  I would urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 1907 until they have had a chance to read it. Bring it up under regular order.                          ____________________
