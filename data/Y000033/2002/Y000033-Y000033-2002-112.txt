Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for the comment that he just made. The conferees have worked really hard with the delegation from New York, including the Senate and House Members; and we have all worked together very well.  This conference report continues to recognize the tremendous human losses suffered by those businesses located in the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks, and we have included this emergency appropriation for the purpose of assisting these businesses. As stated in the joint explanatory statement of the Committee of the Conference, the conferees added $33 million to the amount provided over the initial request, and we did so expecting that that additional money would be made available specifically for helping to assist those firms located in New York City who, at the time of the terrorist attacks, suffered a disproportionate loss of their workforce and who intend to reestablish their operations in New York City.  I have discussed this issue on numerous occasions with Mr. Gargano, who serves as Governor Pataki's Chairman and CEO of New York's Empire State Development Corporation. It is our understanding that in cooperation with New York City and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the State of New York will ensure that these funds will be available for the intended purposes.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
