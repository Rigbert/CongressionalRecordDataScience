I don't know because it is not under the jurisdiction of the committee that I am privileged to chair. So I don't want to prejudge whether there is an objection from the HELP Committee or not because I don't know. I have saluted the Senator from New York for bringing a very real problem to our attention, although I wish it were on a different bill. I wish we would move the Voinovich bill separately, which has been on the calendar for a long time. I don't know that there is an objection on this side.
