In fact, just next week, across the street, the Supreme Court will take up this bill and decide whether it is constitutional. It is an important decision. It is one that will affect millions of Americans, and scarcely anyone understands the impact of this law and what it means to their daily lives.  The first aspect I wish to speak about is the most controversial aspect of it, the so-called individual mandate. What is it? From my point of view, it is a basic method of saying to everyone in America: You have a personal responsibility. You cannot say you are just not going to buy any health insurance; that you don't think you are ever going to need it and are not going to worry about it.  The problem is, of course, those people who make that statement get sick. Some of them get involved in accidents. Some go to a doctor and are diagnosed with terrible illnesses and diseases that require treatment and surgery, and that costs a lot of money. The uninsured people show up at hospitals. They are not pushed away; they are invited in. They receive the treatment. Then they can't pay for it.  It turns out that 63 percent of the medical care given to uninsured people in America isn't paid for--not by them. It turns out the rest of us pay for it. Everyone else in America who has health insurance has to pick up the cost for those who did not accept their personal responsibility to buy health insurance.  So, so what? What difference does that make? It makes a difference. It adds $1,000 a year to our health insurance program. In other words, you and me and everyone with health insurance is subsidizing those people who say: Don't mandate anything on me. Don't tell me I have a personal responsibility. But when I get sick, you can payfor it.That is what the individual mandate comes down to.  I listen to those who say, well, this is just too darn much government to say that people who can afford it need to have health insurance. Keep in mind, this health care bill says if people cannot afford it--if they are too poor or their income is limited--there is a helping hand, not only in the Tax Code but even through Medicaid to make sure they have affordable health care insurance which will never cost them more than 8 percent of their income. A lot of American families would jump at health insurance that would only cost 8 percent of their income. But the law says people have to be willing to pay up to 8 percent of their income to have health insurance. The reason, of course, is if they don't pay, everyone else pays. If they get sick, they cost us $116 billion a year in uncompensated health care coverage paid for those who do not accept their personal responsibility to buy health insurance.  Ruth Marcus has an article in this morning's Washington Post, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2012]          116 Billion Reasons To Be for the Individual Mandate                            (By Ruth Marcus)       The most compelling sentences in the Obama administration's      brief defending the constitutionality of the health-care law      come early on. ``As a class,'' the brief advises on Page 7,      ``the uninsured consumed $116 billion of health-care services      in 2008.''       On the next page, the brief drives the point home: ``In      2008, people without insurance did not pay for 63 percent of      their health-care costs.''       Those figures amount to a powerful refutation of the      argument that the individual mandate--the requirement that      individuals obtain insurance or pay a penalty--exceeds the      government's authority to regulate interstate commerce. To      me, $116 billion seems like a whole lot of commerce.       But let's leave the Supreme Court justices to hack their      way through the underbrush of the Commerce Clause. Because      those numbers are not only relevant to Commerce Clause      jurisprudence, they illuminate the fundamental irrationality      of public opposition to the individual mandate.       The mandate is by far the most unpopular feature of a law      on which Americans are otherwise evenly divided. A Kaiser      Family Foundation poll this month found that two-thirds of      those surveyed disliked the mandate. Even among Democrats, a      majority (53 percent) opposed the requirement; independents      (66 percent) and Republicans (77 percent) were even more      hostile.       Yet this is a provision that the overwhelming majority--     those with insurance--should support, for the simple reason      that these people currently end up footing the bill for much      of that $116 billion.       As the government's brief notes, ``Congress found that this      cost-shifting increases the average premium for insured      families by more than $1,000 per year.''       In other words, those worried about having to pay ever-     higher premiums should be clamoring for the individual      mandate, not agitating for repeal.       Indeed, for all the bristling over the mandate, it will be      irrelevant to the 80 percent of non-elderly Americans who      already have insurance, either through their employers,      government programs, or purchased on their own.       The biggest real-world risk to these people would be if the      court were to overturn the mandate yet allow the rest of the      health-care law to remain in place, driving premiums ever      upward.       Amazingly, Republicans have managed to transform the      mandate from an exemplar of personal responsibility into the      biggest public policy bogeyman of all time.       The irony of the fight over the mandate is that President      Obama was against it before he was for it. During the 2008      campaign, one of the signature differences between Obama and      Hillary Clinton was that Clinton's health plan included an      individual mandate whereas Obama's mandate covered only      children.       Once elected, Obama quickly recognized the inescapable      truth: An individual mandate was essential to make the plan      work. Without that larger pool of premium-payers, there is no      feasible way to require insurance companies to cover all      applicants and charge the same amount, regardless of their      heath status.       In part, hostility to the mandate reflects a broader      uneasiness with the perceived encroachment of big government.       In the Kaiser poll, 30 percent of those who opposed the      mandate cited government overreach as the biggest reason. Not      surprisingly, twice as many Republicans (40 percent) cited      that reason as did Democrats (18 percent).       But opposition to the mandate also stems from the public's      failure to understand--or, alternatively, the      administration's failure to communicate--basic facts.       For example, Kaiser found that when people were told that      most Americans ``would automatically satisfy the requirement      because they already have coverage through their employers,''      favorability toward the mandate nearly doubled, to 61      percent.       Favorable attitudes rose to nearly half when people were      told that without the mandate, insurance companies would      still be allowed to deny coverage to those who are sick; that      without the mandate people would wait until they were sick to      purchase insurance, driving up premium costs; or that those      unable to afford coverage are exempt.       ``People don't understand how the mandate works at all and      they don't understand why it's there,'' Kaiser's polling      director, Mollyann Brodie, told me.       Brodie suspects that it's too late to change minds. ``This      law as a whole has really become a symbolic issue to people      and they really aren't open to information,'' she said.       Maybe, but the administration must keep trying--not only to      sell the law's goodies but to explain how the mandate makes      them possible. Otherwise, they could end up winning the minds      of the justices, yet losing the hearts of the people whose      votes they need to keep the law in place.
