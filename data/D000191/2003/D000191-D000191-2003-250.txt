Speaker, I regret that I was forced to vote against the fiscal year 2004 VA-HUD spending bill today.  However, I could not, in good conscience, vote in favor of a bill that so clearly fails to meet the needs of our nation's veterans.  A vote in favor of this bill is a vote to maintain the status quo, a status quo that has resulted in six month waiting lists, increased out-of-pocket expenses, and limited coverage for many veterans. My vote against this bill is a signal that the status quo is totally unacceptable.  I am not alone in condemning the VA-HUD appropriations bill for its failure to meet the needs of those who selflessly served our country in the armed forces. As top officials of national veterans organizations, including AMVETS, PVA, DAV, and VFW, wrote to Congress regarding H.R. 2861, the legislation is ``wholly inadequate'' and ``represents a flagrant disregard to promises made to veterans by this Congress.''  H.R. 2861 is $2.1 billion below the level set for veterans programs in the House Republican budget resolution. While I thought the House budget resolution was itself inadequate, a lower funding level is a slap in the face to veterans. H.R. 2861 is also $3.3 billion below the levels requested by national veterans organizations. The bill includes shortfalls for medical care, medical research and construction, among other areas.  Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is about priorities. The lack of support for veterans programs in H.R. 2861 shows what happens when the President and his allies in Congress prioritize tax cuts for millionaires over adequately meeting our commitment to veterans.  I reject that prioritization, which is why I voted against this bill. My vote was in favor offully funding the benefits our veterans were promised, have earned and deserve.                          ____________________
