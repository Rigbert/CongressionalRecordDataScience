 President, I want to visit about the agricultural issue, but I have two friends from agricultural States and members of the Agriculture Committee on the other side of the aisle. I am not here to counteract anything they have said. I want to make that very clear. I want to make it clear, though, that while there is from the other side of the aisle admonitions of what we ought to do to solve the agricultural bill problem that we have before us, there are other approaches that ought to be used.  I am here to advocate a position that is not favored on the other side of the aisle. I will also bring to the attention of the agricultural community, who is concerned about this issue, that yesterday the majority party of the U.S. Senate offered a unanimous-consent motion to bring up the very provisions that were in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which the President vetoed, and if he had not vetoed that, we would not have any commodity policy problems for this Congress to settle for the next 7 years. We would not be here today talking about what ought to be done for the 1996 crop year as we get up to the very planting deadlines that are so close and are probably already in place in the State of Alabama and other areas of the South.   Every farmer of the United States would know what the policy for the next 7 years would be if the President had not vetoed that bill. Every farmer would know the amount of money that would be spent on agriculture from the U.S. Treasury over the next 7 years--that would be $43.5 billion--with $6 billion being spent in 1996. Without this legislation this money will not be spent and if the proposals from the other side of the aisle were adopted, there would not be $6 million going into agriculture in 1996. So the certainty of the money going there, it seems to me, ought to be pretty enticing to everybody on the other side of the aisle to back our proposal, plus the fact that there would be certainty in agriculture policy for the next 7 years.  Somewhat unrelated to the immediate problem we have before us but directly related to the fact that the other side is, in a sense, rejecting $6 billion going into agriculture in 1996 and rejecting the proposal of this side of the certainty of $43.5 billion going into agriculture over the next 7 years is the fact that--this may not apply to my three friends who are sitting over there from agriculture states, there are some prominent people on the other side of the aisle who have voted against past farm bills because they did not put enough money into agriculture. I am speaking specifically of the 1990 farm bill and the 1985 farm bill.  How ironic that those very same people are going to oppose what we are trying to do because somehow it puts too much money into agriculture this crop year. Is that not ironic. People on the other side of the aisle who voted against the 1990 farm bill, the 1985 farm bill because it did not put enough money into agriculture, are objecting to Republican efforts that has a farm bill that would put $6 billion into agriculture and a certainty of $43.5 billion over the next 7 years. And $43.5 billion might sound like a lot of money. But it is less than half what has been spent on agriculture in recent years. The farm bill is about the only program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that actually was cut. Most of the other programs in that Balanced Budget Act were slowing the rate of growth.  I want to move on and say it would have also given--what we proposed to do yesterday, and the very same thing that the President vetoed in December would have set a policy that every farmer in America would have the opportunity to plant according to the marketplace, not according to policy decisions made in Washington. Furthermore, every acre would be planted. I think that is a sound agricultural policy, and it was rejected by the other side yesterday.  When we are up to these planting deadlines you may not get exactly what you want, I may not get exactly what I want, but let me say this: Every major farm organization in the United States supports the Freedom To Farm Act. Every major commodity group in the United States supports what was in that bill. Yet there are some who would take the view that at this last minute that is not good enough for them. Or in some cases, ironically, it might be too much. But what is ironic about that, some of the very same people said in past years we were not doing enough for agriculture.  I will yield the floor, although I hope we can have some more discussion on this if the people want to discuss it. I think it is such an important issue that we have to proceed and we have to reach an agreement on this.                          ____________________
