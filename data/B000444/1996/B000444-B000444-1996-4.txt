 President, I rise with my friend Chairman Hatch to commend the inclusion of the Hatch-Biden child pornography bill in the omnibus continuing resolution. This bill will strengthen our ability to track down and crack down on child pornographers.  Those who produce and traffic in child pornography--who exploit the most vulnerable and innocent among us--are, by my lights, among the worst of the worst. They cause a harm that is unspeakable and a damage that is often irreparable.  Child pornography is not an art form and it is not a type of expression that we must tolerate even though we find it intolerable. To the contrary: We have an obligation--a moral obligation, in my mind--to protect our children from this type of abuse--which steals their innocence and shatters their dreams.  I consider myself an unapologetic champion of the first amendment. Yet I believe that child pornography deserves no, and I mean no, first amendment protection.  Over the years, the computer has become an increasingly powerful weapon of the child pornographer and today, technology is making it even easier for child pornographers to make and sell their wares.  What we're seeing now is this: Pornographers are taking pictures of children and morphing them, with the help of computer technology, to make it look as if the children are engaging in sexual conduct.  That means that it's not necessary, these days, to actually molest children in order to produce pornography that exploits and degrades them. All that's necessary is an inexpensive computer, some software, and a photograph of the little boy or girl down the street.  We must move right here and now to put this new generation of child pornographers behind bars.  But we must also be mindful that we live under a constitution which includes a robust Commitment to free and open speech and which necessarily tolerates what is sometimes called the speech we love to hate.  As a threshold matter, any statute that we write must pass the first amendment's test. Otherwise, it will sit on our books, unconstitutional and unenforceable, doing not one child one bit of good.  I am concerned that a provision in this bill which criminalizes the depiction of something that appears to be a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct will not pass constitutional muster.  This proposal would cover purely imaginary drawings, as well as depictions of adults who appear to be minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, like a documentary that deals with child sexual abuse, featuring a 19-year actress who looks like a very young girl.  Don't get me wrong: like many Americans, I would like for a lot of the stuff that's out there today, even it it's just a figment of someone's warped imagination, involving no actual children at all, to be banished from the face of the Earth right now and forever.  But I am not king. And it is our Constitution that still reigns supreme and whose first amendment principles will not, in my opinion, countenance this sort of broad and open-ended prohibition.  The constitutional analysis begins with the famous 1982 case of New York versus Ferber, in which the Supreme Court first recognized the child pornography exception to the first amendment. In the case, the Court pointed to a number of compelling reasons to justify a total and outright ban of this sort of material:  It causes psychological and physical harm to children used as subjects;  It creates a permanent record of sexual abuse;  It fuels the child pornography trade; and  Its artistic and social value is limited, to say the least.  At the heart of the analysis, and why the Court justified such a categorical and complete restriction on speech, is a very straightforward idea: Children who are used in the production of child pornography are victims of abuse, plain and simple. And the pornographers, also plainly and simply, are child abusers.  In the cases following Ferber, strict restrictions on child pornography are predicated on the same rationale: The creation of the pornography hurts the children who are its subjects.  That's why I am concerned that the appears to be standard, which does not in any way involve an actual child in the creation of child pornography, will not survive the inevitable constitutional challenge to this legislation.  My view is shared, among others, by Harvard professor Frederick Schauer, who was the commissioner of the now famous Meese Commission on pornography.  In testimony before our committee, Professor Schauer expressed the opinion that the appears to be standard in the bill would most probably fail the Ferber test and would therefore become a failed weapon in our crusade against pornography.  That is why I introduced an amendment to Senator Hatch's proposal, which would make it a crime to create a visual depiction that makes it look like an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct, whether or not the child ever actually engaged in the conduct.  Here's what this would mean: If a pornographer uses an image, a face or other identifying feature of an actual child, and, via computer morphing or any other means, makes it look like the child is engaging in sex, that will be a crime.  Unlike images that are completely conjured up in someone's imagination, or which employ adults who look like children, these kinds of images do cause real harm to real children:  Although the child may not have actually engaged in the sexual conduct, the image creates an apparent record of such conduct. In my book, that's abuse and that's harm, period.  These kinds of morphed images can be used to blackmail a child into engaging in sexual activity, by intimidating him, or by threatening to show the pictures to others if he doesn't comply.  Also, as the experts tell us, child pornography has a very long life as it often passes among many, many hands, thus victimizing a child who's in the picture time and again.  The definition of identifiable minor in this bill makes it clear that proof of the minor's identity is not required for the prosecution to make its case, only that the child is capable of being identified as an actual person. It also does not matter whether the person depicted is a minor at the time the depiction is created, or whether the depiction is made from a childhood image of a person who is now an adult.  I believe that my proposal is consistent with the Ferber standard with its bottom line focus on the well-being of actual children.  Do not get me wrong: I am wholly sympathetic and supportive of Senator Hatch's view that even imaginary depictions that do not involve actual children can, indeed, cause harm. This kind of stuff can be used by pedophiles to entice other children into sexual activity.  But the point is this: The act of enticement, of course, is itself a separatecrime and I think we all agree that we should throw the book at anyone who would do such an unthinkable and despicable thing.  But the Supreme Court has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to the production of the pornography itself and the constitutional line stops with the involvement of real children. And again, it is only a constitutional law, one that will be upheld and enforced, that will serve to protect our children.  In order to more gracefully bring together my proposal and Senator Hatch's, this substitute merges our two approaches into one new section to be added to the criminal code. And though I have agreed to this stylish accommodation of our two ideas, let there be no mistake:  We clearly intend that if any portion of the bill's definition of child pornography, such as the ``appears to be'' standard, is struck down as unconstitutional, the remaining provision, the prohibition on material involving an identifiable minor, will stand on its own, completely severable.  Our intention here is made crystal clear in the substitute bill's new severability clause.  I'd like to say a brief word about another aspect of this bill. It includes a number of penalties, many of which are properly tough and severe. And though I believe that we should give child pornographers no quarter, I do not think the creation of new mandatory minimums is smart sentencing policy.  One of the main problems with mandatory minimums is that they treat different types of offenders the same, which means that the really bad guys get the same punishment as the less blame worthy. For example, under the proposal added to this bill by Senator Grassley:  A person who puts out an ad seeking to buy soft core child pornography is going to get the same 10-year mandatory minimum sentence as the guy who actually employs or entices an 11 year old to make hard core, violent porn. By the same token, that person who advertises to buy child porn will get the same 10-year mandatory minimum as the parent who markets his child for child pornography.  Make no mistake about it: All these guys should get a tough sentence. But they shouldn't get the same sentence. The same sentence may be too tough for the less culpable, and not tough enough for the most culpable. That's not smart sentencing policy.  As Chief Justice Rehnquist has noted:       One of the best arguments against any more mandatory      minimums, and perhaps against some of those that we already      have, is that they frustrate the careful calibration of      sentences, from one end of the spectrum to the other.  These reservations notwithstanding, I believe that we must get on with the very important business at hand which is to stem the tide of this new generation of child phonography. We have no time to waste, and I am pleased that this bill will soon become law.  I thank my colleagues for their support.        objecting to the summary exclusion and asylum provisions
