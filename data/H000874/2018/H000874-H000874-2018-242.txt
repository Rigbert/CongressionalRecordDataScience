Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I include in the Record remarks by Raniya Madhi. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.                          March for Our Lives                           (By Raniya Madhi)       Hi everyone, my name is Raniya Mahdi, and I'm a junior at      Ridge High School in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and I'm      participating in this march to honor the lives lost at      Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where we      lost seventeen of our school companions and teachers to yet      another mass shooting in this country.       Today is March 24. Millions of people are marching for      their lives across the country to demand change so that no      student, teacher, or parent has to fear for their or their      loved ones life while they are receiving an education at      school. When I heard about this shooting, I had mixed      emotions. I was shocked, shocked, that we had to lose      seventeen more innocent kids to another senseless killing,      and yet some of us haven't even addressed this issue that is      killing our kids day after day. I was upset, upset to think      about how their families must be feeling, that they will      never get to kiss their kids goodbye ever again. They will      never ever be able to see their loved ones, maybe in another      world, but not this one. This world, this country, has made      it impossible for us to be able to feel safe in our own      schools. We should never have to think about the possibility      of being shot by someone who can easily break through our      defenseless walls and enter our school like an ordinary      person, until they whip out their AR-15 and start firing at      students and staff without a care in the world. The ones who      we lost should not have been taken away. Why did they need to      suffer because of the inaction and stagnance of our      congressmen? I thought to myself: These innocent kids came to      school, on Valentine's Day, like any normal school day, yet      they did not live to see their families and friends the next      day. This is horrifying to me, that countless school      shootings like this have happened over the years, but no      change.       Picture this: A nineteen-year-old walks into a liquor store      and lawfully be denied any sort of alcohol. Now picture how      is it that a nineteen-year-old cannot legally buy a beer but      can legally buy an AR-15 assault rifle at this age? And how      can our country allow a person to take the lives of fourteen      fellow students and three teachers? We have to unite as one      and urge our congressmen to take action. This is why we are      participating in this peaceful protest, to pressure our      congressmen, senators, representatives and the President to      make changes to the existing laws. Ban bump stocks! Ban      assault rifles! Increase background checks! We deserve to      feel safe in our schools! We may just be students, but this      kind of revolution has never happened before, where us kids      are taking the reins. Look around you. Look at how many      empowered students there are standing up here and around you.      This is what determination and unity looks like. With these      two things, we can be the generation that ends gun violence.       Most of us here are just teenagers. We should be worrying      about doing well on our AP tests and finals in the end of the      year, not about being shot by someone who can enter our      schools. There have been eighteen school shootings this year      alone, and we are only in March. This country's problem is      that we do not learn from our mistakes. In Australia, there      was a mass shooting in 1996, when a gunman killed thirty-five      people in Port Arthur. Only weeks after the tragedy,      Australia banned all rapid-fire guns and offered to buy the      remaining weapons that some individuals possessed. Since that      day, there has not been a single mass shooting. Not one in      the past twenty-two years.     Whereas America? After Columbine, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino,      Orlando, Vegas and endless others, this country remains numb      to any shootings of any kind, no matter how extreme the death      tolls are, this country has made it seem like those who died      and those who are living aren't even worth putting any sort      of restrictions on the weapon that brutally ended their lives      and a weapon that could potentially end ours if we do not do      something about it.       America needs to wake up and address the major problems      here: gun violence and school security. We cannot let more      innocent lives be taken away. Again, we may not be able to      pass legislation, but we have a voice and we are strong and      will continue to use it until something is done. Let's unite      as one and support the brave survivors in Parkland that are      speaking out for their rights and let's stand together and      fight through this hell of an uphill battle. This is not the      end of our fight, it's only the beginning.                          ____________________
