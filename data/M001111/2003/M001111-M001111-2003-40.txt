 President, I support the amendment offered by my friend from North Dakota.  I am a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation that was introduced earlier this year that would allow travel between the United States and Cuba.  Current policy with regard to Cuba, as enforced by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, permits travel to Cuba only with permission in the form of a license from the Treasury office for certain reasons such as to visits relatives, or for journalism, religious, or humanitarian purposes.  According to Treasury documents, between 1996 and 2003, about one-third of Cuba travel cases opened for investigation were referred for civil penalty enforcement action. Typical penalty assessments for unauthorized travel range from $3,000 to $7,500.  For 40 years, the United States has maintained an isolationist position toward Cuba, and the current regime has remained throughout that time. I believe that permitting travel to Cuba would help demonstrate to Cuban citizens what a democracy is all about.  Mr. President, it is time to lift the travel restrictions to Cuba.  I urge the adoption of this amendment.
