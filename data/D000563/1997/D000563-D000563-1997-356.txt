Dorgan) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:                               S. Res. 65     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--       Whereas spending on federal election campaigns has      increased to an estimated $2.65 billion in the most recent      election cycle, a three-fold increase over campaign spending      just 20 years ago, even after adjusting for inflation;       Whereas in the 1995-1996 election cycle, the Democratic      party committees raised $332 million, a 73% increase over the      $192 million raised four years earlier and the Republican      party committees raised $549 million, a 74% increase over the      $316 million they raised four years earlier;       (3) overall campaign spending for congressional races has      risen from $99 million in 1976 to $626 million in 1996, a      more than six-fold increase;       (4) since 1992, when political parties were first required      to report soft money contributions to the Federal Election      Commission, these contributions, which are raised outside      federal election law, have tripled, from $86 million in 1992      to over $263 million in the last election cycle;       (5) there has been a proliferation of negative ``issue''      ads paid for by political parties and interest groups to      influence federal elections, further increasing the cost of      campaigns;       (6) as political campaigns have become longer, costlier and      more negative, voter apathy has increased and voter      participation in presidential elections has declined from 60%      in 1948-1968, to 53% from 1972-92, to all-time low of 49% in      1996;       (7) these trends will continue if Congress fails to enact      comprehensive campaign finance reform;       (8) the more than 6,700 pages of hearing records, 49 days      of testimony before 8 different congressional committees, 15      committee reports from 6 different committees and 113 Senate      floor votes, constitute a sufficient Senate record on      campaign finance reform; and       (9) campaign finance reform has been filibustered in the      Senate 17 times in the last ten years.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that the Senate should proceed to the consideration of      comprehensive campaign finance reform that reduces spending      on political campaigns and curtails the influence of special      interest money in federal elections by no later than May 31,      1997 and adopt as a goal the final enactment of such      legislation by no later than July 4, 1997.
