Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to compliment everybody who has spoken tonight. I would just suggest again that this is tier 2; it is their money, they want to reinvest it. Yes, it is in government bonds, but it came from the workers. I thought this body was trying to set up a system where we did not take money from the workers to spend on other things. This is our retirement system. This is the railroad retirement system. It only affects tier 2.  For those people who are not on the floor tonight, I urge people watching the show to vote for this legislation. Keep in mind, this had 371 cosponsors. I expect 380 votes on this. It is the right thing to do for our railroads and our railroad workers.
