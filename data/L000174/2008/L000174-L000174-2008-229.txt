President, Marcelle and I have a good friend in Vermont named Cornelius Hogan, although everyone knows him as Con Hogan.  In our State, we have been fortunate to have people, of both political parties, who have given a great deal of themselves to serve the people of Vermont, and Con is an excellent example of that.  Recently, the newspaper the Times Argus published an excellent profile of him. I called Con and Jeanette to say how much I enjoyed it. I would like to share the piece with my fellow Senators, and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: A Life Well Served; Plainfield's Con Hogan Remininsces About Time in                           Government, Business                            (By Susan Allen)       Plainfield.--Every Thursday a 4 p.m., the late Gov. Richard      Snelling would invite some of his cabinet members to his      office and put a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon and glasses on      his desk.       ``You could talk about anything you wanted,'' recalled Con      Hogan last week, seated at the kitchen table in his      Plainfield home, with an expansive view that includes the ski      slopes of Sugarbush and Mad River Glen.       That was a new one for me. I thought I'd heard most of the      behind-the-scenes stories from past--and present--     administrations. I've been in the Vermont press that long,      and collect interesting and odd-ball recollections like some      people collect stamps. I'm fascinated by the people who      devote their lives to serving the state.       But Hogan's reminiscences during our conversation proved      how many good stories I've missed.       Hogan is retired from his extensive tenure in state      government and we started talking about how busy he is during      his so-called retirement (more on that later), but quickly      began trading accounts of political personalities. Most of      his tales were gathered during his professional journey from      serving as a guard in a prison in Annandale, N.J., to heading      Vermont's massive Human Services Agency under Snelling and      former Gov. Howard Dean.       That journey included two significant side trips: An 11-     year stint in the private sector helping International Coins      and Currency slog its way out of bankruptcy in the 1980s, and      an ``ill-thought,'' unsuccessful run for governor as an      independent against incumbent Jim Douglas and Democrat      Douglas Racine in 2002.       ``That was a period of temporary insanity,'' he said of the      gubernatorial race, which almost certainly burned some      bridges with the GOP hierarchy. ``I don't regret it, but I      don't consider it a high point.''       Hogan received a degree in psychology from Rutgers, married      wife Jeanette in 1965, and took a job as a prison guard in      Annandale, rising quickly through the ranks to eventually      serve as a division head with the New Jersey Department of      Corrections, focusing on the budget.       ``I loved it,'' he recalled of those 7 years. ``The people      who work in that line are under such professional pressure      that you become fast friends, the closest friends.''       Hogan and his wife regularly visited a good friend in      Vermont who lived on an apple farm in Bennington, and in 1972      at age 28, he applied for the job of corrections commissioner      in this State. He chuckles at his own audacity, and the      outcome.       Then-Secretary of Administration Richard Mallary (who went      on to serve in the U.S. House for Vermont) wrote Hogan a two-     page, handwritten letter thanking him for his interest,      letting him know the job was already filled, but urging him      to contact the new commissioner to talk about becoming his      deputy.       Hogan is amazed at the thought of Mallary writing such a      long, personal note. But back in 1972, he did apply for      deputy commissioner post and got the job.       Those were tumultuous years in corrections, he said. Then-     Gov. Thomas Salmon, trying to control a huge state deficit,      issued a 10 percent cut in all budgets, to be executed in      60 days--a staggering assignment, Hogan knew.       And the Windsor prison, which had opened in 1808 during the      U.S. presidential administration of Thomas Jefferson, was      closed in the early 1970s, leaving the State without a      maximum security prison for a number of years.       With Snelling's first election in 1976, Hogan moved into      the post of commissioner of Social and Rehabilitative      Services, again during a difficult time. The Weeks School for      juvenile offenders closed, forcing the State to redistribute      the 400 youth to smaller group facilities around the State.       Hogan recalled that all but 15 were placed at one point.      Those 15, he said, were sent to stay with a Vermont couple      who--without the State's knowledge--packed them all into a      Winnebago and headed off to see the country.       ``The dad called me from New Orleans,'' Hogan said. ``I      said, `What are you doing in New Orleans?' ''       Four of the young Vermonters had run off, and the state      scrambled to fix the mess. Fortunately the story ended well      for everyone and never (until now) became public, Hogan said      with a grin.       After his 11-year foray with ICC in the 1980s, Hogan once      again received a call from Snelling, who was considering a      run for governor and wanted Hogan to head his transition team      if elected. Snelling was elected and appointed Hogan his      secretary of Human Services in 1991.       ``During the transition, I was working from 6 a.m. to      midnight, staying in the office--sometimes I slept over,'' he      said. During a meeting one day, Hogan was called out because      Jeanette was outside with fresh clothes for her husband. ``I      need to explain to my wife why I'm spending more time with      you than her,'' Hogan told Snelling, who didn't like meetings      interrupted.       ``He lit up. `Let's go meet your wife,' '' Hogan recalled.      Jeanette had just been to the dentist and had a front tooth      removed, flashing a smile that showed a gaping hole. Hogan      said Snelling never missed a beat and made a ``big show'' of      graciousness to his wife.       Hogan recalled Snelling's impatience with long      presentations. So, as Human Services Secretary, Hogan created      a game where he took a deck of cards, and on each wrote a      one-line synopsis of a proposed program, the cost, and the      supporters and opponents. Fifty-two suggestions.       Snelling loved it; he'd flip through the cards quickly and      make two piles: Yes and No. And Hogan knew how to proceed.       ``He was at the top of his game,'' said Hogan of Snelling      during that second trip to the governor's office. His      recollections of his former boss are nostalgic and reflect      his respect and deep admiration for the late governor.       Snelling died in office on Aug. 13, 1991. During his brief      second tenure as governor, he worked with Democratic House      Speaker Ralph Wright to craft a plan to retire an enormous      state deficit, another point of pride for Hogan.       The day after Snelling's death, new Gov. Howard Dean called      Hogan into his office for a briefing on the Human Services      Agency.       ``I was in no shape to go,'' Hogan recalled. Not only was      he mourning Snelling's passing, he didn't know Dean or what      to expect from the former lieutenant governor.       Hogan arrived with a list of 50 issues to discuss, and      spent an hour running through them all. ``Dean didn't say a      word, he just listened. He was either getting it . . . or not      getting it and he did,'' Hogan recalled.       The two worked well together for 8 years until Hogan left      the administration in November 1999. ``There's a half-life to      that kind of job,'' he said of Human Services secretary.      After making progress on many social issues, ``I had begun to      see some of the same problems again.''       Then came the ill-fated gubernatorial run.       Followed by retirement--or Hogan's version of retirement:      He travels the world working with countries that include      Australia, Israel, Chile, Norway, Northern Ireland, Scotland,      and in May, Holland, to improve their government structure      and programs for children.       He has also become involved in informal lobbying efforts      for universal health care (the number of uninsured Vermonters      has climbed from 42,000 in 2001 to 69,000 today, he noted; he      predicts the increase will continue without serious action).      He considers high health care costs a ``serious economic      threat'' to the State.       He serves on the board of Vermont College in Montpelier,      which is seeking certification and funding. Hogan also      continues to play the banjo with his band, Cold Country      Bluegrass (Jeanette plays the string bass).       And he helps Jeannette around the family horse farm, which      she started but is now run by their daughter, Ruth.       That's Con Hogan's idea of retirement.       His son lives next door with Hogan's two grandchildren, and      Ruth lives around the corner. And in the end, that is his      life's ambition achieved.       ``Having my family close enough to enjoy their successes,      and watch the kids grow up,'' he said. ``Nothing comes close.      This to me is what it's all about.''                          ____________________
