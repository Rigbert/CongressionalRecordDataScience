President, today I am introducing legislation to make available to all Americans the same range of private health insurance plans available to Members of Congress and other Federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.  Too many Americans do not have real insurance options. Many individuals lack insurance because no insurer is willing to cover them at a reasonable price. Others work for employers who do not provide health insurance or offer only one insurance provider. This legislation addresses these issues by giving individuals and businesses access to the group purchasing power of FEHBP and the wide range of health plans in that program.  The OPTION Act, Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide, would expand insurance options by allowing individuals to enroll in private health insurance plans nearly identical to the plans available to federal employees. Though the OPTION program would be separate from the Federal employees program, it would be modeled after FEHBP and would draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group purchasing savings, comprehensive benefits, and open enrollment periods.  Under this legislation, all FEHBP health plans would be required to offer an OPTION health plan to non-Federal employees with the same range of benefits they offer Federal employees through FEHBP.  OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool to prevent any adverse effect on current FEHBP employees, annuitants, and their families. The OPTION Act would not result in any changes to the premiums or benefits of today's FEHBP health plans.  OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting condition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who have at least one year of health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an OPTION plan. To prevent people from waiting until they are sick to enroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage immediately prior to enrollment.  One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans would be allowed to vary premiums by age so that younger enrollees would be more likely to enroll. OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates or lower premiums to encourage and reward longevity of health coverage. These provisions would act as an incentive for people to sign up when they are young and to maintain continuous coverage.  Along with making FEHBP available in the individual market, the OPTION program will allow businesses to tap into the type of group buying power in the federal employees program if they voluntarily choose to participate. To be eligible, a business would have to be willing to pay at least a minimum percentage of premiums, varying from 40 percent to 60 percent depending on the size of the business. Employers would also be offered an incentive to begin enrolling their employees by allowing them to pay as little as 20 percent of the premium for the first year. This innovative employer option would encourage employer health coverage rather than shifting coverage away from the private sector. I want to emphasize that employer participation would be entirely voluntary.  Under the OPTION Act, premiums would not be government-subsidized. Instead, enrollees and those employers who choose to participate would be responsible for the cost of the premiums.  The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which administers the FEHBP program, and would generally follow the rules for FEHBP. OPM has developed considerable expertise in negotiating and working with health plans and has shown that it can run a health program well at a minimal cost. We can build on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance options to all Americans.  Finally, once it is up and running, this program would pay for itself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion of the OPTION premiums. Those who benefit from the program would pay for its overhead costs.  This legislation could open the door for many Americans to obtain good health insurance coverage. Health insurance premiums in today's market can be especially high, both for individuals and for small businesses buying insurance on their own. This legislation will reduce the cost of insurance, and as a result will help to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. It will also expand insurance options. I encourage my colleagues to support this very important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3173       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
