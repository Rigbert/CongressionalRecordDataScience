President, this is an historic day in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. I want Senators and the American people to be aware of the significance of what the people of that island have done today.  For the past quarter of a century, Unionists who favor continued British control over Northern Ireland, and Catholics who favor unification of Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, have been locked in a cruel war over the status of the North. Over 3,200 people have died, many of them innocent civilians caught in the crossfire between the IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups.  Mr. President, as an American of Irish descent, the violence in Northern Ireland has had a profound affect on me. I have always unequivocally opposed the use of violence by both sides in Northern Ireland. Irish-Americans who care about the land of our ancestors condemn violence without reservation and support a peaceful settlement.  My father felt he would never live to see real peace in Northern Ireland, and [[Page S2918]] he did not. But I believe that my father's son will see it, both as an American and as a U.S. Senator.  In December 1993, our hopes were raised for an end to the bloodshed, when former Irish Prime Minister Reynolds, and British Prime Minister Major, declared that the future status of Northern Ireland should be decided by agreement of the people there. That declaration began a peace process that led to the IRA cease-fire last August. Two months later Protestant paramilitary groups stopped shooting, and the cease-fire has held.  Since then, the British Government has taken several steps to reduce tensions in the North, including ending daytime military patrols in Belfast. In the Irish Republic, a Peace and Reconciliation Forum has brought Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into informal talks with representatives of the Government and other parties.  Today in Belfast, in what I believe offers the best hope for peace in the 25-year history of the conflict, Irish Prime Minister Bruton and Prime Minister Major announced the publication of a long-awaited Framework Document which provides a basic for future negotiations on a peace settlement.  Mr. President, late yesterday afternoon, I returned from Dublin, Belfast, and London, where I met with leaders and individuals representing all points of view on the future of Northern Ireland. I went there over the weekend because I knew the peace process was at a decisive point.  I wanted to give encouragement. I also wanted to pay tribute to the people of both Northern Ireland and the Republic, Catholic and Protestant, who are courageously trying to find a way to a better future.  The Framework Document, which sets out a joint vision for the future of both Irish and British Governments, is a tremendous step forward. It reaffirms the principles of self-determination, of the consent of the governed, of democratic and peaceful means, and of full respect and protection for the rights and identities of both traditions.  From the conversations I had, both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with people of all political and religious traditions, I realized the importance of the document and of bringing people together who so fervently want to be brought together. Members of my staff, Tim Rieser and Kevin McDonald, who accompanied me, heard the same thing.  Since the framework's aim is to encourage all parties to come to the negotiating table, nobody is going to be content with all of it. If it were written in such a way that any one group found it totally acceptable, it would guarantee that the rest would find it totally unacceptable. The Unionists with whom I met condemned the Framework Document long before its release. I suggested they recognize it for what it is--a basis for discussion, not a final blueprint. I urged them to come to the negotiating table with their own ideas, not to condemn the process before even giving it a chance.  Mr. President, in Belfast I got a sense of the fear Unionists feel. For centuries they have thought of themselves as British, and today they fear that the British Government is abandoning them. Some longed for a past that never was, dreamed of a future that never would be, and they fear a present they do not understand.  It made a profound impression on me. Change in Northern Ireland is inevitable, but the Framework Document should threaten no one. It would give a majority of the people of Northern Ireland the right to decide their future. It is equally important to recognize that any lasting piece, any healthy society, muse be rooted in equal justice. The fundamental civil rights of both Catholics and Protestants must be protected in Northern Ireland.  Everywhere I went, I heard praise for the role President Clinton has played in supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland. I was told that not since the days of President John F. Kennedy has an American President been so interested in what is happening. It is clear that without his personal involvement we would not have seen this day.  I want to praise our Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith, who has taken up the cause for peace and encouraged the parties to move forward. And I want to praise especially those parties, many of whom have been enemies for decades, perhaps for centuries, who are willing to come together.  In Dublin and Belfast I told Unionists and Nationalists the same thing, that the U.S. Government will support this effort fully, and with even-handedness.  But the real work of peace will be done by them. Both have legitimate aspirations, and both traditions must find a way to accommodate one another. We cannot, nor can any other country dictate what that outcome will be. The parties must find it for themselves.  Mr. President, I am under no illusion that a peaceful future in Northern Ireland is assured. Immense difficulties lie ahead. To put the past behind, to build peace out of bloodshed, to find common ground where there has been so much hatred and distrust. But from all that I heard during my brief visit there, there is a new spirit emerging; a wide recognition that violence has failed; a new determination to find another way.  When mothers in Belfast sat with me and told me they did not want their children to face the kind of horror and violence that they have, it is not a feeling of Protestants or Catholics, it is a feeling of mothers throughout Northern Ireland. It is a feeling that should be listened to by the leaders, because the people do not want to go back to the violent days of the past.  Those mothers spoke of their children, who are going to live most of their lives in the next century. The leaders must decide what kind of a life they will have. The children cannot, but it is they who will be most affected. And if you have hatred and violence, prejudice and bias directed toward a child, does it make any difference whether that child is Protestant or Catholic? Those children have a right to expect their leaders to show courage and a sense of responsibility for the future and to give them a chance to live in peace.  Lasting peace means urgently dealing with the terrible problem of unemployment in the north. People need to have confidence in their government, but they also need jobs; they need economic security as well as physical security.  In Belfast, I saw some of the accomplishments of the International Fund for Ireland which the United States and European countries have supported since 1983. I can attest to the important work the Fund is doing to provide jobs in areas where unemployment among Catholics runs as high as 60 percent. The Fund's efforts have also brought together Catholics and Protestants in common endeavors where in the past there was virtually no contact between them.  And in speaking to members of the Orange Order in Comber near Belfast, I encouraged Unionists there to apply to the Fund and work together to bring jobs and a sense of security and a sense of hope in the future for their people.  President Clinton, in recognition of the Fund's accomplishments and the critical stage the peace process has reached, has proposed increases in our contributions in 1996 and 1997.  The Fund is a transitional program until real investment can take root in the north. A trade and investment conference is planned for May in Washington, and it is eagerly awaited by people in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. President Clinton's selection of Senator George Mitchell as his Special Adviser on Economic Initiatives in Ireland is not only indicative of the President's commitment to support peace there, it also ensures the success of the conference.  Again, in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, and in the United Kingdom, I heard person after person praise the choice of George Mitchell, knowing the respect that is felt for him by both Republicans and Democrats in our country and by the President of the United States.  I am reminded of what Senator Mitchell, quoting Franklin Roosevelt, said to an audience in Dublin: In the dark days of our Great Depression, President Roosevelt said ``the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' He also said, ``the best social program is a job.'' That will be Senator Mitchell's work as the Presidents Special Adviser, and the work of all the people there.   [[Page S2919]] Mr. President, the island of my ancestors is at an historic turning point. Today's publication of the Framework Document offers a real chance for an end to a conflict that has horrified so many for decades.  I want to commend the Irish and British Governments and all the parties who are seeking a better future for the people of Northern Ireland.  Mr. President, for the first time I have a sense of hope that peace is at hand in Northern Ireland, which my late father so desperately wanted. I have a belief that his son and his grandchildren will see it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements of Prime Ministers Bruton and Major and a summary of the Framework Document be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Summary--A New Framework for Agreement       These proposals:       Reaffirm the guiding principles of self-determination, the      consent of the governed, exclusively democratic and peaceful      means, and full respect and protection for the rights and      identities of both traditions;       Provide for an agreed new approach to traditional      consitutional doctrines on both sides:       The British Government will propose changes to its      constitutional legislation, so as to incorporate a commitment      to continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of      the people living in Northern Ireland, and a commitment to      exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous impartiality on      behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland, in a way which      does not prejudice their freedom to determine Northern      Ireland's constitutional status, whether in remaining a part      of the United Kingdom or in forming part of a united Ireland;       The Irish Government will introduce and support proposals      for changes in the Irish Constitution, so that no territorial      claim of right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary      to the will of a majority of its people is asserted, and so      that the Irish Government recognise the legitimacy of      whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the      people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional      status;       Commend direct dialogue with the relevant political parties      in Northern Ireland in developing new internal structures;       Propose a North/South body, comprising elected      representatives from, and accountable to, a Northern Ireland      Assembly and the Irish Parliament, to deal with matters      designated by the two Governments in the first instance in      agreement with the parties;       Describe ways in which such a body could work with      executive harmonising or consultative functions, by way of      authority delegated to its members by the Assembly;       Envisage that all decisions within the North/South body      would be by agreement between the two sides;       Set out criteria for the designation of functions, and      suggest a range of functions that might be designated from      the outset, for agreement with the parties;       Envisage the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish      Parliament being able, by agreement, to designate further      functions or to move functions already designated between the      three categories;       Envisage that the body will have an important role in      consultation with the two Governments in developing an agreed      approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges      and opportunities of the European Union;       Envisage a Parliamentary forum, with representatives from      new Northern Ireland institutions and the Irish Parliament to      consider matters of mutual interest;       Envisage a new and more broadly based Agreement between the      British and Irish Governments to develop and extend co-     operation;       Envisage a standing Intergovernmental Conference which      would consider matters of mutual interest, but not those      transferred to new political institutions in Northern      Ireland;       Envisage that representatives of agreed political      institutions in Northern Ireland may be formally associated      with the work of the Conference;       Provide for a complementary undertaking by both Governments      to ensure protection for specified civil, political, social      and cultural rights.       These proposals do not provide for joint authority by the      British and Irish Governments over Northern Ireland. They do      not predetermine any outcome to the Talks process. Agreement      by the parties, and then by the people, is the key.                                                                    ____Introductory Remarks by the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), Mr. John Bruton, TD, at Belfast Launching of Joint Framework Document, February                                 22, 1995       Today's new framework for agreement is a landmark event in      the affairs on this island.       The two Governments are presenting to the political parties      in Northern Ireland, and to the Irish and British peoples, a      document which is the most detailed expression to date of our      views on the subject of Northern Ireland.       The Prime Minister and I hope that the Framework Document      will receive calm and measured consideration over the days      and weeks ahead.       It is an important and serious text, offered as an aid to      discussion and negotiation. It presents our best judgment of      what might be an agreed outcome future talks involving the      two Governments and the political parties.       We commend it to the parties for their careful      consideration and we look forward to discussing it in detail      with them at the earliest opportunity.       May I at this point pay a special tribute to my colleague      the Tanaiste and his officials and to the Northern Ireland      Secretary of State Patrick Mayhew and his team. Their      determined efforts over many months have brought us to      today's new framework for agreement.       The proposals which it contains are, we believe, balanced      and fair and threaten nobody. No party need fear this      document.       To the nationalist and republican people, the document:       Reaffirms that the British Government have no selfish,      strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and that      they will uphold the democratic with of a greater number of      the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they      prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland;       Says that the British Government will enshrine in its      constitutional legislation the principles embodied in this      new framework for agreement by the amendment of the      Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by      appropriate new legislation;       It will also be important to nationalists that both      Governments consider that new institutions should be created      to cater for present and future political, social and      economic inter-connections within the island of Ireland.      These institutions will enable representatives of the main      traditions, North and South, to enter agreed relationships.      This is the purpose of the North/South body proposed in this      document.       To the unionist and loyalist people, I would point out that      the document commits the Irish Government to ask the      electorate to change the Irish Constitution. The change      proposed will address Articles 2 and 3 in the following ways:       It would remove any jurisdictional or territorial claim of      legal right over the territory of Northern Ireland contrary      to the will of its people;       It would provide that the creation of a sovereign united      Ireland could therefore only occur in circumstances where a      majority of the people of Northern Ireland formally chose to      be part of a united Ireland.       It is also important to unionists that the document also      contains a recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy      of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the      people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional      status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union      or a sovereign united Ireland.       The proposals will challenge the two traditions on this      island but it will do so in an even-handed way. Neither      tradition need fear its contents. As I have emphasized at      every appropriate opportunity, it is a framework for      discussion and not a blueprint to be imposed over the heads      of anyone. Its purpose is to facilitate, not pre-empt,      dialogue. At the end of the day, the people of both North and      South respectively will have the final say.       The document is our carefully considered response to many      suggestions, from the parties and others, that it would be      helpful to have the view of the two Governments as to what      might be an agreed outcome from future talks.       We are asking the parties to come and talk to us, openly      and candidly, about these proposals. We believe that, taken      in the round, they offer a basis for structured discussions      leading to a new agreement.       We believe that they do. It is our hope that the political      parties, having given them the attention they deserve, will      take a similar view.       There can be no doubt about the enormous desire on the part      of the ordinary public--here, in the rest of Ireland and in      Britian--for the earliest possible resumption of political      dialogue.       The ending of all campaigns of paramilitary violence last      autumn has created an unrivalled opportunity for such      dialogue to take place with a reasonable prospect of a      successful conclusion.       I join the Prime Minister in appealing to all the parties      concerned to grasp this opportunity.       The Framework Document is our judgement of how things can      best be taken forward. We have, in our view, the best      opportunity in a generation for a lasting political      settlement. We owe it to the peoples of both of these islands      to put that opportunity to the test.                                                                    ____ Opening Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. John Major, MP,   at a Joint Press Conference With the Taoiseach, John Bruton, TD, To   Launch the Joint Framework Document, Belfast, Wednesday 22 February                                   1995       There is one reason, above all, why the Taoiseach and I      have come to Belfast today.       We wish to offer our proposals here in Northern Ireland--to      Northern Ireland's people and their representatives.        [[Page S2920]] We seek to help peace, but only the people      of Northern Ireland can deliver it.       So let me say to them:       These are our ideas, but the future is up to you;       You have an opportunity now which has not been there for      many years;       An opportunity to work together to build a better future      and a lasting peace.       Our proposals stem from the talks process launched four      years ago, in March 1991.       It was agreed then by the two Governments and the four      participating parties that the process would have three      strands. It would seek a new beginning for:       Relationships within Northern Ireland;       Relations between the North and South of the island of      Ireland;       And relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic.       We agreed that it was only by addressing all these      relationships together than agreement would be found across      the community in Northern Ireland.       At this press conference, the Taoiseach and I are      publishing the document ``A New Framework for Agreement''      which deals with the second and third of these strands. A      little later this morning I shall put forward a separate      document proposing new arrangements within Northern Ireland--     which is of course a matter for the British Government and      the Northern Ireland parties alone.       Our proposals are based on several principles: self-     determination, consent, democratic and peaceful methods, and      respect for the identities of both traditions.       Consent is and will remain paramount in our policy.       It is the democratic right and the safeguard of the people      of Northern Ireland.       No proposals for the future would be workable, let alone      successful, without the consent and active support of all      Northern Ireland's people. For they are the people who would      carry them out and whose lives would be affected.       That is why any eventual settlement must be agreed by the      parties; supported by the people of Northern Ireland in a      referendum; and approved by Parliament--a triple consent      procedure.       Our constitutional matters, each Government has offered      crucial new commitments in this Framework Document:       As part of a balanced agreement the British Government      would enshrine its willingness to accept the will of a      majority of the people of Northern Ireland in British      Constitutional legislation. We shall embody the commitments      we made in the Downing Street Declaration;       The Irish Government would introduce and support proposals      to change its Constitution, so that ``no territorial claim of      right to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the      will of a majority of its people is asserted''. This is a      very important proposal that I welcome unreservedly;       These changes would offer Northern Ireland a constitutional      stability which it has not hitherto enjoyed. Its future      status, by agreement between the two Governments, would be      irrevocably vested in the wishes of a majority of its people       In line with the three-stranded approach, we propose new      institutions for North/South cooperation.       The North/South body which we outline would comprise      elected representatives chosen from a new Northern Ireland      Assembly and from the Irish Parliament. It would draw its      authority from these two bodies. It would operate by      agreement, and only by agreement.       On the UK side, the North/South body would initially be set      up by legislation at Westminster, as part of a balanced      agreement. It would come into operation following the      establishment of the new Assembly. Thereafter, it would be      for the Assembly and the Irish Parliament both to operate the      body and to decide whether its functions should be extended.       Like all of our proposals, the new North/South institutions      will be a matter for negotiation. But the way should now be      open for beneficial cooperation between North and South      without the constitutional tensions which have been such      impediments in the past. We have made suggestions about areas      which might be covered in this cooperation, to the advantage      of both sides. Like all aspects of the document, they will be      for discussion and agreement between all concerned.       The European Union already operates cross-border programmes      between Northern Ireland and the Republic, as it does      elsewhere. We propose that North and South could usefully      work together in specific areas, to take advantage of what      the EU has to offer. But the making of United Kingdom policy      and the responsibility for representing Northern Ireland in      the European Union will remain solely in the hands of the UK      Government.       In the third of our Strands, we outline a new broader-based      agreement to take the place of the 1985 Anglo-Irish      Agreement.       The 1985 Agreement was criticised because the Northern      Ireland parties had not contributed to it. Our new proposals      are offered for discussion in the talks process. We want to      hear the views of the parties; and we envisage that their      representatives would be formally associated with the future      work of the Intergovernmental Conference.       The Intergovernmental Conference would allow concerns to be      expressed about any problems or breaches of the Agreement.      But there would be no mechanism for the two Governments      jointly to supervise or override either the Northern Ireland      Assembly or the North/South body. It would be for each      Government to deal on its own with any problems within its      own jurisdiction. This would not be a question for joint      decision, still less joint action. It is important to be      clear about this, as there have been concerns on this score.       Our two Governments have worked with patient determination      to agree on this Framework, and I am grateful to the      Taoiseach, his predecessor, and the Tanaiste for their      efforts and their spirit of accommodation.       Our proposals seek to stimulate constructive and open      discussion and give a fresh impetus to the political      negotiations. The outcome of those negotiations will depend,      not on us, but on the consent of the parties, people, and      Parliament.       It is not for us to impose. But what we propose is an end      to the uncertainty, instability and internal divisions which      have bedeviled Northern Ireland.       For over four years as Prime Minister, I have listened      intently to the people of Northern Ireland. I have visited      them, consulted them, travelled more widely than any      predecessor throughout the Province, and held meetings with      political leaders, church leaders, council leaders, community      leaders, and people from all walks of life.       It is my duty as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to      maintain the Union for as long as that is the will of the      people. It is a duty in which I strongly believe, and one      which these proposals protect. Just as people cannot be held      within the Union against their will, so equally they will      never be asked to leave it in defiance of the will of the      majority.       Consent and free negotiation are fundamental to me, and      they are the foundation stones of this Joint Document.       In the four years of the Talks process, we have travelled a      long way, but not yet far enough.       I know that many people will be worried, perhaps even      pessimistic, about the future.       But, as we look at the hurdles ahead, let us also consider      where we have come from.       The dialogue of the deaf has ended.       For four years, we have been engaged in talks.       The three-stranded approach is becoming a reality.       The Joint Declaration has been accepted.       The British Government is engaged in talks with      paramilitaries on both sides.       We have had nearly six months of peace.       Prosperity and a normal life are returning to Northern      Ireland.       The principle of consent, once accepted only by Unionists      and the British Government, is today accepted almost      everywhere.       These are some of the gains for everyone in Northern      Ireland.       More gains can lie ahead if we have the courage to conduct      ourselves with patience, with foresight and with      consideration.
