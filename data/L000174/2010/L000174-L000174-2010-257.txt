President, I speak often about the excellent higher education opportunities that are available in Vermont. Today, I want to honor Middlebury College for a new business venture that builds upon its academic reputation in foreign languages.  A small, liberal arts school of 2400 students, located in Addison County, Middlebury is a campus that is rooted in Vermont's rich culture, while charting the way forward to the future. From using wood chips to heat and cool buildings across the campus, to local food initiatives, to recycling building materials, students, faculty and staff use creativity and build on a tradition of excellence in helping to take the college to the next level.  This week, Middlebury College was hailed as one of the Nation's top ``green colleges'' in a new ranking by the Princeton Review. And a recent article in the New York Times described the college's new and innovative business partnership to develop an online language program for precollege students. Already well known for its intensive summer language programs, Middlebury will be able to broaden its reach and impact by bringing a language program directly into the homes of American students wanting to learn new languages.  The Internet has emerged as a significant learning tool, and connecting students with language instruction on the Web is a wonderful academic idea as well as an innovative business initiative.  I know that Middlebury College will continue to be a leader in academic innovation, and I wish them the best in their new endeavor.                          ____________________
