 A conference committee is a committee that is out in the public.  What is happening right now is closed-door agreements. What we are asking for is an open process where we are allowed to take the Senate-passed budget and the House-passed budget, go to conference, and find out where we can agree so we can put this behind us.  I object to the Senator's request and ask again for our unanimous consent request to move to budget conference, as we do in regular order, which is what the Republicans have been demanding for a very long time.
