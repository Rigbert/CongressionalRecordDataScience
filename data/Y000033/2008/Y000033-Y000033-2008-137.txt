Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Bill Number: H.R. 5658, Air Force, RDT, Line 221, PE #0708611F (Support Systems Development).  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Biomass Energy Systems, Inc., 100 Overlook Center, 2nd Floor, Princeton, NJ 08540.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of Federal taxpayer funding is justified: This project is underway to introduce alternative energy sources based on locally available resources for the USDOD and in Alaska. The Air Force, APTO, Eielson AFB and BESI have forged an alliance to create an alternative energy source program to be implemented in Alaska. The program consists of three phases. First, an integrated waste to energy system consisting of waste gasification, gas cleanup, and a gas engine to convert waste-based fuel gas to electricity will be demonstrated using wood waste and other locally generated wastes at Eielson AFB in Fairbanks, AK. After the testing is completed and any modifications are identified, the gasification system will be relocated to a local village, to demonstrate the system in a typical local setting as a backup source of power. After testing the system under local conditions is completed, the system will be integrated in parallel with the existing petroleum-based system. Initially the system will operate as backup for the existing system with a gradual change over to a primary role. This provides a practical model of sustainable renewable energy for the USDOD facilities, as well as the Alaskan villages.  Description of matching funds: BESI is currently under contract to the U.S. Air Force, APTO to deliver a final design for a 1MW system for Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. This is a Congressionally funded project from FY 07 and the contract is worth $848,040.00.  Authorized Amount: $4,000,000.  Project Name: Eielson Air Force Base Alternative Energy Source Program.  Detailed Finance Plan: $2,300,000 Equipment Gasifer and Genset; $700,000 Instrumentation and Controls; $1,150,000 Construction and Installation; $550,000 Shakedown; $300,000 Project Management.                          ____________________
