 During the last three and one-half decades, Tina has worked tirelessly with the People's House and the media to chronicle the sometimes tumultuous but always lively day-to-day history of the Congress. She has gracefully assisted Democrats and Republicans in their interaction with the press during a period when technological advances changed the manner in which the media informed the American people about their government.  In 1969, Tina moved from her native Georgia to Washington, DC, with her husband and young son. Three years later, during the Nixon Administration and Carl Albert's Speakership, she was hired as the first female employee of the House Radio and Television Gallery. At that time, there were only three national television news organizations, and it was still one year before CBS radio took the bold step of launching a ``news on the hour'' service.  In 1981, she was selected Superintendent of the Radio TV Gallery--the first female to head that office. This was the first year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency and the fifth year of Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill's service as Speaker. Since then she has overseen the historic coverage of the transition of power in the House, first from Democratic to Republican hands in 1994, and then a return to Democratic governance in 2006.  During her service, Tina served five Speakers of the House, guiding the House and those who cover it with integrity, honesty and a desire to help all sides succeed in a rapidly changing, frequently challenging environment.  Madam Speaker, Tina has left her mark on Congress and those who cover us for the people. For the press, she has been an advocate and steady hand in working with Congress to expand openness and access. For Members of Congress, she has been a faithful guardian of the institution's interests and the precedents that protect this body.  In addition to helping reporters gather news within the halls of Congress, Tina and her office have helped more than 5,000 members of independent radio and television organizations cover every national political convention. That makes sense, since once a nominee became President she oversaw their subsequent State of the Union Addresses.  Tina not only arranged logistics, she innovated. She developed new platforms for coverage, whether that be utilizing Statuary Hall to allow Members to talk to national and local media, or paving the way for new technologies like HDTV to find their place in the coverage of newsworthy events. She has had a hand in making all of this work and finding new ways to open up our government.  Tina's contribution will continue into the future. Since 2000, she has been working to establish a necessary and appropriate foothold for the electronic media in the Congressional Visitor's Center. As the technology and press have changed in 34 years, so have their needs and the needs of Members of Congress. She foresaw that growth and has worked with us to make the House successful in the years to come.  Let me close by thanking Tina for her service, friendship and gracious guidance. She leaves the House of Representatives the better for her service.                          ____________________
