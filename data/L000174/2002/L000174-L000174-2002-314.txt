We are now meeting their two-year figures is less than 10 months. Oh, and if you were wondering about Court of Appeals judges confirmed in the 1996 and 1997 sessions combined--their total was 7. We have already confirmed 9 in fewer than 10 months.  A fair examination of the rate of confirmation shows that Democrats are working harder and faster on judicial nominees, confirming judges at a faster pace than the rates of the past 20 years. The double standards asserted by Republican critics are just plain wrong and unfair, but that does not seem to matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and belittling every achievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority.  The Republican attack is based on the unfounded notion that the Senate has not kept up with attrition on the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has not only been keeping up with attrition but outpacing it, and we have started to move the vacancies numbers in the right direction--down. By contrast, from January 1995 when the Republican majority took over control of the Senate until they relinquished control in June 2001, federal judicial vacancies rose by 65 percent, from 63 to 105.  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmations in January 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be reorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, 2001. When I became Chairman of a Committee to which Members were finally assigned on July 10, we began with 110 judicial vacancies. With today's confirmation of Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson, we have reduced the overall number of judicial vacancies to 88 and the number of district court vacancies to 58. Already, in fewer than 10 months in the majority, we more than kept up with attrition and begun to close the judicial vacancies gap that nearly doubled under the Republican majority. Under Democratic leadership, we have reduced the number of district court vacancies by almost 25 percent and the overall number of judicial vacancies by 20 percent, to below 90.  I happen to have a chart that shows what we have been doing. We see the trend under the Republican majority going up, and then we see the trend under the Democratic majority and how we have brought the vacancy number down.  The Democratic majority in the Senate has also kept up with attrition on the Courts of Appeals and been acting to close the vacancies gap on the Courts of Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican majority. Vacancies on the Courts of Appeals rose from 16 to 33 in the period January 1995 to July 2001, before the Senate was allowed to reorganize after the shift in majority last summer.  In the fewer than 10 months since the change in majority, the Senate has confirmed nine judges to the Courts of Appeals and more than kept up with the five vacancies that had arisen since July. In contrast, the Republican-controlled majority averaged only seven confirmations to the Courts of Appeals per year. Seven. This is what is somewhat distressing. I suppose they think if they keep saying it enough, the public will be fooled and the press will be fooled. I am willing to bet ultimately neither will.  In the fewer than 10 months the Democrats have been in the majority, we have already exceeded the annual number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by our predecessors. The Senatein the last 10 months has confirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as were confirmed in all of 2000 and more than were confirmed in 1997 or 1999, and nine more than the zero from 1996. Another way to put it is that within the last 10 months, the Democratic majority in the Senate has confirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as were confirmed in the 2000 and 1996 sessions combined and confirmed more Court of Appeals judges than were confirmed in the 1999 and 1996 sessions combined or in the 1997 and 1996 sessions combined. Simply put, in fewer than 10 months we have already exceeded the number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by a Republican majority in four of the six years in which they were in control. No matter what standard you use, we are moving very fast.  Under Republican leadership from 1995 through July 10, 2001, vacancies on the Courts of Appeals increased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.  When I became chairman of a Committee to which Members were finally assigned on July 10, we began with 33 Courts of Appeals vacancies. That is what I inherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, five additional vacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the country. With last week's confirmation of Judge Howard, we have reduced the number of circuit court vacancies to 29. That is, we have kept up with attrition by confirming five Court of Appeals judges and then acted to lower the number of vacancies by confirming four additional judges. Those are the facts. Since our Republican critics are so fond of using percentages, I will say that we will have now reduced the vacancies on the Courts of Appeals by more than 12 percent in the last 10 months.  Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making no progress, as some have asserted, there are now 29 vacancies--that is more than keeping up with the attrition on the Circuit Courts. Republican critics unfairly seek to attribute to the Democratic majority the lack of action by the Republican majority before the historic change last summer.  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the Courts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic majority fewer than 10 months to reverse that trend, keep up with extraordinary turnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies overall. This is progress.  Rather than having the circuit vacancy numbers skyrocketing, as they did overall during the prior six and one-half years--more than doubling from 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has reversed that trend. The vacancies numbers are moving in the right direction down.  Overall, in fewer than 10 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominations. With today's actions, we will have confirmed 52 of those nominees. By contrast, in the first 10 months of Republican control of nominations they held only 10 hearings and confirmed only 36 judges. We have held more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any year of its control of the Senate. The Republican majority never held 17 judicial confirmation hearings in 12 months.  Indeed, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial nominees--more than 50--never got a Committee hearing and Committee vote from the Republican majority, which perpetuated longstanding vacancies into this year.  Despite the new-found concern from across the aisle about the number of judicial vacancies, no nominations hearings were held while the Republicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last year. No judges were confirmed during that time from among the many qualified circuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, 2001, or from among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, 2001.  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of district and circuit vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the Senate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the first hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the reorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the Committee was assigned new members.  That initial hearing included two District Court nominees and a Court of Appeals nominee on whom the Republican majority had refused to hold a hearing the year before. Within two weeks of the first hearing, we held a second hearing on judicial nominations that included another Court of Appeals nominee. I did try to schedule some District Court nominees for that hearing, but none of the files of the seven District Court nominees pending before the Committee was complete. Similarly, in the unprecedented hearings we held for judicial nominees during the August recess, we attempted to schedule additional District Court nominees but we could not do so if their paperwork was not complete. Had we had cooperation from the Republican majority and the White House in our efforts, we could have held even more hearings for more District Court nominees. Nevertheless, in fewer than 10 tumultuous months, the Committee has held 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominations.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on judicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in Committee, in contrast to the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics employed by some during the period of Republican control. The Democratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the past to deny Committee consideration of judicial nominees. We have moved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from 1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public for the first time.  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. Many times during the six and one-half years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, I observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more progress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years for his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to do more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees without action.  I hope to hold additional hearings and make additional progress on judicial nominees. In our efforts to address the number of vacancies on the circuit and district courts we inherited from the Republicans, the Committee has focused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order to respond to what Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a vacancy crisis, the Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This will help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by confirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as possible.  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require greater review. This process of careful review is part of our democratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of our system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime appointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow ideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are outside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would further divide our nation.  Some on the other side of the aisle have falsely charged that if a nominee has a record as a conservative Republican, he will not be considered by the Committee. That is simply untrue. The next time Republican critics are bandying around charges that the Democratic majority has failed to consider conservative judicial nominees, I hope someone will ask those critics about all the Federalist Society members we have confirmed and the Republican activists we have confirmed without a single dissenting vote. I do not believe that President Bush is nominating liberals and neither does the White House.  The Committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both sides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings so far this year have been at the request of Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi, Senator Smith, and Senator Thompson--six Republican Senators who each sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee who was not among those initially sent to the Senate in May 2001.  I tried to accommodate them. They asked if we could move their nominees ahead in the queue. We did. We heard them. We confirmed them. But knowing that no good deed goes unpunished, having moved nominees at the requestof Republican Senators, moved theirs ahead of others, the same Republican Senators signed letters saying: It is terrible we are not moving them in order.  I have tried to accommodate them as much as I could. We would be moving a lot slower if we were going exactly in order. What we are trying to do is get those nominees on whom there is some consensus through first. That will put as many judges on the bench as possible.  I ask my colleagues, please, try to at least wait more than a week after I have accommodated you in moving your judge up for a hearing and getting them confirmed before you send out a letter saying: Why aren't you confirming more judges? I don't want to embarrass Senators by having a chart showing some of the letters and some of the statements they have made asking me to take their judges out of order, and then putting them side by side with their letters criticizing me for taking judges out of order. I am not going to do that, although I get sorely tempted.  I am also sorely tempted because the problems we are talking about arose on a Republican watch, while they were in the majority. It reminds me a little bit of an arsonist we had in Vermont when I was a prosecutor. There was a fellow who used to complain that the fire department wasn't responding fast enough. He was setting the fires. He was the one setting the fires. Rest his soul, he is no longer with us, but he used to complain they weren't responding fast enough, and he was the one setting the fires.  The whipsawing by the other side is truly remarkable. When we proceed on nominees that they support and on whom they seek action, we are criticized for not acting on others. When we direct our effort to trying to solve problems in one Circuit, they complain that we are not acting in another.  I imagine that over the next 10 days we will be hearing a refrain about the most controversial of President Bush's nominees who have not yet participated in a hearing. Some of them do not have the necessary home-state Senator support needed to proceed. Some will take a great deal of time and effort for the Committee to consider. I hope to be able to do something else that our Republican counterparts never did, which is to announce some scheduling decisions well in advance of hearings to come over the next several months.  But I do find it amazing that in spite of all we have done, all we are doing, and the fact that judges are moving much faster than they did in the past 6 years, our partisan critics will act as if we have not held a single hearing on a single judicial nominee. They will not acknowledge their role in creating what they now call a judicial vacancies crisis. They will not apologize for their harsh tactics in the six and one-half years that preceded the shift in majority.  They will not acknowledge that the Democratic majority has moved faster on more judges than they ever did. That will not acknowledge that we have been working at a record pace to seek to solve the problems they created.  We will keep on working. I am sure I will keep on listening to the partisan sniping, but we will keep moving faster than they ever did when they were in charge.  I remind everybody that this Senator would never vote for a nominee whose sole purpose in being there is to detract from the independence of the Federal judiciary and, instead, is intending to make the Federal judiciary ideologically pure one way or the other--and I don't care which way it goes; I will not vote for such a person. I want people to know that if any Vermonter or anybody from any State goes into a Federal court, they are going to have a fair hearing, and they will not be judged based on political party or political ideology. Whether they are plaintiff or defendant, whether they are Government or defendant, or whether they are rich or poor, they should be treated the same.  Each of the 52 nominees confirmed by the Senate has received the unanimous, bipartisan backing of the Committee. The confirmations of Judge Rufe and Mr. Baylson make the 51st and 52nd judicial nominees to be confirmed since I became Chairman last July. I would like to commend the members of the Judiciary Committee and our Majority Leader Senator Daschle and Assistant Majority Leader Senator Reid for all of their hard work in getting us to this point.  The confirmation of the 52nd judge in fewer than 10 months, especially these last 10 months, in spite of the unfair and personal criticism to which they have each been subjected, is an extraordinary achievement and a real example of Democratic Senators acting in a bipartisan way even some on the other side have continued to make our efforts toward progress as difficult as possible.
