Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Russell Walling. Russell passed away on Tuesday, February 5, 2013. A long time resident of Riverside, California, he was a pillar of the community and he will be deeply missed.  Russell was born December 7, 1917 in Douglas, Arizona, the son of Luther and Francis Walling. His family relocated to Riverside in 1927, where he attended Lowell Elementary School, Riverside Polytechnic High School and Riverside Community College. Following graduation he worked as a draftsman for the noted architect G. Stanley Wilson, and later moved to Los Angeles to work for a large architectural firm. Russell met the love of his life, LouElla Scott, at See's Candy where she worked and the two were married in 1941. Russell served his country honorably as a Lieutenant in the Navy Seabees during World War II.  After the war he returned to Riverside to work with his father, forming L.A. Walling & Son. Together they built many homes in the Wood Streets area, including Prince Albert Estates, the first exclusive custom tract homes in Riverside. In the mid-1950s Russell started Russell Walling, Inc. to continue residential building. His first commercial project was an A&W restaurant on University Avenue in Riverside. Over the years he built many large commercial buildings in Riverside, such as DeAnza Chevrolet, Caddock Electronics and Johnson Tractor. Russell's proudest accomplishment was the construction of an extensive complex of buildings for Bourns Incorporated, which won Building of the Year in 1962. In the early 1970s he built Los Amigos, the first private upscale condominiums on Victoria Avenue. In the late 1970s he purchased the original Security Pacific Bank building on the corner of University & Main, now known as the Walling Building.  It is hard to imagine that Russell would have any free time on his hands yet he always found time for his community. He had served as President of Riverside's Chamber of Commerce and Citizen of the Year; President of the Riverside Rotary Club; President of the Riverside Community Hospital Board; and President of the Monday Morning Group. A longtime member of the Victoria Club where he was first a caddy in his early years, and later an avid golfer, Russell and George Champion spearheaded a major three year renovation of the Victoria Club in the 1990s. Russell loved the outdoors and spent many years with his family at their trailer on the beach at El Morro near Laguna. He loved and cherished his time with family, especially his children and grandchildren. Russell and LouElla traveled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and South America. They spent many happy years doing annual fishing treks to Whaler's Cove off the rugged coast of Alaska's Admiralty Island.  Russell was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 69 years, LouElla; his brother Foster and sister, Mary. He is survived by his daughter Lee Walling Good of Grants Pass, Oregon; his son Terry Walling and daughter-in-law Cathleen of Riverside; grandchildren, Karen Lalonde of Greenwood, South Carolina; Tracy Cauble and Susanne McGee of Grants Pass, Oregon; David Good of Greenville, South Carolina; great grandchildren, Marrissa, Kaitlyn and Steven Franquez, Shelby and Caden Morrison, Madalyn and Gregory Cauble, and Jakob and Lukas McGee; and great great granddaughter Mya Franquez.  On Wednesday, February 13, 2013, a memorial service honoring Russell's life was held at the First Christian Church in Riverside. Russell will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Russell's family and friends; although Russell may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
