Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the outstanding high schools in the great State of Maryland. Since 1927, Great Mills High School has set an example in Southern Maryland and across the State for its dedication to educating tomorrow's leaders. For more than 70 years, Great Mills has been a partner with the local community, providing students valuable opportunities both inside and outside of the classroom.  As we celebrate the success of Great Mills High School, we must not forget the partnerships the school has forged with the community. Through a joint initiative called ``Partnerships for Success'', students have had the opportunity to become involved in all aspects of the St. Mary's County community. Whether taking advantage of after school tutoring by personnel at nearby Patuxent River Naval Air Station, working in a cooperative program with a local business, taking classes at St. Mary's College through the Charlotte Hall Fellowship Program, or volunteering with the Special Olympics, Great Mills students are an important and vital resource to the County.  Today, Great Mills offers a richly diverse student body the same valuable opportunities in education and extracurricular activities, as it did seventy years ago. Whether students choose to go on to pursue a bachelors degree, join the workforce, or serve our country in the Armed Services, all of them possess a solid high school education and a firm foundation for succeeding in life.  While the surrounding region has transformed, the quality of the Great Mills graduate has not. Thanks to a hard working faculty, a strong network of parent volunteers, a student body of academic achievers and a caring community, graduates continue to excel. Their academic success can be measured in their career choices--championship coaches, test pilots, doctors, Congressmen, olympians and teachers. All of them have gained their educational foundation in the classrooms of Great Mills High School.  In the coming years, the list of outstanding graduates is certain to grow. Great Mills is poised and ready to give its students a quality education as we approach the new millennium. While the Southern Maryland region continues to lead the State in growth, the $14 million dollar expansion and renovations of the school are sure to ease the pressures of a growing student body. With a first rate faculty, new computer and science labs, superior athletic facilities and expanded capacity, students have all of the tools necessary for the future. The dedication of the new and expanded Great Mills High School represents a true Celebration of Community. Congratulations and best wishes to the students, faculty, staff and to each and every one of the individuals dedicated to the future of Great Mills High School.                          ____________________
