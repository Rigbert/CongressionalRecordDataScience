 President, on the issue of FISA, let me second the observation of the majority leader. There is no more important issue for us to deal with in terms of protecting the homeland. I agree with his decision that we press forward on FISA and get it out of the Senate--but not just get it out of the Senate, get it out of the Senate and to the House in a form the President will sign. Nothing is more important to protecting the homeland than getting this done and getting it done properly.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont.
