Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 448) commending the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the completion of the Space Shuttle's second Return-to-Flight mission.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 448       Whereas, on July 4, 2006, the National Aeronautics and      Space Administration performed a successful launch of the      Space Shuttle Discovery;       Whereas this mission, known as STS-121, marks the second      Return-to-Flight mission;       Whereas the crew of the Discovery consisted of Colonel      Steve Lindsey, Commander Mark Kelly, Piers Sellers, Ph.D,      Lieutenant Colonel Mike Fossum, Commander Lisa Nowak,      Stephanie Wilson, and Thomas Reiter;       Whereas the STS-121 mission tested Space Shuttle safety      improvements, building on findings from Discovery's flight      last year, including a redesign of the Space Shuttle's      External Tank foam insulation, in-flight inspection of the      shuttle's heat shield, and improved imagery during launch;       Whereas the STS-121 mission re-supplied the International      Space Station by delivering more than 28,000 pounds of      equipment and supplies, as well as added a third crew member      to the International Space Station;       Whereas, due to the overall success of the launch and on-     orbit operations, the mission was able to be extended from 12      to 13 days, allowing for an additional space walk to the two      originally scheduled;       Whereas the success of the STS-121 mission is a tribute to      the skills and dedication of the Space Shuttle crew, the      National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and its      industrial partners;       Whereas all Americans benefit from the technological      advances gained through the Space Shuttle program; and       Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration      plays a vital role in sustaining America's preeminence in      space: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That it is the sense of Congress that the      National Aeronautics and Space Administration be commended      for--       (1) the successful completion of the Space Shuttle      Discovery's STS-121 mission; and       (2) its pioneering work in space exploration which is      strengthening the Nation and benefitting all Americans.
