President, I wish to commemorate the 225th anniversary of the town of Gouldsboro, ME. Known today as a beautiful gateway to the Schoodic Peninsula section of Acadia National Park, Gouldsboro was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today.  Gouldsboro's incorporation in 1789 was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For more than 10,000 years, the area was a favorite hunting and fishing grounds of the Abenaki, the Native American tribe of northeastern North America. The name ``Schoodic'' comes from their word for a place of plentiful fish in waters kept ice-free through the winter by the moderating currents of the Gulf of Maine. The reverence of the Abenaki for nature remains strong among all who call the peninsula home today.  The original name of Acadia National Park--Sieur de Monts National Monument recognizes the ongoing influence of the French explorers who visited the area in the early 1600s. In 1763, the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain for control of North America ended with a British victory. With peace came bold pioneers seeking opportunity.  The first recorded non-Native American settler on the peninsula was Thomas Frazer, who built a salt works at the mouth of a creek that today bears his name. Another early settler was the town's namesake, Robert Gould, whose untiring efforts and boundless optimism helped attract new members to the growing community. By the early 1800s, Gouldsboro was a thriving town of lumber and grain mills, fishing, and shipbuilding.  The character of the people of Gouldsboro of years gone by and of today is best represented by one of the town's historic treasures, the bell of the SS Queen Victoria. In 1864, leaders of the Canadian Confederation gathered on that great steamship anchored at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and reached the agreement to found a new nation.  Two years later, the Queen Victoria sank in a hurricane off the coast of Cape Hatteras, NC. Captain Rufus Allen, from the Gouldsboro village of Prospect Harbor, steered his Gouldsboro-built brig Ponvert into harm's way and was able to rescue 42 of the 43 officers and crew. In recognition of his heroism, Captain Allen was presented with one of the few items saved from the doomed steamship--the bronze bell. He gave the 95-pound bell to the Prospect Harbor School upon his retirement in 1875.  In 2004, 138 years after Captain Allen's daring rescue, the people of Gouldsboro recognized the significance of the Queen Victoria to Canadian history and commissioned Prospect Harbor artist and craftsman Dick Fisher to create a replica, which was given to the people of Charlottetown.  That single gesture reaffirmed Gouldsboro's connection to the sea and strengthened the enduring friendship between the United States and Canada.  Today, Gouldsboro is a place where fishing families and summer visitors cherish that connection to the sea. Through hard work and ingenuity, Gouldsboro has become not just a gateway but an essential part of the Acadia experience. With its charming villages, working waterfronts, artist studios, and many recreation opportunities, Gouldsboro is a true gem on the Maine coast.  One of Gouldsboro's early and most influential citizens was David Cobb of Massachusetts, a hero of the American Revolution who served as General Washington's aide during the British surrender at Yorktown.  As the war neared its end and American independence was secured, General Washington urged his aide to leave rocky and cold New England and make his future in Virginia, which he argued had a superior climate and more fertile soil. With his sights already set on Maine, Colonel Cobb replied, ``Sir, we have our heads and our hands.''  That is the spirit that made a thriving town out of the wilderness more than two centuries ago and that sustains a vibrant community today. It is a pleasure to congratulate the people of Gouldsboro, ME, on their 225th anniversary and to wish them all the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
