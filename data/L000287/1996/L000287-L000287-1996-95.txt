Mr. Speaker, real wages are down. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Families are having a hard time finding the money to send their children to college, to save for retirement, to make ends meet.  Finally, Republicans are taking note. They sound like Democrats talking about the middle class.  Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. Democrats raise the minimum wage, Republicans cut taxes for rich friends. Democrats vote for education and job training, Republicans raise taxes on working families.  Republicans help the rich and hurt the rest of us. They voted against Social Security, against Medicare. Senator Dole even brags about voting against Medicare.  Republicans have started to talk about helping the middle class. It is time to do something about it.  Raise the minimum wage. Invest in education. Protect the pensions of working families.  Republicans have started to talk the talk. It is time for them to walk the walk.                          ____________________
