Mr. Chairman, I am particularly disappointed that none of the proposed budgets offered today address the serious problems facing Social Security. Setting aside the surplus coming in to Social Security actually does nothing to avert Social Security's insolvency. I think there is a greater understanding in this body in the last few years about the serious problems that Social Security faces in the future. Because of that increased understanding, I am even more disappointed in the unwillingness of Members to address Social Securities unsolvency. Suggesting the budget provides for paying down all the available ``public debt'' is actually a negative for me. It means we won't be using the surplus for fixing Social Security.  Social Security today has an unfunded liability of $9 trillion and we need to solve the problem now. That $9 trillion unfunded liability translates in terms of future dollars to an astounding shortage of a $120 trillion over the next 75 years. This means that there will be $120 trillion additional funding needed over and above the revenues coming in from the Social Security tax, if we are to maintain promised benefits over the next 75 years. The shortfalls are real. We know the number of people that are working now and will be entitled to benefits. We know the number of future workers and future retirees and therefore, the funding needed to fund benefits.  So, again Mr. Chairman, it should concern us all that we are not addressing this serious problem within the context of this budget--or any of the substitutes offered today.
