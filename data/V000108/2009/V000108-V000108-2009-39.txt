An extraordinary soloist, Irene's serene vocals touched the hearts and lifted the spirits of countless residents of Northwest Indiana and beyond, and through her remarkable gift, she served her community in a way that very few people can. Unfortunately, Mrs. Day-Comer passed away on Monday, February 2, 2009, at the age of 86, but her music will forever remain in the hearts and spirits of those fortunate enough to have heard her sing.  Born in the rural farming community of Marks, Mississippi, Irene's family, like many African American families at the time, fled the South in search of better opportunities in more industrialized areas of the country. After arriving in Northwest Indiana, Irene's family made their home in East Chicago, Indiana. Born into a family of deep spiritual faith and religious conviction, it was at Antioch Baptist Church in East Chicago where Mrs. Day-Comer's extraordinary gift and love for sacred music would emerge. At Antioch, she was a member of the Junior Red Circle and Baptist Training Circle and was active in various choirs and ensembles. During her younger years, Irene attended Columbus Elementary School and Washington High School, where she was a member of the highly esteemed Paul Robeson Glee Club. Encouraged by her mentor and pastor, the late Dr. Vincent McCutcheon, Mrs. Day-Comer went on to study at the Moody Bible Institute and the American Baptist Theological Seminary Extension in Chicago.  By the age of eight years old, Irene's passion for music and unquestionable talent was already clear to those who heard her pristine voice. This passion would carry on to her adult life, where she would continue to serve her community through her songs of faith, hope, and inspiration. She gained acclaim from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, who heard her sing after speaking at Antioch in 1981. After this, Reverend McCutcheon and a group of local churches were able to raise enough funds for Irene and pianist, Marilyn Hairston, to record her historic debut album, Irene Day--He's Everywhere, in 1982. This outstanding compilation of sacred songs allowed even more people the joyous opportunity to hear her exceptional voice, and after being re-released in 2002 in the wake of the tragedy of September 11, an entirely new generation was introduced to her uplifting spirit.  A woman whose life and talent spread far beyond the borders of Northwest Indiana, Mrs. Day-Comer received many accolades for her artistry and her service to the community. In 1982, Irene was honored by the City of East Chicago for her contributions to the community, and July 8 was proclaimed Irene Day Day. In 1985, she was recipient of the prestigious Monroe-Master Dedication Commission Award bestowed by the African Methodist Episcopal Church for her efforts to aid and inspire others. Irene was also honored nationally in 1982 following the release of her album with commendations from the Congressional Black Caucus, the late Congressman Adam Benjamin, Jr., Senator Richard Lugar, and former Vice President Dan Quayle.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a great American artist and citizen, Mrs. Irene Day-Comer, for sharing her outstanding talents with the people of Indiana's First Congressional District and beyond. Irene Day-Comer's remarkable gift brought joy and hope to all who listened to her songs, and I ask that you join me in remembering her today.                          ____________________
