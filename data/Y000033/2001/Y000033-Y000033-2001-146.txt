Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time.  I hope people are listening to what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Shaw) had to say. We are setting up an unconstitutional thing of two-tiered citizenry. I hope we understand what that does. It means one can be a citizen, but one cannot work unless they have been a citizen for 5 years. They have already gone through the process and held up their hand, but they cannot work under that bill.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of my bill. It is appropriate. It is the right thing to do. It makes the original bill, the base bill, better. It is a bill that, as I say, should be passed.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
