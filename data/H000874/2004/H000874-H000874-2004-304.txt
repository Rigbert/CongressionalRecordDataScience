Speaker, I yield to my friend, hopefully for assurances that that will happen.  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Speaker, and I would just point out to the gentleman that the transportation bill has always been a very bipartisan bill. I would not expect anything different in the process of going through the conference committee and meetings of the conferees than has been in the past. Both sides of the aisle here and both sides of the rotunda are very interested in keeping that bipartisanship, so I would be very surprised and would oppose having meetings that did not include everybody that was appointed to the conference committee.
