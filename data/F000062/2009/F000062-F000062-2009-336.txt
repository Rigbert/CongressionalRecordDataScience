 President, I rise today to introduce a series of bills, S. 762, S. 763, and S. 764, designed to better prepare for catastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently devastated Southwestern Australia andthat have plagued much of our country for years.  California has seen unprecedented devastation from wildfires in the last 5 years.  Over 10,000 families have lost their homes.  Over 4 million acres have been burned.  In 2007, wildfires in Southern California caused the evacuation of an estimated 750,000 people--the largest evacuation in California history.  In these fires alone, more than a million acres burned, and more than 2,000 homes were destroyed.  These fires killed nine people, and injured 130. Mostly firefighters.  The financial damage is estimated to be in the billions.  Simply put, this was a disaster of epic proportions.  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire losses just 5 years ago.  We must face the fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California's future, and the future of other States.  Experts predict that things are only going to get worse in the years to come.  Global warming, extended droughts, dangerous invasive species outbreaks, and years of poor forest and fuel management have all contributed to the explosive conditions that we now face.  The reality is that California and much of the West is tinder-dry. Fires are larger, and they burn hotter and with more intensity.  In early February we saw the tragic consequences of catastrophic wildfire in Australia. Two hundred are dead, a million acres burned, and whole communities were wiped out in a matter of hours.  Here in the U.S. we face that very same possibility, and we must do everything we can to stop a similar tragedy from devastating our neighborhoods.  The problem is that more and more people are living in areas at high risk of wildfire. There are more than 5 million homes in California alone in this high-threat ``wildland-urban interface.'' Across the rest of the country, there are nearly 40 million more homes located in the wildland urban interface.  So the question comes: What can be done?  There is no doubt that we cannot fully eliminate wildfires.  But I believe that we can take steps now to better protect communities, to improve firefighting capabilities, and to improve relief and recovery aid.  The three bills that I am introducing today will get this process started. They are the Fire Safe Communities Act, which would establish new incentives for communities at risk of wildfires to adopt responsible building codes and mitigation practices.  The Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act, to make sure that qualified individuals, displaced by major disasters, are able to make their mortgage and rental payments.  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act, to increase the amount of federal dollars available to homeowners whose rebuilding costs outstrip their insurance coverage.  The Fire Safe Communities Act will help protect our communities from the catastrophic effects of wildfires.  Most importantly, it does three key things.  It gives incentives to local communities that have adopted responsible fire-mitigation plans by allowing for greater federal reimbursement of firefighting costs during major fires.  It creates a grant program to encourage responsible development practices that meet wildland-urban interface code guidelines.  It allows for the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture to collaboratively work on mitigation projects that will protect homes on State and private lands  In effect, the Federal Government would become the partner of local governments as they seek to make their communities fire-safe.  As I have said, we can never stop wildfires. But we can take important steps to make these fires less destructive.  This bill starts with the first step, by putting a reliable, unambiguous definition to ``Fire Safe'' communities.  Current Wildland fire codes, such as those produced by the International Code Council and the National Fire Protection Association, compile a comprehensive set of best practices that can be adopted by communities that are looking to protect themselves from fire damage. If properly implemented, these codes can greatly improve the fire resistance of these communities and their residents.  The fire code guidelines address water supply, construction materials and techniques, defensible space, vegetation management, and infrastructure standards.  The target mitigation measures in fire codes have been proven to be effective. Firefighter groups, insurance companies, and blue ribbon panels have all come to the same conclusions. It is time that we take their advice and start making this important investment.  The bill authorizes a $25 million per year grant program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, FEMA, Office of Grants, and Training.  It will help communities implement these standards, and bring the safest development practices to their neighborhoods.  This grant program will be available to local governments located in the wildlife-urban interface, and to high-threat regions that have adopted--or plan to adopt--these responsible firesafe measures.  As further incentive, this bill makes the existing Fire Management Assistance Grants program contingent on the implementation of Firesafe codes, standards and ordinances.  Today under the Fire Management Assistance Grant program, the federal government covers 75 percent of the cost of fighting wildfires.  Under this bill, communities that adopt the firesafe codes would be eligible for Federal reimbursement of up to 90 percent of their firefighting costs.  It is important to note that firesafe building codes, standards and ordinances are not mandatory. The Federal Government should not be in the business of telling local governments how and where to build their buildings.  Instead these are voluntary codes; communities can choose to adopt, or not to adopt, at their discretion.  The bill does not step on the toes of local government. Rather, helps all of us reach a common goal.  I come from local government--I am 9 years a mayor, 9 years a county supervisor--and I recognize that zoning is the province of local government.  But we have a real problem here: We know that development in the wildland-urban interface is accelerating, and it is making fires more costly.  We need to take steps to improve fire safety in these areas.  This bill is an important step toward becoming better prepared.  Now I want to discuss two bills intended to improve recovery aid after disaster strikes.  The Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act will provide much-needed relief to working families hit hard by disasters.  It would authorize FEMA to make mortgage and rental assistance available for qualified individuals in communities designated as disaster areas by the President under the Stafford Act.  It is based on an important point: While catastrophic wildfires and other disasters can destroy homes, they don't relieve people of the financial obligations that come with home ownership or lease agreements.  In most cases, these payments must still be made, even if the residence has been wiped out.  This burden is too much for many working families. They incur additional expenses--such as hotel or lodging costs--that come with being displaced following a major disaster.  FEMA used to provide mortgage and rental assistance. But these types of assistance were eliminated by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.  This bill would re-authorize the program, and make several changes to ensure that assistance is provided only to those most in need.  First, to qualify for assistance applicants must demonstrate that they face significant economic hardships and suffered disaster-related income loss.  The disaster-related income loss must fit into one of the following categories: your employer, or your own business, must be located in the area declared a major disaster by the President; you lose your job because youremployer or business has a significant business relationship with a company located within the Presidentially declared disaster area; or you live in a Presidentially declared disaster area, and have suffered financially due to travel restrictions and road closures post-disaster.  To qualify for this aid, applicants must also provide proof that their employment was discontinued as a result of disaster.  They must also show imminent delinquency, eviction, dispossession, or foreclosure.  Finally, this assistance is available only for up to 18 months, and is subject to income caps.  Only households with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, in high-cost states such as California, would be eligible.  Households in lower-cost States could be eligible if their annual adjusted gross incomes do not exceed $75,000.  In today's market conditions, the federal government needs to make sure that we do everything we can to help families stay in their homes.  The Mortgage and Rental Assistance Act will prevent foreclosures in disaster areas by helping families make their payments on time. Given the state of the housing market, this bill is of the utmost importance and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act would increase the amount of money FEMA can provide--for rebuilding and temporary housing--in high-cost states such as California.  It is designed to help disaster victims whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage. Or for low income earners who have no insurance.  Sadly, many Californians hit by wildfires or other disasters learn too late that their insurance coverage is insufficient.  This is a real problem in California. In fact, California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner estimates that as many as 25 percent of the victims of the 2007 wildfires were underinsured.  Let me be clear: this bill will not cover the full costs of rebuilding.  But it will help close the gap, for qualified households in areas declared by the President to be disaster areas.  Today, FEMA can provide up to roughly $28,000 to individuals and households whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage. This assistance can be used for rebuilding costs, as well as temporary housing.  The Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act would increase this amount to $50,000 for individuals who earn less than $100,000 per year. By increasing the amount of assistance, and targeting the program toward lower-income homeowners, the FEMA Disaster Assistance program will more efficiently help homeowners recover from disasters.  The legislation also gives the President the discretion to increase this cap, if necessary, to cover rebuilding expenses in high-cost states.  I believe this bill will provide an important step toward giving Americans the chance they need to rebuild their lives after suffering through a major disaster.  Catastrophic wildfires are not going away. In fact, the evidence strongly suggests they will occur with greater frequency and ferocity.  But we can take important steps--now--to make our communities safer.  To strengthen our firefighting capabilities.  To ensure that more relief and recovery aid is provided to victims, so they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.  These bills are not a panacea. But they are an important first step. I urge my colleagues to vote for them.                                 ______                                       By
