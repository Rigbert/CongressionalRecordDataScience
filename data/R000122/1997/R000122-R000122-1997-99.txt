President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which is included, I believe, in the managers' amendment, with the concurrence of the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina.  The thrust of my amendment is to confront an issue which is growing--the issue of slamming--where individuals who have signed up for long distance telephone service have their service changed illegally. This is a growing problem, a problem that we must confront. It is a problem that--in fact, as I considered it, I also contemplated the construction of an amendment to this appropriations bill that would have dealt with the problem by mandating better proof that a customer has actually changed service, including criminal penalties for slamming, and other deterrences.  As I spoke with my colleagues and law enforcement officials, I came to realize, through many different viewpoints, that an amendment at this time would delay the appropriations process. So rather than introducing an amendment, I have proposed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which, again, I believe has been accepted and will be maintained within the managers' agreement.  Before going forward, I commend and thank the chairman, Senator Gregg, and the ranking member, Mr. Hollings, and also Chairman McCain and Chairman Burns for their generous assistance in this endeavor.
