Mr. Chairman, again reclaiming my time, I do not believe it does that. What we have attempted to do, and may I stress the fact again that this person the IDQ has been given to by the council, and all of this helps pay for the cost of the administration of that program. That is all it does. And no more money goes to the general Treasury and there is no more added cost.  Mr. Chairman, we are not going to balance the deficit on this. I truthfully think that if we are going to talk on this floor about mining royalties, about below-cost timber sales, about all the other good things, then we ought to be considering if we give someone an exclusive right. Now remember, I am not talking about all the fishing fleet. I am talking about the exclusive right, exclusive to catch that fish. He excludes everyone else; then he has told us that he would be willing to pay a share to manage this program.                              {time}  1200  I have heard no objection from this. This is why I am surprised at the amendment, frankly.  In the hearings we heard none. I can ask the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentleman from California, the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Gejdenson], which I am reluctant to ask anything, but if in reality did they hear at any time, and I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut, being that I mentioned his name, I will yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.
