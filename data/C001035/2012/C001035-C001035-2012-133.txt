I agree with them. I supported the amendment offered by Senator Lieberman, but I also encourage my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Senator Shelby. It would take in the independent regulatory agencies, and it goes a little bit deeper into the executive branch. So I think both principles are correct--that the kind of disclosures we are going to be required to make should also apply to high-level executive branch employees.  I thank both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Alabama for their leadership.
