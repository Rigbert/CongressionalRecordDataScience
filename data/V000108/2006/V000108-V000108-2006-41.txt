 Asian carp have been found in the Illinois River, which connects the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. To prevent the carp from entering the Great Lakes, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA and State of Illinois, the International Joint Commission and others are working together and have installed a permanent electric barrier between the fish and Lake Michigan.  Unfortunately, the first barrier or nonpermanent barrier has been shut down. I believe we should keep both open and running. However, the fixwould be legislating on an appropriations bill and would not be appropriate at this point.  Mr. Chairman, I do join the chairman and fully support the gentlewoman's intent to solve this problem. I appreciate your bringing it again to our attention.
