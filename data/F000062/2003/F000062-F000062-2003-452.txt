 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true hero--to one of the first Americans to have fallen in combat in Iraq and make the ultimate sacrifice. His name: Jose Gutierrez, a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was just 22 years old.  Corporal Gutierrez arrived in the United States when he was a 16 year old orphan, having left poverty-stricken circumstances in Guatemala City and a country racked by a brutal civil war.  He traveled over 2,000 miles by foot, north through Mexico, in search of a better life here in the United States.  Like so many immigrants, his past was soon eclipsed by his new life as an American. He was taken in by the Mosquera family of Lomita, CA. Nora and Max Mosquera had begun helping immigrant foster children when their own children had grown.  ``He joined the Marines to pay back a little of what he'd gotten from the U.S.,'' Max Mosquera said. ``For him it was a question of honor.''  A tall and quiet young man who enjoyed soccer and chess, Jose learned English quickly and had plans to study architecture.  He became an infantry rifleman with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. He enlisted exactly 1 year ago, on March 25, 2002, and arrived at Camp Pendleton, CA, in early September.  Corporal Gutierrez died in battle, around 4 a.m. on Friday. He was struck by enemy fire while fighting alongside fellow marines near the southern Iraqi port city of Umm al Qasr.  ``He was such a good kid,'' remembered Robert Nobles, a physical education teacher at North High in Torrance, where Corporal Gutierrez graduated in 2000.  I have been told that news of his death has resonated throughout Guatemala. Every major newspaper, radio and TV station carried his story. He has been portrayed as a brave and selfless young man--which he most certainly was.  I have also heard that it has been difficult to locate his one blood relative, his sister, who still lives in poverty in Guatemala City. The sister is arranging to have his body sent back to Guatemala, whereas a social worker in Los Angeles, Wendy Perlera, an acquaintance of Corporal Gutierrez, wants to bring his body back to L.A.  Wherever Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez is finally laid to rest--in the country of his birth or the country which he was willing to give his life for--he will not be forgotten.  Our thought and our prayers are with his family--with his sister in Guatemala and with the Mosquera family, who provided him with the emotional and financial support to pursue his dreams.  The fact that he died so young--just 22--is tragic. Indeed, the loss of any young life is a tragedy. The fact that he was willing to fight--and die--for his adopted homeland, has earned him the lasting admiration of Americans everywhere.                          ____________________
