 At the beginning of this administration, the President proposed terminating RFE/RL. That decision was reversed in the spring of 1993. And that summer, the President proposed consolidating all U.S. sponsored international broadcasts. Congress accepted it. And we ordered budget cuts. We cut the costs. The reason it is $175 million, $100 million more that the request for Fiscal 1996, is that it costs more--in the current fiscal year--to reduce the size of the radios. That is what it cost under German law to reduce the operation. We are bound under German law. When we lay off people and fire people under German law, we are required to pay this severance pay. That is the reason why it is more money this year and drops to $75 million next year.  Thirdly, I point out to my friend from Iowa, he did vote for and we did vote for Radio Free Asia. We authorized the establishment of a new service last year, and began appropriating money last year. We did it because there is censorship in China and the other communist countries in Asia; because there is a gerontocracy in Beijing that does not let people express their points of view. We did do that. So he is ahead of himself without even realizing it. We did in fact vote and have voted to guarantee that where there is censorship in the world, we will be involved to the extent that we can.  So, Mr. President, if we do not send troops, and we are not going to send money, and we are not going to send information, and we are not going to send access to the truth, what the heck are we going to do?
