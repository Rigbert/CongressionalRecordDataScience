Speaker, consider this scenario: ``The formation of a free and democratic society is being hampered by internal and external strife. The drafting of a constitution encounters opposition and various parties within the country are struggling for power. The economy is underdeveloped and there is little order. The people are unsure of their future and this promise of democracy. It would take decades for this democracy to truly flourish and become the republic that it is today.'' That's the history of America, Mr. Speaker. The people of Iraq, a year after their liberation, are facing many of the same obstacles of early Americans. However, they have accomplished more in one year than the United States accomplished in a decade--they have drafted a working constitution that guarantees freedom of religion and worship, freedom of expression, freedom to peacefully assemble and demonstrate, freedom to organize political parties, freedom to join unions and the right to equal treatment under the law. This progress is unprecedented.  365 days ago, our troops, along with other coalition forces, entered the country of Iraq to liberate a badly battered and abused population. Our troops performed with determination and tenacity: they were given their mission and performed brilliantly. Now, because of their accomplishment, 24 million people live in a country that has voiced its dedication to freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, there are those in this country that lack the same resolve to freedom and democracy. At the first sign of opposition and test of honor they run and hide behind words such as ``quagmire.'' This wavering support is disheartening at best and it undermines the incredible accomplishments of our troops, especially those that have made the ultimate sacrifice. It also undermines the determination of the Iraqi people to establish a democracy--deeming them incapable and incompetent.  Even as we speak here today, progress is being made in Iraq. As chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee I've visited Iraq and witnessed first-hand their accomplishments. With our help, they have surpassed prewar peak electrical generation levels and are on track to be generating at 140 percent over their prewar level by June. Water facilities are currently operating at 65 percent of prewar levels, mostly due to years of neglect, electricity shortages and post-war looting of plant and emergency generators. Current projects include the rehabilitation of 15 water treatment facilities and portions of the Sweet Water Canal to Basrah. These projects will benefit over 14.5 million Iraqis and provide a future for water reliability.  One year ago this country, along with our allies, made the decision to topple a tyrannical regime, liberate a people, and help build a democracy in the heart of a terrorist breeding ground. Our troops have done, and continue to do, their part. It is time for all leaders in America to do their part: we must stand by the Iraqi people and government as they begin their long and challenging journey towards freedom. Our own past demonstrates that democracy is messy; at times there will be setbacks and frustrations, but in the end, freedom is worth every sacrifice.                          ____________________
