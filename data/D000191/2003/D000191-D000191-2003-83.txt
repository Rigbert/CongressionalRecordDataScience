Speaker, during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, we had great assurances from the President and his staff that in the aftermath the United States would not be tagged with the bill.  Press Secretary Ari Fleischer: ``It is a rather wealthy country. Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden of their own reconstruction.''  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, arguably the godfather of this policy: ``There is a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people. The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 billion and $100 billion over the course of the next 2 or 3 years. We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.''  Then, of course, the wonderful Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld: ``I do not believe the United States has responsibility for reconstruction. In a sense, funds can come from those various sources I mentioned: frozen assets, oil revenues and a variety of others things, including the Oil for Food program.''  Well, what a difference a few months makes. The President has presented the second bill for Iraq, $70 billion last April, and now another $87 billion that he wants this Congress to borrow on behalf of the American people to spend for the ongoing conflict and to rebuild that country.  That is right, borrow. We are going to obligate Americans for the next 30 years to pay for the rebuilding of Iraq. Apparently, it is necessary when creating a democratic and civil society that there be massive investment in public works, public infrastructure, schools, hospitals, universal health care, telecommunications, ports, rail, water, all those things; and the American people should borrow the money, according to the President, to do those things so that the Iraqi people can move toward a democratic and civil society.  But, unfortunately, according to the President, it is not necessary to do those things and pay for those things and not advisable to borrow the money to do those things to pay for the continuance of a democratic and civil society here in the United States of America.  Yes, he says we can borrow $20.3 billion to do all those things in Iraq, but we cannot afford it here. We are borrowing money to pay tens of thousands of Iraqis to have no-show, no-work jobs, to provide stability, but the President says we cannot draw on the Unemployment Trust Fund, the $16 billion balance on taxes we have paid, to give extended unemployment benefits to Americans.  On a per capita basis, the United States is going to spend ten times as much per citizen in Iraq on drinking water as it will in the United States, despite the D-minus grade that our water infrastructure has, despite the unfunded mandates on rural communities that cannot afford to meet those Federal requirements. Two times as much for water resource projects, ten times as much for sewer and drinking water.  Iraqis will receive 300 times as much to put together a reliable electricity system in their country. Did the President not notice, I guess they have generators at the White House and Camp David, he did not notice that the lights went out in the eastern United States, but they did because of a crumbling and underinvested infrastructure. We are going to spend 300 times as much per citizen in Iraq. Thirteen times as much for medical infrastructure.  In the little port of Umm Qasr over there, we are about to borrow from the American people another $45 million to further upgrade that port, at the same time that the President cannot find $8 million to dredge ports in Southern Oregon. We just do not have the money to keep those ports open, he says, but we can borrow $45 million to further improve Umm Qasr, into which we have already dumped $50 million.  Then there is the Mawizeh marsh. The President wants to borrow on behalf of the American people $50 million to restore a marsh. Well, we have big huge controversy over the Klamath marsh and that area in Oregon, and we need $25 million to move toward resolving that controversy. But the President says that money is not here in the United States of America, but he will borrow $50 million to restore a marsh in Iraq.  Then there is the horrible problem of Basra and Umm Qasr. Their water supply comes through an open ditch, only half of which is lined. Of course, my city of Albany gets its water through an open ditch, none of which is lined. So it is an emergency that the American people borrow $200 million for Umm Qasr and Basra so they can have a modern water supply system, but, sorry, there is no money for Albany, Oregon, and hundreds of other communities across this country.  Apparently it is necessary, the President says, to borrow these funds on behalf of this generation and future generations of Americans so that Iraqis can live a better life, but we cannot afford to do similar projects here in the United States of America, to put Americans to work. If that money were spent here in the United States of America, it would put 1 million people to work, but that is not on the President's radar screen.                          ____________________
