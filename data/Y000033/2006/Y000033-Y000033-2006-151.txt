Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind him, if you look at any of the studies that are taking place now, the polar bear pack is very healthy and, in fact, increasing. Keep that in mind. Read something that really has some merit to it. Do not just read the fear tactic. This is science from the Fish and Wildlife people. Read that. They will tell you we are increasing the numbers, not decreasing. Where you got this idea, I have no idea. Because someone told you that.
