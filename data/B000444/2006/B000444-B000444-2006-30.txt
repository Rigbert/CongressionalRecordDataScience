 President, if I understand the parliamentary situation properly, and I am not sure I do, I ask unanimous consent that following the offering of the Ensign amendment, the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair so that it may reconvene pursuant to the previous order.  I further ask that the following Senate staff be permitted to attend the closed session, and I send the list to the desk.  The list is as follows:       Mike Disilvestro; Joel Breitner; Mary Jane McCarthy; Paul      Nelson; Richard Verma; Stephen Rademaker; Marcel Lettre;      Nancy Erickson; Lynne Halbrooks; Scott O'Malia; Pam Thiessen;      Thomas Moore; Lynn Rusten; Ed Corrigan; Rexon Ryu; Ken Myers      III; Ken Myers, Jr; Brian McKeon; Ed Levine; Madelyn Creedon;      Nancy Stetson; Diane Ohlbaum; Anthony Blinken; Janice      O'Connell.
