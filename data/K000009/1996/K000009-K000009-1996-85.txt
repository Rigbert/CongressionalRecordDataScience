Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rabbi Edward and Sara Garsek as they leave our community after more than 20 years of service. Since 1975, Rabbi Garsek has served as the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Congregation Etz Chayim in Toledo. In that capacity he has earned the admiration and respect of the entire Jewish community and beyond that all of the citizenry of our city. Through these years he and his wife Sara have worked lovingly and consistently to raise the spirituality of their extended Toledo family.  An integral part of the Garseks' roles as rabbi and rebbetzin has been as teachers--filling an enormous need in our community, teaching audit education courses, Hebrew High School, Community Hebrew School, as well as Sunday religious school. The benefit of their professionalism is most keenly felt at the Hebrew Academy of Toledo, where they meet daily with their pupils. They will be long remembered by their students.  Rabbi Garsek leads his congregation with a wonderful sense of humility, a warm sense of humor, and a passionate love of Israel--the People and the State. Sara is his perfect complement, a tower of strength in her knowledge, believe, and devotion to the words of the Torah. We in Toledo know them to live by the words of Hillel, ``Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; be one who loves human beings and draws them near to Torah.''  Rabbi and Sarah Garsek came to Congregation Etz Chayim bringing with them three very young girls, Chaya, Esther, and Devorah. Over the years, they have been blessed with four more beautiful children, Zev, Shoahana, Rachael, and Yitzchak; a son-in-law, David; and two grandsons, Bentzion and Akiva.  Rabbi and Sara Garsek will be missed, but we know their presence will grace their new community as it has ours.                          ____________________
