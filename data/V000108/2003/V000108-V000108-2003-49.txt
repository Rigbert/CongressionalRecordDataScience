Speaker, it is with the greatest honor and pride that I congratulate the St. Joseph's Carmelite Home for Girls in East Chicago, Indiana as they celebrate their 90th anniversary. On September 27, 2003, the women of St. Joseph's and other community members will gather together for a reunion of gratitude and friendship during their 90th Jubilee Celebration.  In 1913, the vision of St. Joseph's Carmelite Home for Girls became a reality when Mother Mary Theresa of St. Joseph was granted permission from Bishop Herman Alerding to actively work with the poor children of Lake County. It was the generous donation of two small frame houses by Mr. Walter Riley, chairman of the First National Bank in East Chicago that brought the home to life. The two small houses became homes to some seventy children and at the time both boys and girls lived in the homes.  St. Joseph's Carmelite Home for Girls began as an orphanage, grew to a group home, and today provides residential treatment to many Northwest Indiana girls. It was in 2001 that the doors of the Holy Innocents Center and Emergency Shelter opened to newborns, infants, toddlers, as well as young children in need.  Sister Maria Giuseppe, the home's administrator, along with six nuns, four postulants, and 45 lay people, give support, guidance, and comfort to over 50 young girls who are now in residence at the home. Their selfless dedication to the girls in the home, as well as all the citizens of East Chicago, is an outstanding model for all Americans.  With my father Mr. John Visclosky as a former member of the Carmelite Home's board of directors, I know firsthand the importance of St. Joseph's Carmelite Home for Girls to the Northwest Indiana community. The generosity and love that the St. Joseph Carmelite Home provides for its residents is remarkably selfless and giving and deserves the highest recognition.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. Joseph's Carmelite Home for Girls as they celebrate their 90th anniversary. Their sincere commitment to the children of East Chicago and all of Northwest Indiana is worthy of the highest gratitude and admiration. I am truly honored to represent such exceptional and giving citizens in Congress.                          ____________________
