Is it not true historically that when we are in the midst of a national security challenge or crisis, and questions of civil liberties arise, that many times we do not want to face them head on; that it is not until later in history that we look back and say we should have asked harder questions, questions about the suspension of civil liberties in wartime, questions about internment camps, questions about policies that we followed?  If I understand what the Senator is seeking in this amendment, it is to say at this point in time what we are asking for is a disclosure of those people who have been detained and arrested and are in special status, whose rights at least may be compromised because of our concern about national security; and that disclosure is all that this amendment is about, giving the administration the last word and determination as to which names might be held back and not disclosed because of security concerns.
