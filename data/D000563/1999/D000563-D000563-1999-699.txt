President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes Patricio Rojas. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Janina and Diogenes, who face deportation later this month to the Dominican Republic as a result of a technicality in current federal immigration law.  Janina has been denied citizenship because her mother was the child of a U.S. citizen female and foreign male. Previous law allowed only children of U.S. citizen males and foreign females to claim U.S. citizenship.  In 1994, Senator Paul Simon passed the Immigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act, which allowed individuals born overseas before 1934 to U.S. citizen mothers, and their descendants, to claim U.S. citizenship. As a result of that 1994 law, Janina's mother received U.S. citizenship in January 1996.  However, when Janina attempted to attain citizenship as a descendant of a direct beneficiary of this legislation, her application was denied. Despite the 1994 law, the Immigration and Naturalization Service required that Janina's mother meet transmission requirements: she must have been physically present in the U.S. for 10 years prior to Janina's birth, 5 of which over the age of 16 years, in order for Janina to derive citizenship. Since her mother was prohibited from becoming a U.S. citizen until 1996, however, this requirement is unreasonable.  While 60 years of discriminatory law was corrected in 1994, the citizenship qualifications of the line of descendants of those U.S. citizen females remain adversely impacted. The private relief bill I introduce today will grant Janina and her husband Diogenes permanent resident status to continuetheir lives in this country until this provision can be amended.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 520       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes      Patricio Rojas, shall be held and considered to have been      lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent      residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon      payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Janina      Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes Patricio      Rojas, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State shall      instruct the proper officer to reduce by the appropriate      number during the current fiscal year the total number of      immigrant visas available to natives of the country of the      aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By
