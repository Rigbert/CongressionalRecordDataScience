 This is one of the great days in the Senate. When you work on something for a long time, and you find yourself cut out year after year, you are determined you are going to persevere to find new ways to do it, and for Senator Snowe and for me, it is a very special day. I thank everyone for making it possible for all of us in the United States.  I yield the floor.
