President, I stand on the Senate floor today in firm agreement with my colleagues that the Congress must do more to combat the scourge of sex trafficking. It is a profound and tragic failure of American institutions that trafficking continues to plague our country and, in fact, has actually increased.  Federal law enforcement has failed to root out and prosecute the traffickers, even when they have been operating in plain sight. So, too, have the big internet companies failed when it comes to sex traffickers who operate on their platforms.  I fear that the legislation before the Senate now is going to be another failure. I fear that it is going to do more to take down ads than to take down traffickers. I that fear it will send these monsters, these evil people who traffic beyond the grasp of law enforcement to the shadowy corners of the dark web, a place where every day search engines don't go, and it is going to be even easier for criminals--these vicious traffickers--to find a safe haven for their extraordinarily evil acts.  In many respects, this debate mirrors one the Congress went through a little bit more than 20 years ago. Back then, I think it would be fair to say that not many Senators knew much about the internet. In 1995, this body had a laudable goal. The Senate said it wanted to protect kids from accessing pornography online, but the result of those good intentions was, unfortunately, a bad policy--a policy called the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  Behind that policy was a fundamental misunderstanding of both the architecture of the internet and the modern application of the First Amendment. The law didn't just go after those targeting pornography to minors. It took speech that was legal in the real world and made it illegal online. And it produced a paradise for the legal trickster, creating new ways to sue over speech and adversely affecting scores of Americans, medical providers, artists, writers of literature, and more.  As should happen with poorly written policy, all but one part of the Communications Decency Act was struck down by the Supreme Court. The one piece of the law left standing was section 230, which I coauthored with former Congressman Chris Cox. What section 230 was all about was laying out the legal rules of the road for the web. There were innovative new businesses sprouting up all over and novel forms of communication and media connecting and informing people in new ways. But it seemed clear that a quick way to strangle this promising set of developments in their infancy was for these new companies to be held legally liable for every piece of content that users posted on their platforms.  When section 230 was written, nobody could have foreseen all of the effects. Here is what we did know back then. First, we wanted small businesses to start out focusing on hiring engineers, developers, and designers rather than worrying about how they had to hire a team of lawyers.  Second, we wanted to make sure that internet companies could moderate their websites without getting clobbered by lawsuits. I think Democrats and Republicans would agree that this is a better scenario than the alternative, which means websites hiding their heads in the sand out of fear that they would be weighed down with liability.  Third, we wanted to guarantee that bad actors would still be subject to all of the Federal laws. Whether the criminals were operating on a street corner or online wasn't going to make a difference, and we were determined to state that explicitly.  Fourth, we wanted to protect the internet from the whims of State and local legislators. This body has the authority to regulate interstate commerce.  I would ask any of my colleagues to offer an example of how something could be more interstate than the internet.  It may not satisfy some publicity-seeking local official when we talk about the Federal Government's role here, but there is no question that the role of the Congress, in its leading on something that is clearly interstate in nature, is in the best interest of the American people.  For the most part, the framework worked better than I ever imagined it would. As a result of section 230, the small, gutsy entrepreneur--say an entrepreneur in North Carolina--who has a big dream of working out of his garage has a real shot at succeeding. Marginalized groups of vulnerable Americans have a better opportunity than ever to make their voices heard because of section 230, and small nonprofits have the ability to take their causes nationwide.  One scholar, David Post, even wrote that the 230 law created $1 trillion worth of economic value in the private economy. He said: ``It is impossible to imagine what the Internet ecosystem would look like today without it.''  My wife saw that article, looked at me and said: Well, dear, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds an acorn.  Setting aside spousal kidding, to illustrate why the protection that comes from section 230 is so important, I turn next to what things would be like without it.  Imagine if you are starting a forum site that is dedicated to discussing knitting. If ever there were a topic that sounded drama free, that would be it. Yet suppose somebody goes on the site and shares a pattern he didn't have the right to share. Suddenly, your website is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit. Maybe the controversy--knitting versus crocheting--gets overheated, and the users start trading barbs. Suddenly, you have people slinging defamation suits at your itty-bitty forum host. Then somebody is injured by an automatic needle threader he reads about in a comment thread. Suddenly, you are a codefendant in a liability suit--all because you didn't have the protection of section 230.  Imagine how hard it would be to launch a platform that would be open to the discussion of any topic when even the simplest, most narrowly focused website on the internet can become a magnet for lawsuits. There are not enough lawyers in the world to handle all of that litigation, and my sense is we will have a lot of constituents who will say: Thank God.  In the absence of section 230, the internet as we know it would shrivel. Only the platforms that are run by those with deep pockets and an even deeper bench of lawyers would be able to make it.  Moreover, section 230 is not just about hobbies and commerce. It protects the coordination of free speech, particularly among vulnerable groups of Americans. That is the reason organizations like the libertarian Cato Institute, the progressive Human Rights Campaign, and the ACLU have voiced serious concerns about the legislation before the Senate. You sure don't see those three groups lined up side by side very often, but they are here now. It is because, without the protections of section 230, civic organizations that exercise their right to free speech could be cowed by their more powerful political opponents.  For this example, imagine that a nonprofit organizes a campaign in support of a local ballot measure. It uses social media to build awareness and promote upcoming rallies and events with online discussion boards. Yet, without section 230, powerful interests that are opposed to its work can just swoop in and effectively silence that nonprofit with an onslaught of litigation. Hostile individuals could pose as supporters and make comments on the nonprofit's website that would expose the group to liability suits. I think it is pretty obvious that there would be an enormous, chilling effect on speech in America.  I ask unanimous consent that the statements from the Cato Institute and the ACLU that are in opposition to the legislation now before the Senate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From CATO at Liberty, Feb. 27, 2018]                     The Death of an Open Internet                           (By John Samples)       Today the House votes on the Fight Online Sex Trafficking      Act (FOSTA), a piece of anti-sex trafficking legislation. It      follows and incorporates an earlier effort by the Senate, the      Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA). The bill at issue      today is actually a last minute amendment by Representative      Mimi Walters (CA) that brings the worst elements of SESTA      into FOSTA, creating a hybrid bill far worse than the sum of      its parts. This bill has grave consequences for an open,      competitive internet and for some people who use it.       Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has long      shielded internet service providers from liability for user      generated content, facilitating the internet we know today.      FOSTA would likely reduce these protections. FOSTA creates a      new federal crime tied to the intent to promote sex      trafficking     using the internet. Alone, this might be considered an      acceptable, narrowly tailored measure. However, the Walters      amendment incorporates SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard of      liability, which withholds CDA Section 230 protections from      sites ``knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating''      sex-trafficking. SESTA's standard requires no intent to      facilitate sex trafficking, relying upon the mere knowledge      that one's app or blog has been used by bad actors.       Preemptive action, driven by effective platform moderation      and cooperation with law enforcement, remains the most      efficient way to combat online sex trafficking.      Unfortunately, FOSTA's incorporation of SESTA's ``knowingly''      standard would stymie this collaboration. If a platform      attempts to prevent sex trafficking by removing and reporting      offending user generated content, it risks establishing that      it had knowledge of the content, rendering it liable for      anything that might slip through the moderation process.      Instead of encouraging platforms to combat sex trafficking,      SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard punishes private attempts to      prevent the problem, and cripples broader attempts at      effective content moderation.       A combined FOSTA/SESTA would benefit established social      media platforms and trial lawyers at the expense of an open      internet while doing little to prevent sex trafficking.      Facebook may be well resourced enough to cope with the      increased legal risk imposed on hosts of user generated      content, but their nascent competitors are not. Attempts to      avoid running afoul of the ``knowingly'' standard will likely      lead to greater reliance on automated filtering.       Other issues have not received the attention they merit.      Libertarians (and others) often distinguish law from      morality. What is immoral need not be illegal. American law      in many jurisdictions does not honor that distinction and      criminalizes exchanging sex for payment. Some members of      Congress seem pleased this bill will better enforce those      laws against people who voluntarily engage in such exchanges.       The consequence of doing so, however, should please no one.      Members believe this bill will likely drive women who sell      sex for a living off the internet. For them, that is a      feature not a bug of the bill. But those engaged in the sex      trade are unlikely to give up their work. Instead they will      end up on the streets. Why does this change of venue matter?      Between 2002 and 2010, Craigslist introduced an ``erotic      services'' section on its front page which was used almost      exclusively to advertise illegal sex services. Three      economists found that this section led to a 17.4 percent      reduction in the homicide rate of the women in the relevant      jurisdiction. They also noted ``modest evidence'' that the      Craigslist section reduced female rape offenses. The      economists concluded this reduction in violence came from the      women moving indoors and matching more efficiently with safer      clients. This potential increase in violence and murder      should give pause to even those who deem selling sex immoral.       Congress has worked on these bills for some time through      their committees. Now both bills have been thrown together,      brought to the House floor, and are expected to become law,      all in a week or so. Instead of this rush, the House      Judiciary Committee could have finished its work, and the      whole House debated and voted on the measure. The Senate and      House then could have conferred and perhaps produced a bill      acceptable to all. That would be ``regular order'' for      Congress in lawmaking. It has once again been ignored.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2018.     Re Oppose H.R. 1865--The ``Allow States and Victims to Fight          Online Sex Trafficking Act''.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)      writes to express its opposition to H.R. 1865, the ``Allow      States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,''      also referred to as FOSTA, which passed the House on February      27 and may be considered by the full Senate in the coming      days or weeks. The bill is a serious, yet unsuccessful,      attempt to stop the use of the Internet for sex trafficking      without hindering online freedom of expression and artistic      innovation. Tech experts say that a thriving Internet      requires retaining certain liability protections for online      platforms providers. Victims' rights advocates, on the other      hand, say the sex trafficking problem requires narrowing      those protections. The bill misses the achievable legislative      opportunity to do both, and in particular leaves the Internet      exposed to the uncertain impact of changed protocols on the      part of platform providers.       For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's      guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and      communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and      liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United      States. With more than 2 million members, activists, and      supporters, the ACLU is a nationwide organization that fights      tirelessly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC      for the principle that every individual's rights must be      protected equally under the law, regardless of race,      religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national      origin.       The risks to the Internet as the world's most significant      marketplace of ideas outweigh the uncertain benefit of the      bill to the fight against sex trafficking. Accordingly, ACLU      opposes the bill. While the language of H.R. 1865 has been      improved to address some of the ambiguities creating the most      significant risks, ACLU remains concerned that the bill, if      enacted, will foster an atmosphere of uncertainty among      online platform providers. This uncertainty will inhibit the      continued growth of the Internet as a place of creativity and      innovation.       The ACLU has long supported maintaining the statutory      immunity provisions of section 230 of the Communications Act      of 1934 in order to promote freedom of speech and expression.      Section 230 became one of the key factors enabling the robust      expansion of Internet-based speech, communications, and      commerce. It is a critical factor in maintaining the      Internet's diverse ecosystem of speech and art and advancing      economic and political dialogue. The rationale for liability      protections for online providers is that they should not      suffer criminal or civil liability merely for creating online      fora to which others may post content, even when some of      those communications turn out to be offensive or even      unlawful. Any liability should be on those who create and      post that content.       We opposed FOSTA's predecessor bill, an onerous bill that      would have drastically curtailed protections for online      publishers. FOSTA was revised in the House through the      efforts of a broad cross-section of victim advocates, law      enforcement, and tech experts. The current version creates a      new federal facilitation of prostitution crime, but would      still impact liability protections for online providers. As      finally approved, it also incorporated key aspects of the      Senate version of the bill.       ACLU opposed the Senate version of the bill, the ``Stop      Enabling Sex Traffickers Act'' (S. 1693, SESTA), but also      acknowledged improvements incorporated prior to final      committee approval. In particular, the modified version of      SESTA heightened the intent standard needed to establish a      criminal violation--a key distinction separating a typical      online platform provider from one that might inject itself      into the online content being posted to its platform. Also,      in authorizing state prosecutions notwithstanding the federal      liability protections for online platforms, the bill would      limit state prosecutions to those where the behavior violated      the federal law.       The changes to both the House FOSTA bill and the Senate      SESTA bill were the result of concerted advocacy efforts by      Internet and other tech experts who testified about the      critical importance played by section 230 protections. In the      days before the section 230 protections were adopted over two      decades ago, online providers were subject to lawsuits for      allowing the posting of content. The threats were so      financially significant that providers would simply bar the      posting of third party content, knowing they could never      fully insulate themselves from liability except by blocking      all content that might be offensive to some. Since the      adoption of section 230, online providers have been free to      curate their sites' content without fearing liability for      what others post.       Even with the improvements in both bills, ACLU continued to      oppose both measures because the risks to the vibrancy of the      Internet as a driver of political, artistic, and commercial      communication is real and significant. Moreover, there is      little to suggest that current law could not be used to find      and punish the bad actors who are truly facilitating online      sex traffickers. In fact there is at least one pending      federal court case that makes this very argument. There are a      host of state laws outlawing such behaviors and current      liability protections are intended to protect only those who      are simply providing a channel for others to use, not those      who are determining what is posted and who have a malicious      intent to do harm to others. Finally, ACLU is concerned that      the scope of the bill's language will encompass the actions      of sex workers who have no connection to trafficking      whatsoever within its enforcement, including effective harm      reduction and anti-violence tactics. Such an outcome is      directly contrary to the aims of bipartisan criminal justice      reformers who seek to limit the over-federalization of crime      where such crimes already exist at the state level.       For the foregoing reasons, the ACLU opposes H.R. 1865 as      approved by the House of Representatives. It poses a risk to      freedom of speech on the Internet as we have come to know it      while purporting to solve a problem that could be addressed      in other ways.       If you have questions or comments about ACLU's position on      this legislation, please contact First Amendment advisor      Michael Macleod-Ball.           Sincerely,                                                      Faiz Shakir,                                      National Political Director.
