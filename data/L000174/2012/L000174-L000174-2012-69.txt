I will be speaking later on to the senior Senator from North Dakota.  Mr. President, I have had the privilege to serve with several hundred Senators since coming here. I have put in a very small list those who are extraordinary both for their talents and for our personal friendship, and Kent Conrad is in that short list very easily. In fact, he defines it in many ways. Because of what we heard here, as I whispered to him a minute ago, it was nice to hear a grownup speak on the floor.  I have seen him reach across the aisle. We have been privileged, both of us have been privileged to serve with fine Senators from both parties. But Kent Conrad is unique. Marcelle and I value more than I could possibly say here our friendship with Kent and his wife Lucy and the 101st Senator, Dakota.  As I said, I will speak later about this Senator, but what we heard today was a real giant of the Senate speaking, and I hope all Americans will listen to the lesson he gave us.  I yield the floor.
