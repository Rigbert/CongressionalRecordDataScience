 Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding time to me.  The current situation regarding U.S. troop presence in Europe is very strange, because many countries in Europe are now far wealthier than the United States and are more than able to defend themselves. They do not need us.  In Europe, because their countries invest in health care, almost all Europeans have free or inexpensive health care. Yet in our country, 43 million Americans lack health care. In Europe, almost all young people are able to go to college free or very inexpensively. In our country, young people and their families are going deeply into debt.  It seems to me absolutely appropriate that Europe provide more funds for their own defense. If they do that, maybe we can join them and provide health care to all of our people, and free and inexpensive college education to our young people.
