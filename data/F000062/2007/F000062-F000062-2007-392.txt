 President. I rise today with Senator Hutchison to introduce legislation to reauthorize the extraordinarily successful Breast Cancer Research Stamp for two additional years.  Without Congressional action, this important stamp will expire on December 31 of this year.  This stamp deserves to be extended as it has proven to be highly effective.  Since 1998, over 747 million breast cancer research stamps have been sold--raising $53.76 million for breast cancer research.  California continues to be one of the leading contributors, purchasing over 47 million stamps with $3.6 million going to research--almost 15 percent of the nationwide contribution.  Furthermore, in September 2005, the General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report showing that the Breast Cancer Research Stamp has been a success and an effective fund-raiser in the effort to increase funds to fight the disease.  The report also indicated that ``grants funded by NIH and DOD using Breast Cancer Research Stamp proceeds have produced significant findings in breast cancer research.''  The National Institutes for Health and the Department of Defense have received approximately $36.7 million and $15.7 million, respectively, putting these research dollars to good use by funding innovative advances in breast cancer research.  For example, a 2002 Department of Defense Concept Award enabled researchers to develop Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) technology. This method of imaging helps surgeons determine if they have removed all cancerous tissue during breast cancer surgery.  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are becoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. Every dollar we continue to raise will help save lives.  One cannot calculate in dollars and cents how the stamp has focused public awareness on this terrible disease and the need for additional research funding.  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far reaching effects on our nation: breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women after skin cancer. More than three million women are living with breast cancer in the U.S. today, one million of who have yet to be diagnosed. Though much less common, over 1,700 men were diagnosed with breast cancer last year.  This legislations would: extend the authorization of the Breast Cancer Research stamp for two additional years--until December 31, 2009; allow the stamp to continue to have a surcharge of up to 25 percent above the value of a first-class stamp with the surplus revenues going to breast cancer research; not affect any other semi-postal proposals under consideration by the U.S. Postal Service.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Hutchison in passing this important legislation to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for another two years.  Until a cure is found, the money from the sale of this unique postal stamp will continue to focus public awareness on this devastating disease and provide hope to breast cancer survivors.  We ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation directly follow this statement in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 597       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF POSTAGE STAMP FOR BREAST                    CANCER RESEARCH.
