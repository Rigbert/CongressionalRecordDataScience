President, this amendment deletes a section I included in the bill entitled ``Moratorium on Antipersonnel Landmines.'' This section simply reaffirmed current law. Having received the assurance of the Armed Services Committee that the House conferees on the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization bill will recede to the Senate on the certification requirement relating to the landmine use moratorium that is in the House version of that bill, I am striking this section in the fiscal year 1997 Foreign Operations bill. This assures that current law, which provides that beginning in 1999 the United States will observe a 1-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines except in certain limited circumstances, remains in effect as originally adopted by the Senate by a vote of 67 to 27 on August 4, 1995.  I appreciate the efforts by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and his staff, who negotiated this agreement with the House conferees. I also want to thank the chairman of the House National Security Committee, Representative Spence, for his part.                           amendment no. 5024  (Purpose: To provide additional funds to support the International                         Development Association)       On page 177, line 24, after ``Jordan,'' insert the      following:       ``Tunisia,''       On page 178, line 2, after ``101-179'' insert the      following:       ``: Provided, That not later than May 1, 1997, the      Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on      Appropriations describing actions by the Government of      Tunisia during the previous six months to improve respect for      civil liberties and promote the independence of the      judiciary.
