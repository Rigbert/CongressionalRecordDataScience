 Focusing on the DOD bills, the authorization and the appropriation bill, technically, as I understand it, we have not gone to conference on either one of those at this point in time. One of the reasons is, I presume, that there will be a motion to instruct on the McCain amendment on one of those bills. Can the gentleman tell me when we might have a motion to go to conference? I know you have talked about them coming on the floor as conference reports, but in light of the fact we have not gone to conference yet, could the gentleman inform me as to when we might have a motion to go to conference?  I yield to my friend.
