Mr. Speaker, I do not do this lightly. In my period of time being in the majority, I have never rose opposing a rule, so this is a very serious moment for me. I want my side to understand why I am doing this and this side to understand also why I am doing it, and suggest a ``no'' vote on this rule.  House Joint Resolution 124 will continue to keep in place a spending limit of $27.7 billion on Federal aid to highway programs. Last month I agreed to this limitation; but I was clear that if the continuing resolution ran beyond December 31, I would move to strike the language.  This continuing resolution runs until January 11, 2003. That does not sound like a long time. However, we cannot be certain that the Congress will move quickly to enact appropriation bills in January.
