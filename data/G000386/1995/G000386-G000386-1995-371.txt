 President, again, I did not make my suggestion very clear to the Senator from Ohio because he kept concentrating on the word ``ensured.'' We could eliminate ``ensured'' and put in there ``to the extent practicable'' and that may solve the problem. I do not want to do that unless it will solve the problem because I think this is about as weak as you can get.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.
