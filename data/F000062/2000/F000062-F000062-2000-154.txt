 I go down to Otay Mesa where trucks are lined up by the thousands and you have Customs agents who maybe earn $45,000 or $50,000 a year--we know some trucks are loaded with tons of cocaine, with street values of millions of dollars--taking a bribe, maybe half a million dollars just to turn their head and let that truck go through.  This is where the corruption becomes so evil and where it is not just confined to jungle areas of Colombia or outposts in Mexico or anywhere else in the Andean region but comes right into the United States as well.
