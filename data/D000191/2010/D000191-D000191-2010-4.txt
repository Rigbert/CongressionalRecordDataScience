My constituents have insisted that chronic unemployment and the lagging economy be addressed by Congress; and yet sporting accomplishments have foolishly taken precedence on Capitol Hill. My ``present'' vote on H. Res. 176I does not connote any ill feelings toward Heisman Trophy winner Cameron Newton or the Auburn University athletic program. I appreciate the hard work and dedication exhibited by student athletes like Cameron Newton. However, I do not think that airing such appreciation on the House floor is the wisest use of time.
