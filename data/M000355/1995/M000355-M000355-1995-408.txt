 President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to honor an outstanding Kentuckian who recently passed away. Charlie Rodgers of Hopkins County, KY was an outstanding citizen as well as a leader in his profession and community.  Mr. Rodgers gave wholeheartedly to his community. Mr. Rodgers was the retired owner of Hales Furniture Store. During his lifetime he served as president of the Downtown Retail Merchants Association, president of the Rotary Club, chairman of the Salvation Army, and charter member of the Salvation Army Board of Directors. Mr. Rodgers was also the recipient of the Salvation Army's Other Award. He was a member of the Providence Rural Methodist Church and dedicated many hours to religious service.  Mr Rodgers was actively involved in both local and State level politics. He served as a leader in the development of the Republican Party in his county. Mr. Rodgers served on the State Board of Elections for two 4-year terms, and was as member of the State Republican Party for 20 years. Although he had always shown an interest in politics, he never sought election to public office until 1993 when he ran for the third district magistrate seat. He won this election upsetting a long time democratic stronghold.  While we all admire Mr. Rodgers' success in serving his community, church, and the Republican Party to the best of his ability, I believe that Charlie Rodgers was even more prosperous as an individual. All who encountered him knew that they were dealing with a true Kentucky gentlemen. He was looked upon as a very honest, kind, and compassionate man.  Charlie Rodgers, and his wife Peggy, are both long-time friends of mine. Mr. [[Page S3070]]  President, I can say with great certainty that his commitment to integrity and honesty was unwavering and shone through in everything that he was involved in.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Charlie Rodgers. Hopkins County will certainly miss his presence and sense of devotion. I am confident that Mr. Rodgers strength of character and breadth of accomplishment will remain a standard of excellence for generations to come.                          ____________________
