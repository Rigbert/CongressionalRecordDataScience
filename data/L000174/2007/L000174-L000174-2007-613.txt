I thank Senator Casey for expediting his consideration of this nomination. As a courtesy to Senator Specter, I asked the former majority leader to proceed to this nomination in December last year. Regrettably, Senator Frist chose not to do so and Senator Specter's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee ended without this nomination having been confirmed. I am glad that, at long last, the Senate has turned its attention to this nomination and is granting its consent. I thank Majority Leader Reid for acting promptly.
