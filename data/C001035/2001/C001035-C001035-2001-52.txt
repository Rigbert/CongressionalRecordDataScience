President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and my colleagues from Vermont, Senators Jeffords and Leahy, in introducing legislation to ensure that States like Maine and Vermont, which have taken the initiative in developing innovative programs to make prescription drugs more affordable for their citizens, can proceed with these efforts.  The last 20 years have witnessed dramatic pharmaceutical breakthroughs that have helped reduce deaths and disability from heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases. As a consequence, millions of people around the world are leading longer, healthier, and more productive lives. These new medical miracles, however, often come with hefty price tags, and many people--particularly lower Americans without prescription drug coverage--are simply priced our of the market.  As so often happens, the States have been the laboratories for reform in this area and have come up with some creative ways to address this problem. In January of this year, the Department of Health and Human Services granted Maine a waiver under the Medicaid program through which States can offer drug discounts of up to 25 percent for individuals with incomes up to three times the Federal poverty level. Our new Healthy Maine Prescriptions Program includes both this new discount prescription drug benefit and a separate benefit, financed entirely with State funds, that offers discounts of up to 80 percent for low-income elderly and the disabled. Maine began providing benefits under the Healthy Maine Prescription Program on June 1st of this year, and by June 26th the Department of Human Services had enrolled 50,460 individuals into the program. Ultimately, it is estimated that 225,000 Mainers qualify for the program.  Unfortunately, however, this important new program has run into a stumbling block. Last month, in a case brought by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a three-judge appeals panel ruled that a similar program developed by Vermont ``lacked the authority to offer the same prescription rebates offered under federal Medicaid insurance'' because Congress ``imposed rebate requirements to reduce the cost of Medicaid.'' The pharmaceutical trade group has subsequently sued the Department of Health and Human Services to block the Maine waiver, and the State of Maine has become a party to that case.  The Maine program is different enough from Vermont's to provide a different result in court. However, we believe that innovative programs like these, which meet such a clear human need, should be able to proceed without having to fight endless legal battles. That is why we are introducing legislation today to give the Department of Health and Human Services clear authority to grant States these kinds of waivers, which will allow them to pursue innovative uses of Medicaid, such as the Health Maine Prescription program. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson made creative use of these kinds of Medicaid waivers when he was Governor of Wisconsin. We believe that he should be able to continue to do so in his new role as Secretary without the chilling effect brought by lawsuits like PhRMA's.  The legislation we are introducing today will allow States like Maine to proceed with the innovative programs they have developed to meet the prescription drug needs of their citizens, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the legislation.                          ____________________
