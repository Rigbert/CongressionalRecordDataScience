 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to evaluate the suitability and feasibility of expanding the Santa Monica National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor. This bill was introduced in the House by Congressman Adam Schiff last year.  The Rim of the Valley Corridor, as designated by California law, encircles the San Fernando Valley, La Crescenta, Simi, Santa Clarita, Conejo Valleys, consisting of parts of the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills and adjacent connector area to the Los Padres and San Bernardino National Forests.  With the population growth forecast for the next several decades, the need for parks to balance out the expected population growth has become critical in California. Federal, State, and local authorities have worked together successfully to create the highly successful Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the world's largest urban park, hemmed in on all sides by development. Park and recreational lands provide people with a vital refuge from urban life while preserving valuable habitat and wildlife. This bill enjoys strong support from local and state officials and I believe it will have strong bipartisan support as well.  After the study called for in this bill is completed, the Secretary of Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine whether the Rim of the Valley warrants national park status.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
