President, I will make this very brief. I think most Members are in the Chamber, and I know they want to get to a vote. In 20 years here, I can count on how they might vote.  I would really urge Senators to think carefully about voting to table. This is basically saying that we are not going to allow ourselves to set up the kind of political litmus test that nobody in private business would be allowed to do. This does not stop any Senator from saying I do not want to hire somebody because I do not feel ideologically compatible with him or her.  But what it is saying is when you go and just put your people into a general overall pool of available staff members you do not have to go down through the kind of things that asks you to rate everything from the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause to the National Rifle Association andUnited Nations, rate everybody from Al Gore to Bob Dole as the study committee's grading was. Can you imagine if somebody at IBM was saying before we even consider your application where do you stand with the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association, or where do you stand with Planned Parenthood or with Right to Life? There would be a hue and cry.  We should not do the same thing here. It is an outrageous mistake. But if we are going to apply the same laws to ourselves as is applied to everybody else, they should be so applied.  I told my good friend from Iowa I would be brief. I yield the floor.
