In addition to some other comments in the book, it was the most graphic illustration that this administration is insensitive to the deficits and debt they are creating.  I also recall in that same book Paul O'Neill, then-Secretary of the Treasury, was recommending to the Bush administration to put triggers in the tax cuts so that if the surplus disappeared, then the tax cuts would not continue and drag us even deeper into debt. That was rejected by Larry Lindsey, the former head of the Council of Economic Advisers, the predecessor to the man who came up with this delightful equation that says losing jobs overseas is good for America.  What we have had is a wonderful parade of economic extremists in the White House who advised this administration into the current mess with our budget and with our economy.
