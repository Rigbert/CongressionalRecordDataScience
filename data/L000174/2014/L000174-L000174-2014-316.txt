President, Vermont is home to hundreds of world-class small businesses, each of which dots our economic landscape with their unique and often award-winning offerings. Our reputation for quality has made the ``Vermont brand'' one that is valued and sought after by consumers across the Nation--and increasingly also across the globe. One burgeoning industry in Vermont is that of craft beer. In fact, the State is becoming almost as well known for its craft beers as it is for its maple syrup.  One such successful small brewery, the Hill Farmstead Brewery, was featured in the January 18, 2014, edition of the New York Times. After a planned expansion next year, the brewery's owner, Shaun Hill, plans to cap production at 150,000 gallons per year. His successful business model, and highly sought after brew, as the article states, ``offers lessons in how limiting production can bring success.''  Vermont's small-State appeal attracts business owners large and small. The Hill Farmstead Brewery is just one example of the successes Vermont's economy boast. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of ``Craft Beer, the (Very) Limited Edition,'' from the January 18 New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 18, 2014]                 Craft Beer, the (Very) Limited Edition                           (By Claire Martin)       Two weeks ago, a beer drinker in Fresno, Calif., called      Hill Farmstead Brewery in Vermont to ask where he could buy      its craft beers. ``You have to drive to the airport, get a      ticket, fly to Burlington, rent a car and drive an hour and a      half to the brewery,'' the owner, Shaun Hill, replied with a      laugh. But he wasn't joking.       Hill Farmstead, in the hamlet of Greensboro, produces just      60,000 gallons of beer annually. The beer is available for      purchase only at the brewery and in roughly 20 Vermont bars.      In addition, Mr. Hill sends 12 kegs to distributors in New      York City and Philadelphia a few times a year.       Next year, after several buildings are expanded and new      equipment is installed, Mr. Hill plans to cap production at      150,000 gallons a year--forever. (For context, the Russian      River Brewing Company, a craft brewery in California, made      437,100 gallons last year, and Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in      Delaware produced 6.3 million gallons.)       Hill Farmstead is one of at least three Vermont craft      breweries that are churning out small batches of highly      sought-after beers and have owners with firm plans to keep      the operations small. Mr. Hill's story offers lessons in how      limiting production can bring success.       Mr. Hill, 34, has been honing his brewing technique for      nearly 20 years. He first learned to make beer for a high      school science-fair project, then started a home-brew club in      college and later worked as the head brewer at two other      Vermont breweries, the Shed and the Trout River Brewing      Company, as well as one in Copenhagen, Norrebro Bryghus.       Two beers created during Mr. Hill's tenure at Norrebro      Bryghus won gold medals in 2010 at the World Beer Cup, an      international beer competition, and a third earned a silver      medal.       Several months before these accolades, Mr. Hill returned to      Vermont to begin construction on Hill Farmstead Brewery on a      former dairy farm that he and his brother, Darren, a      woodworker, inherited from their grandfather. ``I wanted to      make beer, I wanted to live in this place and I wanted to      help my family and make sure I had the finances available to      take care of this land in perpetuity,'' Mr. Hill says.       This wasn't his first attempt at starting a brewery, but it      was the first time he was able to obtain financial backing.      ``Ten years ago or even still five years ago,'' he says, ``it      was very difficult to find private investment or to convince      banks to loan money to a start-up.''       In the past decade, craft beer production has thrived,      attracting investors with deep pockets. In 2012, national      retail sales for craft beer were $11.9 billion, according to      the most recent figures from the Brewers Association.       While Mr. Hill was in Denmark, where American craft beer      was starting to become popular, he was able to borrow $80,000      from a small group of European and American lenders who he      felt respected his vision and abilities.       From the start, his philosophy has been to make the best      beer possible without pursuing what he calls ``infinite,      boundless growth.'' He operates under the belief that beer is      a perishable item, ``just like lettuce or broccoli,'' he      says, and should be consumed locally, not shipped long      distances.       Mr. Hill has a staff of six, including two assistant      brewers who harvest yeast and transfer beer into kegs, but he      personally makes all of the brewery's offerings--pale ales,      stouts and porters--using modern stainless steel tanks and      traditional wooden barrels, like those used in winemaking.       The beers are known for having ``a sense of balance that      isn't common in a lot of new breweries,'' says Jeff Baker,      the bar manager of the Farmhouse Tap and Grill in Burlington,      which serves the beers. ``They're hoppy, but they're not      super-bitter and they don't exhaust your palate.''       For entrepreneurs who measure success in more than just      financial terms, it's still crucial to have a viable      business, says Bo Burlingham, author of ``Small Giants:      Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big.'' ``The      challenge for a lot of small companies who have nonfinancial      goals is that you can't let that get in the way of having a      very financially solid business,'' Mr. Burlingham says.      ``You'd better have a sound business model, steady gross      margins, a healthy balance sheet and margins you protect.''       For Mr. Hill, financial stability came quickly. He says the      brewery began turning a profit after just one year.       Demand surged last February when users of the beer-review      site Ratebeer.com deemed Hill Farmstead the best brewery in      the world--after having anointed Mr. Hill as the best new      brewer in 2010.       Now Mr. Hill says he fields questions like the one from the      Fresno caller every day. He estimates that thousands of      people have made long-distance beer runs to Hill Farmstead      Brewery, some traveling from as far as New Zealand, Norway      and Japan.       Customers wait in line for one to four hours to buy bottles      and two-liter growlers of the beers, many of which are named      for Mr. Hill's ancestors (Edward, Abner, Florence). The      brewery once sold an entire batch of beer--500 gallons--in      one day.       As his beer's popularity has risen, he has sometimes worked      18-hour days. Some small-business owners who have achieved      financial stability choose to delegate a significant portion      of their work to employees, but Mr. Hill says he won't be      doing that.       And the notion of moving production to an industrial park,      where craft breweries are commonly found, holds no appeal for      him. He has decided to invest in infrastructure and better      equipment that will make his current operation more      efficient.       ``I didn't start this brewery so I could keep growing and      move it away from here; that wasn't the point,'' he says.      ``It wouldn't be fun anymore. It wouldn't have purpose or      meaning.''                          ____________________
