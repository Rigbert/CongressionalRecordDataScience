President, I cannot support the devastating cuts to health care that are in the budget reconciliation conference report. I have fought to slow health care spending, but that is not what is in this conference report. This conference report slashes and bums the health care countryside like the barbarians descending on Rome. This conference report is not about reform or creating a decent health system for the poor and for seniors--it is about dismantling the system as we know it.  For starters, the Senate-passed bill increased drug rebates so that Medicaid beneficiaries would get better prices on their drugs.
