 President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Elaine Hays, whose story has been chosen to be recorded as part of the London, KY ``Living Treasures'' project.  Born in Elkhorn City, KY, on March 19, 1924, Mrs. Hays has lived in and been a part of the Kentucky community her entire life, and has called London home since 1949. She is the granddaughter of Austrian and German immigrants, and even has one ancestor who was on the McCoy side of the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud. Growing up in the Floyd County community of Betsy Layne, Mrs. Hays saw firsthand the development of the coal mining industry, as well as the devastating effects of the Great Depression.  After receiving her degree in home economics from Western Kentucky University, Mrs. Hays, sister to three war veterans, opened and subsequently ran a cannery at the Belfry High School in Betsy Layne where she was already working as a home economics teacher. Mrs. Hays wanted to help both the Nation and the families of Betsy Layne during the war by preserving food.  Mrs. Hays married her husband Earl in 1947 and taught alongside him at Belfry High until 1949. After an extensive interview process, The Hayses were hired by Sue Bennett College as teachers and program developers. Mr. Hays was to set up and run the college's farm which supplied food for the college dining hall, while Mrs. Hays was to develop a home economics program. In later years, Mrs. Hays became a ``first lady'' of sorts when Earl was chosen to become president of the college, a position he filled from 1958 to 1985. In between teaching and raising her two sons, Jim and Lon, Mrs. Hays still found the time to entertain students and other guests of the college. The eventual closure of Sue Bennett College was a somber day for Mrs. Hays, and her family alike, but its influence on their lives has been unforgettable.  Mrs. Hays retired in 1998 after working in the education field for 55 years.After Earl's death in 1999, her retirement has been made happier by her three grandchildren.  Kentucky is lucky to have women such as Mrs. Elaine Hays who put aside their own needs in order to better serve their family and their community. It is an honor to record Mrs. Hays' story, for it is a story of an outstanding Kentuckian.  The Laurel County-area newspaper the Sentinel Echo recently published an article detailing the life, accomplishments, and contributions of Mrs. Hays' life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, June 22, 2011]                   London's Living Treasures: Part 4       The last installment of the London Treasures project is the      story of Mrs. Elaine Hays, who shares rich memories of her      mountain heritage and her life as the president's wife at Sue      Bennett College. Mrs. Hays is a very faceted, elegant woman      who has spent her life learning and teaching others.       ``I am Elaine Hays, oldest child and only daughter of Lou      and Elizabeth Weber Roberts. My three brothers and I spent      our childhood in the coal mining areas of Pike and Floyd      counties. We all have a strong sense of home, our origins and      a strong loyalty to family.       I was born on March 19, 1924, in Elkhorn City, Ky., on an      island in the middle the Russell Fork of the Big Sandy River.      My grandmother Ida Eiler Weber, an Austrian emigrant, ran a      hotel there for tourists and mining officials. She came to      New York City and met Thomas Edward Weber, whom she later      married. Tom was from Magdeburg, Germany. As he read, wrote      and spoke several languages, he was hired by large coal      companies to meet the boats at Ellis Island and hire      immigrants to work in the coal-fields of Ohio, Virginia, West      Virginia and, Kentucky. He became a mining superintendent and      many of the miners followed him from one place to the next;      Elkhorn City being the last. Mamaw, as we called my      grandmother, was a wonderful cook and loved to dance,      especially polkas and waltzes. My grandfather traveled a lot      and was an avid reader. He kept us supplied with books and      piano rolls for the player piano. My mother sang beautifully      and sang for audiences at the local movie theatre while they      were changing the old movie reels.       My parents married in Elkhorn City in 1923. My father, Lou,      was the son of Ricely and Caroline Ratliff Roberts. His      mother died after the birth of her eleventh child, a sad fate      of many mountain women. Grandfather Ricely was primarily a      logger. He and his older sons would clear ``new ground'' and      raft the logs down the Big Sandy River to Catlettsburg or      Ashland. When I was 8 years old, I rode horseback with him to      visit his family. He lived in a big, two-story log house. My      father's great-grandmother was Cherokee and his grandmother      was Maryetta McCoy Roberts, of the infamous Hatfield-McCoy      feud.       My dad had a great respect for women and believed they      should be well-educated and work for equal wages. My mother      owned a grocery store and eventually get into the restaurant      business and he supported her in those efforts.       The first 10 years of my life there was always one,      sometimes two, of Dad's sisters living with us and going to      high school. In the mountains during the 30s, high schools      were only in county seat towns or larger towns. Children      living up creeks and hollows had to live away from home to go      to high school.       We moved from Elkhorn City to Hellier, a dusty little      mining village. We played in polluted creeks, catching      minnows and crawdads. We roamed the nearby hills. We also      picked up every disease, including diphtheria. In Hellier, we      saw miners go to work before daylight and return after dark,      always with carbide lamps on their caps. I was impressed with      the big commissary owned by the coal company where miner's      families purchased food, clothing and household goods. My      mother told me we couldn't afford to trade at the company      store.       We moved to Betsy Layne in Floyd County when I was in      seventh grade. Betsy Layne was a nice community with two      hollows where there was a big mine and where the miners      lived. It was owned by the Pittsburgh Coal Company. One      excellent thing that mining companies did was to support the      school programs. At Betsy Layne, the emphasis was music. We      had music every day through the eighth grade. The high school      had band, orchestra, girl's glee club, men's glee club and      various trios and quartets. Athletes all participated in the      glee club.       Many evenings, our band director gathered the neighborhood      band members and came to our home. We played our instruments      and sang. Mother provided refreshments. Betsy Lane had been      our favorite place to live. I was greatly influenced by my      family's love of music and their heritage. When I was a      teenager, my grandmother moved to Brooklyn and I visited her      there in the summers in the 1930s. She took me to Radio City,      Statue of Liberty, Battery Park Aquarium, Metropolitan Museum      of Art and History and to many ethnic restaurants.       My most formative years were in Betsy Layne. It was during      the Depression and there was so much unemployment. My dad      always had a job, but the whole family had to work to make      ends meet. We didn't have a car, but travel was convenient as      there were four passenger trains a day that stopped at Betsy      Lane. My brothers and dad raised a big garden and mother      canned and preserved food. I helped string beans and thread      them on a string and hung them to dry for ``shuckie'' beans.      We hung them to dry rather than drying them flat. We had a      cow and the boys cared for her and did the milking. I learned      early how to churn and make butter and cottage cheese. Mother      shared the milk from the cow with less fortunate neighbors.      Mother was a great cook, but didn't cook as most mountain      women did. She used cookbooks and measured ingredients. She      taught me basic cooking terms and at 12 years old, I could      cook a simple summer meal that would probably be green cooked      with new potatoes on top, slaw and cornbread. We seldom fried      anything. Mother broiled meat, except chicken, which she      fried. In November and December, the making of fruitcakes was      a family project. My brothers cracked and shelled pecans and      Mother and I cut up candied fruits. I have continued the      fruit cake tradition and have sent them to my brothers for      Christmas for over 50 years--Mother's recipe, of course. She      had the newest kitchen tools just as my grandmother did      always and served food attractively and used parsley to      garnish it. It was my job to set the table and make it look      pretty and I still enjoy doing that. My mother was a great      influence in choosing my college major of home economics. In      1982, I wrote a cookbook called ``Along the Way'' that had      recipes from three generations of my family and those from      many friends as well. The book has travelled through several      generations since that time.       My brothers had lot of chores and all of us developed a      strong work ethic in those years. The boys would dig ginseng      and sell it for spending money. Though we all worked, we had      good play times and there was always a baseball game going      on. I played on the teams with the boys and we all played      tennis on clay courts on the high school playground that was      just across the street from our home.       Dad helped us daily with our studies, checked our homework      and taught us what we didn't understand. It was very      important to him that his children did well in school and he      encouraged the neighborhood kids to attend school, too. In      fact, he bought baseball equipment and kept it with him at      the C&O depot where he worked. After school, the neighborhood      boys would go to the depot and get the bats and gloves and      play ball. During World War II, he received many letters from      those boys telling him they were glad he had encouraged them      to stay in school. Dad realized his dream of having college-     educated children. I went to Western Kentucky University and      majored in Home Economics. Gerald graduated from Annapolis      Naval Academy and became a commander. Lon Edward graduated      from Pikeville college, University of Virginia, and      University of Louisville Medical School and practiced      medicine. Gene had three years of college and became a county      commissioner in Titusville Florida. My three brothers served      in World War II, Vietnam and the Korean War.''       In the summer of 1940, I had just graduated from high      school and Earl Hays, the man who later became my husband,      just out of Berea College, came to Betsy Layne to teach      agriculture. I would see him often when I was home on      vacation from Western. The war years came along and he      enlisted in the Army. In the meantime, I graduated from      Western in 1943 and went to Belfry, Pike County, to teach      home economics.       Belfry High School was fairly large and I taught 120      freshman girls. In the summer of 1944, I went to University      of Kentucky to learn how to operate a community cannery. I      didn't stay in Belfry, but went to Betsy Layne to teach home      economics. The ag teacher and I set up and operated a      community cannery. It was part of the national war effort to      help families preserve their own food.       Earl came back from the Army to Betsy Layne in 1945. We      dated a year and a half and were married December, 1947. Earl      and I were very compatible and had the same values. He was      one of the kindest and most thoughtful men that I have ever      known. Our wedding was a community affair. Our students      decorated the small church with fresh greenery and candles.      Our friends gave the reception and Mother baked a gorgeous      wedding cake.       We taught at Betsy Lane High School until 1949. It is      interesting how we came to London and Sue Bennett College.      Our Methodist minister was at the annual Methodist Conference      and met Oscie Sanders, president of Sue Bennett. She said,      ``Bob, I'm looking for an agriculture and home economics      teacher and preferably a married couple.'' He said, ``I know      just the couple.'' After much communication and several      interviews, we were employed to come here. Earl was to      supervise the college farm which supplied food for the      college dining hall and I was to set up a home economics      program.       Earl was born and raised in McKee, Ky., but his mother's      family was from London. His grandfather, Creed Russell, had a      general store about where Porters store is now and his      grandmother, Ellen Hale Russell, named the post office at      Lida and was postmistress there for many years.       In the early 1950s, we began attending University of      Kentucky on Saturdays and summers. Earl's emphasis of study      was horticulture and mine was child care and family living.      We received our master's degrees in 1953.       Earl supervised the farm but gradually it and the dairy was      discontinued. He became dean of students, taught basic      horticulture classes and did public relations. I taught      orientation, folk dancing, and later home economics courses.      My favorite two courses were Marriage and Family and      Appalachian Sociology--which I developed. These courses were      the result of my taking graduate courses from UK in      Appalachian history and culture. I continued taking classes      in guidance and counseling and became certified in that      field.       Our son, Jim, was born in 1954, and in 1957, our son Lon      was born. Both of them later attended Sue Bennett College.      Their background at Sue Bennett College served them well. Jim      became a biologist, and Lon, a psychiatrist.       Earl became president in 1958 after President Oscie Sanders      retired. Upon his retirement in 1985, he had served in that      capacity longer than any other Kentucky junior college      president. A new president's home was built in 1960, and we      moved on campus.       Unkowingly, when Earl became president, I became an      unofficial hostess. I enjoyed having students and visitors in      our home. Some of our happiest Thanksgiving dinners were when      foreign students were with us. We and our sons met and      enjoyed many interesting people.       In 1977, I left Sue Bennett as a teacher and became the      first guidance counselor for adult students at Laurel County      State Vo-Tech. I enjoyed working with adult vocational      students. It was as if I had made the full cycle in      vocational education.       Earl retired in 1985 and we moved to our retirement home      just off campus. The campus was a great place to raise our      sons. They enjoyed the students and college activities and I      appreciate the great influence Sue Bennett College had on our      family.       After working in the education field for 55 years, I      retired in 1998. My retirement years have been made happier      with my three grandchildren. My oldest grandchild, Lon      Stuart, and his wife Alina are both attorneys. Karolyn      graduated from Centre College this year and he sister,      Kathryn, will be a sophomore at Centre this fall. London has      been a great place for my to continue living after my      retirement and Earl's death in 1999.       Any time I'm in town, I see and chat with many former      students. The greatest joy from teaching is seeing former      students succeed. I always feel surrounded by friends.       I am still a part of a group of friends that we met the      summer we came to London. Though the group has expanded and      decreased through the 62 years. the original ones still have      dinner together monthly. That's friendship.       I think one of the saddest days for my family and Laurel      County was the closing of Sue Bennett College. Earl and I and      my sons feel privileged to have been a part of the college,      which played a huge role in the development of our entire      region.       It has been a joy to have been acquainted with people who      have worked hard to improve our area. The beautification      efforts on Main Street and those who are working for historic      preservation are just the latest examples. I truly love the      people of London-Laurel County and have enjoyed making this      our home since 1949.                          ____________________
