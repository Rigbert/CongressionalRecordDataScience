President, I didn't know Mr. Liebengood, but I listened closely to the tributes made today. He clearly was an extraordinary person who touched the hearts of many in the United States on both sides of the aisle. There are so many like him who give a great contribution to this institution. I hope when the time comes they will receive the same memorial and tributes as Mr. Liebengood received today.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Illinois.
