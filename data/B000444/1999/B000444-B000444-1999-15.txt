 President, I rise today to condemn in the strongest manner possible the anti-democratic violence that continues in Kosovo. This violence takes many forms, the most widely publicized of which is attacks by ethnic Albanians on Serbs and other minority groups in the province. KFOR and the U.N. Mission must stamp out these attacks immediately.  What has received less media attention is the intimidation, and occasional violence, within the ethnic Albaniancommunity. Recently there were public threats against the lives of two of Kosovo's most respected journalists, Veton Surroi and Baton Haxhiu, editors of the newspaper ``Koha Ditore.''  On my trip to Kosovo eight weeks ago, I met with Mr. Surroi. He had already spoken out against violence against Kosovo's Serbs and was already receiving private threats as a result. Mr. Surroi is a worldly, courageous democrat--exactly the sort of person that Kosovo needs to achieve genuine democracy.  During the same trip, I also met with Hashim Thaqi, political leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army. I told Mr. Thaqi that he and his forces would have to submit unconditionally to civilian authority and respect the rights of all political parties, ethnic groups, and individuals in Kosovo.  With this as background, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an open letter published in Kosova Sot on October 29, 1999 by James R. Hooper, President of the Balkan Action Council, to Mr. Thaqi appear in the Record after my remarks.
