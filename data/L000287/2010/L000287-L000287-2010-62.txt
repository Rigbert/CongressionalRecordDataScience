Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  On February 18, the IRS family suffered a terrible tragedy. I rise today to express my deepest sympathies to the families of Vernon Hunter, Shane Hill, and the employees at the IRS in Austin, Texas. We as a Nation and as a people are much better than this. We should be better to each other. This type of attack is just wrong, and we must not tolerate violence against our public servants.  I understand that people may not like to pay their taxes, but we cannot take out our anger on IRS employees. They do not deserve this. The people who work at the Internal Revenue Service are mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who work hard each and every day. They do their jobs, and they do them well. They perform a public service that benefits the entire Nation. This Congress is committed to the safety of each and every person who serves this Nation.  I want to thank the IRS Commissioner for the steps he has taken to enhance security at all IRS sites around the country. We will continue to make sure that the Internal Revenue Service has the resources to improve security at its offices.  I was moved by the many stories of people who reached out and helped each other during this terrible tragedy. Even in the face of chaos and violence, people reached out and helped each other. First responders, emergency personnel, employees, and other citizens showed great courage and compassion to minimize the loss of life. I thank them all and honor them today.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
