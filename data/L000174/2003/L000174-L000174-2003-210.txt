President, as one Member of Congress who believes that we have a strong interest in broadcasting and strengthening our relations with Mexico, I was appalled to read a recent Washington Post article entitled ``Three Americans Jailed in Bizarre Mexican Land Dispute.''  Mexico is a country of 100 million people. We share a border. We share a wide range of cultural, economic, political, and other interests. Yet our history has been a troubled one, and the election of Vicente Fox offered an historic opportunity to begin to build a new relationship based on trust, mutual understanding, and shared goals.  Regrettably, President Bush, who shortly after his inauguration spoke convincingly of his intention to give a high priority to U.S.-Mexican relations, has failed to turn those words into action. Little has been accomplished. I am afraid that once again, the hopes and aspirations of both Mexicans and Americans will be for naught.  The President needs to recognize that as important as the Middle East and the Persian Gulf are to U.S. and global security, we have vital interests right here in our own hemisphere. I remember how during the 1980s we spent billions of dollars to wage proxy wars in Central America. Yet when those wars were over, we turned our back. Today, with the exception of our counter-drug programs in the Andes, which as we have seen recently in Bolivia are of dubious merit, we spend a pittance to support economic and political development in these countries the majority of whose people remain impoverished and without meaningful political or legal rights. Our policy is short sighted and it will cost us in the long run.  Of all countries in the hemisphere, none is more important to U.S. interests than Mexico. it would be difficult to think of any issue--immigration, tourism, trade, infectious disease, water security, environmental pollution, democracy and the rule of law, organized crime--that does not cry out for broader cooperation. I hope President Bush, and his capable new Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Roger Noriega, will give renewed attention to these issues during the remaining years of President Fox's term.  I mention this because earlier this year, I sponsored, with Senator Reid, Senator Daschle and others, an amendment which authorized $100 million to be spent in Mexico to promote micro credit programs, small business entrepreneurship, private property ownership, and support for small farmers who have been affected by adverse economic conditions. I felt it was important to make a strong statement, through legislation, that we need to devote significant resources to help address these problems. Our amendment was adopted, and it is my hope that we can include a portion of those funds for Mexico in the fiscal year 2004 Foreign Operations Act.  But my support for providing those funds will depend on whether the case which is the subject of the Washington Post article I mentioned is satisfactorily resolved. The three Americans who have been arrested are the victims of an absurd miscarriage of justice. Fortunately, according to the article, the American Embassy in Mexico is following the case closely, and recognizes that these three people have done nothing wrong. To the contrary, they have generously cared for an ailing, elderly American, Russell Ames, who lost his wife Jean Ames three years ago. Jean Ames was a wonderful woman, and her death was a great blow to Russell Ames. Ames, already in his late eighties at the time of his wife's death, would never have been able to continue to live in his home in a small village near Oaxaca, Mexico, without the around-the-clock care of Mary Ellen Sanger and the other Americans who lived on the property.  My office has conveyed my concern about the unlawful arrests and detentions of these three Americans to the Mexican Embassy in Washington. These people should be immediately released and the cases against them dismissed. And, just as important, President Fox, who has repeatedly said that his presidency stands for the rule of law, should determine whether the Mexican official who is responsible for this travesty should be removed from his position.  I ask unanimous consent to print the aforementioned article in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 18, 2003]         Three Americans Jailed in Bizarre Mexican Land Disputecaretakers of man, 91, held in standoff involving a member of president                              fox's cabinet                          (By Kevin Sullivan)       Oaxaca, Mexico--Three U.S. citizens, including a man dying      of cancer, have been jailed here and face up to 14 years in      prison in a land dispute involving a member of President      Vicente Fox's cabinet.       The Americans, two men and a woman, are long-term friends      and caretakers for a former U.S. college professor, Russell      Ames, 91, who has lived in Oaxaca since 1959. Ames and his      late wife sold their land to the University of the Americas      in Mexico City in 1988 in exchange for lifetime rights to      remain on the property. But now the university, whose      president, Alejandro Gertz Manero, is on leave serving as      Fox's minister of public security, is trying to force Ames      off the land.       A municipal judge and a squad of state police officers      arrived at Ames's property on Friday in an attempt to evict      him. Neighbors said about 60 people who live in a nearby      village, including the mayor and police chief, came to      support Ames, blocking his removal.       Ames said that arresting his three friends on charges of      trying to take over the land for themselves was a      ``ridiculous'' attempt to intimidate him into leaving.       ``These three Americans are innocent bystanders and the      embassy feels what has happened to them is an outrage,'' said      Laura Clerici, consul general at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico      City, which has sent officials to monitor the case.       U.S. Ambassador Tony Garza has complained about the case to      Gertz, who is also a university trustee. Gertz said the      arrests were legal and that he has not improperly used his      influence in the case.       The case is one of a number of land disputes involving      Americans who live or own property in Mexico. Earlier this      year an American couple was forced off land they owned in the      southern state of Chiapas by local residents wielding      machetes. Three years ago scores of U.S. citizens lost      millions of dollars in investments when they were evicted      from oceanfront homes they bought in Ensenada in the western      state of Baja, California. U.S. officials at the time blamed      the losses on a lack of consistency and transparency in      Mexican property laws. At least half a dozen more major      disputes are pending over property owned by Americans along      the Caribbean coast.       ``We are being held hostage,'' Mary Ellen Sanger, one of      the three jailed Americans, said in an interview in a state      prison here. Sanger, 45, a native of Schenectady, N.Y., said      she had been assigned latrine-cleaning duty in the prison and      slept on a concrete floor with 44 other women in a communal      cell.       Sanger has been a caretaker, feeding, dressing and walking      with Ames for almost three years. Joseph Simpson, widower who      is about 72 and suffering from late-stage terminal throat      cancer, has been a caretaker on the property for more than      a decade. He is now under police guard at a Oaxaca      hospital, where U.S. Embassy officials who visited him      said he was in grave condition. John Barbato, 58, from      Nevada City, Calif., a poet and artist who has known Ames      since 1985, rents a small house on the property and is in      prison with Sanger.       Despite their longstanding ties to Ames and the property,      the three were arrested on Oct. 6 and charged with violently      taking possession of the land on May 1. U.S. officials said      the arrest warrant claimed the three Americans moved onto the      property that day in a conspiracy to take the land for      themselves, charges that carry a penalty of three to 14 years      in prison.       ``That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,'' said Ames,      who was being fed dinner and ice cream by Sanger when a squad      of police arrived at his house to make the arrests. ``They      took care of me for several years. I felt enormously lucky to      be taken care of by them. Most people my age don't have      anybody, or are just miserable.''       The underlying issue behind the arrests is the dispute over      the land where Ames lives, a parcel worth an estimated      $250,000 in one of Mexico's most popular tourist      destinations.       Ames said the sale of his land to the university was part      of a charitable donation. Records show that the property was      in the name of his wife, Jean Ames, who transferred ownership      to the university for $60,000, half of its assessed value at      the time. Ames said he and his wife never received that      money; the listed purchase price was simply a legal formality      for tax purposes. In return, Ames said the university agreed      to allow him and his wife to live on the land for the rest of      their lives, and to pay them up to $4,000 a year.       Gertz, who became president of the university in 1995, said      in an interview that the land deal was made with Jean Ames      only. The notarized sale agreement specifies that only she      would have lifetime rights to the land. But numerous letters      contained in Ames' files show that his wife intended that      both of them be allowed to live out their lives there.       ``If he's saying that I have no rights here at all, that's      ridiculous,'' Ames said. ``We were dealing with splendid      people at the university back then. And they made a provision      for me that I could live here for the rest of my life.''       Ames and his wife lived together on the land until Jean      Ames died in 2000 at age 92. Then, in May of this year, Ames      was served with an eviction notice by the university, giving      him nine days to vacate the property and ordering him to pay      nearly $40,000 in back rent--$1,000 a month since the death      of his wife. Ames said he was stunned and angry. He hired a      lawyer and filed a civil suit against the university, saying      he no longer wanted it to have his land. That case is      pending.       Gertz said that following the death of Jean Ames, Russell      Ames should have sent the university a letter asking      permission to remain on the property. However, despite the      eviction notice, Gertz said Ames would ``of course'' be      allowed to stay on the property until he dies if he seeks      university permission now.       Gertz said Sanger, Simpson and Barbato never asked the      university's permission to live on the land, so they were      trespassing and deserved to be arrested. But Ames said he      believes the three Americans were jailed on trumped-up      charges to intimidate him into leaving his property and      dropping his civil suit.       ``I hope this is a big bluff, but I'm scared,'' Barbato      said.                          ____________________
