Speaker, I am proud to rise today to honor Mr. Sigmund Sadowski, of Indiana's 1st Congressional District, who will celebrate his 80th birthday on November 19, 1995.  According to one of his biggest fans--his sister, Ms. Wanda Boris--Sigmund continues to live a full and giving life. When Sigmund was just 26 and married for 1 year, he lost his father. This left his mother to care for six unmarried children, and, at that time, Sigmund took over as the patriarch of the family. Wanda says that Sigmund has always been viewed as a father-figure and a selfless, gentle man.  Beginning his career in retail as a stock boy and a key registrar in the Hammond store, Sigmund dedicated 48 years of service to Goldblatts Department Store. After just 2, short years, he was promoted to manager of the fabric and knitting department of the Gary store. Between 1941 and 1945, he and his wife, Michalene, worked for the Government as civilians for the Navy in Hawaii. After the war, he returned to the region and resumed working for Goldblatts as supervisor of the textile department. In 1960, he was voted boss of the year at Goldblatts. Sigmund was also the first to initiate a program with Roosevelt High School for underprivileged students to work part time at Goldblatts and receive school credit with pay. This is where he stayed until Goldblatts closed in 1980. Since then, Sigmund has remained in the retail business.  Sigmund also found time to give to some area charities. He served on the board of directors for the Goodwill Industries and was a member of the Downtown Gary Merchants Association, the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and the Better Business Bureau. He was also a member of the Knights of Columbus and the Junedale Little League.  Mr. Speaker, Sigmund's wife of 55 years, Michalene, and his two sons, Gregory and Mark, as well as his grandchild, Jefferey, should be very proud of this selfless man. Sigmund has truly made Indiana's First Congressional District a better place to live. I ask you, and my other congressional colleagues, to join me in wishing Sigmund a very happy birthday, with hopes for many more.                          ____________________
