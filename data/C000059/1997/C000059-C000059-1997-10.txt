Chairman, I rise today in support of the National Monument Fairness Act. Like many Members, I was outraged by the President's decision to designate a whopping 1.7 million acres of land in Utah as a national monument last year. In what was obviously driven by politics and not resource conservation, the President did not consult with and in fact ignored the Governor of Utah, the State's congressional delegation, and most importantly, those affected by his action, the local population.  Tellingly, the President made his announcement in Arizona, surrounded by hand-selected members of the green movement, far away from the people of Utah. We need to ensure that a President cannot circumvent the will of the people like this again. This bill would ensure that the President works with Congress and with affected Governors before designating large tracts of land as national monuments.  Let us make sure Congress is allowed to do the job the people sent us here to do, to represent them. It is crucial that we never again allow the President to ignore our constituents. Again, I urge a yes vote on this bill.
