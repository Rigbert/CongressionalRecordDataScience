Chairman, this amendment is the mirror opposite, as the gentleman knows, of the Hudson amendment that is currently pending via a rollcall vote.  The Hudson amendment would allow lease 260 to move forward under the Department of the Interior's next 5-year offshore leasing plan for 2017 through 2022.  The Sanford amendment would prevent lease 260 from moving forward under the next 5-year plan. And given the competing amendments, I must oppose this amendment, since we accepted the other amendment last night.  So I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
