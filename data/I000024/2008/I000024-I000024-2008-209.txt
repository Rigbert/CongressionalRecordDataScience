President, we have gone through a lot of activity and a lot of anguish on the floor concerning the immigration bills. There was a comprehensive immigration bill that did not work. It was something some people thought would be a good idea and, frankly, I opposed it.  But there is something that is happening right now that is a very good idea. There are 15 of us in the Senate who have taken different elements of concern having to do with illegal immigration, areas of specialty, if you will. It happens that 15 of us had a news conference yesterday, wherein we talked about approaching this differently--each one having his or her own legislation, and then you can support other legislation as you see fit.  It happens that there will be 15 bills that will be introduced. I will have one of those, and I will be supporting 14 of the other 15, or 13 of the other 14. So I think the way we are approaching this is good.  My area of specialty, that comes as no surprise, is in making English the national language. We have been talking about this for a long time. The approach we are talking about is a very simple approach. It is something that is popular.  I have had this on the floor of the Senate twice. In 2006, it was amendment No. 4064. It passed the Senate by a vote of 62 to 35. Again, in 2007, the support was even greater. That was amendment No. 1151. It passed--that was last year--by a vote of 64 to 33. So it is something that clearly is popular.  Let me explain the problem we have. One of the last things that was done in the Clinton administration was Executive Order 13166. This was an effort to make anyone who is receiving any kind of Government services to have the documentation in any language of his or her choice. It could be Swahili, it could be French, it could be any other language.  Now, the effort to make English the national language is not purely symbolic, as some of my colleagues might believe; rather, it will have a tangible impact.  After Executive Order No. 13166, there has been a high burden on Government agencies to provide translations for documents for services in virtually every language.  The cost is tremendous. It is quite a range. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget estimated the cost of providing these services to be between $1 and $2 billion each year.  The cost is not the only drawback of the entitlements of Executive Order No. 13166. It ultimately enables immigrants to avoid learning English which, regretfully, hurts their chances of effective assimilation into American culture. Historically, one of America's greatest attributes is the unity provided by having a language that is commonly used throughout the country. It is important for new legal immigrants to learn this language so they might communicate and achieve success.  As President Bush said in one of his messages, learning English ``allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery [store] . . . from cleaning offices to running offices . . . from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own.''  I can't think of any issue we have had before the Senate during the time I have been here that is more popular than this. A 2006 Zogby poll found that 84 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics, believe English should be the national language of government operations. According to a 2002 Kaiser Foundation survey, 91 percent of foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning English is essential to success. We have polling data going all the way back to 1996. In each case, 84 to 90 percent of the American people want this to take place.  I ask unanimous consent that these polls be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    National English Amendment Polls       All types of pollsters of all groups, liberal and      conservative, immigrant and non-immigrant, with all wordings      show consistently high levels of support for making English      the official language of the United States:       (1) An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed 80%      of all Americans indicated that they would support a proposal      to make English the official language.       (2) A December 2006 Zogby International poll showed that      92% of Americans believe that preserving English as our      language is vital to maintaining our unity.       (3) A June 2006 Rasmussen Reports poll showed that making      English the nation's official language is favored by 85% of      Americans; this figure includes 92% of Republicans, 79% of      Democrats, and 86% of those not affiliated with either major      political party.       (4) A March 2006 Zogby International Poll showed 84% of      likely voters support making English the official language of      government operations with common-sense exceptions.       (5) A 2004 Zogby poll showed 92% of Republicans, 76% of      Democrats and 76% of Independents favor making English the      official language.       (6) In 2000, Public Opinion Strategies showed 84% favored      English as the official language with only 12% opposed and 4%      not sure.       (7) A 1996 national survey by Luntz Research asked, ``Do      you think English should be made the Official Language of the      United States?'' 86% of Americans supported making English      the official language with only 12% opposed and 2% not sure.       Latino immigrants support the concept of Official English:       (1) An April 2007 McLaughlin & Associates poll showed that      80% of all Americans, including 62% of Latinos, would support      a proposal to make English the official language.       (2) A March 2006 Zogby poll found that 84% of Americans,      including 71% of Hispanics, believe English should be the      official language of government operations.       (3) My favorite poll is this one: In 2004 the National      Council of LaRaza found that 97% strongly (86.4%) or somewhat      (10.9%) agreed that ``The ability to speak English is      important to succeed in this country.''
