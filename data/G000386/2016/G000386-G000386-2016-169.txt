 President, we just heard some very legitimate questions from the previous speaker that ought to be answered, and I am going to go back to the familiar to answer that--to the so-called Biden rules.  By now everyone is pretty familiar with the Biden rules, so I am not going to take time to go over all of them again, but they boil down to a couple basic points.  First, the President should exercise restraint and ``not name a nominee until after the November election is completed,'' or, stated differently, the President should let the people decide. But if the President chooses not to follow this model, but instead, as Chairman Biden said, ``goes the way of Fillmore and Johnson and presses an election-year nomination,'' then the Senate shouldn't consider the nomination and shouldn't hold hearings.  It doesn't matter, he said, ``how good a person is nominated by the President.'' So the historical record is pretty clear. But we haven't talked as much about one of the main reasons Chairman Biden was so adamant that the Senate shouldn't consider a Supreme Court nominee during a heated Presidential election. It is because of the tremendous damage such a hyperpolitical environment would cause the Court, the nominee, and the Nation. In short, if the Senate considered a Supreme Court nominee during a heated Presidential election campaign, the Court would become even more political than it already is.  That is a big part of what was driving Chairman Biden in 1992 when he spoke these strong words. Here is how Chairman Biden described the problem in an interview--not the speech on the floor that I have quoted in the past--about a week before his famous speech of 1992:       Can you imagine dropping a nominee . . . into that fight,      into that cauldron in the middle of a Presidential year?  He continued:       I believe there would be no bounds of propriety that would      be honored by either side. . . . The environment within which      such a hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so      prone to be able to be distorted.  As a result, Chairman Biden concluded:       Whomever the nominee was, good, bad or indifferent . . .      would become a victim.  My friend the Vice President--but a friend when he was in the Senate--then considered the tremendous damage that thrusting a Supreme Court nominee into a frenzied political environment would cause and weighed it against the potential impact of an eight-member Court for a short time. He concluded that the ``minor'' cost of the ``three or four cases'' that would be reargued were nothing compared to the damage a hyperpoliticized fight would have on ``the nominee, the President, the Senate, and the Nation, no matter how good a person is nominated by the President.''  The former chairman concluded that because of how badly such a situation would politicize the process, and based on the historical record, the only reasonable and fair approach--or as he said, the ``pragmatic'' approach--is to not consider a nominee during a Presidential election.  He said.       Once the political season is underway . . . action on a      Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the      election campaign is over. That is what is fair to the      nominee and is central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to      me, Mr. President, we will be in deep trouble as an      institution.  He concluded:         Senate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances      is not fair to the President, to the nominee, or to the      Senate itself.  This, in part, is why Chairman Biden went to such lengths to explain the history of the bitter fights that occurred in Presidential years. He said: ``Some of our Nation's most bitter and heated confirmation fights have come in Presidential election years.''  I will state this about the discussion we are having today and will probably have every day for the next several months: Everyone knows that this nominee isn't going to get confirmed. Republicans know it, Democrats know it, the President knows it, and, can you believe it, even the press knows it. That is why the Washington Post called the President's future nominee a ``judicial kamikaze pilot,'' and the New York Times noted that the nominee would need an ``almost suicidal willingness to become the central player in a political fight that seems likely to end in failure.''  So the only question is, Why would the other side come to the floor to express outrage about not having a hearing? It is because they want to make this as political as possible.  The press has already picked up on it. For instance, CNN reported that the other side hopes to use the fight over a Supreme Court nominee to ``energize the Democratic base.'' They are already using the Supreme Court and the eventual nominee as a political weapon. They want nothing more than to make the process as political as possible. That is why the President wants to push forward with a nominee who won't get confirmed. That is why the other side is clamoring for a hearing on a nominee everyone knows won't get confirmed. Making the Court even more political is absolutely the last thing the Supreme Court needs.  The Court has been politicized enough already. A recent Gallup poll documents the frustration I hear expressed even at the grassroots of my State of Iowa. In the 6 years since President Obama has appointed two Justices, the American people's disapproval of the Supreme Court jumped from 28 percent disapproval in 2009 to 50 percent disapproval in 2015. That is what happens when Justices legislate from the bench. This Senator might say there is even a Republican nominee sitting on that bench that has legislated from the bench as well.  That is what happens when Justices make decisions based on their personal political preferences or what is in their heart rather than what is in the Constitution and the law. The last thing we need is to further politicize that process and the Court.  I just want to make sure that everyone understands what all of this outrage is really about. It is about making this process as political as possible.  We aren't going to let that happen to the Court, the nominee or the Nation, to follow the suggestion of then-Senator Biden. We are going to have a debate--a national debate--between the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee about what kind of Justice the American people want on the Supreme Court. That is what the American people deserve, and that is why we are going to let the people decide.  But beyond one Justice, there is an even more basic debate occurring. At my town meetings, often somebody will come in very outraged about why I won't impeach Supreme Court justices. They say: ``They're making law, instead of interpreting law. How come you put up with that?''  So we can have a debate between the Republican nominee and the Democrat nominee on what the constitutional role of the Court is. And we can have a debate about whether we want a Justice who expresses empathy and understanding of people's problems--the President's standard. As we all know, that is not the purpose of the judicial branch of government. That branch of government isn't supposed to let their personal feelings be involved whatsoever. And the President should not encourage the Justices he appoints to let their feelings decide cases. Their job is to look at what the law says, what the Constitution says, what the facts of the case are, and to make an impartial judgment.  Consider a Justice appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican president, who wrote that the Affordable Care Act didn't fit into what Congress could do in regards to regulating interstate commerce--because that reasoning could not be upheld under the Constitution. Instead, that Justice decided the Court could uphold the Act under the Congressional taxing power and found a way to sustain this President's legacy. It was also a Republican Justice who said: Find all kinds of ways to do what you want to do as opposed to what the Constitution requires or what Congress intends in legislation.  It would be nice to have a debate between a Democratic nominee and a Republican nominee, whether we have two, three, or four national debates or whether they have hundreds of appearances around the country, to have these basic constitutional issues discussed. And then we should let the people decide not only who appoints the next Justice but who will decide the direction of the Supreme Court for generations to come.  I yield the floor.
