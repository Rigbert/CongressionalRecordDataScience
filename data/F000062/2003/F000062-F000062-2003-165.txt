 President, I have been in public office for 30 years. I have always supported schools. I supported every charter amendment, and every bond issue to be helpful to schools. I have supported every vote to increase dollars to schools. I voted to support charter schools, magnet schools, alternative schools. I have campaigned for increasing Title I moneys that go to schools that teach poor children to try to correct the formula so the money goes where the child goes.  As a Mayor for 9 years, 3 of those years I bailed out the school district with $3 million a year so that teacher salary increases could be paid during those years. I have traveled to many cities to see what innovative public education programs have been put into play. I have never before supported a voucher program. I do so now with a great commitment to see if this program can succeed. I do so now because those of us who believe strongly in public education--and that is 100 Members of the Senate--have perhaps been too concerned with the structure of education, the rhetoric of education, and not concerned enough about what actually works on the streets and in the neighborhoods and communities of America.  This was brought to my attention 3 years ago when the Mayor of Oakland, Jerry Brown, called me and said: My schools have deep troubles. There are so many failing youngsters. I want to try something new. I would like to try a military school, all voluntary, aimed to be geared for excellence, college preparatory. I want to have the poorest of the poor admitted to this school.  I thought about it for a while.  He said: I have been turned down by the local board of education. But that is not going to stop me.  He went to the State and got a special charter from the State. He came back here and convinced Jerry Lewis in the House, me in the Senate, to put some money in a bill to allow him to begin.  I spoke to Jerry Brown this morning. I said: Jerry, I want to give the Senate a brief progress report. How is it going in your military school?  He said: We have our startup problems, but we are doing pretty well. We have 350 youngsters. Some drop out. We have discipline. We have uniforms. We have the National Guard participating. These youngsters, 3 years later, are testing to the equivalent of the second best middle school in Oakland.  So it was a new model. It was refused by the educational establishment. But it is working for some youngsters.  When I went to public school in San Francisco, there were 350 students in the school. The class sizes were under 20. There were no other languages other than English spoken. That is certainly not the case for the most part in public education today. It has changed dramatically. Schools have student populations in the hundreds. Classes are way up in numbers. Language has run up to 40 different languages in a school. The economic and social disparity of this great diverse society makes teaching in the elementary school grades much more difficult.  I have come to believe that if I can make a difference to work for new models in education, I am going to do it. Education is primarily a local institution. Policy is set by local leaders. The Federal Government provides maybe 7 percent of educational dollars and most of those through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  I strongly believe that Mayors should have an input. This Mayor has asked for dollars not to be taken from public schools but new dollars: new dollars to be put in public schools, $13 million; new dollars to be put in chartered schools, $13 million; and new dollars to try a scholarship program to try something different.  What he has seen in the District of Columbia is too much failure. Despite the fact that each youngster receives $10,852 a year--the third highest in the United States,--despite the fact that of the amount of money that comes into education, test scores are dismal.  Of fourth graders in the District of Columbia schools, only 10 percent read proficiently. Of eighth graders, only 12 percent read proficiently.  Think about what that means. If you are in the eighth grade and you can't read, what good is high school? You can't read to learn. Reading is a predicate to learning, just as discipline is a predicate to learning. So these youngsters become doomed.  This is not my assessment. This was a national assessment that was done in March of 2000. Of eighth graders, 77 percent are below the grade level in math. Twelve percent are proficient in reading.  I am supporting this because the Mayor wants it. I am supporting it because it is not a precedent. It is a pilot. It is 5 years. The voucher is adequate. It is $7,500. There are 9,049 students in the District of Columbia in failing schools.  This would cover 2,000 of those youngsters; 2,000 of those youngsters would have an opportunity to have some choice in where they go to school. Would they go to a religious school or a secular school? That is up to the parent; it depends on the cost. Some families would be able to put in some additional funds, if the private school tuition is above $7,500.  But I know for a fact there are plenty of schools where the tuition is below the $7,500. As I said in the committee, I helped a youngster go to one of these parochial schools in the District. The tuition is $3,800 a year. I have watched her blossom. I have watched the discipline work for her. I have watched the small classes work for her. I have watched the additional time the teacher spends with her work. I see her reading way above grade now. I see her proud of her uniform that she wears, so there is no competition for clothes. It is just one model.  The key thing that comes through to me, as somebody who listens to average people perhaps more than I do the policy wonks when it comes to education, is different models work for different children. We all know with our own children, what works for one child doesn't necessarily work for another. Therefore, what public education needs to do is stop worrying about structures and bureaucracies and bigness and worry about what is not working for these children. What do we do to provide a different environment? Do we divide up our campuses in a number of smaller schools? Do we build schools in office buildings--small schools, maybe with a hundred youngsters--so children can be closer to their families? What do we do? What new models do we look at?  All this Mayor is saying is these are failing schools. Why should the poor child not have the same access as the wealthy child does? That is all he is asking for. He is saying let's try it for 5 years, and then let's compare progress and let's see if this model can work for these District youngsters.  Interestingly enough, I am looking at the list of failing schools, and I see four are elementary, four are middle/junior high; and then it jumps to eight for senior high. What is the lesson in that one statistic? The lesson in that one statistic is if you have four elementary schools failing, you are going to add to that in high school; you are going to have more high schools failing and more difficulty in high school.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN FAILING SCHOOLS, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC         SCHOOLS, ENROLLMENT FOR SELECTED SCHOOLS AS OF SY 02-03------------------------------------------------------------------------                          Schools                             Enrollment------------------------------------------------------------------------Elementary  Bruce-Monroe ES..........................................          370  Stanton..................................................          622  Wilkinson................................................          508  Fletcher-Johnson EC......................................          528Middle/Junior High  Evans MS.................................................          259  Sousa MS.................................................          420  Johnson JHS..............................................          646  R.H.
