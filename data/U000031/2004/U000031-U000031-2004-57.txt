Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to United States Olympic Women's Soccer player, Lindsay Tarpley, whose outstanding play helped the team bring home the gold in Athens. The grace and class that Lindsay and the entire women's soccer team demonstrated during their superb Olympic championship run is an inspiration to all of us.  In the 2004 Olympic gold medal game, millions of people around the world watched as Lindsay brilliantly scored the United States' first goal as the team went on to defeat Brazil 2-1. Her play throughout the tournament was marvelous and made the whole of southwest Michigan exceedingly proud.  Lindsay graduated from Portage Central High School in 2002 where she was twice an All-American, named the nation's top High School forward by Parade Magazine, was Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year, and led her team to win the MSHAA state title in 1999. Following her explosive career at Portage Central, Lindsay furthered her excellence at the University of North Carolina. Over the last two seasons at UNC, Lindsay continued in her dominance and after being named National Player of the Year by Soccer America in 2003, she was selected to the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team.  I could never adequately list or describe all of Lindsay's accomplishments on the soccer field, but perhaps her greatest accomplishment thus far is being a role-model for millions of youth players throughout our country. As a National and Olympic star, Lindsay has shown through her dedicated play and elegance in success, the true meaning of being a champion. Just like her own role model, Mia Hamm, Lindsay is a role model for countless girls throughout southwest Michigan and our nation as a whole.  On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, I would like to wish a very speedy recovery toLindsay on her recent injury that she endured while playing at UNC. I extend my very best wishes to Lindsay's continued success on and off the field and congratulations on her Gold medal in the 2004 Olympics.                          ____________________
