President, if I may take one moment while the distinguished leader is here.  I wish to commend Senator Reid for his cooperation. He has worked very hard to bring this together. We had a very complex and very extensive immigration bill, with 300 amendments filed in the Judiciary Committee. After it went through the committee, Senator Reid worked hard to get time on the floor and then we passed it with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.
