President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico. This is a debate we have been through over and over again. There are some who believe that drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the answer to America's energy challenge. This amendment says the proceeds from that drilling will fund all the other energy policies in our Nation.  This makes no sense whatsoever. There is no possible way that in the next fiscal year, even if we approved the drilling in ANWR, there will be proceeds that can be contributed to the Energy Policy Act funding.  Yesterday, this body had a chance to vote for real money to fund the Energy Policy Act when Senator Bingaman offered the amendment, and it was defeated by opposition from the other side of the aisle.  I rise in opposition to this amendment. This is no way to fund energy policy, and ANWR is not the answer to our energy prayers.
