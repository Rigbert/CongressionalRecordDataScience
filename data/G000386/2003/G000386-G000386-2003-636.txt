 President, first of all, I thank Senator Baucus for the compliments he gave me. More importantly, it emphasizes, as I have tried to indicate, the great cooperation I have had from him. Legislation such as this has some controversial provisions in it, and you don't get a piece of legislation such as this to the floor without the bipartisan cooperation that has been exhibited. I thank him for that.                           Amendment No. 526              (Purpose: To provide a Managers' amendment)  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration. This is what is referred to as the managers' amendment.
