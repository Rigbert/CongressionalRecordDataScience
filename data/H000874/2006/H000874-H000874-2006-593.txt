Speaker, I am proud today to join Chairman Mel Watt and the entire Congressional Black Caucus in recognizing the importance of Black History Month. While Black History Month always provides us with an important opportunity to reflect on the vital accomplishments and contributions of African Americans, it has taken on a special meaning this year with the recent passing of both Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King.  Although they have passed on, Mrs. King and Mrs. Parks continue to inspire us to work towards the noble goal of equality for all. These two women were among a group of brave pioneers who led one of the greatest movements of our time--the Civil Rights Movement. I have great respect for all those who risked beatings and arrests, and were even willing to make the ultimate sacrifice--their lives--to stand up for a cause that is right and just.  My close friend and colleague, Representative John Lewis, stands among us as a giant of the Civil Rights Movement. During the legendary march that Representative Lewis led to Selma, Alabama, more than 40 years ago, countless peaceful, law-abiding Americans were beaten and arrested. This day came to be called ``Bloody Sunday,'' and it helped spur a nation to action to fight against the evils of discrimination and racism.  Mr. Speaker, I have had the great honor and privilege to accompany Representative Lewis and other civil rights leaders to Selma several times to commemorate the events of that fateful day by marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Each time, we are reminded of the impact that one single day can have on the course of history, and we celebrate those with the courage and determination to face down the worst so that all Americans might enjoy the freedom and equality that this nation stands for.  These pilgrimages to Selma vividly illustrate for us how far we have come in the quest for civil rights for all, yet also serve as a reminder that we must never be complacent in thinking that the battle is won.  The plight of those who are denied civil rights is a struggle that is far from over, and we must remain ever mindful of those whose rights are in danger of being denied. In the coming year, several provisions of the Voting Rights Act are scheduled for reauthorization. It is our duty to ensure that the march toward civil rights for all continues forward, rather than stalling or going backward.  The VRA is crucial in guaranteeing that the rights of all Americans remain protected, and, as such, should command broad, bipartisan support. It is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and to all those who have participated in the Civil Rights Movement in ways large and small, to renew the very Act that codified their long struggle for enfranchisement into law.  Our nation is deeply indebted to these men and women of courage and integrity. Their legacy will live on for generations.                          ____________________
