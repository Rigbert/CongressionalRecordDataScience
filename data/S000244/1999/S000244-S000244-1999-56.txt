Chairman, as I mentioned in my opening statement, this manager's amendment is necessary to strike the authorization of certain FAA R activities from H.R. 1551.  By agreement with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, theauthorization of these specific activities were included in H.R. 1000, the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century when it successfully passed the House earlier this year.
