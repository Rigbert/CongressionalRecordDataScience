 The first package, which I voted in support of, includes a number of provisions which I strongly support.  First, I am proud to have worked in conjunction with Senators Merkley and Wyden as well as Rep. Schrader to ensure that this package forgives a multi-million-dollar interest burden owed by Oregon's Pacific groundfish fisheries. This burden was created solely by bureaucratic incompetence, and the inclusion ofthis provision is a huge win for Oregonians.  The bill also increases funding for programs that hundreds of Oregonians depend upon, such as YouthBuild, JobCorps, and Senior Corps. I led the charge to secure an additional $13 million above FY 2019 levels for the Senior Corps program, ensuring volunteers earn an increased stipend which will allow them to take hundreds of more dollars home a year. It also increases funding for Pell Grants--easing the way for more people to afford an education. It also included record investments for early childhood education programs, more funding for rural broadband, and a reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools program through 2020. In addition, it includes the highest funding level for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in 15 years.  The bill makes robust investments to support our nation's veterans, including funding for suicide prevention, homeless assistance programs, rural health initiatives, opioid abuse prevention, and funding for the VA's electronic health record initiative to ensure our veterans get the care they have earned and deserve.  The package also includes $25 million for gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)--the first time in more than 20 years. The bill secures record-level funding for life-saving healthcare research at the NIH and CDC, and it extends funding for vital community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Centers.  Unfortunately, I am deeply disappointed that this bill included a provision that would extend market exclusivity rights to Big Pharma for certain medicines, allowing these companies to price-gouge consumers for longer periods of time without competition from more affordable, generic drugs.  The second appropriations bill also includes a number of provisions that I strongly support, including a 3.1 percent pay raise for both our men and women in uniform and federal civilian employees, as well as robust funding for the STOP School Violence Act, legislation that would give students and teachers the tools they need to help prevent school shootings. It includes increased investment in election security, the National Guard Youth Challenge, the National Science Foundation, and the Census Bureau, so that it can effectively and accurately carry out the 2020 Decennial Census.  I also led the fight to include funding for esophageal cancer research, which I am pleased to report was incorporated into the bill as part of $110 million for the Department of Defense's Peer-Reviewed Cancer Research Program (PRCRP). I strongly support the robust funding included for numerous other defense health and cancer research programs as well.  Unfortunately, despite including provisions I strongly support, I voted against this second bill because it also contains several objectionable provisions.  For example, this bill once again increases funding for an already-bloated Pentagon budget, including a massive increase to the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account--a fiscally irresponsible slush fund that is not counted in the budget, has no congressional oversight, and gives a blank check to fund endless wars that Congress hasn't authorized. For years, Congress has continued to increase the Pentagon's budget despite overwhelming evidence of its waste and abuse of taxpayer money. I believe this legislation could have made responsible cuts to our defense budget without jeopardizing the safety of our troops, preventing a pay increase, or undermining our national security.  I am also extremely disappointed that this final bill stripped out a repeal of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force and a provision to block funding for the U.S.'s involvement in the Saudi-led coalition's involvement in Yemen's civil war--both of which were included in the House-passed defense appropriations bill earlier this year. This is yet another example of Congress abdicating its constitutional authority to finally put a stop to the endless wars that have cost countless lives and taxpayer money.  This legislation fails to effectively check the Department of Homeland Security's border policies and spending. The bill includes funding for President Trump's wasteful and ineffective border wall, lacks appropriate restrictions to prevent the Trump administration from raiding funds from other agencies to spend on immigration detention and the wall, and does virtually nothing to provide necessary oversight against enforcement-only immigration policies.  The Trump administration's policies have resulted in cruel family separations, record levels of detained immigrants, especially children, in cruel conditions, and the death of at least two dozen immigrants while in federal custody. Instead of enacting strong, enforceable oversight mechanisms, this bill largely maintains the status quo. That is unacceptable. Congress needs to be a check against the executive branch's authority.  For these reasons, I opposed this second appropriations package. I will continue to fight against Republican efforts to hand billions of dollars in taxpayer money to a bloated and wasteful Pentagon and work to rein in the Trump administration's cruel enforcement-only immigration agenda.                          ____________________
