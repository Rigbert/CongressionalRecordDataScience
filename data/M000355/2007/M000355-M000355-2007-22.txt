 President, heading into our last work week, Republicans remain focused on the two principles that have guided us all year: protecting and defending the country from harm and protecting taxpayers' wallets.

On security, Senate Republicans will amend the House version of the Appropriations bill to include funding for the troops in Iraq. Our men and women in uniform deserve our support wherever they are serving.
