  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, actually H.R. 782, the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act which we have been awaiting for 4 years, had many other problems; and it is best that it was pulled. This is legislation that is vitally needed so we can better fund and prioritize programs for senior citizens.  But the bill was going to take money from the Older American Employment programs, away from the efficient, the private nonprivate providers and dump it on State bureaucracies that have no track record and in fact where they do have a track record, one that is less effective and less efficient. It also was going to cut congregant meals for seniors under the theory that they should just stay home; it is cheaper to serve them there than to have them come to congregant meal sites, missing out on the vital socialization function and others things that go on there.  It was a bad bill, and it is best that it was pulled. It needs more work before it comes to the floor of the House, and it should come under open rule so amendments can be offered. We have waited 4 years. It should not be under a closed procedure.                          ____________________
