 The Supreme Court has said it much more clearly than we ever could. So, I quote the Court, which I seem to be doing quite often these days:       [O]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of      section 1 is an agreement between competitors at the same      level of the market structure to allocate territories in      order to minimize competition . . . This Court has reiterated      time and time again that ``horizontal territorial      limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade with no      purpose except stifling of competition.''  This fundamental principle of antitrust law should guide the review of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. In the words of the D.C. Circuit, ``the hallmark of the [unlawful] `group boycott' is the effort of competitors to `barricade themselves from competition at their own level.' ''  Today, we are calling on all interested parties to break the barricade. We are challenging the NCAA, the Bowl Alliance commissioners, and the Alliance bowl committees to take action to bring about genuine competition to college football and the postseason.  Postseason playoffs can be a reality for college football. It works for college basketball, college baseball, and it works for college football--at the Division I-AA, Division II, and Division III levels. They all have a playoff system, all of them except Division I.  The opportunity to compete in postseason bowls should be based on merit, not membership in an exclusive coalition.  So, Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, for his fine work on this issue. And also Senator Enzi for his great work on this. We are hoping for the best. Obviously, the solution to this problem that we would all prefer is for the organizations themselves to solve the problem. But, if they do not, it seems pretty clear to each of us that this is an antitrust case the Justice Department should pursue.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 1997.     Hon. Joel I. Klein,     Acting Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, U.S.          Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Klein: We believe that there is substantial      evidence of serious violations of Section 1 of the Sherman      Act (15 U.S.C. 1) by the College Bowl Alliance      (``Alliance'').       The Alliance is a coalition of top college football      conferences and representatives of top postseason college      football bowls. Over the past few years, the Alliance has      entered into a series of restrictive agreements to allocate      the market of highly-lucrative New Years' bowls. By engaging      in this market allocation, the coalition bowls and the      coalition teams have ensured that they will receive tens of      millions of dollars, while the remaining teams and bowls are      left to divide a much smaller amount. In 1996, for example,      the eight Alliance bowl participants (including the Rose Bowl      participants) went home with a total of $68 million, while      the 28 non-Alliance bowl participants shared a pot of $31      million. Moreover, the Alliance agreements have the      additional purpose and effect of making the already-strong      Alliance teams stronger while relegating the remaining teams      to a future of, at best, mediocre, second-class status.       As you will recall, the Antitrust Division commenced a      review of this coalition in late 1993. Shortly thereafter,      the Alliance agreed that the top bowls would be open to all      teams based on merit. The 1997 New Year's Bowls, however,      proved to the contrary. We are writing to advise you of these      recent material events and to urge that you initiate a formal      investigation into this matter.                             I. Background       Courts have routinely declared that agreements among      competitors to allocate territories and exclude would-be      competitors are a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.      See, e.g., Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 593 F.2d 1173, 1178      (D.C. Circuit 1978). As the D.C. Circuit has explained:       ``The classic `group boycott' is a concerted attempt by a      group of competitors at one level to protect themselves from      competition from non-group members who seeks to compete at      that level. Typically, the boycotting group combines to      deprive would-be competitors of a trade relationship which      they need in order to enter (or survive in) the level wherein      the group operates. . . . [The hallmark of the `group      boycott' is the effort of competitors to barricade themselves      from competition at their own level.' ''       Id. This fundamental principle should be kept in mind while      reviewing the facts surrounding the College Bowl Alliance.              a. original college bowl alliance agreement       In 1991, five college football conferences (ACC, Big East,      Big Eight, Southeastern, and Southwestern conferences) and      the independent University of Notre Dame, formed a coalition      with the prestigious College Bowl Committees of the Federal      Express Orange, USF Sugar, IBM Fiesta, and Mobil Cotton      Bowls (``Alliance bowls'').\1\ The Pac-10 and Big Ten also      participated in the coalition, although their champions      played in the Rose Bowl under a separate agreement.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ The Bowl Alliance was originally called the Bowl      Coalition. Additionally, pursuant to the dissolution of the      Southwest Conference, the Big Eight became the Big 12, and      the Cotton Bowl dropped out of the coalition.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       The coalition agreement was expressly designed to reduce      competition in the postseason match-ups of teams and bowls,      and to guarantee every coalition team an opportunity to vie      for a lucrative, high-visibility bowl. The contract      specifically guaranteed that each coalition team      participating in any of the Alliance bowls would receive a      minimum payout based on similar terms. Typically, an Alliance      bowl team has taken home a purse in excess of eight million      dollars. Moreover, the original Request for Proposal      contained a clause requiring that no Alliance bowl or      Alliance team could compete in time slots opposite other      Alliance bowls.       The agreement also stipulated the procedure by which the      top-ranked and lesser-ranked Alliance teams were matched up      with participating Alliance bowls. Three conferences were      guaranteed berths at a specific Alliance bowl regardless of      the ranking of their champion team. Any team not in the      Alliance, however, was precluded from competing in any of the      Alliance bowls, regardless of its record or ranking.       The Alliance conferences and Notre Dame received      substantial benefits from the coalition agreements. They were      assured a berth at a major postseason bowl--regardless of      their topmost ranking. Further, all of the participants in      the Alliance bowls were guaranteed to receive a substantial      minimum payment and national visibility. Such visibility in      turn enhanced fan support, alumni fund-raising, and athletic      recruiting for the bowl teams.       By dividing the lucrative market of major postseason bowls      among themselves, the Alliance Conferences and Notre Dame      expressly and effectively excluded a substantial number of      the other Division 1A teams from any of the prestigious New      Year's Bowls. The excluded teams were those which were either      independent or in non-Alliance conference such as the Western      Athletic Conference, the Big West, and the Middle America      Conference.             B. Initial Request for Antitrust Investigation       In response to these market allocations, Senator Mitch      McConnell formally requested that the Justice Department      investigate the intent and effect of the Bowl Alliance      agreements. Specifically, Senator McConnell pointed out that      the Bowl Alliance agreements precluded a non-Alliance team      from going to the significant and lucrative Alliance Bowls--     even when the non-Alliance team had a better record and a      better ranking than an Alliance team. In response, the      Justice Department commenced a review of the Bowl Alliance.                  C. ``Revised'' College Bowl Alliance       Thereafter, the College Bowl Alliance entered into a      revised agreement whereby the 1997 New Year's bowls would      supposedly have two of the six Alliance slots ``open to any      team in the country with a minimum of eight wins or ranked      higher than the lowest-ranked conference champion from among      the champions of the Atlantic Coast, The Big East Football,      The Big Twelve and Southeastern conferences.''       At that point, Senator McConnell concluded that the ``new      arrangement seems to open competition to the top tier bowl      games.'' (Letter from Honorable Mitch McConnell to the      College Football Association, December 21, 1995.) The Justice      Department apparently made a similar determination.       Notwithstanding the promise of open competition, the      Alliance announced that it would consider non-Alliance teams      for the ``at-large'' openings only if they signed a special      restrictive agreement. The Alliance demanded that the terms      of this ``participation agreement'' be kept confidential.      Nevertheless, a key term of this agreement apparently was      that the at-large participants had to promise to accept an      offer from an Alliance bowl over any offers from non-Alliance      bowls. In the words of the Alliance, ``[t]here are no `pass'      or withdrawal options.''\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \2\ In the fall of 1996, the Alliance sent out      ``participation offers'' to presumably all of the non-     Alliance teams. Both Brigham Young University and the      University of Wyoming signed the restrictive participation      agreements, but included a proviso stating they would not      agree to all of the restrictive terms. Specifically, the      University of Wyoming explained that ``the University . . .      and the Western Athletic Conference will not comply with any      expressed or implied provision that prevents other members of      the WAC from participating in bowls that compete with any      Alliance Bowl, or with any other provisions that might      violate antitrust laws.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------               D. Continued Boycott of Non-Alliance Teams       The potential antitrust fears became a reality after the      1996 regular season when the Alliance continued its apparent      boycott of non-Alliance teams. During the 1996 season,      Brigham Young University and the University of Wyoming,      members of the non-Alliance Western Athletic Conference, had      ``a minimum of eight wins or [were] ranked higher than the      lowest-ranked [Alliance] conference champion. . . .''       BYU, in fact, met both of the Alliance criteria by      compiling a remarkable 13-1 record and earning a ranking of      the fifth best team in the country. This record and ranking      was superior to nearly every Alliance team, including the      University of Texas, 8-5 record and a No. 20 ranking;      Pennsylvania State University, 11-2 record and a No. 7      ranking; Virginia Tech, 10-2 record with a No. 13 ranking;      and Nebraska, 11-2 record and a No. 6 ranking. Nevertheless,      BYU did not receive an at-large invitation to play in any of      the prestigious Alliance bowls; while Texas, Penn State,      Virginia Tech, and Nebraska all were invited to play in      various Alliance bowls, with the attendant financial and      recruiting benefits. Similarly, Wyoming finished with an      impressive 10-2 record and a No. 22 ranking, but was not      afforded an offer to play in the Alliance bowls.                 E. Formation of the ``Super Alliance''       In June 1996, the Alliance lock on college football power      was strengthened as the Rose     Bowl agreed to join the Alliance, which guaranteed the Big      Ten and Pac-10 conferences automatic berths in an Alliance      bowl. The Alliance has officially renamed itself the ``Super      Alliance.''    II. Sherman Act Prohibits Market Allocations and Group Boycotts       The Sherman Act prohibits the Alliance agreements. Section      1 of the Sherman Act is violated where: (1) there is an      agreement, (2) that unreasonably restrains trade, and (3)      affects interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. 1. It is beyond      dispute that interstate commerce is affected by the millions      of dollars that flow through the Alliance bowls to the      Alliance conference teams. Thus, our analysis focuses on the      existence of agreements and the unreasonable restraint of      trade.         a. the alliance is linked by at least three agreements       The Alliance coalition is linked by a minimum of three      agreements that limit competition. First, the Alliance      conferences--the ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pacific 10      and the Southeastern conferences--have horizontally agreed      not to compete with each other for the top postseason bowls.      Next, the Alliance bowls--the Sugar, Fiesta, and Orange      bowls--have horizontally agreed not to compete with each      other for the top-ranked teams. Third, the Alliance      conferences and the Alliance bowls have vertically agreed to      further their horizontal agreements by limiting participation      with non-Alliance teams and non-Alliance bowls. These      agreements individually and in their totality demonstrate ``a      conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve      an unlawful objective.'' Monsanto Co.  v. Spray-Rite Serv.      Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).       Moreover, strong evidence suggests the existence of an      ``anti-overlap'' agreement. The coalition's original Request      for Proposal contained an explicit ``anti-overlap'' clause.      Under the terms of such an agreement, no Alliance bowls or      teams could compete in time slots opposite other Alliance      bowls. Although this clause was officially removed following      a letter of protest from the Holiday Bowl, the Alliance's      exclusive prime television slots are strong indicators of an      anti-overlap agreement. Such circumstantial evidence may be      used to prove the existence of an agreement. See id. b. the alliance agreements unreasonably restrain trade under either a                   per se test or a rule of reason test       The effect of these interlocking agreements is to      unreasonably restrain trade. Courts determine the      reasonableness of a restraint by applying either a per se      test or a rule of reason test. See, e.g., NCAA v. Board of      Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100-01 (1984). The Alliance agreements      fail under either analysis.                          (1) per se analysis       The facts underlying the Alliance warrant the stringent per      se analysis. Although courts have often analyzed regulations      of sports organizations under a rule of reason, see, e.g.,      Justice v. NCAA, 577 F. Supp. 356, 380 (D. Ariz. 1983)      (citations omitted), such a lenient review is inappropriate      where the purpose of the regulations is to eliminate business      competition. See, e.g., id. (citing M & H Tire Company, Inc.      v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 560 F. Supp. 591, 604 (D. Mass.      1983); Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Assoc'n, 359 F.      Supp. 1260, 1264-68 (N.D. Ga. 1973)). The Alliance cannot      cloak its purpose and effect under the garb of NCAA self-     regulation, cf., Justice, 577 F. Supp. at 379 (rule of reason      is appropriate where NCAA enforced rules against compensating      athletes), where the underlying facts demonstrate that      business-minded entities acted with the clear intent to      exclude non-Alliance bowls and non-Alliance teams from multi-     million dollar opportunities.       Courts have routinely condemned such market allocations and      group boycotts under the per se rule. See Fashion      Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 312, U.S. 457      (1941) (group boycott); United States  v. Addyston Pipe &      Steel Co., 85 Fed. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), mod., 175 U.S. 211      (1,899) (market division). As the Supreme Court has      explained:       [o]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of      section 1 is an agreement between competitors at the same      level of the market structure to allocate territories in      order to minimize competition. . . . This Court has      reiterated time and time again that ``horizontal territorial      limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade with no      purpose except stifling of competition.''       United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 608 (1972)      (citations omitted).       For example, in United States v. Brown, 936 F.2d 1042 (9th      Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit held that an agreement between      two billboard advertising companies providing that each would      not compete with the other's former billboard leaseholds for      one year was per se illegal. Similarly, the agreement among      the Alliance bowls not to compete with each other for teams      should be per se illegal. Id. Likewise, the agreement among      the Alliance teams not to compete with each other for the      Alliance bowls should be struck down. Id.                           (2) Rule of reason       The Alliance agreements also fail under a rule of reason      analysis. Under the rule of reason, courts require a      plaintiff to show that there are significant anti-competitive      effects. See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100-01      (1984). Once this burden has been met, the defendant must      show that there are pro-competitive effects, which then      shifts the burden back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that      such effects can be achieved in a less restrictive manner.      Id. at 120 (striking down restraint on broadcast of college      football where there was no sufficient pro-competitive      justification).                      (a) anti-competitive effects       As set forth above, the anti-competitive effects of the      Alliance on college football generally and the New Year's      bowls specifically are undeniable. Instead of having all the      bowls bidding for all the teams, a super-coalition of      powerful bowls and powerful teams has divvied up the prized      opportunities among themselves. As the Supreme Court stated      in NCAA v. Board of Regents, ``[t]he anti-competitive      consequences . . . are apparent . . . [when] [i]ndividual      competitors lose their freedom to compete.'' 468 U.S. at 107-     08.       The facts of the 1996 season indicate that non-Alliance      teams were not allowed to genuinely compete for one of the      lucrative Alliance bowls. For example, BYU was not invited to      an Alliance bowl in spite of having a ``minimum of eight      wins'' and being ``ranked higher than'' four of the      Alliance teams participating in Alliance bowls. Moreover,      non-Alliance bowls were unable to genuinely compete for      the Alliance teams in light of the anti-overlap rule and      the ``no-pass'' rule--the latter of which mandated that      all Alliance-eligible teams must accept offers from      Alliance bowls--regardless of how lucrative a non-Alliance      bowl offer might be.       These anti-competitive effects are in direct contravention      of well-established Supreme Court precedent. In NCAA, the      Court explained that `` `[i]n a competitive market, each      college fielding a football team would be free to sell the      right to . . . its games for whatever price it could get.' ''      NCAA, 468 U.S. at 106 (quoting district court and striking      down restraints). The Alliance agreements clearly restrict      such a right for both the non-Alliance bowls and the non-     Alliance teams. See also United States v. Paramount Pictures,      Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 154 (1948) (striking down block booking      because it ``eliminate[s] the possibility of bidding for      films theater by theater. [Such agreements] eliminate the      opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice      first runs, and put a premium on the size of the circuit.'')                     (b) No Pro-competitive Effects       The Alliance cannot establish that its restrictive      agreements produce any pro-competitive effects. In fact, the      Alliance's own language reveals that it did not have even a      pro-compeititve purpose. The Alliance states that its      ``framework enhances the quality of postseason college      football match-ups, increases the likelihood of pairing the      two highest ranked teams in the nation in a bowl game, and      provides excitement for the coaches, players, and fans.''      According to a recent Sports Illustrated article, the purpose      and effect of the Alliance is not to determine the true      national champion, but rather ``is to avoid the creation of      NCAA-run national playoffs. . . . The Alliance exists to keep      the power and the money in the hands of the Alliance bowls      and the four conferences that receive guaranteed berths in      those bowls. . . . Any national championship games that      result are a bonus.'' Layden, Tim, ``Bowling for Dollars,''      Sports Illustrated, Dec. 16, 1996 at 36.       The Alliance goals fall far short of actually allowing the      best teams to compete in the best bowls. The 1996 season is a      painful reminder of this fact. Instead of consumers getting      to watch a highly-competitive match-up between No. 5 ranked      BYU and another top-ranked team, they were forced to endure      two blow-outs in the Alliance: the Fiesta Bowl where No. 7      Penn State defeated No. 20 Texas 38-15, and the Orange Bowl,      where No. 6 Nebraska trounced No. 9 Virginia Tech 41-21.      These match-ups were based on membership in the Alliance, not      on merit.\3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \3\ Additionally, there is evidence which indicates that the      decision was not based on consumer preference. One poll is      reported to have shown that fans would have preferred the      following teams in an Alliance bowl: BYU--48%, Penn State--     22%, and Colorado--21%. As the Court has stated, ``[a]      restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of      consumer preference . . . is not consistent with [the]      fundamental goal of anti-trust law.'' NCAA, 468 U.S. at 107      (citation omitted).---------------------------------------------------------------------------       In short, the Alliance ``framework'' fails to enhance      competition, as well as failing to meet its own stated goals.      The rule of reason inquiry must end here where the anti-     competitive restrictions are ``not offset by any pro-     competitive justifications sufficient to save the plan . . .      .'' NCAA, 468 U.S. at 97-98.                            III. Conclusion       Based on the facts available at this time, it is clear that      the Alliance agreements fail under either a per se rule or a      rule of reason. As the Supreme Court has explained, ``the      essential inquiry remains the same--whether or not the      challenged restraint enhances competition.'' NCAA, 468 U.S.      at 104. The restrictive Alliance agreements reduce      competition in the lucrative New Year's bowls, and guarantee      every Alliance team an opportunity to reap the short- and      long-term profits of a high-visibility bowl. The Alliance not      only perpetuates the current power structure, but, in fact,      exacerbates it. The strong get stronger, while the rest get      weaker.       As policymakers and football fans, we urge the Justice      Department to use its statutory enforcement powers to break      this lock on     college football. We have every reason to believe that your      investigation will reveal additional evidence of the      Alliance's anti-competitive purpose and effects. Action must      be taken to restore genuinely open competition to college      football and to postseason bowls.           Sincerely,     Mitch McConnell.     Craig Thomas.     Robert F. Bennett.     Mike Enzi.
