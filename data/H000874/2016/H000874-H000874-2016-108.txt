Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a recorded vote.  It is my understanding that because the amendment was defeated, magically, without anybody coming to the well to change their vote, by giving to the majority the right to have the ability, without coming to the well and telling America that you were going to change a vote.
