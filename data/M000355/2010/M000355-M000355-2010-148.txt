 President, I object to the Lincoln amendment. I object to the Reid amendment, and with regard to the issue of border security, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3170; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the substitute amendment at the desk, which is a fully offset border security provision, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
