 President, I want to follow on what Senator Kennedy said in his opening remarks about this bill being here through a great deal of cooperation between two committees, and Republicans and Democrats within those committees. It also gives me an opportunity to thank Senator Baucus because I always have a very close working relationship with him on our Finance Committee. This is a result of that cooperation. But, as I previously said, and it has been alluded to by Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, this is an issue where two committees, the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee share jurisdiction. So we have had a remarkable cooperation between the two committees, and that includes Senator Kennedy's cooperation to get this bill out and hopefully not only get it to the floor but that this sort of cooperation helps us expedite this bill.  This is a very important piece of legislation and is needed by a lot of segments of the economy in order to keep companies viable.  In addition, I hope we will be able to have Senator Baucus back with us quickly. Originally when he left the hospital we heard it might be 2 weeks' recovery. I hope that is coming along OK and he should be back here with us very shortly.  Mr. President, I will suggest the calling of a quorum.
