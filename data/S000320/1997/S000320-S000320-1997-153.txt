 President, I rise today to express support for Judge Roy S. Moore. Judge Moore is a judge on the circuit court of the State of Alabama. Judge Moore is a lifelong resident of Etowah County, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, a distinguished veteran of the Vietnam War, and a graduate of the University of Alabama School of Law. Judge Moore has always and continues to serve his community, Alabama, and this country with distinction and principle.  It is because of his principles that Judge Moore has become an issue. Two years ago, Judge Moore was sued by the Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union because he opened his court with a prayer and because he displayed the Ten Commandments over his bench. A lower court judge enjoined Judge Moore from praying before court sessions and later barred his display of the Ten Commandments. The Supreme Court of Alabama has since issued a stay of the order barring display of the Ten Commandments.  Judge Moore has refused to acknowledge the orders which stop him from praying and displaying the Ten Commandments. I support Judge Moore in his actions. I do not believe that his convocation prayer or the presence of the Ten Commandments in the courtroom violates the Constitution.  As the Members of this body well know, a prayer, said from the floor of this Chamber, begins every day in which the Senate is in session. This practice is also followed in the House of Representatives. Furthermore, the Marshal of the Supreme Court, in calling each session to order, implores ``God {to} save the United States and this honorable court.'' It has also become a tradition for Presidents to conclude their State of the Union Addresses with the simple prayer, ``God Bless America.'' I believe these are just a few of the many instances where the Lord is invoked during civil ceremonies and occasions. I believe that these examples are entirely appropriate and in line with the provisions of the Constitution. I feel that our history teaches that the Founding Fathers were against government making efforts to promote specific religions at the expense of others. I do not think it was ever the view of the Founders that the government should adopt a position of Godless neutrality. It is constitutional, it is traditionally appropriate and it is just simply right for our leaders to request the assistance of God in their daily deliberations.  I believe that Judge Moore is also correct in refusing to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom. The Judge's display is consistent with other displays involving religious symbols and art in or on public property. In fact, a door to the Supreme Court of the United States bears two tablets numbered one to ten, which I interpret to represent the Ten Commandments. Moreover, there are friezes within the Supreme Court which depict Moses, King Solomon, Confucius, Mohammed, St. Louis and a figure called ``Divine Inspiration.'' I believe that these symbolic representations, just like Judge Moore's, are appropriately placed within our public spaces. Their very presence provides guidance and inspiration for our Nation's leaders.                          ____________________
