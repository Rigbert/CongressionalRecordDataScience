Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment to the Corona, California community is truly exceptional. Next week, on January 21, 2016, Herb Spiegel will be honored as a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Herb has dedicated himself to the Corona community.  Herb has been a citizen of Corona, California since 1958. His company, Corona Industrial Electric, Inc. is a fixture in the business community and was operated by Herb for 36 years. Herb retired in 1994, after receiving numerous awards and recognitions in the electrical contracting industry, and became actively immersed in the local community.  Wanting to give back and stay involved, Herb has been involved in numerous committees, clubs and organizations. Herb has remained active with the Corona Chamber of Commerce for 57 consecutive years. He has been involved as an active member of the Corona Host Lions for over 50 years, serving on the Board and in many other capacities. He is a member of the Corona Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. He has been a member of the Masonic Lodge over 60 years; and an active member of Congregation Beth Shalom of Corona. Herb has also been active in philanthropy, community outreach, and local non-profits for years including Corona Public Library, Corona Norco Unified School District, and as longtime judge for History Day.  Herb's tireless passion for his family, community service and giving back has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Herb a close friend, fellow community member and great American. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Herb on achieving the Lifetime Achievement Award.                          ____________________
