Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1154, the proposed Indian Federal Recognition Administrative Procedures Act of 1998, is a bill intended to speed up the Federal recognition process and to update the existing procedures for extending Federal recognition to Indian tribes.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1154 would revamp the Federal recognition process for Indian groups by eliminating bias and conflict of interest and by establishing an independent, 3-member commission to review tribal recognition petitions.  Among other things, H.R. 1154 would require a petitioning tribe to prove: 1, that it and its members have been identified as Indians since 1934; 2, that it has exercised political leadership over its members since 1934; 3, that it has a membership roll; and 4, that it now exists as a community.  Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely important bill to the many Indian bands around this Nation who have a legitimate right to Federal recognition, but who have been denied that right because of a slow, cumbersome, and enormously expensive process. If there ever was a better example of justice being denied through justice delayed, I am not aware of it.  Mr. Speaker, one tribe seeking recognition discovered recently, after 8 years of waiting, I say again, 8 years of waiting, that the bureaucrats down at the Interior Department have done absolutely nothing on the tribe's application for recognition because the Department bureaucrats had ``misplaced'' the tribe's paperwork. It took 8 years to find that out. I do not know what else is not getting done down at that Department, but I do know that the time has come to straighten out this mess.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge the passage of the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  (
