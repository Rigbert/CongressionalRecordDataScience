Apparently the gentleman is unfamiliar with the portions of the Constitution referring to what were then post roads.  The government can't create a job? We create incredible wealth, millions of jobs, by facilitating the infrastructure of this country, which is paid forby the taxpayers. And those are all private sector jobs. They are contracted out to the best bid. So the gentleman has a little bit to learn.  I realize he is new here and he has been sent here on a fool's errand: Let's keep the Republican freshmen busy while behind closed doors your Speaker is cutting a deal.  Things haven't changed around here all that much. And you are down here pretending that somehow we have become the omnipotent, unicameral legislature and the rulers of America, the President and the Senate be damned.  Now, I am pretty fed up with the Senate, too, and I share your low opinion of them. They are a problem.  Let's kind of think this through. We can pass a bill here that becomes a law. Now, in the last Congress, the House passed 300 bills that never came up in the Senate. Are those all laws today? Boy, we have got some catching up to do here. There were a lot of good bills that died in the Senate, 300 laws. Great.  But what if the Senate passes a bill and the House doesn't? Does that become a law? Well, I guess, you know, they could deem themselves the unicameral, omnipotent legislative branch, which I think they feel like they are all the time anyway. So then anything they pass we don't take up becomes law.  What if the President takes a bill that someone has introduced here but hasn't been debated and voted on by either House and he signs it? Does that become a law?                              {time}  1100  What a brave and wonderful new, efficient world we have. We can have two branches and three competing places passing what they deem to be laws. Now, come on. Let's get real here. We read the Constitution on the second day of this Congress, and, in fact, Joe Wilson--we all remember Joe Wilson, ``you lie''--he read article I, section 7, clause 2 on the floor. But apparently he and many others on that side didn't take it to heart. It's pretty darn specific. It's got to pass the House and the Senate in identical form and be agreed to by the President of the United States. We cannot deem anything. In your fantasy world, we can deem everything.  If the Constitution is a little too technical, I would recommend what I give out to schools kids: ``How our Laws are Made.'' It would be a good primer for the Republican freshmen who are being duped.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
