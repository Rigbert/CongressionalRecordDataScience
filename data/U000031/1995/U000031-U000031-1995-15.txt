Chairman, days like today we need to think about the reasons why we are here. Are we here to talk about problems or are we here to solve them? The current Medicare Program today is going bankrupt. You know that, and we know that. Can you imagine the answer to the question in the next decade if today we shirk our responsibility from saving Medicare from going bankrupt, what seniors will say about this Congress? ``What the hell happened when you all saw the writing on the wall? What did you do?''  Two years ago there was a lot of talk about the Clinton health care plan, and the more that folks heard about it, the more they did not like it, and it never even came up for a vote. Today, as I have met with hundreds and hundreds of seniors and many of my providers, I realize that the more folks understand this bill, knowing that the alternative is either doubling the FICA tax or letting Medicare go belly up, the more they like the idea of themselves choosing the plan that fits their needs best. The right to choose, with knowledge that they can keep Medicare the way they have it now, without a reduction in benefits, will always remain as an option.  Mr. Chairman, I do not ever want to look in the eyes of one of my seniors and say ``Medicare went bankrupt on my watch.''
