 President, let me begin my remarks on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill with a quick word of thanks to Chairman Cochran for the allocation and for additional outlays the subcommittee received. With his support, we are able to recommend a bill that provides $31.7 billion to meet America's foreign assistance needs.
