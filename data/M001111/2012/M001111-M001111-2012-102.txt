 President, today I wish to recognize Charlie Earl for his exemplary record of public service to the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges and the people of Washington State.  Charlie Earl will retire on July 31, 2012, after more than 40 years of public service in the State's higher education system and a variety of government positions. He most recently served for 6 years as the executive director of the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges and 7 years as president of Everett Community College. As the executive director, Charlie worked to increase public access to higher education while enhancing the quality of Washington State's career and technical education system. All the while, the past several years have seen the most difficult economic environment in Washington State's recent history. As our State budget tightened, spending on our community colleges decreased by 22 percent, but this did not stop Charlie from developing a vision for the State and leading toward it with energy, passion, and commitment.  While Charlie served as executive director, he propelled Washington's community and technical colleges to be among the most innovative in the country. Charlie's leadership supported the development and expansion of the Washington State student achievement performance award, opportunity grants, 4-year applied baccalaureate degrees, an open course library, and the Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training, I-BEST, Program. These changes allowed for many students to return to school to earn their diploma or certificate or learn new skills required of the 21st century workforce. The I-BEST Program challenges the traditional notion that students must complete all basic education before they can begin postsecondary education or training. This model allowed students to move through school, earn degrees, and join the skilled workforce faster and with less cost to the student, State, and Federal Government. I am not alone in seeing this as a revolutionary model in adult education. In 2011, the I-BEST Program was named a ``Bright Idea'' by Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and is being replicated in 20 other States. All of this would not have been possible if not for Charlie's leadership, advocacy, and stewardship of the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Education and its staff.  During Charlie's tenure, enrollment increased at Washington's 34 colleges by 80,000 students. This was clearly no small feat. Washington State has also seen the largest increase in certificates and degrees since the community and technical college system began tracking this statistic. This was achieved not simply because more students are enrolling in career and technical education but because more students are reaching important academic goals and building momentum to finish their academic program. As you can clearly see, Charlie worked tirelessly to promote student access, and ensure all students are making timely progress towards their education and career goals. The achievements of the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges during Charlie's tenure as executive director have been remarkable.  Charlie graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in finance and from Washington State University with a master of arts degree in political science. He serves as chair of the National Council of State Directors of Community Colleges, is a past president of the Washington Association of Community and Technical Colleges, and has been a board member of the Washington Council on Aerospace, Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board, Early Learning Advisory Council, Governor's Job Creation Subcabinet, and National Governors' Association Compete to Complete Advisory Group. Charlie's entrepreneurial spirit and unwavering commitment to student success will be sorely missed. I join with many in Washington State in congratulating Charlie on his achievements, and I look forward to seeing all that he will accomplish in his retirement.                          ____________________
