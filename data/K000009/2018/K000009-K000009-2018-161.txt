Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Pastor Isiah J. Johnson; senior pastor and founder of St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church, who, through his ministry, brought hundreds to Christ, was one of the longest tenured Pastors in the United States, and served as a valued member of the Toledo community.  Pastor Johnson was born to Mary and Levi Johnson in Troy, Alabama. He was one of eleven siblings. He was a graduate of Academy High School in Troy and Easonian Baptist Seminary in Birmingham.  His call to ministry came to him from youth experiences at church where his father was a deacon and he looked forward to Sunday services, especially listening to the preacher at his family's church. His family tells us that at the age of only 12, he felt the spirit had called him while playing church with some friends. After that moment, he would preach ``to the corn stalks and any siblings who listened to him.''  After being ordained at the age of 19, he served as a pastor of four churches in Alabama before settling in Toledo and founding St. Mark's in 1955. Pastor Johnson met the love of his life, Betty Rae Johnson in Toledo and they were married on August 26, 1958.  Pastor Johnson served the Toledo community for many years on various committees and boards. He is the past Chairman of the Civic Committee (Pastor's Conference--Toledo), President of the Baptist Ministerial Alliance, TARTA Board member, founder of the Fairside Community Center, Mental Health Board of Toledo member, and a member of the Evangelist Board of the National Baptist Convention.  Pastor Johnson was recognized by Mayor Ford of Tuskegee, Alabama on July 20, 1994, who sponsored a resolution that instituted July 20th as Rev. I.J. Johnson Day in Tuskegee. He was further recognized by the Mayor and City Council of Toledo on June 3, 2008 where Detroit Avenue from Fernwood Avenue to Dorr Street was dedicated as Rev. I.J. Johnson Way.  He is survived by his wife of 48 years; daughters Annie Wright, Denisee Gaston and Angela Taylor; sons, Jim, Eric, Izear, the Rev. Michael, and the Rev. Curley Johnson; brother, Alonzo Johnson; 28 grandchildren and 39 great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by daughters Mary Stokes and Darlene Baker.  Pastor Johnson will be remembered admirably by the many people he ministered to, his fellow church and community members, and his family and friends. We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of what Pastor Johnson had meant to each of the people who shared in his life. Mentor and friend to many, his charismatic leadership will be cherished.                          ____________________
