Speaker, as the House approaches a vote on the Senate's Wall Street bailout bill, I urge caution to my colleagues. We need regular order, not panic. We want the right deal, not a fast deal. There is a better way to address the credit crunch facing our banks than taxpayers printing money for Wall Street's bad actions. We must use the FDIC as we did in the 1980s to resolve thousands of problem institutions. In those days, we had over $100 billion worth of resolutions that cost but $1.8 billion to the insurance fund, not the taxpayer.  We need to have the Securities and Exchange Commission work with our banks on how they account for the real estate on their books not with arbitrary indexes and measures, but rather to true value. That would unlock billions of dollars, $500 billion in the system today, and would ease interbank lending.  Let's use the right medicine, not a Band-aid through which a hemorrhage will soon break as our deficit explodes even more and the value of the dollar declines further. Let's have the wisdom and courage to do what's right.                          ____________________
