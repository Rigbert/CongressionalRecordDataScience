 GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. Since the Congress composed entirely of incumbents has the power to determine what is a reasonable limit directly on campaigns, would it not be entirely conceivable, I ask my friend from Washington, in the very near future, if not in the very same Congress, after this became part of the Constitution, that these incumbents might seek to limit spending in campaigns directly by the candidates themselves standing for reelection and a challenger, quite dramatically?  Most incumbents start out with a pretty substantial lead unless they are running against a famous athlete, a movie star, or sitting Governor. It has often been described as the incumbent looking at it as a football field, and the incumbent at the beginning of the campaign is at the 40-yard line and sprinting toward the goalline; the challenger is back on the 5-yard line with 95 yards to go. Might not this Congress composed entirely of incumbents decide to set a spending limit of, say, $50,000 per House of Representatives race and declare that reasonable?
