President, I rise today to submit a resolution with my colleague, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, in support of the establishment of the National Railroad Hall of Fame in Galesburg, IL.  The State of Illinois has played a pioneering role in the growth of the railroad industry. The history of Illinois railroading dates back to 1837 with the creation of the Northern Cross Railroad linking the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. The city of Galesburg joined Chicago by rail seventeen years later in 1854. The Carl Sandburg College of Galesburg is today the home of the first accredited railroad degree program.  So it is only natural that the National Railroad Hall of Fame would be established in Galesburg. This privately-funded museum will highlight the efforts of men and women whose hard work and resourcefulness helped build one of the nation's best modes of transportation. It will also help promote and encourage a better understanding of the origins and growth of the railroad industry. The vision of the National Railroad Hall of Fame will span more than two centuries, from the dawn of the American railroad, through the Golden Age of railroading, and up through the modern era, in which railroads remain a critical aspect of the transportation industry. The museum will also be a center of learning and debate, as well as a library of historical materials.  Fourteen members of the House of Representatives have brought forward an identical measure in that chamber. Approval by the Senate will be an important step toward the erection of this monument. I urge the Senate toadopt this resolution in a timely fashion so that we can properly honor the railroad industry and its many pioneers.                          ____________________
