 President, I would like to take this opportunity to inform my colleagues about a truly outstanding group of American veteran LST [landing ship tank] sailors that intend to sail a 50-year-old World War II LST 13,000 miles from the Far East to our shores. Their plans are for this vessel to arrive and sail under the Golden Gate Bridge on August 14, 1995, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific and to honor the thousands of LST sailors that served on them over the past half century.  After a 10-day layover on the west coast the seasoned crew of 70 sailors will sail the ship to its homeport, the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans. I say seasoned because these men sailed on LST's during World War II when they were just 18 to 24 years old. Now, 50 years later they will again be sailing an LST. This time the voyage will be during the peace they fought for so nobly and that we all now enjoy.  One member of the crew is a constituent of mine, William Irwin of Huntsville, AL. During World War II he was a decorated lieutenant who served aboard LST 277. During the return voyage of the LST Ship Memorial, he will again be sailing as a lieutenant (3d deck officer). To be considered, he and other members of the crew completed 4 months of training and were tested with Coast Guard standards; Lieutenant Irwin's score was 100 percent. All will meet rigid physical and professional requirements. I am enclosing a list of the proposed crew that includes sailors from 24 States.  The crew will spend 10 days aboard the vessel checking out equipment and preparing for the historical voyage that is planned to commence upon its departure from the Far East on June 20, 1995. There will be stops in the Philippines, Guam, and Kwajalein along the 13,000-mile homeward trek. Departing the Marshall Islands, the crew intends to proceed to the Equator and sail eastward until they cross the international dateline. They will continue on to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and then will proceed to San Francisco. The voyage will require 47 days at sea with the LST traveling at an average of 7 knots.  This project has become a reality through the combined efforts of the U.S. LST Association, the National D-Day Museum, and the Navy that will provide the crew and its training. The LST Ship Memorial, that will be funded by private donations, will be the only one of its kind, worldwide.  [[Page S4672]] It is my understanding that the LST Memorial will be homeported 6 months of the year at the National D-Day Museum, located on Lake Pontchartrain, LA. For the remaining 6 months it is the intention of the organization to sail our inland waterways. The crew will stop along the route and allow free public access for viewing, to keep alive the memories of World War II and remind the public of the heroism, bravery, and sacrifice of the 2 million men that served and sailed on these gallant vessels. Plans are underway in the first year to sail the LST inland via the Mississippi, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri rivers, as well as the Great Lakes, as the U.S. Navy did in 1945 and 1946. The following year the LST will sail the east coast and the third year she will sail the along the west coast, repeating the cycle every 3 years.  Mr. President, I would like to commend Lt. William Irwin, Chief Milan Gunjak, president of the United States LST Association, Dr. Stephen Abrose, founder of the National D-Day Museum, Comdr. Robert Jornlin, vice president of the U.S.S. LST Ship Memorial, Comdr. Jack Melcher, Sr., president of U.S.N. and project director and all their supporters for their hard work and efforts in securing this fitting memorial to an important naval vessel and to the sailors who served aboard LST's during World War II.  Mr. President, I ask that a proposed list of the LST crew be printed in the Record.  The crew list follows:                   U.S.S.
