President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies.  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, 1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.''  The AO has done an excellent job at preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of Congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency.  The system in place now has worked well and should be continued. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency.  The bill would update the reporting requirements currently in place with one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would require the wiretap report to include information on the number of orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from obtaining the plaintext of communications intercepted pursuant to such order.  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and online information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law enforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the fruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on Organized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools of Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected anecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of criminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of encryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an ongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information technologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence operations. As part of this study, a database of case information from federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be furnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by law enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on which to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this area.  The final section of this bill would codify the information that the Attorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace device orders, and require further information on where such orders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders and orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, I believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of federal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting requirements such as the one included in this law.  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis compile information from five components of the Department of Justice: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The report contains information on the number of original and extension orders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register and trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of investigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were predicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were affected.  These specific categories of information are useful, and the bill we introduce today would direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific categories of information. In addition, the bill would direct the Attorney General to include information on the identity, including the district, of the agency making the application and the person authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance technique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney General's annual reports.  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon lapse. I therefore urge prompt action on this legislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap reports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap reports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace reports submitted by the Attorney General.  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1769       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Continued Reporting of      Intercepted Wire, Oral, and Electronic Communications Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code,      requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the      United States Courts to transmit to Congress a full and      complete annual report concerning the number of applications      for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire,      oral, or electronic communications. This report is required      to include information specified in section 2519(3).       (2) The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995      provides for the termination of certain laws requiring      submittal to Congress of annual, semiannual, and regular      periodic reports as of December 21, 1999, 4 years from the      effective date of that Act.       (3) Due to the Federal Reports Elimination Act and Sunset      Act of 1995, the Administrative Office of United States      Courts is not required to submit the annual report described      in section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code, as of      December 21, 1999.     SEC. 3. CONTINUED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.       (a) Continued Reporting Requirements.--Section 2519 of      title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end      the following:       ``(4) The reports required to be filed by subsection (3)      are exempted from the termination provisions of section      3003(a) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of      1995 (Public Law 104-66).''.       (b) Exemption.--Section 3003(d) of the Federal Reports      Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66) is      amended--       (1) in paragraph (31), by striking ``or'' at the end;       (2) in paragraph (32), by striking the period and inserting      ``; or''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(33) section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code.''.     SEC. 4. ENCRYPTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.       Section 2519(1)(b) of title 18, United States Code, is      amended by striking ``and (iv)'' and     inserting ``(iv) the number of orders in which encryption was      encountered and whether such encryption prevented law      enforcement from obtaining the plain text of communications      intercepted pursuant to such order, and (v)''.     SEC. 5. REPORTS CONCERNING PEN REGISTERS AND TRAP AND TRACE                    DEVICES.       Section 3126 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      striking the period and inserting ``, which report shall      include information concerning--       ``(1) the period of interceptions authorized by the order,      and the number and duration of any extensions of the order;       ``(2) the offense specified in the order or application, or      extension of an order;       ``(3) the number of investigations involved;       ``(4) the number and nature of the facilities affected; and       ``(5) the identity, including district, of the applying      investigative or law enforcement agency making the      application and the person authorizing the order.''.                                 ______                                       By
