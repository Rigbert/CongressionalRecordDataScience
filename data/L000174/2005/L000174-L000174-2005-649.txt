President, it is now fairly common on the Senate Floor to hear the statement that we cannot adequately defend our Nation today without our military reserves. Everybody knows that the activation of members of the National Guard and Reserve since September 11, 2001, represents the largest mobilization of our back-up military personnel since World War II. Everyone knows too that members of the National Guard and Reserve comprise over 50 percent of the forces on the ground in Iraq. And, yes, we all know that we are asking the reserves, particularly the National Guard, to help increase security within the domestic United States, whether at prominent events or along our porous national borders.  It is critical that we go beyond mere statements and take concrete steps to preserve the readiness, morale, and general effectiveness of this force. This imperative extends particularly to redressing harmful policies that give the impression to our reservists that they are not an equally important part of the wider military and the defense of the Nation.  Today Senator Bond and I are introducing legislation that will end one of the most glaring of these inequities. Our legislation, The National Guard and Reserves Housing Equity Act of 2005, effectively terminates a patently unfair low housing allowance provided to reservists when they are called up for a relatively short-term of active service.  This so-called lower allowance level, known officially as the Basic Allowance for Housing II, or B.A.H. II, puts on average almost $400 less per month--per month--in the pockets of our reservists than what they would receive if they were regular, active duty members. To any reservist who leaves his or her community, profession, and family for active service, receiving B.A.H. II says that he or she is a second-class member of the military. You might do the same job as a full-time member of the military and live in the same type of housing, but you do not deserve the same allowance. The allowance creates an unacceptable financial hardship that will decrease the willingness of any reasonable person to continue service.  This is a very real problem. Last year, Congress and the President enacted a piece of legislation--which Isponsored along with my fellow Guard Caucus Co-Chair Senator Kit Bond--that authorized greater use of the National Guard for national homeland security missions. Using this new authority, members of the National Guard from my home State of Vermont were called to active duty late last year to help increase security along the Northern Border. Those members of the Guard worked side-by-side with their active duty counterparts. Yet the Guard personnel received over $300 less per month in housing allowances.  I cannot tell you how many soldiers and airmen who participated in that mission came up to me and made clear how slighted and insulted they felt by that housing allowance. Those comments mirror what I heard from other members of the Guard who received B.A.H. II on a similar mission. This second-tier housing allowance really burns in the saddle of every citizen-soldier, sailor, airman, and marine, and it is having a real effect on morale.  We simply cannot tolerate this inequity to continue, and it is within our power to do something about this. So we have a choice today: Either we can keep this second-tier housing allowance in place and send a signal that we need to save some dollars on the backs of those who have stepped forward to serve, or we can remedy this inequity, making the firm statement that we will take the real steps necessary to support our reservists and provide them the resources so that they can do their jobs and be treated fairly while they serve.  The National Guard and Reserves Housing Equity Act of 2005 specifically provides that any member of the reserves called up for more than 30 days will receive the exact same housing allowance as a regular active duty service-member. The legislation gives the Office of Secretary of Defense some discretion to set the allowance under the 30 days, but it should be done on a pro-rated basis on the higher regular allowance. The effect of this legislation will be to end the category of Basic Allowance of Housing II.  This legislation has been endorsed unanimously by the 35-military association umbrella group, The Military Coalition. So that all senators may read the specific views of the military associations, I ask that letters from the National Guard Association of the United States, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, the Reserve Officers Associations, the Reserve Enlisted Association, the Association of the United States Army, and the Fleet Reserve Association be printed in the Record. The Military Officer's Association of America and the Air Force Sergeant's Association have also directly endorsed this legislation.  We often hear statements about supporting our troops, but this is a chance to actually support them. This is an issue that literally affects our troops where they live. I invite our colleagues to join Senator Bond and me in co-sponsoring this legislation and in working to end this grossly unfair system. With the National Guard and Reserves Housing Equity Act of 2005, we are backing up our thanks with meaningful action. With this step we are saying that we are ready to provide a strong foundation of policies that will actually encourage our reservists to continue to serve the country superbly. This is the right thing to do, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enacting this legislation this year.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        National Guard Association                                         of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2005.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing on behalf of the men and      women of the National Guard Association of the United States      to thank you for introducing legislation which addresses the      inequities in housing allowances paid to members of the      National Guard.       Your bill, which reduces the threshold for receipt of full      BAH from 140 days to 30 days, will have an immediate and      positive impact on many of our members who are receiving      housing allowances at a rate which is on average $400 less      than the regular BAR rate. Because BAH II is not adjusted for      location, in some places the loss of income could be as high      as $1,000.00, depending on rank.       As you know, when a Guard member is on duty, the mortgage      payment or rent is not reduced. Your bill will rectify this      injustice and allow National Guard members to receive full      BAH when on orders for more than 30 days.       At no other time in recent history have the men and women      of the National Guard been asked to sacrifice so much for the      good of the Nation. We thank you for recognizing their      contribution and sacrifice and working to remove this      inequity in their housing allowance.       Please don't hesitate to call on us if there is anything we      else we can do to support this worthwhile legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Stephen M. Koper,     Brigadier General, Retired President.                                  ____         Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United            States,                                   Alexandria, VA, April 21, 2005.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Enlisted men and women      of the Army and Air National Guard, thank you for introducing      legislation to reduce the threshold for the receipt of Basic      Allowance for Housing (BAH) to 30 days. This bill will      authorize National Guard and Reserve members on active duty      for more than 30 days to receive full BAH instead of the      lower BAH II they now receive if their orders are for less      than 140 days.       Almost all National Guard members must maintain a private      residence while performing periods of active duty. Their rent      or mortgage payment doesn't go away when they are called to      active duty.       National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty      for less than 140 days receive BAH II instead of the BAH that      every other servicemembers receives. BAH II is based on the      old BAQ rate and is, on average, $400 less than the average      BAH rate. it is not adjusted for location. In some places,      such as the Washington, DC Metro area, the difference can be      $1,000, depending upon the rank of the servicemember.       A significant percentage of mobilized Guard members earn      less on active duty than in their civilian careers and paying      them a reduced housing allowance only makes the financial      difficulty worse. Your bill would eliminate this inequity for      most National Guard and Reserve members by changing the      threshold from 140 days to 30 days.       Thank you so much for addressing one of the many needs of      our National Guard members. EANGUS will support this      legislation in any way possible. If there is anything we can      do to assist, please let us know.           Working for America's Best!                                   MSG (Ret) Michael P.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Hon. Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Bond: The Reserve Officers      Association, representing over 75,000 Reserve Component      members and the Reserve Enlisted Association supporting all      Reserve enlisted members, supports your bill to require that      members of the National Guard and Reserve called or ordered      to active duty for a period of more than 30 days receive a      basic allowance for housing at the same rate as similarly      situated members of the regular components of the uniformed      services.       This bill tears down a barrier at a time when the services      will need to rely on volunteerism as they run out of      mobilization authority. The lower Reserve Component housing      allowance has been reported by ROA members as a reason why      they are not encouraged to volunteer for active duty.       Additionally, it will also help to offset pay differential      and positively affect the financial health of our military      families. The provisions of your bill meet sound business      practices by targeting entitlements and we are encouraged it      will receive bipartisan interest. Congressional support for      our nation's military men and women in the Guard and Reserve      is and always will be appreciated.           Sincerely,     Robert A. McIntosh,       Major General (Ret), USAFR, ROA Executive Director.

Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the more than 100,000      members of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA),      I thank you for introducing legislation to reduce the      threshold for the receipt of Basic Allowance for Housing II      (BAH II) to 30 days.       Almost all National Guard members must maintain a private      residence while performing periods of active duty. Their rent      or mortgage payment doesn't go away when they are called to      active duty.       National Guard and Reserve members who are on active duty      for less than 140 days receive BAH II instead of the Basic      Allowance     for Housing (BAH) that every other servicemember receives.      BAH II is based on the old BAQ rate and is, on average, $400      less than the average BAH rate. It is not adjusted for      location. In some places, such as the Washington, D.C. Metro      area, the difference can be $1,000, depending upon the rank      of the servicemember.

Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: FRA wholeheartedly endorses your      introduction of legislation authorizing National Guard and      Reservists called to active duty for a period of more than 30      days to receive a basic allowance for housing (BAH) at the      same rate as their active duty counterparts.       Current policy require Reservists serving less than 140      days receive ``BAH II,'' which is generally a flat-rate      amount based on pay grade and marital status rather than the      market-influenced, geographically-driven allowance that      active duty personnel receive.       At the specific request of senior enlisted leaders of the      Coast Guard, FRA addressed this inadequacy in Congressional      testimony, recommending a policy change authorizing      Reservists activated 30 days or more to be eligible for      locally based BAH. This measure significantly helps ensure      Reservists' compensation reflects the duties our Nation has      asked them to perform.       The Association salutes you for your efforts and is      committed to working toward enactment of this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Joseph L.
