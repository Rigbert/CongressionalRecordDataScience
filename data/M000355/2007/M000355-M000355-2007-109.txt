 President, yesterday, the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service sent a letter to Congress warning about the consequences of not addressing the AMT tax right away. She said that if we don't do something about this middle class tax hike by December, as many as 50 million Americans, more than a third of all U.S. taxpayers, will either get hit by a tax that was never meant for them or forced to wait months for a refund that many of them count on for their family budgets.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Acting Commissioner Linda Stiff be printed in the Record.
