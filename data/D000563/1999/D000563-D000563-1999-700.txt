President, I rise today to share with my colleagues an essay written by a great Chicagoan, and the father of our modern-day futures industry, Leo Melamed. I believe his essay, Reflections on the Twentieth Century, eloquently captures the essence of this great nation.  Mr. President, Leo Melamed had to travel a long hard road to reach the pinnacle of success. As a boy, he survived the Holocaust, coming to the United States to find a better life for his family. Growing up on the streets of Chicago, Leo was able to climb the ladder of opportunity and make that better life for himself and his family. His early experiences gave him a deep appreciation of the importance of a free society and an open economy.  Leo Melamed's heroic story embodies the American Dream. The young man who came to Chicago with little has, through hard work, tenacity, intellect and energy, given much to the world. In 1972, he launched the International Monetary Market (IMM), the first financial futures market. He has also achieved the position of Chairman Emeritus and Senior Policy Advisor for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and is the author of several books. His leadership over the past quarter century has been critical in helping transform the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from a domestic agricultural exchange to the world's foremost financial futures exchange.  Currently, Melamed serves as chairman and CEO of Sakura Dellaher, Inc., a global futures organization which he formed in 1993 by combining the Sakura Bank, Ltd., one of the world's largest banks, and Dellaher Investment Company, Inc., a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) he established in 1965. As a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, and with an ability to operate in all world futures markets, Sakura Dellaher, Inc., assists financial institutions in their management of risk. Because of Leo's exemplary accomplishments and contributions to the field of financial futures, he has been recognized as ``the father of the futures market concept.''  I should also add, Mr. President, that the March 1999 issue of Chicago magazine has chosen Leo Melamed as one of the Most Important Chicagoans of the 20th Century. The article states: ``As de facto leader of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a quarter of a century, Melamed transformed the moribund exchange, introducing foreign currency and gold as commodities to be auctioned off in the trading pits. Thanks to those decisions, Chicago is today the world capital of currency futures trading.'' Leo Melamed deserves great recognition for his outstanding contributions to the city he loves so much.  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Leo Melamed's essay, Reflections on the Twentieth Century, be printed in the Record.  The essay follows:                  Reflections on the Twentieth Century                            (By Leo Melamed)       The Twentieth Century, my father told me before his death,      represented a new low in the history of mankind. ``The      Holocaust,'' he said, ``was an indelible blot on human      conscience, one that could never be expunged.''       Still, my father always tempered his realism with a large      dose of optimism. He had, after all, against all odds,      managed to save himself and his immediate family from the      inevitability of the gas chambers. Were that not the case,      this kid from Bialystok would not be here to receive this      incredible Weizmann Institute honor nor tell his story. And      quite a story it is!       I don't mean simply the story of how my father snatched his      wife and son from the clutches of the Nazis. I don't mean      simply the story of how my parents outwitted both the Gestapo      and the KGB during a time in history when, in Humphrey      Bogart's words, ``the world didn't give a hill of beans about      the lives of three people.'' I don't mean simply the story of      our race for freedom across Europe and Siberia during a      moment in history when the world had gone quite mad. And I      don't mean simply the story of Consul General Chiune      Sugihara, the Japanese Oscar Schindler who chose the follow      the dictates of his God rather than those of his Foreign      Office and, in direct violation of their orders, issued life      saving transit visas to some 6000 Jews trapped in Lithuania--     the Melamdoviches among them. Six months later all of us      would have been machine-gunned to death along with 10,000      others in Kovno.       No, I don't mean simply all of that, although all of that      is a helluva story. But there is yet another dimension to the      story here. I mean the story of the splendor of America! For      it was here, here in this land of the free and home of the      brave that the kid from Bialystok was given the opportunity      to grow up on the streets of Chicago, to climb the rungs of      social order without money or clout, and to use his      imagination and skills so that in a small way he could      contribute to the growth of American markets. In doing so he      not only justified fate's decision to spare his life, but      more important, attested to the majesty of this nation.       Because within my story lies the essence of America, the      fundamental beauty of the United States Constitution and the      genius of its creators. For throughout the years, thru ups      and downs, thru defeats and victories, thru innovations which      challenged sacred market doctrines, and ideas which defied      status quo, no one ever questioned my right to dream, nor      rejected my views simply because I as an immigrant,      without proper credentials, without American roots,      without wealth, without influence, or because I was a Jew.      Intellectual values always won out over provincial      considerations, rational thought always prevailed over      irrational prejudice, merit always found its way to the      top. Say what you will, point out the defects, protest the      inequities, but at the end of the day my story represents      the real truth about America.       For these reasons, after all was said and done, my parents      were optimists. They agree, that in spite of the two World      Wars, in spite of the horrors and atrocities, the Twentieth      Century was nevertheless a most remarkable century. They      watched the world go from the horse and buggy--to main form      of transportation at their birth--to Apollo Eleven which in      1969 took Neil Armstrong to the moon.       Indeed, it is hard to fathom that at the dawn of my      parent's century, Britannia was still the empire on which the      sun never set; the railroads were in their Golden Age,      automobiles were considered nothing but a fad, the phonograph      was the most popular form of home entertainment, and life      expectancy for the American male was but 48. Sigmund Freud      first published his ``Interpretation of Dreams,'' and Albert      Einstein, the foremost thinker of the century, had just      published his theory of relativity.       Of course, the event that would have the most profound      effect on the direction of our present century occurred back      in 1848--smack dab in the middle of the Nineteenth Century:      Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, published the      Communist Manifesto. The concept of communism would dominate      the political thought of Europe and later Asia for most of      the Twentieth Century.       Today, some 150 years after the concept was conceived, we      know it to have been an unmitigated failure. Indeed, those of      us, citizens of planet Earth fortunate enough to be present      in the final decade of the Twentieth Century, have been      privileged to witness events equal to any celebrated      milestone in the history of mankind. In what seemed like a      made for TV video, we were ringside spectators at a global      rebellion. In less than an eye-blink the Berlin Wall fell,      Germany was unified, Apartheid ended, Eastern Europe was      liberated, the Cold War ceased, and a doctrine that impaired      the freedom of three generations and misdirected the destiny      of the entire planet for seven decades was decisively      repudiated.       What a magnificent triumph of democracy and freedom. What a      glorious victory for capitalism and free markets. What a      majestic tribute to Thomas Jefferson, Adam Smith, Abraham      Lincoln, and Milton Friedman. What a divine time to be alive.      Surely these events represented some of the defining moments      of the Twentieth Century. Ironically, the lynch-pin of all      that occurred will not be found in the political or economic      arena, but rather in the sciences. One hundred years after      the Communist Manifesto, to be precise, on December 23,      1947--smack dab in the middle of the Twentieth Century--two      Bell Laboratory scientists invented the first transistor. It      was the birth of a technology that would serve to dominate      the balance of this century and, I dare say, much of the      Twenty-first as well. The Digital Age was upon us.       Transistors and their offspring, the microchip, transformed      everything: the computer, the space program, the television,      the telephone, the markets, and, to be sure,      telecommunications. Modern telecommunications became the      common denominator which gave everyone the ability to make a      stark, uncompromising comparison of political and economic      systems. The truth could no longer be hidden from the people.      We had migrated said Walter Wriston of Citicorp from the gold      standard to the ``information standard.''       In a very real sense, the technology of the Twentieth      Century moved mankind from the big to the little. It is a      trend that will surely continue. In physics, this century      began with the theory of General Relativity; this dealt with      the vast, with the universe. From there we journeyed to      comprehension of the infinitesimal, to quantum physics.      Physicists were now able to decode nature's age-old secrets.      Similarly, in biology we also moved from macro to micro--from      individual cells to gene engineering. We entered an era of      biomedical research where we can probe the fundamental      components of life and remedy mankind's most distressing      afflictions.       Thus, in stark contrast to the signals at the turn of the      last century, the evidence today is overwhelming that the      next century will be dominated by the information standard.      Today, millions of transistors are etched on wafers of      silicon. On these microchips all the world's information can      be stored in digital form and transmitted to every corner of      the globe via the Internet. This will change the way we live,      the way we work, and the way we play. Indeed, the Digital      Revolution will direct the next century just as the      Industrial Revolution directed much of the Twentieth.       So there you have it: the pain, the progress, and the      promise of my parent's century. It would be grand to believe      that we have learned from our mistakes, that only enlightened      times await us, but I am afraid that would be a bit      pollyannaish. Still, we stand on the threshold of immense      scientific breakthroughs and the future looks brighter than      it ever was. Indeed, the Weizman Institute of Science      symbolizes the scientific miracles of the Twentieth Century      and points the direction for the world as we enter the Twenty      First. If my parents were still present, they would surely      tell this kid from Bialystok to await the next century with      great anticipation and with infinite optimism.       Thank you.                          ____________________
