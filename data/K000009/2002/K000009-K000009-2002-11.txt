Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), now the senior Member representing that great State here for our Republic in the House, and rise in support of his Resolution with all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to honor our friend and colleague Congresswoman Patsy Mink, as this beautiful, beautiful poster indicates, a woman of hope.  Patsy's service, now 24 years, places her among the longest-serving women in the House, certainly currently. She was honest and intelligent, gifted and dedicated, and leaves behind a stellar record of accomplishments. For almost half a century, she was a devoted advocate for her constituents and her native State of Hawaii. She served America with distinction. She will be deeply missed.  She was a trailblazer. Her career embodied a series of firsts. She was the first Asian American woman to practice law in Hawaii, and the first Asian American woman to be elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. And then in 1964 she became the first, in her own words, woman of color ever elected to the United States Congress, an Asian American woman of Japanese American heritage from the then new State of Hawaii.  She transcended race and gender throughout her life. She was a leader on women's rights, social and economic justice, health care and child care, and no one here knew more about education. She came to this House at the beginning of the 88th Congress in 1965, served until 1977, and then again from 1990 until her untimely passing this past Sunday.  When Patsy first began her career in this Congress, she was one of only 11 women serving in the House. She watched as Members came in the 1980s and began to double the number of women to 24, up to the current ? level of 62 with 13 women now in the Senate.  I agree with my colleagues that Patsy viewed as her most important achievement passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. She, as the gentleman from Hawaii indicated, had experienced race and gender discrimination. She often said her life experiences challenged her to lead thefight for women and girls to have equal access to education and athletic opportunities. Title IX has torn down barriers for women and girls in America. Title IX has had a dramatic impact on women's access to higher education opportunities, especially medical and law school, in addition to the more publicized impact on girls' and women's athletics.  Throughout our Nation, millions of girls participate in sports programs today, and millions of girls and women have more opportunities available to them because of Congresswoman Patsy Mink. She stood up for them and for us. Her legacy will survive in every classroom, every school and every campus. In celebrating the 30th anniversary of Title IX, Patsy stated her belief that ``we must rededicate ourselves to the continued pursuit of educational opportunities for girls and women.'' Her leadership on a wide range of issues, the environment, poverty, civil rights, helped shape a stronger America.  Patsy will live forever in our hearts and in this great institution. She truly remains America's daughter for all time, a woman of hope.  In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I would like to place on the record and ask my colleagues to sign a letter being sent to the Speaker from all of us that asks the Speaker to work with the membership as the Speaker deems appropriate to commission a portrait or sculpture of Congresswoman Mink to memorialize her contributions to our Nation. We would expect that the costs of this effort would be privately financed, working with an appropriate nonprofit entity, and that following the completion of this work of appropriate artistic quality, we would like to have it placed in a fitting public space here in the Capitol, perhaps in the new Capitol Visitors Center, so that her story can continue to inspire the millions of visitors who come to Washington to learn more about our democratic system, which she strengthened every day of her service to our country and indeed the world.  Mr. Speaker, the text of the letter is as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2002.     Hon. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: Appreciation for the diversity and      accomplishment of our nation's leaders throughout our history      strengthens people's understanding of freedom's legacy and      potential. This is a key reason why so many of us have urged      that the artwork displayed in the public spaces of the House      be more representative of this rich history of      accomplishment, including correcting the underrepresentation      of women in the current collection on display.       The passing of our beloved colleague, Patsy Takemoto Mink      of Hawaii, offers us the opportunity to both improve our      representation of women who have contributed to this      institution and our nation, as well as pay proper recognition      to a woman whose path-breaking efforts have shaped a more      optimistic future for generations of Americans.       Congresswoman Mink's life embodied a series of firsts.       She was the first Asian-American woman to practice law in      Hawaii, and was the first Asian American Women to be elected      to the Territorial House before Hawaii became a State in      1959, and she was one of the pioneers that advocated for      Hawaii's statehood.       In 1964, she became, in her words, the first woman of color      ever elected to the U.S. Congress. As the first Asian      American woman of Japanese-American heritage elected, she      served with distinction twelve terms in the House of      Representatives for two 12-year periods.       Congresswoman Mink transcended race and gender      discrimination throughout her career. Her life experiences      challenged her to lead the fight for women and girls to have      equal access to education and athletic opportunities. She      played the leading role in the enactment of Title IX of the      Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibited for the first      time gender discrimination by federally funded institutions.      That law has become the major tool for women's fuller      participation not only in sports, but also in all aspects of      education.       Patsy's leadership on a wide range of issues as the      environment, poverty, education, and civil rights shaped a      stronger America. During her tenure in Congress Mrs. Mink      helped write environmental protection laws safeguarding land      and water, and communities affected by coal strip mining.       For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, we respectfully request the      opportunity to work with you and other officials of the House      whom you deem appropriate to commission a portrait or      sculpture of Congresswoman Mink to memorialize her      contributions. We would expect that the costs of this effort      would be privately financed, with an appropriate nonprofit      entity being designated for the receipt of any contributions.      Following the completion of this work of appropriate artistic      quality, we would like to have it displayed in a fitting      public space of the House, including possibly the new Capitol      Visitors' Center, so that her story can continue to inspire      the millions of visitors who come to Washington to learn more      about our democratic system which calls for the inclusion of      all Americans, regardless of race, gender, or origin.       We look forward to this opportunity to work with you.           Sincerely,     Neil Abercrombie,     Marcy Kaptur,     Robert A. Underwood,     Diane E. Watson,     Michael M. Honda,     Robert T. Matsui,       Members of Congress.
