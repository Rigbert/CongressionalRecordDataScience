These outstanding recipients will be honored during the Chamber's annual awards and installation banquet, which will take place on Thursday, January 29, 2009, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana.  The Hobart Chamber of Commerce utilizes members of the community in order to improve and develop business, industry, and the professions. Each year, the Chamber members and friends gather together to honor the Business Award Winners, Volunteers of the Year, and to commemorate specific accomplishments within the community.  Continuing a tradition that goes back well over 50 years, the Chamber will honor its 2008 Business Award Winners. The Large Business of the Year award recipient is Saint Mary's Medical Center. The hospital continues to be a leader in providing outstanding health services to the community. For the fourth consecutive year, Saint Mary's Medical Center has also won the 2008 Distinguished Hospital for Patient Safety. The Small Business of the Year award recipient is Sebo's Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. This outstanding facility has grown into a 138-bed facility offering clinical services, specialty programming for Alzheimer's and Dementia patients, rehabilitation services, and many other amenities. The New Business of the Year award is being presented to 54 Main Bistro. The owners, Dave and Linda Papp, renovated an 1895 Victorian home and turned it into a local favorite that is known for its weekly changing menu. Each business is dedicated to providing excellent business to the community and for that reason, they are to be commended.  The Hobart Chamber of Commerce will honor the Herrick Family with the Volunteers of the Year award. Dr. James Herrick, his wife Janet Herrick, and their daughter Cheryl Herrick have been dedicated volunteers in Hobart for many years. The family continues to be a staple in the community, donating their time and effort to numerous special events, fundraisers, the Kiwanis Club, Little League, and the community's school system, to name a few. For their selfless commitment to their community, I congratulate the Herrick family on this prestigious award.  The Hobart Chamber of Commerce will also congratulate Burns Funeral Home as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. In 1908, James E. Burns opened his first funeral home in Hammond, Indiana. His business was founded on providing compassionate care to the friends and families of the departed during their time of need. It was this principle that allowed the Burns family to expand to Gary, Hobart, and finally to Crown Point in the 1980s. Today, the family owned and operated business provides the same exceptional services, and I commend Terry, Sally, Jim, Patrick, and Jimmy Burns, and their entire staff on continuing the legacy of Mr. Burns.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Hobart Chamber of Commerce 2008 Business Award Winners, Volunteers of the Year, and also in congratulating the Burns family and their team on the 100th anniversary of Burns Funeral Home. For their dedication and commitment to the community of Hobart as well as Northwest Indiana, they are all worthy of the honors bestowed upon them.                          ____________________
