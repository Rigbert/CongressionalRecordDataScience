He and I have something in common: We are interested in alcohol fuels, ethanol and diesel. We understand these are homegrown. You don't have to wait for the OPEC cartel to decide to send them to you. We grow the corn in the field, and one out of every six bushels of corn that is grown in America creates ethanol, alcohol fuel.  Earlier, my colleague and friend from New York was talking about, What could this possibly mean to farmers? He doesn't understand the mechanics of the market. More demand raises prices. Demand for corn to use it to create ethanol and alcohol fuels will help farmers. As farmers receive higher prices for their corn, there are lower payments in the Federal programs. The taxpayers are going to benefit as well.
