Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H. Res. 792. The resolution, offered by my good friend from New York, Mr. Meeks, congratulates the Co-operative Republic of Guyana for reaching its 40th anniversary as an independent nation.  H. Res. 792 is a timely and appropriate measure to let our friends in Guyana know that we support them as they pursue a strong and sustainable democracy. The resolution recognizes the 40th anniversary of Guyana's independence and extends best wishes to that nation for peace and further progress, development, and prosperity.  Guyana has been a real friend, Madam Speaker, to the U.S. and an ally in the fight against terror. The friendship between our two nations has been strengthened by large numbers of folks who have migrated to the United States. Here the Guyanese diaspora makes significant contributions to both the U.S. and Guyana. Guyana Americans are law-abiding people who contribute to American society as good citizens while respecting the values of our society.  Guyana joins the United States in promoting political and economic freedoms; combating poverty, crime, disease, and drugs; and promoting security, regional stability, and prosperity.  The government of Guyana is, as we speak, placing emphasis on every sector of society to ensure improved efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainable development. These policies will therefore focus on strategies for development which expand and promote employment opportunities, increase foreign exchange earnings and private investment into the nation.  Guyana is an integral member of the Caribbean region and constructive partner of the United States in fulfilling the agenda of the Western Hemisphere, that is, promoting peace, security, democracy, and development throughout the hemisphere.  I urge all of our Members to support this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1545
