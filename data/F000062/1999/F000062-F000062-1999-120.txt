 President. I am pleased to introduce the ``Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals En Banc Procedures Act of 1999.''  As the largest circuit in the country, the Ninth Circuit faces unique difficulties. While this size has certain advantages, including creating a uniform body of federal law along the Pacific Coast of the United States, it also creates organizational and procedural challenges which must be addressed for the court to do its job effectively. The bill I am introducing today requires organizational and procedural reforms which will help the court to meet these challenges.  The United States Department of Justice, which is the most frequent litigant before the Ninth Circuit--participating in 40% of its cases--has specifically identified reform of the en banc review process as critical to resolving the existing problems on the Ninth Circuit.  ``From our perspective as litigants, the Ninth Circuit's shortcoming is traceable not principally to its large number of judges or geographical size, but rather to its failure effectively to address erroneous panel decisions in important cases . . . .''  The ``Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals En Banc Procedure Act'' will institute three major changes to Ninth Circuit court procedures: (1) it reduces the number of judges required to call for an en banc hearing; (2) it increases the size of en banc panels from 11 to a majority of the Circuit; and (3) it requires the establishment of a system of regional calendaring.  First, this legislation would grant the Ninth Circuit a dispensation to lower the statutory requirement that a majority of the Circuit's active-service judges must vote affirmatively to rehear a case en banc. Instead, 40 percentof the judges sitting on the Ninth Circuit would be sufficient to request an en banc hearing.  In recent years, too many en banc requests at the Ninth Circuit have been disregarded by the Court. In 1996, the Ninth Circuit voted on 25 en banc requests by its judges, but only agreed to 12 en banc hearings. In 1997, the Ninth Circuit considered 39 en banc requests, but only held 19 hearings. In 1998, the Ninth Circuit entertained 45 en banc requests, but the Circuit only agreed to hold 16 en banc panels.  The Supreme Court, our nation's highest and most venerated court, requires less than a majority of its members to consider a case. It is simply common sense that the Ninth Circuit should not have a higher burden for hearing a case en banc than the Supreme Court uses to grant certiorari.  Lowering the bar to en banc hearings will enable the Ninth Circuit to resolve a greater percentage of conflicts before they reach the Supreme Court.  A second provision of this legislation will increase the size of Ninth Circuit en banc panels from the current 11 judges to a majority of the Ninth Circuit. Except for the Ninth, the Fifth, and the Sixth circuits, all en banc panels sit as an entire court. Eleven judges selected from a 28 judge circuit are insufficient to give litigants or the general public confidence that an en banc decision reflects the views of the entire circuit. By increasing the size of the panels, the Ninth Circuit will have more judges to raise, identify, and resolve potential conflicts in controversial cases.  Critics have also objected to the Ninth Circuit because of its geographical expanse, as it ranges from Hawaii to Alaska to Arizona. It is charged that judges unfamiliar with the history of a particular region often sit on panels that decide regional issues.  The Federal courts are a national court, with a responsibility to apply a single, coherent Federal law across the states. The states of the Ninth Circuit have benefitted from this harmonizing influence. For example, the Ninth Circuit has created a consistent body of maritime law on the West Coast.  At the same time, to address both the appearance of regional bias and any actual regional bias that does exist, this bill would require the Ninth Circuit to have geographical representation on its panels.  The Ninth Circuit presently has three administrative units--a Northern, a Southern, and a Central unit. Under this legislation, at least one judge from the particular geographic unit would be assigned to cases arising in that unit. Thus, if an appeal was filed in Alaska, a judge from the Northern region would sit on the case. Similarly, if an appeal was filed in San Francisco, a Central region judge would sit on the case.  To the degree that the Ninth Circuit has stepped outside the mainstream of jurisprudence, this legislation enacts reforms that will help corral stray decisions. I look forward to working with my fellow Senate and House colleagues in enacting this reform.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1403       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
