 President.  The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. The first half of the time will be under the control of the majority leader or his designee, and the remaining time will be under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee.  Following morning business at 11, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1637, the JOBS bill, also known as the FSC/ETI bill. The bill managers were able to make some progress during yesterday's session by working through several amendments. As a reminder, a cloture motion was filed with respect to the FSC bill. That vote will occur tomorrow. We hope, if cloture is invoked, we can finish the bill this week. It is still possible we could consider related amendments during today's session. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible throughout the day, although we do not anticipate any vote prior to our respective policy luncheons. If there are votes, obviously Senators will be notified.                          ____________________
