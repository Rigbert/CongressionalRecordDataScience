Speaker, I stand in support of this legislation today.  I thank my colleague Debbie Dingell. The two of us helped cosponsor the spousal impoverishment bill, which is part of this bill. There was no objection to that, and I am delighted that we are getting it done.  But I want to particularly take this time and just thank Joe Barton for his leadership on the ACE Kids Act.  All of us come here to this House for particular causes that really grab our interest and attention. Joe Barton has been so good--some would say like a dog to a Frisbee--in getting the ACE Kids Act to the House floor. This bill is going to save lives.  It was bipartisan. Frankly, I wanted to move it as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, but we didn't have a CBO score. We couldn't get it done.  We had plenty of meetings over the last couple of years on this, and here it is. We are going to get it done. Hopefully, the Senate is going to get it done, and we are going to get it to the President's desk.  This is probably the last time that Joe Barton is actually managing a bill on the House floor, and it is appropriate that this is his bill, that it is his engine that is moving this train that really is going to make a difference for families across the country. So I say thank you, Joe Barton.
