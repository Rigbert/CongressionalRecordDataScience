 But we didn't do that job. We didn't do it, and here we are today now looking, after spending more than $1 billion to inform the consuming public about February 17, we're just going to move it to June 12. Who knows if it moves again.  Dates have meaning. Americans know about the date called April 15, the date that we pay our taxes; yet there are still a number of folks who don't file on time.  We need to file on time. We need this analog transition date to stick so that if we do have another emergency, particularly in the next couple of months, whether it be our police, our fire fighters, our EMS folks, that they will begin to have that technology so they can communicate to save lives.  That's what this is about. Please vote ``no.''
