Everybody wants this bill to pass, and the shame of it not passing today is, I am sure the gentleman shares, is that we somehow sent a message to our Armed Forces personnel arrayed across this globe, and particularly in the Middle East, at risk and they look to this capital and know full well that this bill is passed with over 400 votes and must be concluding to themselves that it was politics and political division that undermined the passage this day.  So I know my colleague is working towards this objective. This is not a criticism of the gentleman, and it was an open session in the Committee on Ways and Means, and as my colleague recalls, I am sure, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, a Republican, raised the issue that this was a real problem, in open session, in committee.  So it was obviously on both sides of the aisle that we are concerned about the fact that we politicized an otherwise bipartisan, nonpartisan objective that we wanted to achieve, and I look forward to that coming back hopefully in the posture that it was in when we, 400 of us plus, came together to pass that legislation. So I would hope that can happen.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield.
