Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I was the principal Republican author of the Brady Act, which was signed into law in 1994. While much of the debate on the Brady Act was on the 5-day waiting period that was contained in there, the lasting good of the Brady Act was the establishment of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, wherein people who are statutorily ineligible from possessing any type of firearm, such as a convicted felon or an adjudicated mental incompetent, could be identified instantly and a proposed firearm sale could be denied to that individual.  This part of the Brady Act is intended to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who are prohibited by Federal or State law from possessing them. The NICS system was established by the Attorney General to enforce the provisions of the Brady Act. The mission of NICS is to ensure the timely sale of firearms to individuals who can legally possess them and to deny their sale to individuals who are prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm.  But background checks can only be as effective as the records that are available to be checked, and most crimes of violence are prosecuted under State and local law rather than Federal law. So the NICS system cannot keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous individuals without receiving the most current records from the States.  NICS has not been operating in the most efficient way possible because of the failure of certain State and local governments to provide NICS with the current information regarding individuals who may be disqualified from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Despite the fact that the Federal Government has contributed more than $350 million since 1995 through the National Criminal History Improvement Program, called NCHIP, to help the States update their records and to improve reporting, some States still have not completely computerized their criminal records and do not maintain complete criminal history records.  Some States still do not have computerized records on mental health adjudications. And in some States domestic violence crimes and protective orders are not computerized or properly labeled as domestic violence related. Often, even States that do keep records fail to note the final disposition of arrest charges. This bill is designed to provide more money to the States to make these records as close to 100 percent perfect as possible, and I support it.  Although NICS will attempt to obtain information for any missing record, Federal law provides that if a delayed background check is still pending after 3 business days, the firearms dealer may proceed with the sale. So if the records are not in NICS and cannot be found in 3 days, the sale goes through even though the buyer might be an adjudicated mental incompetent or a convicted felon.  The NCHIP program has helped increase the records available for search by NICS by as much as 60 percent. But some States and local governments have failed to automate their records or otherwise make them available to next, and I am particularly troubled by States that have refused to join the Federal Government as partners to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them.  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about the State of Maryland's refusal to assist the FBI with these NICS checks, and I will enter four letters into the Record to highlight this problem.  In a March 12, 2002, letter to the FBI, the Maryland State Archives informed the FBI, ``We can no longer provide the research and assistance your program requires without reimbursement for the work.'' The letter indicated that the annual cost of providing this research to support NICS would cost about $45,000 annually. It was not until August 27, 2002, that the Maryland Department of Public Safety reaffirmed its commitment to NICS. Then, on October 3, 2002, the Maryland Archives informed the FBI that it will provide NICS research assistance so long as NCHIP funding is available, thereby leaving the door open to once again discontinue cooperation.  Mr. Speaker, it is outrageous that the State of Maryland would let almost 7 months go by without assisting the FBI with these criminal NICS checks. And I do not know if this was the fault of the executive branch or the failure of the Maryland legislature to provide enough money to do the job, but 7 months went by and nothing was being done.  The Federal Government spends about $60 million annually on NICS, and as I have already said, about $350 million in the last 7 years on NCHIP. Maryland has received over $6,700,000 from NCHIP to improve its criminal history records. Are we to believe that Maryland could not find another $45,000 to assist with NICS checks? Maryland's shortsighted policy has made it the weak link in the NICS system.  Maryland's policy has endangered lives and threatened public safety. Maryland's failure affects every State because a Maryland felon might, for example, try to illegally buy a gun in Virginia. If the Maryland State Archives refuses to search its criminal history records, Maryland felons can purchase guns that they are otherwise prohibited from purchasing.  It is my understanding that the State of Maryland was the only State in the country to refuse to assist the FBI with NICS checks. Practically every State in the Union has a financial problem, but they have continued working with the FBI because they felt it was important. Only Maryland said no. Maryland is now, apparently, providing that assistance, but only if Federal funding is available, and this is not tolerable because of the amount of NCHIP and other Federal criminal justice assistance provided Maryland and the importance of keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons and adjudicated mental incompetents.  The Washington Post, in an October 12, 2002, story, reported that Maryland Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend ``Is considering a plan to require ballistic fingerprints of high-powered rifles sold in Maryland.'' I would suggest that the folks in Annapolis start by assisting the FBI with a program that we know will keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  Mr. Speaker, the Lieutenant Governor's biography, which is posted on the official State of Maryland Web site, claims she is ``Maryland's point person on criminal justice,'' and her biography lists a number of anticrime efforts for which she takes credit. As the point person for criminal justice matters, I would expect the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland to fully cooperate with the General Accounting Office investigation that I am requesting today for a complete audit of Maryland's use of NCHIP funding.  Mr. Speaker, more money to upgrade State criminal history records is all well and good, but Federal money and assistance is not always the answer. Sometimes public officials need to exercise a modicum of common sense, and that common sense dictates that we need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous individuals. NICS can only do that if it is provided the records on those individuals. Accordingly, funds provided to the States must be used to improve their recordkeeping and automate system to reduce delays for law-abiding gun purchasers and to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.  In 1998, the Brady Act required Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) to initiate a background check on all persons who attempt to purchase a firearm. The Brady Act is intended to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who are prohibited by Federal or state law from possessing them. The Attorney General established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) operation center to enforce the provisions of the Brady Act.  The NICS mission is to ensure the timely sale of firearms to individuals who are not prohibited under Federal law and deny a sale to those individuals who are prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm. However, background checks can only be as effective as the records available to be checked. The NICS system cannot keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous individuals without receiving the most current records from the states.  The current NICS system has not been operating in the most efficient way possible because of the failure of certain states and local governments to provide NICS with current information regarding individuals who may be disqualified from purchasing a firearm. Despite the fact the Federal government has contributed more than $350 million since 1995 through the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) to help states update their records and improve reporting, some states still have not completely computerized their criminal records and do not maintain complete criminal-history records. Some states still do not keep computerized records on mental health adjudications. In some states, domestic violence crimes and protective orders are not computerized or properly labeled as domestic violence related. Often, even states that do keep records fail to note the final disposition of arrest charges.

Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and at this point would include for the Record the letters I referred to above:                                      Maryland State Archives,                                                   March 12, 2002.     Ms. Linda L. Miller,     Federal Bureau of Investigation,     National Instant Criminal Background Check System,     Clarksburg, WV.       Dear Ms. Miller. We regret that we can no longer provide      the research and assistance your program requires without      reimbursement for the work. Orders received before March 18      will be the last we are able to process, unless the enclosed      memorandum of understanding is signed before then.       Since July 1, 2001, the Maryland State Archives has      responded to 1,800 requests for dispositions of criminal      cases related to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System. Our staff researched the case numbers through      an on-line system, or from docket book indices, or by      contacting the courts. We then located, reproduced, and faxed      the dockets that reflect the charge and disposition. Archives      staff averaged next day response for requests received on      weekdays, and always responded within three working days      (unless we were dependent on the courts for case numbers      which are reported after that time). The annual cost of      providing this efficient service will approach $45,000.00      this year alone.       We have previously requested federal funding directly      through NICS and through federal grants to this state, but no      support has been forthcoming to date. Direct financial      support for the staff and facilities to make this information      accessible is required. Given the state imposed hiring freeze      we are operating under and the loss of reference staff in the      last four months, it is not possible for the Archives to      continue providing this service to your agency unless funds      are found to pay us a per unit cost of $25.00 for each      request.       We estimate that the Archives has processed better than      half of all the applications that your office receives from      Maryland which require further information before the      background check can be completed. If you are unable to      secure funding to assist us in the research necessary to      fulfill your requests, we foresee that you will have to      assign an agent to research here on a full-time to continue      to perform this work. We know from our own experience that      each cased requires approximately one hour of research. We      will assist any agent in our public Search Room at the Hall      of Records in Annapolis to locate the necessary documents on      days that we are open. The Archives provides this level of      service to anyone who visits our facility, although I should      point out that budget cuts may force us to close the Search      Room for one or more days during the week.           Sincerely yours.                                              Christopher N. Alan,     Deputy State Archivist.                                  ____                                          Maryland State Archives,     Federal Bureau of Investigation,     National Instant Criminal Background Check System,          Clarksburg, WV       Please note that the Maryland State Archives that as of      March 18 the Archives is no longer providing remote criminal      research for the National Instant Criminal Background Check      System. You are invited to conduct this and any future      criminal background research in the Archives' public Search      Room. Please note that many criminal files or necessary      indices may still be in the custody of the courts.       The public search room is open Tuesday through Friday, 8:00      a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and      1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. The Archives is Closed on Mondays. On      weekdays the search room remains open at lunchtime (12:00      p.m. to 1:00 p.m.) with reduced services. The Archives is      closed on state holidays. The state holiday closings for 2002      are: Tuesday, January 1; Thursday, July 4; Tuesday, November      5; Thursday, Friday and Saturday, November 28, 29 & 30;      Wednesday, December 25. The Maryland State Archives is      located at 350 Rowe Boulevard, Annapolis, MD 21401.           Sincerely,                                            R.J. Rockefeller, PhD,                                     Director, Reference Services.                                       ____         State of Maryland, Department of Public Safety and            Correctional Services, Information Technology and            Communications Division,                            Pikesville, Maryland, August 27, 2002.     Re National Instant Check System (NICS)--FBI Letter (May 9,          2002) to Maryland State Archives and Response (May 31,          2002) from Maryland State Archives.     Kimberly Del Greco,     Acting Section Chief, NICS Program Office, Clarksburg, WV       Dear Ms. Del Greco: I am writing on behalf of the Criminal      Justice Information System (CJIS) Central Repository in      response to the letter dated May 9, 2002, from Mr. Timothy      Munson, NICS Program Office, to Mr. Christopher Allan, Deputy      State Archivist of the Maryland State Archives. Mr. Munson's      letter detailed some of the frustrations he was experiencing      in obtaining Maryland criminal history record information on      subjects under the purview of the NICS operations. I am also      in receipt of the response from Mr. Allan.       The Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services      and the Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals jointly      oversee Maryland's Criminal Justice Information System      (CJIS). It is established under the authority of the Criminal      Procedure Article, Sec. Sec. 10-201-10-234, Annotated Code of      Maryland. The enabling statute is implemented by executive      Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR 12.15.01) and by judicial      rules (Maryland Rules Sec. Sec. 16-308 and 16-508). The CJIS      Central Repository is housed for administrative purposes in      the Information Technology and Communications Division of the      Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.       The policy issues raised in both letters referenced above      are of genuine concern to Maryland, and in particular to this      Department. I apologize for the long delay in responding to      the original letter. I felt it was important to first      identify what created the issues identified by Mr. Munson and      then, in consultation with NICS staff, to take immediate      steps to reach a mutually agreed-upon resolution.       I think resolution has been reached, the result of several      conference calls between our respective staffs. Consensus on      procedural issues included, among others, the following:       Installation of a dedicated fax machine by the FBI,       Faxing completed response to the FBI within 24 hours of      receipt of inquiry,       Use of standardized verbiage re: sources of dispositions,       Development of holiday/weekend work schedules, and       Identification of points-of-contact at the respective      agencies.       I should also point out that, because Maryland was a ``day-     forward'' participant when it joined the Interstate      Identification Index (III) in March 1998, this State has not      been able to electronically supply criminal history record      information prior to March 1998. However, this Department is      supporting the efforts of CJIS Central Repository to make      these the pre-March 1998 records available for NICS      investigations as soon as may be possible.       I am committed not merely to maintaining Maryland's      criminal history record information in the CJIS Central      Repository in a timely, complete, and accurate fashion, but      also to utilizing procedures that will provide this      information to authorized users in an efficient and effective      manner. Please let me know if the attempt to improve our      response with respect to NICS operations develops further      problems or does not in any way satisfy the needs of NICS.           Sincerely,                                                    Judith A. Wood     Chief Information Officer.                                  ____                                      Maryland State Archives,                                                  October 3, 2002.     Gary Wick,     Asst. Operation Manager, U.S. Department of Justice,          Clarksburg, WV.       Dear Mr. Wick: Thank you for your letter of September 19      regarding the Maryland State Archives and NICS research. Dr.      Papenfuse asked me to respond on his behalf.       Your suggestions are welcome. We will immediately cease      mailing copies after the fax transmissions. Some consider fax      an unsatisfactory record, so we followed with copies. If you      find the fax adequate, we will rely on that alone. Your staff      may continue to contact us by telephone when the fax presents      a legibility issue. We wish that the NICS staff had access to      adequate email so that we might transmit the very fine image      files we use to reproduce the documents.       You might occasionally receive contradictory reports when a      first search yields nothing, but when further information      provided by your agents or our own quality assurance steps      locate a record at first not found. This happens rarely, but      is not due to multiple staff member seeking the same record      and passing by one another. I am pleased when we can follow      up and report comprehensively, even if after the initial 72      business hours.       We are pleased to report that federal funds are available      to pay for this service through the NCHIP FY 2002 Program and      the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional      Services. So long as such funds are available, the Archives      will endeavor to contribute to national and personal security      in support of the NICS operation.           Sincerely,                                          R.J. Rockefeller, Ph.D.,                                     Director, Reference Services.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
