-megawatt solar array.  The project is a win for everyone involved. It embraces the future. It will supply 30 percent of the zoo's electricity needs, and it makes use of a vacant brownfield site in the city that would otherwise be a financial and environmental burden.  It serves as a wonderful educational tool for the zoo's more than 800,000 annual visitors.  Unfortunately, this is success story that will be difficult to replicate in Ohio due to the backward energy policy recently enacted by Ohio's Governor and State legislature.  As America strives to regain energy security, we must embrace all energy options, especially innovative, renewable energy sources that will power our future into and beyond the 21st century.  Hats off to the Toledo Zoo for serving as a national leader in advancing this goal.  Madam Speaker, I will include for the Record a recent article from the Toledo Blade detailing this really incredible success.                    [From the Blade, July 22, 2014]    Rudolph/Libbe Project: Solar Array To Supply Power to Toledo Zoo                Brownfield site will again be productive                             (By Tom Henry)       A massive, 2.1-megawatt solar array that has put 22 acres      of vacant South Toledo land back into production is to be      dedicated today. It's the kind of comeback that supporters      believe will become less common across Ohio because of a      recent bill Gov. John Kasich signed into law discouraging      investments in renewable power.       The ceremony for the Rudolph/Libbe project near the Toledo      Zoo is expected to draw a contingent of area business and      government leaders interested in seeing how land contaminated      by past industrial practices, known as brownfield sites, can      go back on the tax rolls and generate clean energy while      reducing blight.       In this case, a group of local investors led by Rudolph/     Libbe Cos.--a limited liability company called Anthony Wayne      Solar Number 1--is doing that for one of the region's largest      employers and one of its most popular destinations, the      Toledo Zoo.       The solar array and property, adjacent to the north side of      the zoo's main parking lot between Anthony Wayne Trail and      Spencer Street, are owned by those investors, who have a      long-term contract in place to sell electricity generated at      the site exclusively to the zoo.       The project, developed by Rudolph/Libbe and a sister      company, GEM Energy, will generate about 30 percent of the      Toledo Zoo's annual electricity needs, Jason Slattery,      director of solar for Rudolph/Libbe Inc., said.       ``This project is a great example of the public and private      sectors working together to benefit the zoo and the      community,'' Mr. Slattery said. ``We took a contaminated      brownfield site, a financial burden for the city, and turned      it into a win for the city of Toledo and the Toledo Zoo.''       He and other supporters believe such projects will be      harder to come by now, though, because of the two-year      legislative freeze on renewable-energy mandates that Mr.      Kasich has signed into law.       That legislation, known as Senate Bill 310, applies only to      utilities, not companies such as Rudolph/Libbe. But Ohio      became the nation's first state with renewable-energy      mandates to enact a two-year timeout.       A 2008 law requires utilities doing business in Ohio to      steadily invest more in renewable power through 2025, when at      least 12.5 percent of the electricity they provide is      supposed to come from clean sources such as wind and solar      energy.       Renewable energy advocates fear that two-year hiatus will      put out a message to the business community that Ohio is no      longer receptive to such investments.       Rudolph/Libbe, one of the region's largest contractors,      expects to be doing more work in Michigan and New York, which      have strong incentives for solar projects, Mr. Slattery said.       The solar industry has had setbacks from the failure of a      high-profile manufacturer, California-based Solyndra, as well      as the deep financial troubles of local manufacturers such as      Xunlight and Willard & Kelsey.       But Rudolph/Libbe's an installer, not a manufacturer.       Growth in solar nationally has transformed the company's      business model.       Since 2008, Rudolph/Libbe went from virtually no      involvement in solar to having 10 percent of its revenue come      from it.       It believes solar-installation projects will eventually      become the backbone of as much as 30 percent of Rudolph/      Libbe's revenue.       Although Rudolph/Libbe will likely have to rely on states      other than Ohio for that sort of push, it still expects to      line up some Ohio contracts during the two-year freeze and      hopes state legislators regain their interest in what the      company sees as a budding industry, Mr. Slattery said.       ``We think the costs of doing solar is an unstoppable train      and it's not getting off the tracks,'' he said.       Rudolph-Libbe's costs for solar projects have come down      from $9 per watt to $2 per watt since 2008. More affordable      prices have resulted in more business, Mr. Slattery has said.       For the project near the zoo, investors worked with the      Lucas County Land Bank, an agency that strives to repurpose      vacant land, he said.       The site, formerly in receivership, was once home to a      Haugh-ton Elevator Co. factory, but it has not been used      since the early '90s.       There are 28,500 solar panels on 15 of the site's 22 acres.      Additional panels could be put on some the remaining seven      acres in the future. Officials first want to assess the      viability of adding more, after examining the amount of shade      cast off nearby homes along Spencer Street during the four      seasons, Mr. Slattery said.       The site is believed to be one of the nation's largest      solar installations generating power for a zoo.       ``This solar array supports the zoo's mission by using      cleaner and greener energy, reducing reliance on nonrenewable      energy while providing an inspiring example for zoo      visitors,'' Jeff Sailer, Toledo Zoo executive director, said.       Rudolph/Libbe also developed the zoo's 1,400-panel walkway,      called SolarWalk,     which was installed in 2010, as well as multiple other      projects with the Ohio Air National Guard and ones with the      city of Bryan and First Solar LLC of Perrysburg in recent      years.       The zoo also has a wind turbine generating power for its      main parking lot, and geothermal wells to heat and cool the      aquarium.       Bill Rudolph, chairman of Rudolph/Libbe Cos., said the      companies are ``honored to support the Toledo Zoo's mission      of environmental stewardship through this project.''       The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has planted trees      and shrubs near the fences to create a visual buffer and      spruce up the aesthetics for area residents. Plans also call      for native grasses to be planted across the site.       Union labor from northwest Ohio was used to build the      project, which created about 60 temporary construction jobs.                          ____________________
