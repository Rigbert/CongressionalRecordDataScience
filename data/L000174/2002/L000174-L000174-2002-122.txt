President, if the Senator will yield, due to her good work on the bill, of which she is a prime sponsor, reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is in this bill. It tracks the Leahy-Hatch-Kennedy-Landrieu bill.  We also have authorized funding for the Centers for Domestic Preparedness. I note that because it has been the persuasive persistence of my friend from Louisiana that has improved this bill so much, and I commend her.                          ____________________
