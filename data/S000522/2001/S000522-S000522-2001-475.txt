Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, Mr. Evans of Illinois, Mr. Moran of Kansas and Mr. Filner of California, and other members of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, I am introducing a new measure, the ``Veterans Hospitals Emergency Repair Act,'' that my colleagues and I hope will begin to address what has become a troubling and lingering problem in some of our Nation's veterans hospitals: a crumbling and substandard patient-care infrastructure. The problems even include buildings that could collapse in earthquakes. In fact, Mr. Speaker, just yesterday in Tacoma, Washington, a temblor of 6.8 magnitude damaged patient care buildings 6 and 81 on the campus of the American Lake VA Medical Center.  Mr. Speaker, for the past several years, we have noted that the President's annual budget for VA health care has requested little or no funding for major medical facility construction projects for America's veterans. As we indicated last year in our report to the Committee on the Budget on the Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2001, VA has engaged in an effort through market-based research by independent organizations to determine whether present VA facility infrastructures are meeting needs in the most appropriate manner, and whether services to veterans can be enhanced with alternative approaches. This process, called ``Capital Assets Realignment for Enhanced Services,'' or ``CARES,'' has commenced within the Department of Veterans Affairs, but will require several years before bearing fruit. In the interim, Mr. Speaker, some VA hospitals need additional maintenance, repair and improvements to address immediate dangers and hazards, to promote safety and to sustain a reasonable standard of care for the nation's veterans. Recent reports by outside consultants and VA have revealed that dozens of VA health care buildings are still seriously at risk from seismic damage. The buildings at American Lake damaged in yesterday's earthquake were among those identified as being at the highest levels of risk.  Also, Mr. Speaker, a report by VA identified $57 million in improvements were needed to address women's health care; another report, by the Price Waterhouse firm, concluded that VA should be spending from 2 percent to 4 percent of its ``plant replacement value'' (PRV) on upkeep and replacement of its health care facilities. This PRV value in VA is about $35 billion; thus, using the Price Waterhouse index on maintenance and replacement, VA should be spending from $700 million to $1.4 billion each year. In fact, in fiscal year 2001, VA will spend only $170.2 million for these purposes.  While Congress authorized a number of major medical construction projects in the past three fiscal years, these have received no funding through the appropriations process. I understand that some of the more recent deferrals of major VA construction funding were intended to permit the CARES process to proceed in an orderly fashion, avoiding unnecessary spending on VA hospital facilities that might, in the future, not be needed for veterans. I agree with this general policy, especially for those larger hospital projects, ones that ordinarily would be considered under our regular annual construction authorization authority. We need to resist wasteful spending, especially when overall funds are so precious. But I believe that I have a better plan.  Mr. Speaker, when I assumed the Chairmanship of the Veterans Committee earlier this year, I asked what steps my colleaguesand I might take immediately that could help our veterans. The legislation that I am introducing today is part of the answer. This bill, which I am pleased is cosponsored by my friend and the Ranking Member of theJerry Moran of Kansas, our new Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, as well as the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Mr. Bob Filner of Califomia, as well as other members of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, sets up a temporary, 2-year program of delegated authorizations of smaller construction projects (each limited to a cost of less than $25 million) that would update, improve and restore VA health care facilities in a defined number of sites each of these years. The Secretary would be given this power to approve individual facility projects, generally based on recommendations of an independent capital investments board and on criteria detailed in our bill that place a premium on projects to protect patient safety and privacy, improve seismic protection, provide barrier-free accommodation, and improve VA patient care facilities in several specialized areas of concern, such as privacy needs for women veterans, in order to meet the contemporary standard of care for our veterans.  The bill would require the Secretary, at the end of the process, to report his actions to the VA Committee and to the Appropriations Committee as well. The bill also would mandate a review of this delegated-project approach by the General Accounting Office, to ensure this is an effective mechanism to advance some VA medical construction during the pendency of CARES.  Mr. Speaker, our bill would authorize appropriations of $250 million in fiscal year 2002, and $300 million in fiscal year 2003, to accomplish these projects under the authority provided. Thus, I believe we can make the case for this interim approach and gain support for moving a specific list of relatively small but critical projects forward with independent review. I believe we soon can be doing something urgently needed for veterans, in the best traditions of our continuing commitment to them. Then we can await the development and conclusion of the CARES process, more comfortable in the knowledge that at least for many VA hospitals, their emergency maintenance needs for small-scale construction projects will not go unnoticed, unauthorized--and unfunded.  It should be noted that nothing in this bill prevents the Committee or the Congress from still considering the merits of large-scale, VA major medical facility construction project authorizations in these two fiscal years, should we decide to take such decisions, now or in the future. By its nature, the bill is intended as a stopgap measure to give the VA Secretary limited authority to keep its health care system viable while the CARES process proceeds.  Mr. Speaker, I believe, and I hope that my colleagues will agree with me, that this is a worthy bill. On very short notice, when VA was informally advised about the prospect of this kind of bill being introduced and considered by this House, 25 projects that would be appropriate under its terms were immediately identified. I am certain that there are many more, in all sectors of the VA health care system, that the Secretary will have an opportunity to consider and approve under this authority. Many VA facilities need funds right now for small projects on an emergency basis. In good conscience, we cannot continue to ignore them. In my judgment, we cannot afford to wait several years before deciding to provide ftinds when these projects confront the VA system, the veterans, and us today.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and help enact it as a high priority early this year.                          ____________________
