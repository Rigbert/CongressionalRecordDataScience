 President, I rise today to recognize a Kentuckian who has both faithfully served his community and the men and women of the U.S. Army for more than two decades. I speak of Mr. William J. Rissel, the president and chief executive officer of the Fort Knox Federal Credit Union, a stalwart member of the Fort Knox CORE Committee, and a long-time friend.  Under Bill's leadership, the Fort Knox Federal Credit Union has achieved impressive growth and has done much to help the local community. Bill has worked in the financial services industry for more than 30 years, and he has headed the Fort Knox Federal Credit Union since 1991. In that time, it has expanded from 4 branches primarily serving Hardin County to 14 branches across central Kentucky. Fort Knox Federal Credit Union was recently awarded the Department of the Army's Distinguished Service Award. It won this recognition in competition against all other on-post credit unions in the Nation.  If there is a cause that is near and dear to Bill's heart in addition to Fort Knox Federal, it is that of Fort Knox and the surrounding community. In 2011, under Bill's guidance, Fort Knox Federal sponsored a platoon deployed to Afghanistan. The staff shared messages of support and care packages with the soldiers to remind them of home and let them know that they remained in the thoughts and prayers of the local community. Bill and I have worked together for years trying to ensure that Fort Knox has what it needs to support its mission and the military personnel and their families who call the post home. Bill has been a member of the Fort Knox CORE Committee since 1993 and has served as president of the organization since January 2006.  Bill is also active in the local area, having served as a Radcliff Chamber of Commerce board member; president of the Association of the United States Army, Fort Knox chapter; the United Way Advisory Committee; the Radcliff Industrial Foundation Board; and Rotary International. He also visits Fort Knox Elementary School and reads to Mrs. Trimble's class every year.  Bill and his wife Rosie are completing their dream house in Florida where they may both enjoy the warm weather, but I know his heart will always remain in central Kentucky.  Mr. President, I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. William J. Rissel for his successful career and thank him for his service to the community and to Fort Knox.                          ____________________
