President, as we meet on the floor of the Senate, we are deliberating a bill about promoting tourism in America, which turns out to be a way to increase economic activity, create some business activity, keep people in their jobs, and maybe attract folks from overseas to see this beautiful land of ours. We are now in a procedural holding pattern. The minority party has asked us to wait 30 hours before we talk about it. It is unfortunate because we are prepared to go and are ready and we have a lot of things to do, but the rules of the Senate are available for them as for us, and they are utilizing them now to delay and stop action on this bill which is very routine, bipartisan, and enjoyed the support of over 90 Senators when it was called yesterday on a procedural vote.  In the meantime, as we are waiting on the floor for the Republicans to give us permission to go forward, the committees are at work. I left the Judiciary Committee where the Presiding Officer is also a member, with the Attorney General, where we spoke about some critical issues.  Right across the hall from us is the Finance Committee, and they are debating the future of health care in America, and that is a debate which we are all following very closely.  It is clearly time for us to acknowledge the obvious. Although we have some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world, the fact is the cost of health care in America is spinning out of control and if we do not have the political will and courage to step up atthis moment in time and address that, it is going to get much worse. People will find that there will be more uninsured people, people with health insurance that is not worth much, and that the cost of what you can buy will be so expensive that average people cannot afford it. You will find, if we do not do something, that health insurance companies will continue to exclude people because of preexisting conditions, continue to argue incessantly with doctors over what the right procedure will be. We will find unfortunately that there will be a situation where we do not have the chance to utilize the very best health care in this country for needed procedures.  Many Senators say: I have listened to that but count me out. I have a great health insurance plan. I don't need to be part of your debate.  What President Obama has said and what we have said in Congress is: OK, we accept that. If you have health insurance that you like, that you want to keep, you can keep it. There will not be any change. But if you happen to be one of those Americans who think they can do better for something more affordable or, sadly, if you are one of the 48 million Americans with no health insurance, for you, we think we have to change some of the ways we do business in this country.  One of the key elements here, as I mentioned already, is what to do with 48 million uninsured. If these uninsured people had their own health insurance, it would be a benefit to all the rest of us who happen to have health insurance.  Some of these political commentators like to write that Members of the Senate have some special health insurance plans. We are fortunate to have one of the best in the world, but it is the same plan Federal employees have across America. Eight million Federal employees and their families, and Members of Congress who opt to buy into it, have a wonderful plan. I am lucky; my wife and I are very fortunate to have that kind of coverage. But for a lot of people, they don't have that kind of luxury. Once each year, I can choose from nine different health insurance plans that sell to Federal employees who live in the State of Illinois. That is quite a good deal. If I don't like the way I was treated last year by my health insurance company, I can change. It is like buying a car; I have a lot of places to shop and look. But most Americans don't have that. Most Americans do not have the option of looking for health insurance, and if they do, they cannot afford it. If you have to pay for it out of pocket, you may find yourself unable, and small businesses which want to provide health insurance, not only for the owners but the workers, say: It is just too darned expensive, we cannot afford to do it.  That is why 48 million Americans--not the poorest because we cover them with Medicaid, and not those lucky enough to have health insurance, but those smack-dab in the middle who get up and work every day at businesses, maybe businesses they own, and do not have health insurance. One out of four realtors in America has no health insurance. You don't think of that, but it is a fact. So we work with them to try to come up with an approach--that is now being debated by the Finance Committee--to have small businesses and self-employed people have a chance to buy health insurance just like Federal employees can buy health insurance.  But we really have to get to the bottom line of this issue. It is not enough to just say we are going to cover 48 million Americans currently not covered. That is important because uninsured people who show up at the hospital in America today are not turned away, they are treated. Who pays for them if they cannot pay for themselves? The rest of us--taxpayers and people with health insurance. It is estimated that the average family pays an additional $1,000 a year--almost $100 a month--for coverage for uninsured people. We are picking up their health expenses because they do not have health insurance. That is a hidden tax. So when we talk about the cost of health care reform, there is a real cost of doing nothing--about $1,000 a year out-of-pocket for most American families.  We need to move on to the tougher issue, and this is the one debated at length here on the floor. The bottom line here is the cost of medical care. We spend twice as much as any other nation on Earth for medical care for our citizens. Sadly, we do not have the results to show for it. If you look at the basic health indicators, many countries that spend far less per person than the United States have much better outcomes. You wonder, why is that the case? We have the best hospitals, we have the best doctors, we have all the technology, all the drug companies. Why are we not the healthiest people in the world?  Some of it is our own fault. When you look at the chronic conditions that cost so much in our health care system, it is the choice of the person who decides, I am going to keep smoking cigarettes. That is a terrible choice. It can lead to sickness and disease and even death, and that is a lifestyle choice people should not make, and they do and we pay dearly for it.  Other people do not watch their diets closely. I am certainly no one to preach on that. But when we suffer from obesity in this country, people end up in the hospital and end up in doctors' offices 10 times more frequently than people who are not obese. Diabetes comes from that, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems--all these can be managed with lifestyle choices and preventive medicine, which we do not focus on in America today, so we need to do more of that.  But the other element is we need to have buy-in from doctors and hospitals and medical professionals to bring down the cost of health care.  There is a widely read article which has been referred to over and over, worth repeating, published by a doctor who is a surgeon in Boston. His name is Atul Gawande. The article was published in the New Yorker on June 1. I commend it to everyone following this debate because most Members of Congress are reading it closely. Dr. Gawande went to McAllen, TX, and wanted to know why the average cost for a Medicare patient treatment in that town was $15,000 a year while the average cost in El Paso--and Chicago, I might add--was right at $10,000 a year. Why did it cost 50 percent more to treat a Medicare patient in McAllen, TX? He took a look and sat down with doctors, and being a surgeon he knew what questions to ask.  The first response was: Defensive medicine. We have to order extra tests because those lawyers will sue us.  Another Doctor said: You know that is not true, Texas has the toughest medical malpractice law in America, limiting pain and suffering awards to $250,000.  This doctor went on to say: Nobody is suing us around here. It is not about defensive medicine. If it is, it is a tiny part of it.  What it turns out is many of the doctors in that community, and hospitals, are ordering more procedures than are needed. If you are a patient or the parent of a patient, you are not going to question it when a doctor says: I think we need an MRI. Are you going to say: Doctor, are you sure we need an MRI? You trust his judgment, and that judgment, unfortunately, can be very expensive because the doctors in that town are motivated by more procedures, more billing, more money, more profit. That is the wrong motivation. The motivation should be a healthy patient, a good medical outcome.  Dr. Gawande contrasted McAllen, TX, with the Mayo Clinic, a fantastic medical resource in Rochester, MN. It treated members of my family, and it is one of the best in the Nation. The Mayo Clinic hires the best doctors they can find and pays them by salary. They are not paid by patient or how much they bill. So these salaried doctors are looking for good outcomes. They don't want to order anything more than a patient needs. They want to get a good outcome. Think of the difference in motivation between the doctors in McAllen, TX, and the doctors in Rochester, MN.  The Congressional Budget Office sent a report to us yesterday, and it says if you really want to reduce the costs of health care in America, you have to get to the question of reimbursement. When you talk about that, you will get everybody at the American Medical Association on their feet, shaking their fists, saying if you cut back on compensation and reimbursement for doctors, fewer people will go into the profession, you will not be able to get thebest procedures--you understand what they are going to say. I have heard it. Many of us have heard it. But we have to find a good way to approach this. We have to bring down the rising cost of health care in this country.  One of the suggestions is that in addition to private health insurance companies offering health insurance, we have a public option, that we have a plan that really is not motivated by profit, whether it is a government-sponsored plan like Medicare or whether it is some other plan, a cooperative, which Senator Conrad has proposed, that really says: Let's take the profit out of it and see if we can move toward the best health care outcomes and reduce the costs of health insurance so we get a good medical outcome at a reasonable cost.  Some have come to the floor and criticized that idea. I think they are wrong. I think if you look at the Medicare system, 45 years after we enacted it, it has been an unqualified success. Just look at how long seniors are living because they have good medical care after they reach the age of 65. It is not a question of whether you are rich or poor.  I run into people in my State of Illinois--a woman, a Realtor who said to me in Harrisburg, IL: Senator, I want you to meet me. She said: I am 64 years old. I have never had health insurance 1 day in my life.  I could not believe that. But she said: Next year I am 65. I am going to have Medicare. And finally I can breathe a little easier knowing that the savings I have put together are not going to be wiped out with one trip to the doctor.  So we understand that Medicare has worked. And it has created quality care and good outcomes. We also know the Veterans' Administration, another government health insurance approach for the men and women who served our country, whom we honor with a medical system that is there for them, provides some of the best care in our country.  We need to find a way to work out these differences. Believe me, at the end of the day there will always be a reason to do nothing. There will be political risk in doing something. But the American people have to stick with us in this debate and understand that if we do not address the fundamental issue, it is not just a question of whether we will have deficits as far as the eye can see from medical costs or a program going through the roof, it is a question of whether we will all have peace of mind of health insurance protection for ourselves and our families that makes sure we have something we can afford, based on quality that will provide the kind of health care we need. It all comes around. Every family faces it. And when that day comes, we want to make sure we have done our part. This year, President Obama has challenged us, though we are sitting idly on the floor today doing virtually nothing except giving speeches. He has told us: Do not go home this year without health care reform.  He is right. It is time to roll up our sleeves and get that done.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times on June 17, this morning, by David Leonhardt entitled ``Health Care Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 17, 2009]            Health Care Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality                          (By David Leonhardt)       Rationing.       More to the point: Rationing!       As in: Wait, are you talking about rationing medical care?      Access to medical care is a fundamental right. And rationing      sounds like something out of the Soviet Union. Or at least      Canada.       The r-word has become a rejoinder to anyone who says that      this country must reduce its runaway health spending,      especially anyone who favors cutting back on treatments that      don't have scientific evidence behind them. You can expect to      hear a lot more about rationing as health care becomes the      dominant issue in Washington this summer.       Today, I want to try to explain why the case against      rationing isn't really a substantive argument. It's a clever      set of buzzwords that tries to hide the fact that societies      must make choices.       In truth, rationing is an inescapable part of economic      life. It is the process of allocating scarce resources. Even      in the United States, the richest society in human history,      we are constantly rationing. We ration spots in good public      high schools. We ration lakefront homes. We ration the best      cuts of steak and wild-caught salmon.       Health care, I realize, seems as if it should be different.      But it isn't. Already, we cannot afford every form of medical      care that we might like. So we ration.       We spend billions of dollars on operations, tests and drugs      that haven't been proved to make people healthier. Yet we      have not spent the money to install computerized medical      records--and we suffer more medical errors than many other      countries.       We underpay primary care doctors, relative to specialists,      and they keep us stewing in waiting rooms while they try to      see as many patients as possible. We don't reimburse      different specialists for time spent collaborating with one      another, and many hard-to-diagnose conditions go untreated.      We don't pay nurses to counsel people on how to improve their      diets or remember to take their pills, and manageable cases      of diabetes and heart disease become fatal.       ``Just because there isn't some government agency      specifically telling you which treatments you can have based      on cost-effectiveness,'' as Dr. Mark McClellan, head of      Medicare in the Bush administration, says, ``that doesn't      mean you aren't getting some treatments.''       Milton Friedman's beloved line is a good way to frame the      issue: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The choice      isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between      rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United      States devotes far more of its economy to health care than      other rich countries, and gets worse results by many      measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very      rationally.       On Wednesday, a bipartisan panel led by four former Senate      majority leaders--Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole and      George Mitchell--will release a solid proposal for health      care reform. Among other things, it would call on the federal      government to do more research on which treatments actually      work. An ``independent health care council'' would also be      established, charged with helping the government avoid      unnecessary health costs. The Obama administration supports a      similar approach.       And connecting the dots is easy enough. Armed with better      information, Medicare could pay more for effective      treatments--and no longer pay quite so much for health care      that doesn't make people healthier.       Mr. Baker, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell: I accuse      you of rationing.       There are three main ways that the health care system      already imposes rationing on us. The first is the most      counterintuitive, because it doesn't involve denying medical      care. It involves denying just about everything else.       The rapid rise in medical costs has put many employers in a      tough spot. They have had to pay much higher insurance      premiums, which have increased their labor costs. To make up      for these increases, many have given meager pay raises.       This tradeoff is often explicit during contract      negotiations between a company and a labor union. For      nonunionized workers, the tradeoff tends to be invisible. It      happens behind closed doors in the human resources      department. But it still happens.       Research by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra of      Harvard has found that, on average, a 10 percent increase in      health premiums leads to a 2.3 percent decline in inflation-     adjusted pay. Victor Fuchs, a Stanford economist, and Ezekiel      Emanuel, an oncologist now in the Obama administration,      published an article in The Journal of the American Medical      Association last year that nicely captured the tradeoff. When      health costs have grown fastest over the last two decades,      they wrote, wages have grown slowest, and vice versa.       So when middle-class families complain about being      stretched thin, they're really complaining about rationing.      Our expensive, inefficient health care system is eating up      money that could otherwise pay for a mortgage, a car, a      vacation or college tuition.       The second kind of rationing involves the uninsured. The      high cost of care means that some employers can't afford to      offer health insurance and still pay a competitive wage.      Those high costs mean that individuals can't buy insurance on      their own.       The uninsured still receive some health care, obviously.      But they get less care, and worse care, than they need. The      Institute of Medicine has estimated that 18,000 people died      in 2000 because they lacked insurance. By 2006, the number      had risen to 22,000, according to the Urban Institute.       The final form of rationing is the one I described near the      beginning of this column: the failure to provide certain      types of care, even to people with health insurance. Doctors      are generally not paid to do the blocking and tackling of      medicine: collaboration, probing conversations with patients,      small steps that avoid medical errors. Many doctors still do      such things, out of professional pride. But the full medical      system doesn't do nearly enough.       That's rationing--and it has real consequences.       In Australia, 81 percent of primary care doctors have set      up a way for their patients to get after-hours care,      according to the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States,      only 40 percent have. Overall, the survival rates for many      diseases in this country are no better than they are in      countries that spend far less on health care. People here are     less likely to have long-term survival after colorectal      cancer, childhood leukemia or a kidney transplant than they      are in Canada--that bastion of rationing.       None of this means that reducing health costs will be easy.      The comparative-effectiveness research favored by the former      Senate majority leaders and the White House has inspired      opposition from some doctors, members of Congress and patient      groups. Certainly, the critics are right to demand that the      research be done carefully. It should examine different forms      of a disease and, ideally, various subpopulations who have      the disease. Just as important, scientists--not political      appointees or Congress--should be in charge of the research.       But flat-out opposition to comparative effectiveness is, in      the end, opposition to making good choices. And all the noise      about rationing is not really a courageous stand against less      medical care. It's a utopian stand against better medical      care.
