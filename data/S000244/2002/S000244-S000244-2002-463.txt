Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the impassioned speech by the gentleman from Illinois. I am afraid he has forgotten a couple of things as he has been talking about how good Chapter 12 is.  First of all, Congress did pass an extension of Chapter 12. It was by a voice vote in this House and an overwhelming vote in the Senate as a part of a bankruptcy reform bill, and Chapter 12 would be permanent today if it were not for the fact that President Clinton pocket vetoed the Bankruptcy Reform Act in the last Congress; and in this Congress, the House has been attempting to reach a compromise with the other body in the bankruptcy conference.  We sent a proffer to the Senate in February to resolve all of the outstanding issues, and the other body rejected it. So there has not been any negligence on the part of the House of Representatives in reaching a conclusion on this. We still continue our negotiations. The people on the other side of the Capitol are bringing additional issues that were not considered in either House that we continue negotiating.  One of my top priorities this year is to get a bankruptcy bill passed and signed into law that will help out everybody in this country, not just the 383 people who filed for Chapter 12 in the year 2001.  I need the gentleman's help in getting an overall bankruptcy reform bill passed. Again, I do not have a problem with his motion to instruct, but I hope and pray that the effect of that motion to instruct is not to unravel all of the popular items out of a bankruptcy reform bill so that we do not pass an overall bankruptcy reform bill and get it signed into law.  Last year, bankruptcy wrote off $44 billion of debt of bankrupts and that has increased the cost of goods and services by approximately $400 for the average American family from Maine to California, and it seems to me that we should not be letting people who use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool off the hook because that ends up being a tax increase on the overwhelming majority of the American people who pay their debts as agreed, and that is the issue in bankruptcy reform; and that is why we have got to keep all the cars on the train so that we can get this passed and relieve the American people of having to pay the debts of those that use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool.                              {time}  1400  Mr. Speaker, I support the motion to instruct, but let us keep our eye on the ball.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
