Reclaiming my time, I will tell the gentleman, I'm sure he knows this, April 20, 2007, 4 months, actually 3\1/2\ months after, as a result of the election of 2006, the American public gave us the responsibility of leading, we passed regulatory legislation through this House 4 months into our term, after 6 years.  Very frankly, as you recall, Mike Oxley, the chairman of the Banking Committee under the Republican leadership, we passed regulatory legislation then. It was opposed by the administration. And Mike Oxley said, and I won't say what he said, but essentially he said, in a different way, that the administration gave them the back of his hand.
