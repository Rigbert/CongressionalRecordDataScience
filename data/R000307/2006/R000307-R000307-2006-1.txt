President, today I honor Ms. Joyce Woodburn's 35 years of dedicated service at the Central Intelligence Agency. Ms. Woodburn has had a long and distinguished Government career, and on January 2, 2007, she will bring to a close a career as a CIA staff officer that includes over 27 years in the CIA's Office of Congressional Affairs.  Joyce began her extensive career as a secretary and rose to the rank of senior executive within the Agency. During her career, she has worked for 7 Presidents, 13 Directors of Central Intelligence, 2 Directors of the CIA, and the first Director of National Intelligence.  Joyce's excellent work and professionalism is well known to us on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and she has been a linchpin in coordinating and supporting the CIA's relations with Congress over the last 27 years. Her calm and friendly diplomacy has certainly smoothed over many a bump in the CIA's relations with Congress.  She has represented the CIA in Congress through some historic crises, including the ordeal of the American hostages in Iran, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the bombings of the Embassy and Marine compounds in Beirut, the Iran-Contra scandal, the fall of the Soviet Union, Operation Desert Storm, Somalia, the bombings of our embassies in Africa, 9/11 and the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the current tensions with Iran and North Korea. Joyce has been a tremendous help over the past 27 years in getting the members and staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence the information and briefings we need to do our work.  Thank you for your service, Joyce, and we wish you a healthy and prosperous retirement.                          ____________________
