 President, once again, my friend misses the point. I am not objecting to the State portion being put in here. That is not relevant. It has nothing to do with terrorism. It is not going to effect the bill. My colleague talks about this having an impact on terrorism. I believe we should reform State habeas corpus. We should, and it is appropriate to do it in this bill, as long as my friend from Washington does not have any illusions that he can go back and tell the people of Washington that by effecting State habeas corpus he has done something about terrorism. That is the point. It is relevant, just not relevant to stopping terrorism.  The second point I will make--and then I will make my motion--is that people have been asking me about time. I am willing to enter into a time agreement. There are a maximum of a possible 14 motions. I doubt whether they will all be used. I am prepared to agree to one-half hour, equally divided, and to a time certain to vote tomorrow, or tonight, or whenever anybody wants to vote on it. So I want everybody to know that. I understand we may be trying to work that out now.
