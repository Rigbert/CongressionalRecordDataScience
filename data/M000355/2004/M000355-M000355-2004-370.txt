 President, I congratulate the majority leader and the Democratic leader for what I think is an excellent agreement made in good faith. It gives us a chance to pass one of the most important pieces of legislation that Congress will consider in the second session of the 108th Congress.  It has not been easy getting to this point. I wanted to say, particularly on behalf of those of us who represent States in which tobacco farmers are slowly having their assets stripped from them, that this agreement gives the buyout a chance. It doesn't guarantee an outcome, but it certainly gives the buyout a chance to be considered in conference. Getting to conference on this bill is a significant move in the right direction from the point of view of those of us who represent tobacco growers.  I thank the leaders for what I think is an excellent agreement to move this into conference and have a chance to pass a very important bill.                          ____________________
