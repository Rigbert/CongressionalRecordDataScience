 In addition to the CR, which is necessary to fund government, we have a crisis in America, a health crisis. We spent a lot of time talking about it last time. We won't spend a long time, but Zika continues to be a real challenge. We have continuing incidents. The moral and fiscal costs of not addressing this issue are of great magnitude, great seriousness.  Can the gentleman tell me whether he believes that sufficient resources to respond to the Zika crisis will be included in the CR or whether it may be a freestanding bill that we could reach consensus on and send to the President?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman is correct that this is a crisis before us. The gentleman and I have worked on this issue when it first arose, putting individuals into committee and looking at what we needed to accomplish. This House actually acted and acted early.  Your question is: Would it be combined with the continuing resolution? I believe that is what we would see, along with the continuing resolution to solve this challenge with Zika. Unfortunately, it has been stuck in the Senate. In the conversations I have been having with the other house, I am very hopeful that that will get done.
