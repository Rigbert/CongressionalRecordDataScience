President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a meeting of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has been scheduled to discuss natural gas issues. The meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 21, 2013, at 10:00 a.m., in room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building.  The purpose of this meeting is to provide a forum to explore what the next applications are for natural gas and how this new demand will be met. Domestic supply and the potential benefits or unintended consequences caused by expansion of natural gas exports will be specific points of interest.  Because of the limited time available for the forum, witnesses may testify by invitation only. However, those wishing to submit written testimony for the record may do so by sending it to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510-6150, or by e-mail to [email protected].senate.gov.  For further information, please contact Todd Wooten at (202) 224-4971 or Lauren Goldschmidt at (202) 224-5488.                          ____________________
