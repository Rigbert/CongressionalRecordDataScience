President, obviously, I agree with the withdrawal of the amendment and hope that will be an issue better addressed in another forum. I am pleased it was. I also hope that we may see soon the Ambassadors--this confirmation is still being withheld--so the family, the children, everybody else can make plans, especially since the school year is now upon us.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc; that the bill be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment; and that no points of order be waived thereon by reason of this agreement.
