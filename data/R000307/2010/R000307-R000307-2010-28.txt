Dr. Barrasso has been predicting this for some time. Those of us on the Finance Committee and the Health committee, we got a double dose. During the health care debate, we tried to warn of the ``four rationers'' that were embedded in the bill. That is what we called them. I made several statements on them. We have: the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, the CMS Innovation Center, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  Dr. Berwick was actually the vice chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force until 1996. You may remember this, as Dr. Barrasso pointed out, this was the body that recently ignited a firestorm by recommending that women wait until age 50 before they receive a mammogram. That certainly angered many doctors in America, and whoever said that beat a hasty retreat.  We also warned that ObamaCare, I say to the leader and my friend from Wyoming, will result in higher costs, not lower, a prediction not only by the CBO but by the bravest man in America, CMS expert, Richard Foster, who--it is amazing to me that he is still on the job, thank goodness. He recently backed all that up, in terms of higher premiums, higher cost, rationing, access to doctors by the elderly, and has renewed his warning time and time again.  Now our predictions are coming true and President Obama's CMS nominee,Dr. Berwick, will be the man who cuts health care costs by putting the rationing plans into practice. We will call it cost containment, but it will be rationing.  I hope my colleagues will join me in carefully reviewing the statements and the speeches and the books and everything else that good Dr. Berwick has stated in the last 30 years on rationing. I think if we do that, most of us will agree he is the wrong man, wrong time, wrong job.  I thank the leader and the good doctor for allowing me to join in this colloquy.
