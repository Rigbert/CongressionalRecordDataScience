 President, I rise to introduce the Protecting Our Youth From Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2013 along with my colleagues and friends, Senators Klobuchar, Manchin and Schumer. This bill will provide law enforcement and prosecutors with an important new tool to address the growing threat posed by dangerous, synthetic drugs.  Synthetic drugs are unregulated substances designed by scientists to mimic the effects of controlled substances. They are packaged in a manner which is intended to appeal to our Nation's youth and are sold at gas stations, head shops and over the Internet.  Manufacturers of these products boldly seek to circumvent Federal law by marketing their merchandise as innocuous items like potpourri, incense, bath salts and plant food and stating that they are ``not intended for human consumption.'' Make no mistake; the individuals who produce, distribute and sell these products are nothing more than drug traffickers who seek to profit from the human use of these drug products.  When Congress outlawed several of these synthetic drugs last year, traffickers did not stop producing them. Instead, they made slight alterations to the chemical structure of the illegal drugs to skirt the law. By doing this, the traffickers produced ``controlled substance analogues.''  The bill I am introducing today will give law enforcement the tools they need to prosecute individuals who produce and distribute controlled substance analogues.  Many of the controlled substance analogues on the market today are designed to mimic the effects of THC, the principal chemical in marijuana. The Monitoring the Future survey, which tracks the drug-using behaviors of adolescents, began studying the use of synthetic marijuana in in 2011. Their 2012 report found that 11.3 percent of 12th graders had used synthetic marijuana in the prior 12 months. Aside from alcohol and tobacco, synthetic marijuana was the second most widely used drug among 12th graders after marijuana.  There are many other ``families'' of controlled substance analogues whichhave been encountered in the market place. They mimic the effects of drugs like ecstasy, PCP and LSD and therefore produce strong stimulant and/or hallucinogenic effects when ingested.  Altogether, there are an estimated 200 controlled substance analogues available today. The threat is global and is rapidly expanding.  Fortunately, the Obama Administration has made progress combatting this threat. Two nationwide operations targeting designer synthetic drugs--one in 2012 dubbed Operation LogJam and the other which culminated approximately two weeks ago named Operation Synergy--demonstrate this progress. These operations resulted in at least 318 arrests; 681 executed search warrants, including at least 29 for drug manufacturing facilities; $93 million in cash and assets seized; and the removal of 10 tons of synthetic drugs from the supply chain.  Today, I am introducing a bill that will put these drug traffickers on notice that if they seek to develop products containing controlled substance analogues that put our nation's youth in harm's way, then they will be brought to justice. This will be accomplished by creating a new tool by which the administration can designate, and publish, an administrative list of outlawed controlled substance analogues.  First, the Protecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2013 will establish an inter-agency committee of scientists, headed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, which will be responsible for establishing and maintaining an administrative list of controlled substance analogues. The Committee is structured so that it can respond quickly and robustly to the threat.  Second, DEA officials have informed my staff that virtually all of these controlled substance analogues arrive as bulk powders from outside our borders. My bill will make it illegal to import a controlled substance analogue on the list unless the importation is intended for non-human use.  Third, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review, and if appropriate, amend the federal sentencing guidelines for violations of the Controlled Substances Act pertaining to controlled substance analogues.  Finally, it is important to note that controlled substance analogues are not controlled substances, meaning that the registration, reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the Controlled Substances Act do not apply to those who seek to perform bona fide scientific research or use a controlled substance analogue for non-human industrial applications.  This bill sends a strong message to drug traffickers who continue to circumvent our Nation's laws. Congress recognizes that no matter how you alter the chemical structure of synthetic drugs to get around the law, they remain dangerous and should not be available for human consumption.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1323       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Youth from      Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2013''.     SEC. 2. ENFORCEMENT.

SEC. 4. DIRECTIVE TO SENTENCING COMMISSION.       (a) In General.--Pursuant to its authority under section      994 of title 28, United States Code, the United States      Sentencing Commission shall review and, if appropriate, amend      the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements to      ensure the guidelines and policy statements provide adequate      penalties for any offense involving the unlawful      manufacturing, importing, exporting, or trafficking of      controlled substance analogues under part D of the Controlled      Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841 et seq.) or part A of the      Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et      seq.) and similar offenses, including unlawful possession,      possession with intent to commit any of the foregoing      offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to commit any of the      foregoing offenses.
