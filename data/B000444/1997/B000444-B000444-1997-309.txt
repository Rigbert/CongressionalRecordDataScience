 The notion of, as my friend from North Carolina stated, that there is an artificial date of April 29 made up by the administration to put undue pressure on the Senate to act. Let me point out for the Senate that there is nothing artificial about that date. It is real.  What does that mean? It means that our failure to ratify before the 29th will have consequences. First, the chemical weapons treaty mandates trade restrictions that could have a deleterious impact upon the American chemical industry. If the United States has not ratified, as long as they have not ratified, American companies will have to supply end user certificates to purchase certain classes of chemicals from the CWC signatories. After 3 years, they will be subject to trade sanctions that will harm American exports and jobs.  I know that my friend says a lot of chemical companies do not like this. I come from a State that has a little bit of an interest in chemicals, the single most significant State in America that deals with chemicals. A little company called Du Pont; a little company called Hercules; a little company called ICI Americas; a little company called Du Pont Merck--little pharmaceutical outfits who are among the giants in the world. They are not what you call liberal Democratic establishments. They are ardently--I can testify--they are ardently in favor of this treaty. They believe it is desperately in the interest of the United States of America and their interest. This is not a bunch of lib labs out there who are arms controllers running around saying, ``Disarm, ban the bomb.'' These are Fortune, not 500, not 100, 10, Fortune 10 companies that are saying, ``We want this treaty.'' And further, ``We will be harmed if we do not enter this treaty.''  This overall governing body, known as the Conference of State Partners, is going to meet soon after April 29 to draw up the rules governing the implementation of this treaty. If we, to use the vernacular, ``ain't'' in by the 29th, if we are not on by the 29th, we do not get to draw up those rules.  There used to be a distinguished Senator from Louisiana I served with for a long time. My friend, the Presiding Officer, knew him from his days up here. His name was Russell Long. He used to say kiddingly, ``I ain't for no deal I ain't in on.'' But the chemical industry, which is our largest exporter--hear what I just said--the biggest fish in the pond are saying, ``We want to be in on the deal.''  That is why the 29th is important. If we are not a party to the CWC, we will not be a member of that conference. And this body, with no American input, could make rules that have a serious impact upon the United States.  Third, there will be a body called the executive council with 41 members on which we are assured of a permanent seat from the start because of the size of our chemical industry, that is, if we have ratified by the 29th. If we ratify after the council is already constituted, then a decision on whether to order a required surprise inspection on an American facility may be taken without an American representative evaluating the validity of the request and looking out for a facility's interest because we will not be on the standing executive council that makes that decision.  Fourth, there will be a technical secretariat with about 150 inspectors, many of whom would be Americans because of the size and sophistication of our chemical industry. If we fail to ratify the convention by the 29th, there will be no American inspectors.  And finally, and most importantly, in the long term, by failing to ratify, we would align ourselves with thoserogue actors, those rogue states who have chosen to defy the Chemical Weapons Convention. There would be irreparable harm to our global leadership on critical arms control and nonproliferation issues.  I will not take the time now to address other concerns that have been raised, because I said I would limit myself to these three points.  Concluding, Mr. President, first, there has been good-faith, long and serious negotiations resulting in significant movement by the administration on conditions to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Second, this treaty is in the overwhelming national interest of the United States of America, a topic I am ready, willing, and anxious to debate with my distinguished colleague from North Carolina and others who think it is not. But at a minimum, Mr. President, the Senate should get a chance to hear that debate and vote on whether or not the distinguished Senator from North Carolina is correct or the Senator from Delaware is correct.  Third, Mr. President, April 29 is not an artificial date. Because the triggering mechanism was when we got to 65 signatories, and that 6 months after that date the treaty would enter into force.  Well, 65 have signed on. And 6 months after they got to the No. 65, happens to be April 29. This is not artificial. We did not make up the date. That is what the treaty says.  So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that my friend from North Carolina, having reflected on the quandary the administration was placed in, which was to negotiate with the Lott group--they thought they were negotiating with Senator Helms; they thought they were negotiating with every Republican who had an objection, under the auspices of Senator Lott--if they had known that Senator Helms did not view that as the appropriate forum for this negotiation, they would have simultaneously met with him.  But now at the end of the process, when we are about to go out on recess, to say that we are not ready to bring this treaty up when we get back unless there is a new negotiation, I find unusual, particularly since I have agreed with the Senator from North Carolina that I will sign on to additional conditions with him.  Let us vote on the only nine outstanding issues that I am aware of that have been raised. None other has been raised that I am aware of, that the administration is aware of, anyone in the Lott group is aware of, to the best of my knowledge.  So, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying, the Senator from North Carolina has dealt with me in good faith. We have negotiated in great detail. He has listed his 30 objections. We have agreed on 21 of the 30. We disagree on nine. We agree on a method to vote on those nine.  I sincerely hope--I sincerely hope--for the interest of the United States of America, after having already decided in the Bush administration that we would do away with the use of chemical weapons regardless of what anybody else did, that we would not now lose our place of leadership in the world and our ability to engage in the moral suasion that relates to nonproliferation and the diminution of weapons of mass destruction, that we would not now forgo that position merely because 1, 2 or 5 or 10 Senators said we should not even bring it on the floor to debate.  I do not believe that will happen. But then again, my wife thinks I am a cockeyed optimist. But I do not think I am being unduly optimistic or a cockeyed optimist. I think having been here this long, that the Senate will get a chance to work its will. That is all I am asking. All I am asking is the Senate get a chance between now and the 29th of April to decide whether it likes this treaty or not. I believe every Member of this Senate has the national interests of the United States of America in mind when they act and when they vote.  Let each of them vote their conscience on this treaty. If it turns out that 66 do not agree with me, then we have spoken, as we did in the League of Nations. The consequences of that vote I think were disastrous. I think the consequence of failure to ratify this treaty would be disastrous. But I think the consequence of not even letting the Senate vote will be catastrophic.  I yield the floor, Mr. President.                               Exhibit 1                                           Harvard Law School,                                 Cambridge, MA, September 9, 1996.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden, You have asked me to comment on the      suggestion that the Chemical Weapons Convention (the      Convention), now before the Senate for its advice and      consent, conflicts with the provisions of the Fourth      Amendment of the Constitution prohibiting unreasonable      searches and seizures. In my view, the suggestion is      completely without merit.       The Convention expressly provides that: ``In meeting the      requirement to provide access * * * the inspected State Party      shall be under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of      access taking into account any constitutional obligations it      may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and      seizures,'' (Verification Annex, Part X, par. 41)(emphasis      supplied).\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ The Verification Annex is, of course, an integral part of      the Convention.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       As you know, this provision of the Convention was inserted      at the insistence of the United States after earlier drafts,      which provided insufficient protection in regard to      unreasonable searches and seizures, had been criticized by a      number of U.S. scholars. The plain meaning of these words,      which seems too clear for argument, is that the United States      would have no obligation under the Convention to permit      access to facilities subject to its jurisdiction in violation      of the provisions of the Fourth Amendment. It was the clear      understanding of the negotiators that the purpose of the      provision was to obviate any possibility of conflict between      the obligations of the United States under the Convention and      the mandate of the Fourth Amendment. The Convention in its      final form is thus fully consistent with U.S. constitutional      requirements.       Inspections required by the Convention will be conducted      pursuant to implementing legislation to be adopted by      Congress that will define the terms, conditions and scope of      the inspections to be conducted in the United States by the      Technical Staff of the Organization for the Prohibition of      Chemical Weapons (OPCW) established by the Convention. I      understand that draft implementing legislation entitled the      Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, now before      the Congress, specifies the procedures that will be followed      in the case of both routine and challenge inspections carried      out pursuant to the Convention. The Act requires, at a      minimum, an administrative search warrant before an      inspection can be conducted, and has elaborate provisions for      notice and other protections to the owner of the premises to      be searched. These provisions of the Act are modeled on      similar administrative inspection regimes already authorized      by Acts of Congress such as the Toxic Substances Control Act      and upheld by the courts. However, if Congress is concerned      that these provisions are constitutionally insufficient, it      is free under the Convention to revise the Act to include      more stringent requirements that conform to constitutional      limitations. Finally, a person subject to inspection may      challenge the inspection in a U.S. court, which in turn will      be bound to invalidate any inspection that fails to comply      with constitutional requirements. In view of the provisions      of the Verification Annex quoted above, the United States      would not be in violation of any international obligation in      such an eventuality.       For these reasons I conclude that there is no      constitutional objection to the Convention, and that the      rights of individuals under the Fourth Amendment will be      fully protected under the Convention and implementing      legislation of the character presently contemplated.       In addition, I have been involved in the field of arms      control as a scholar and practitioner for many years, going      back to the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, in connection      with which I appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee as Legal Adviser of the State Department. I have      also closely followed the negotiations for the Chemical      Weapons Convention. The United States has been a prime mover      in the development of the Convention under both Republican      and Democratic administrations. I am convinced that the      prompt ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is      overwhelmingly in the security interest of the United States      and should not be derailed by constitutional objections that      are so plainly without substance.           Sincerely,                                                     Abram Chayes,     Felix Frankfurter, Professor of Law Emeritus.                                  ____                                        Columbia University in the                                             City of New York,                                 New York, NY, September 11, 1996.     Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: As requested, I have considered      whether, if the United States adhered to the Convention on      Chemical Weapons, the inspection provisions of the Convention      would raise serious issues under the United States      Constitution. I have concluded that those provisions would      not present important obstacles to U.S. adherence to the      Convention.       Like domestic laws, treaties of the United States are      subject to constitutional restraints. The Fourth Amendment to      the      United States constitution provides: ``The right of the      people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and      effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall      not be violated * * *'' Constitutional jurisprudence has      established that the right to be secure applies also to      industrial and commercial facilities and to business records,      papers and effects.       The Constitution, however, protects the rights of private      persons; it does not protect governmental bodies, public      officials, public facilities or public papers. As to private      persons, the Fourth Amendment protects only against searches      and seizures that are ``unreasonable.'' Inspection      arrangements, negotiated and approved by the President and      consented to by the Senate, designed to give effect to a      treaty of major importance to the United States, carry a      strong presumption that they are not unreasonable.       The Chemical Convention itself anticipated the      constitutional needs of the United States. Part X of the      Convention, ``Challenge Inspection pursuant to Article IX,''      provides: ``41. In meeting the requirement to provide access      as specified in paragraph 38, the inspected State party shall      be under the obligation to allow the greatest degree of      access taking into account any constitutional obligation it      may have with regard to proprietary rights of searches and      seizures.''       As applied to the United States, that provision is properly      interpreted to mean that the United States must provide      access as required by the Convention, but if the Constitution      precludes some access in some circumstances, the United      States must provide access to the extent the Constitution      permits. And if, because of constitutional limitations, the      United States cannot provide full access required by the      Convention, the United States is required ``to make every      reasonable effort to provide alternative means to clarify the      possible noncompliance concern that generated the challenge      inspection.'' (Art. 42.)       The United States would be required also to adopt measures      to overcome any constitutional obstacles to any inspection or      interrogation required by the Convention. If it were      determined to be necessary, the United States could satisfy      the requirements of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by      arranging for administrative search warrants, by enacting      statutes granting immunity from prosecution for crimes      revealed by compelled testimony, by providing just      compensation for any ``taking'' involved.           Sincerely yours,                                                     Louis Henkin,     University Professor Emeritus.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2     Distinguished Individuals and Organizations Supporting the CWC       William Jefferson Clinton.
