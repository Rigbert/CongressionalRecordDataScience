Mr. Chairman, I agree it is my understanding that the Fish and Wildlife Service has authority to undertake this review in a fairly rapid manner. My only concern that any review is truly independent of undue influence. For that reason, I agree with you provided the service and the reviewer consult with the House Committee on Resources prior to and during the review.  The committee must agree with the parameters of the review and we must be advised of the process of the review.
