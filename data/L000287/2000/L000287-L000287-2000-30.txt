Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I have known Senator Paul Coverdell for many years. We worked together in the city of Atlanta in the Fifth District. He has been very helpful and very supportive over the years.  Our prayers are with him at this time, with his family, and we wish for Senator Coverdell a speedy recovery. We ask that the divine hands of the Almighty be with him during this hour.
