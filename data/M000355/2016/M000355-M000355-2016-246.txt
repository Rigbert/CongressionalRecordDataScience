 President, today the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will hear arguments in the case challenging the merits of the President's so-called Clean Power Plan. My home State of Kentucky is one of more than two dozen States that have signed on to that suit, and I have been proud to lead efforts in support of the Commonwealth on this issue. In fact, I joined Chairman Inhofe, more than 30 other Senators, and more than 170 Representatives in filing an amicus brief to push back on the President's power grab.  I was pleased that the Supreme Court stepped in earlier this year to issue an unprecedented stay of this plan until the Federal courts review it.  In light of the court's hold on the plan, I wrote a letter encouraging the Governors of all 50 States to take advantage of this much-needed reprieve and to adopt a wait-and-see approach before complying with the plan's standards.  As I noted then, the President's plan is yet another example of Executive overreach patterned after this administration's political and ideological agenda, rather than scientific evidence.  This massive regulatory overreach would cause energy bills to skyrocket. It would strike at the most vulnerable. It would ship middle class jobs overseas. It would bring further harm to families like those in Kentucky who have been devastated by this administration's anticoal policies. And it would do little to nothing to actually achieve its intended purpose--reducing global emissions.  This plan, which I have long believed may not be upheld in court, could place significant legal and economic burdens on our States. That is why I have encouraged them to take advantage of the court's stay as we await a final ruling.  I look forward to today's hearing, which is an important step in determining whether the President's misguided plan will survive legal scrutiny.                          ____________________
