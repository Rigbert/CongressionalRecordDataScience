We continue to work on, particularly with your leadership, encouraging strong communication and coordination between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education on the issue of serving homeless youth. It is my intent to continue to encourage that collaboration and to work to the utmost degree, not just to prevent lapses, but to strengthen education services for homeless students while implementing the HEARTH Act.
