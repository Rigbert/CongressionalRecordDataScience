 President, later this morning we will welcome an important friend of the United States to the Capitol, Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan.  I am looking forward to hearing what he has to say. I know many of my colleagues feel the same way because Prime Minister Abe doesn't just lead one of the most important economies and countries in the Asia-Pacific region, he leads one of the most important countries and economies in the entire world. Abe has proposed to tackle some tough structural problems other leaders in his country might not touch, but he knows the Japanese people can be persuaded to reward their leaders for taking risks.  Abe previously served in the Cabinet of a free-market Prime Minister who grabbed hold of economic third rails of Japanese politics and then rolled to a landslide victory when others counted him out. Perhaps that is why Abe feels liberated to pursue new initiatives of his own.  On the domestic side, Abe has proposed structural reforms. On the international front, Abe has worked to enhance the role and influence of democratic nations, such as the two of us, in the Asia-Pacific. Just this week in Washington, he signed important agreements with the United States on both cyber security and defense.  This all serves to underline the enduring importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance. It also reminds us that the Obama administration must do its part, too, by investing in the platforms and capabilities needed to make its announced pivot to Asia real. That is the only way to both bolster democratic nations such as Japan in the region, while also effectively countering China's aggressive encroachment upon the territorial and navigational rights of its neighbors.  Trade is another way to advance our common values and strengthen our national security and our economy. For years, Japan and the United States had a difficult trading relationship. Today, though, the U.S. and Japanese negotiators actually appear close to reaching an agreement that could significantly lower existing barriers to trade, benefiting both of our economies.  That breakthrough is being negotiated as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement between Pacific nations such as Japan, Australia, and the United States. That would help ensure the region and the world play by fair rules, instead of ceding the fields to an increasingly aggressive China.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership could also, according to one estimate, support up to nearly one-quarter of a million new jobs in the United States, including more than 50,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone. But American and Kentucky workers and farmers will never be able to reap the rewards of selling more ``Made in America'' goods to the Pacific until Congress passes a bipartisan trade promotion bill.  Passing that bipartisan legislation is key to enhancing Congress's role in the trade process, while simultaneously ensuring Presidents of either party--because this is a 6-year TPA, it will applyto the next President--have the tools they need to secure a strong and enforceable trade agreement for American workers.  The bill recently passed the Finance Committee on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and I intend to take it up after we complete action on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.  But, for now, let me just say that Congress is pleased to have the Prime Minister join us today. We thank Prime Minister Abe and his country for their enduring friendship.                          ____________________
