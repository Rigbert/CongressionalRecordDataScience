Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information. There are, of course, so many things which disappoint us when the majority leader announces them; but that is not one of them, I assure him.  I appreciate the majority leader's advice that Wednesday and Thursday we will be considering the budget, obviously one of the most important policy documents that we consider. And it appears from his announcement that there will be substantial time on Wednesday and substantial time on Thursday, I presume, for a full and fair debate on the underlying proposal that will be reported out of the committee, as well as such substitutes as may be made in order. Is that correct?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
