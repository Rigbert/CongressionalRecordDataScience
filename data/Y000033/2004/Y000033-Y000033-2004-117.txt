Reclaiming my time, they can continue their suit, but they are not the ones now that have to pursue the suit. They are the ones that won the case, and they can drive their trucks on interstate commerce because of the clause in the interstate commerce clause under the Constitution. What the gentleman is asking us to do in the Congress is to undo what the court has ruled.  I am not a lawyer. Thank God for that. We have got enough of those around here. But I am a little concerned that what we are doing here is really not fair to the persons that filed the suit to begin with. We are saying you cannot do it. You can go back to court. As we go back to court, well, you cannot use the truck. Under the interstate clause, that is against the Constitution, as the court has ruled.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
