President, if I could have the attention of my colleague from Pennsylvania, I would like to pose a question to him on a matter. We, as we have indicated, have been digging through the amendments. As far as I can tell, what we have is the earlier language that imposes a new excise tax on the investment income of large university endowments. That has been in the bill, so be it.  Now, there seems to be a new exception on page 289.
