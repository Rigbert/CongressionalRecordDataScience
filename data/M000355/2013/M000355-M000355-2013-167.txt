 President, I rise today for the sad occasion of paying tribute to a brave and honorable police officer from my home State of Kentucky who has fallen in the line of duty. Officer Jason Ellis, a seven-year veteran of the Bardstown Police Department, was tragically killed on May 25. He was 33 years old.  Officer Ellis worked as a field-training officer and a canine officer; with his police dog, Figo, he fought illegal drug use in Bardstown. Bardstown Police Chief Rick McCubbin described Officer Ellis as one of Bardstown's top officers and credited him with making a serious dent in the town's drug problem. Chief McCubbin also said these words: ``[He] paid the ultimate sacrifice doing what he loved: being a police officer.''  Jason Ellis, a native of Cincinnati, OH, attended the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, KY, where he was a star baseball player. He set records for all time career hits, doubles, home runs, and career games played, the last of which is still a record at the school. He played minor league baseball in the Cincinnati Reds system.  Even as a star on the diamond, however, coaches and teammates remember Jason Ellis talking about becoming a law enforcement officer. His wife, Amy, says: ``He was always a go-getter. . . He was dedicated to his job and he wanted to clean the streets up. And that was the way to get the drugs off the streets.''  On May 30, Officer Ellis was laid to rest at Highview Cemetery in Nelson County. Fellow law enforcement officers from across the Commonwealth as well as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois came to pay their respects, and hundreds of police cruisers made up the funeral procession. Over a thousand people filled the church sanctuary, with more standing along the aisles, to show their gratitude for Officer Ellis's service and sacrifice.  It is incredibly moving to see the broad outpouring of support from Kentuckians and the law enforcement community for Officer Ellis, which I pray was of some comfort to Officer Ellis's family at such a difficult time. Officer Ellis leaves behind his wife Amy and two sons, Hunter and Parker.  It can't be stated enough, Mr. President, how deep our admiration and respect is for every man and woman who wears a police uniform and makes a solemn vow to defend the lives of others, even at the cost of their own. Police officers provide stability and justice in our civil society. I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in extending the deepest sympathies to the family of Officer Jason Ellis and the members of the Bardstown Police Department. We are very sorry for their loss.                          ____________________
