 Ah, memories are made of this. It was just the other day when the gentleman from Florida was requesting of  [[Page H3607]] the House in decibels a little higher than the ones he just used everybody to sit down and cease and desist, let us have a rational debate.  I would suggest that the amendments that we are considering are not nothing amendments. I would suggest the policy debate we had in the House Agriculture Committee that went 15 hours did not involve nothing. It involved tremendous policy decision in regards to food stamp reform.  Might I remind the gentleman from Florida that in October 1987 the Democrats first attempted to self-execute the adoption of their welfare reform bill into the reconciliation bill without a separate vote. The adoption of the rule was considered to be the adoption of the welfare reform amendment. That rule was rejected by the House. A second legislative day was created that same day by Speaker Wright. Memories are made of this.  And we brought forward a new rule for reconciliation minus the welfare reform component. The Committee on Rules subsequently reported a separate rule for the welfare reform bill making in order just one amendment, one amendment, not a series of amendments or nothing amendments that we are talking about here, in the nature of a substitute by the minority leader, but that rule was withdrawn from lack of support by the Democrats.  Finally we had a third rule.
