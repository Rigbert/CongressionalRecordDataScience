Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district. On January 31, 2004, Sgt. Eliu Miersandoval, born Abi Mier, of San Clemente, California, was killed in action in Kirkuk, Iraq. Today I would ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Eliu was born on June 26, 1976, in Durango, Mexico, to Pascual and Estella Mier, who currently reside in Pomona, California. Eliu went to high school at San Clemente High, and after graduating he joined the Army in 1996 for great future opportunities and to travel. In 1999, he was sent to Fort Hood, Texas, and was later promoted to Sergeant in the 4th Infantry Division. He was a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic in what is the most technically advanced combat division in the Army. It was the 4th Infantry Division that participated in the capture of Saddam Hussein.  Eliu is remembered as an outstanding athlete and talented musician. More importantly, he was a loving husband to his wife Amanda and a proud father to his son Adrian.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country, we realize that this history is comprised of men and women like Eliu who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. My thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice go out to his wife and family. There are no words that can relieve their pain.  His wife and family have all given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one. Their loss is part of a larger effort to give the Iraqi people and all people around the world the opportunity to live in freedom and without fear. I hope they know that their son and the sacrifice he made will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
