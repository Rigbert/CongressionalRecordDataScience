President, I rise today to remember a very special Vermonter, and a good friend, Karen Kitzmiller. Karen, at the young age of 53, lost her long battle with breast cancer on May 20 of this year. In East Montpelier the following Saturday, I joined hundreds of family, friends, colleagues, and admirers who gathered together to share their memories of Karen, and to honor her life.  For the past 11 years Karen Kitzmiller served as Montpelier's Democratic State representative in the Vermont Legislature. Her legislative achievements were many, but most outstanding was her work on the House Health and Welfare Committee. Karen was a determined advocate and principled leader on behalf of the health and well-being of Vermonters. She fought to prevent tobacco companies from targeting children with advertisements designed to encourage youth smoking. To help patients appeal coverage denials by health maintenance organizations, Karen dedicated her efforts to the establishment of Vermont's health care ombudsman. She devoted considerable energies to the provision of health care coverage for the uninsured. This spring, after almost four years of effort, she witnessed the Governor sign legislation to ensure that uninsured patients who volunteer to participate in cancer treatment clinical trials are provided with health care coverage.  Karen was diagnosed with cancer more than four years ago, and yet through it all, she did not give up her work on behalf of Vermonters. She continued to serve in the Legislature, she leant her experience as a cancer survivor in efforts to promote awareness about the importance of support groups, and she helped to establish the annual Breast Cancer Conference in Burlington. These are just a few of the lasting contributions that will serve as a tribute to Karen's life for years to come.  Karen leaves behind a loving family--her husband, Warren, and two daughters, Amy and Carrie. Amy is a student at the University of Virginia, studying government and women's studies, and Carrie is a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying at the School of Arts and Sciences. I had the privilege of sponsoring Amy as a Senate Page in 1996 and as an intern in my Montpelier office in the summer of 2000. They are both bright young women. I know their mother was very proud of them both. Although their loss is great, the Kitzmillers can take some small comfort in knowing how special Karen was to so many people. Her strength, her courage, and her compassion served as inspiration to all those who were fortunate enough to come in contact with her. She will be missed by all.                          ____________________
