Speaker, I know that Members want to catch planes, and I will be brief; but I did want to take this opportunity.  From time to time we, in sadness, see one of those people leave who have served this institution very well, and served me, both in my role as majority leader and as Democratic whip. But I wanted to rise at this point in time to say thank you--and I know you want to join with me--to Austin Burnes, who is leaving as my floor director and as a valued friend and staff member.  At the same time, I want to thank those on Speaker Boehner's staff, on Majority Leader Cantor's staff and on Whip McCarthy's staff who have worked so well and positively with Austin Burnes, for helping us to do our job better. Obviously, there were differences from time to time--well, maybe all the time--but I thank you for that.  Austin, I want to thank you for the service you have given to this institution, to your country, to me, and to all the Members who appreciate very much your advice and counsel.                          ____________________
