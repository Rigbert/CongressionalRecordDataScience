 President, today I am pleased to join my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, in sponsoring the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Partnership Act of 1995.  This legislation is the product of years of effort by many people representing public groups and all levels of government, but it would not be before Congress today were it not for the vision, leadership, and hard work of former Congresswoman Jolene Unsoeld, who took on a daunting challenge and came away with a broadly supported plan to preserve and promote several chapters in the colorful history of the Pacific Northwest.  Briefly, the act would establish and coordinate the management of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve, which contains a number of contiguous historic sites located on the Columbia River. This area, situated in the heart of the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, provides a rare opportunity to save and interpret, in one central location, several layers of history. Vancouver's historic area has been referred to as the ``birthplace of history in the Northwest'' since Lewis and Clark explored the areas in 1805-6.  The historic reserve is located within an original 1848 military reserve and includes six principal elements: Fort Vancouver National Historic Site--National Park Service; Vancouver Barracks--U.S. Army; Pearson Airpark and museum--city of Vancouver--NPS/City, and Marine Park--City. These publicly-owned sites tell a story of Northwest history beginning with the rich native American culture that flourished along the river, early Euro-American settlement of the area, the American military presence in the Northwest, and more than 80 years of continuous aviation activity at Pearson Airfield, one of the original Army Corps fields and the site of several aviation milestones.  In 1990, pursuant to Public Law 101-523, Congress created the Vancouver Historical Study Commission and charged the five-member group with developing a plan to preserve these historic assets and coordinate the management of the area. After careful study and much public involvement, the Commission submitted, through Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt, a report that is the basis for this act. It is a carefully crafted plan which provides historic protection, a partnership among the property owners, and an opportunity--with no additional financial obligation to the Federal Government--to highlight some of the most important and interesting history in the Pacific Northwest.  I want to commend the city of Vancouver for demonstrating, through their outstanding restoration of Officers Row, that historic preservation can be economically self-sustaining and for working closely with the National Park Service, the U.S. Army, and the State Office of Historic Preservation to develop this plan.  The Vancouver National Historic Reserve Partnership Act provides a new standard for historic preservation. It emphasizes a narrative or layered approach to history instead of the single-point-in-time approach, and it demonstrates how--at a time when the Federal Government cannot afford expensive new initiatives to acquire, restore, or maintain historic properties--we can form partnerships to preserve and highlight our heritage.  I am proud to be the cosponsor of this act in the Senate and urge that it be given timely and favorable consideration by this body.                                 ______      By
