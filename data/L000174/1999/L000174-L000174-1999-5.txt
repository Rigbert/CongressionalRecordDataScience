I thank the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader. Both of them are dear friends of mine with whom I have served for many, many years.  I thank them for their consideration, especially of Calendar No. 292. That is not simply a number on the calendar. It represents a very real person. Richard Linn is an extraordinary man, extraordinary husband, extraordinary father, and wonderful bother. He will do a great job and be an outstanding judge. I thank both leaders for their help and their consideration.
