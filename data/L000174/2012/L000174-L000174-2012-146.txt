President, today, the House of Representatives passed S. 3245, legislation to reauthorize the job-creating EB-5 Regional Center Program for an additional 3 years. In addition to this important program, the legislation also prevents the expiration of three other immigration programs important to Senator Conrad, Senator Hatch, and Senator Grassley.  I am very pleased the House acted with such strong bipartisan support, and I commend House Judiciary Committee chairman Lamar Smith for his quick action on the bill. Once again I thank the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator Grassley, for his partnership on this legislation.  Passage of this legislation in the House today will ensure that the job-creating EB-5 Regional Center Program will continue. Today's action will allow the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to continue to improve and grow the program administratively and will give me and other interested lawmakers, agency officials, and private citizens the time needed to consider and find consensus on lasting statutory improvements to the program so that it may continue as a permanent and vital part of our immigration system. Most importantly, it will allow American entrepreneurs to continue building job-creating development projects around the country.  This program is and will remain a productive part of America's immigration system. Like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the United States is right to provide the world's citizens the opportunity to immigrate to its shores based upon investment. This program welcomes people from around the world who devote substantial investment capital to American businesses to invigorate American communities. And it does so at no cost to the American taxpayer. Moreover, those who immigrate through this program will purchasereal estate and other goods, enroll their children in our schools, colleges, and universities, pay taxes, and enrich the communities in which they will live and work.  As the availability of credit in the United States has become restricted, particularly for new and small businesses, many have turned to this program for capital. The program's growth over the last several years has been significant. And with increased growth comes the need for the law to keep pace and for the administering agency to adapt to this growth and devote the necessary resources. As we move forward, I look forward to continuing my work on comprehensive legislation to make this program an efficient, more productive, and permanent part of our immigration law. We have already seen many instances of the way in which this program can harness together many individual investments to do big things in many communities. But the law can and will benefit from some improvement in the coming months, and I stand ready to work with any Senators who recognize the value and potential of this program.  Our immigration law provides 10,000 visas each year for this program. When this program reaches the point at which it is fully subscribed, based on the minimum required investment amount and the statutory job creation requirement, it has the potential to direct $5 billion in foreign capital investment into American communities each year, with the potential for the creation of 100,000 American jobs. And that calculation does not take into account the domestic capital that can be attracted when projects are capitalized and carried out through this program or the ancillary benefits that communities experience when local economies are strengthened, nor does it account for the immeasurable contributions that new Americans make to our communities across the country every day.  We all recognize the need to take steps to do whatever we can to spur our economy and create jobs for American citizens. I have no doubt that the action taken unanimously by the Senate on August 3 and the decisive action taken by the House of Representatives today to complete the legislative process on this bill will help us meet this shared goal.                          ____________________
