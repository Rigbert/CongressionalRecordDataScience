Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, there are two things: The Fish and Wildlife Service now has an exorbitant amount of aircraft that they provide, and I would not like to get into the subject totally tonight.  In my State alone we have over 110 aircraft. There are plenty of aircraft to be chartered out, and my argument all along has been every time they acquired aircraft, if it is from the military or any other place, it takes tax dollars to maintain and operate those aircraft, in direct competition with aircraft that are available for contract. I can go to Alaska, and I hope you have a chance, the gentleman has been to Alaska, and we can go on the turbo-goose, we can go into everything but a big jet.  I am saying it is time we get out of this business. I am not striking the aircraft that they have now, but the two aircraft they have requested, I am saying no more. Until they can come to me and justify that aircraft, they can show what the need is, I do not think we ought to be having any more aircraft for them.
