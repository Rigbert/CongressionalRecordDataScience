Speaker, I rise to encourage you to join with me and 69 of our colleagues, a total of 70 already, who have signed on to cosponsor H.R. 381, the Return to Prudent Banking Act. This bipartisan bill would restore the provisions of the Glass-Steagall banking law that separated prudent banking from wild speculation in the financial realm.  Yesterday marked the 16th year, to the day, that Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, bestowing on financial institutions and investment firms the ability to put the life savings and deposits of the American people at greater risk.  I was one of the 57 Members of this Congress who voted against that repeal of Glass-Steagall. At that time, my colleagues and I were told by Wall Street that the banks were strangled by outdated restrictions, that the repeal was a modern experiment in deregulation; so Congress repealed this bedrock law, over our objections.  Look where that decision took America. We witnessed a terrible market crash in 2008; now, slow growth and the outrageous enormous accumulation of banking assets in a handful of institutions like JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America. They are raking in record-shattering profits while paying depositors almost nothing on their interest or on certificates of deposit as wages for working-class Americans continue to flatline.  The original Glass-Steagall Act served our country well. It laid the foundation for an unprecedented half century without financial panics or crises. Just as important, it contributed to a right-sized banking system focused on serving our economy and society as a whole rather than enriching itself at everyone else's expense.  This Congress must reinstate the regulatory prudence of the Glass-Steagall Act. Without these proper safeguards, it is only a matter of time before Wall Street's greedy operatives once again steer the American economy over the precipice.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 381, the Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2015. Help restore prudence, discipline, and sanity to our financial system and, in turn, real economic growth to America.                          ____________________
