 The purpose of the Father of the Year Awards is to honor fathers who have remained a positive role model for their children while also making a positive difference in their community.  John Gless is one of those fathers. He has been married to his wife Janet for 52 years, and has four children and 11 grandchildren. As owner and founder of Gless Ranch, John has been an active member of the California farming community and avid supporter of numerous charitable organizations.  I am proud to call John a fellow community member and American. And today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating him on this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
