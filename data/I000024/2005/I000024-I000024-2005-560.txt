President, today I am introducing the Ratepayers Protection Act of 2005. This bill will ensure that the poor and elderly and other groups who are disproportionately harmed by rising energy prices are not forced to pick up the tab for utilities that incur costs to control carbon dioxide.  The science underlying the climate change theory does not justify the enormous expenditures mandatory climate bills would impose. Moreover, implementing these climate bills would have virtually no effect on reducing temperatures even if climate alarmists are correct. Yet those in our society least able to bear the costs of these mandatory schemes will be hit the hardest. With my bill, disadvantaged individuals will not be saddled with these costs.  I understand that this bill will be referred to the Energy Committee. I do not plan to move this bill as stand-alone bill, however, but instead to offer it as an amendment to any mandatory climate bill that sets caps on greenhouse gases.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1205       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Ratepayers Protection Act of      2005''.     SEC. 2. STUDY.       (a) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Disadvantaged individual.--The term ``disadvantaged      individual'' means--       (A) an individual with a disability, as defined in section      3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.      12102);       (B) a member of a family whose income does not exceed the      poverty line, as defined in section 673 of the Community      Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902);       (C) an individual who belongs to a minority group;       (D) a senior citizen; and       (E) other disadvantaged individuals.       (2) Utility.--The term ``utility'' means any organization      that--       (A) provides retail customers with electricity services;      and       (B) is regulated, either by price or terms of service, by 1      or more State utility or public service commissions.       (b) Study.--Not later than 30 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Congressional Budget Office, in      consultation with other appropriate organizations, shall      initiate a study to determine the effect on disadvantaged      individuals of actions taken or considered, or likely to be      taken or considered, by utilities to reduce the carbon      dioxide emissions of the utilities.       (c) Report.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Congressional Budget Office shall      submit to Congress a report that specifically describes the      results of the study, including the economic costs to      disadvantaged individuals of actions by utilities intended to      reduce carbon dioxide emissions.       (2) Review period.--Congress shall have 180 days after the      date of receipt by Congress of the report described in      paragraph (1) to review the report.       (3) Effective date.--If the Congressional Budget Office      determines that there would be an additional economic burden      on any of the classes of disadvantaged individuals if the      costs of actions by utilities intended to reduce carbon      dioxide emissions were recovered from ratepayers, the      amendment made by section 3 shall take effect on the day      after the end of the review period described in paragraph      (2).     SEC. 3. UTILITY ACTIONS TO REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.       The National Climate Program Act (15 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.)      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 9. UTILITY ACTIONS TO REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.       ``(a) Definition of Utility.--In this section, the term      `utility' means any organization that--       ``(1) provides retail customers with electricity services;      and       ``(2) is regulated, either by price or terms of service, by      1 or more State utility or public service commissions.       ``(b) Ratepayer Protections.--       ``(1) In general.--No utility may recover from ratepayers      any costs, expenses, fees, or other outlays incurred for the      stated purpose by the utility to reduce carbon dioxide      emissions.       ``(2) Prohibition on certain commission actions.--No State      utility commission, public service commission, or similar      entity may compel ratepayers to pay the costs, expenses,      fees, or other outlays incurred for the stated purpose by a      utility to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.       ``(c) Shareholder Obligations Unaffected.--Nothing in this      section prevents the shareholders of, or other parties      associated with (other than ratepayers), a utility from      paying for any action by the utility to reduce carbon dioxide      emissions.''.                          ____________________[Pages S6228-S6238]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS  By
