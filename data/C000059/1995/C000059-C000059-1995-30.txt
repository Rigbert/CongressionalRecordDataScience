Speaker, I take the floor of the House today to honor and praise the lifelong dedication of a friend and public servant of the great city of Lake Elsinore in California. The accomplishments of this individual make me proud to call him my personal friend, a fellow community member, and a fellow American. His love for his family as a father and a husband, and his love for his country as a veteran and a leader are a display of his utmost respect for the traditional American values and principles. This gentleman that I speak so highly of, and regard with the highest respect is the mayor of the city of Lake Elsinore, Mr. Gary Washburn.  For the past 16 years, Mr. Washburn has served the government of the city of Lake Elsinore as a member of the planning commission, a city council member, and mayor. His influence and involvement has played an integral role in the growth and development of his city. I would like to commend him on his accomplishments in representing his constituents and providing leadership as the elected mayor of the city of Lake Elsinore.  Prior to his involvement in the city government of Lake Elsinore, Mr.. Washburn served as a professor and is responsible for the education and welfare of many university-level students. He helped many young Americans open their minds, reach their goals, and build new dreams through education. In addition, Mr. Washburn is a combat veteran of Vietnam who was honorably discharged after 2 years of service as a crew chief on July 4, 1968. During his military career, he served our country in the 1st Aviation Brigade, the 54th Utility Airplane Company, and the Otter Air Service.  In addition to his involvement in representing city government and serving America, Mr. Washburn's other community involvements include: president of the Elsinore Elementary P.T.G., executive board of the Riverside County Economic Development Committee, president of the Rotary Club, chairman of the Riverside County City Selection Committee, board member of the Riverside Transit Agency, city representative to the Lake Elsinore Management Agency, city representative to the Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency. His timeless dedication in serving his city and country have earned him the respect of his family, friends, colleagues, and constituents as a true champion of public service.  Unfortunately, on November 7, 1995, Mr. Gary Washburn will retire as mayor after a lifelong dedication to the public welfare of the citizens of the city of Lake Elsinore, CA. After over 16 years of service in city government, Mr. Washburn will end a long tradition of contributions of dedication and effort by his family dating back to 1889. On the occasion of his retirement, I would like to thank him for his service to our community, and offer my best wishes for his future endeavors.                          ____________________
