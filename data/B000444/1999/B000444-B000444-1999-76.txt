 By the way, it is much stronger than any President wants. It is section (E) of the amendment we sent. I will read it to the Senator:       Withdrawal from Treaty.--If the President determines that      nuclear testing is necessary--  The antecedent to that is the lab Directors say it--     to assure, with a high degree of confidence, the safety and      reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile,      the President shall consult promptly with the Senate and      withdraw from the Treaty pursuant to Article IX (2) of the      Treaty in order to conduct whatever testing might be      required.  It is pretty strong.
