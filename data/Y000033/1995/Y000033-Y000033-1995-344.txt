Mr. Chairman, let us look at this amendment. This is the amendment to try to harvest dead, dying, dead trees. Double adjective. These trees burned last year. If we do not harvest them, they are rotted, they cannot be used, they are a waste. And it appalls me when I hear Mr. Porter saying this overturns court decisions, et cetera, et cetera. These are not live trees. These are burnt trees, 16 billion board feet standing, and all we are asking is for 3 billion board feet this year and 3 billion board  [[Page H3235]] feet next year. That is all we are asking, to keep some of our American people working. There is no work for these mills, for the sawmills, for the people that make their living here, if we cannot have trees, and we stopped cutting live trees because of action of this Congress and the courts.  It is time that we pass this Taylor amendment and this legislation. We did have hearings. There was a long, protracted hearing of a whole day. We heard from those people who are not only working, but from the biologists, that said for the health of the forest we must harvest these trees. Let us stand with the committee.
