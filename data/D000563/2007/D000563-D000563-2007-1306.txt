President, I rise today to introduce S.J. Res. 5, honoring the valor of General Casimir Pulaski, who made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of American freedom. This Resolution would grant posthumous honorary citizenship to General Pulaski.  Casimir Pulaski was a young soldier whose activities to advance Polish liberty'' from Russian influence led to his exile from Poland. In Paris, he met Benjamin Franklin and was inspired to join the Continental Army in its fight for American independence.  On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski fought with distinction in the Battle of Brandywine. His bravery and abilities in battle averted an American defeat and saved the life of George Washington. That same year, Pulaski wrote to George Washington, ``I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.''  Casimir Pulaski was promoted to Brigadier General and, as General, continued to provide great leadership. In 1779, at the siege of Charleston, South Carolina, he helped to fend off British forces. Later that year, his letter to George Washington proved prophetic when in October, during a major offensive against British forces in Savannah, Georgia, Pulaski was mortally wounded. He died at sea, aboard the U.S.S. Wasp, on October 11, 1779.  General Pulaski's life and death inspired his contemporaries just as he inspires us today. Shortly after his death, the Continental Congress resolved to build a monument in his honor; one that proved to be the first of many. In 1825, General Lafayette, an honorary American citizen, laid the cornerstone for the Pulaski monument in Savannah, Georgia. In 1929, Congress resolved that October 11 of each year would be Pulaski Day in the United States, and several states have followed this example. In 1973, my own state of Illinois designated the first Monday of March as Pulaski Commemorative Day and in 1986 declared that day to be a state holiday. There are countless schools, streets, and memorials across the country that bear his name, and honor his great contributions.  We in Illinois are privileged to have a large and vibrant Polish-Americancommunity. From Casimir Pulaski to legendary artists like Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the Polish people have contributed a great deal to Illinois, and to this country. Chicago is home to the Polish American Congress, which encompasses three thousand Polish organizations across the county, as well as the Polish Museum of America. The Polish-American community also has a large presence in the Illinois National Guard which has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the Polish Air Force.  I am honored to rise today, on Pulaski Commemorative Day, to introduce this Resolution to grant posthumous honorary citizenship to General Casimir Pulaski. Honorary citizenship is a proper tribute to a man who gave his labor and life to the cause of American independence. When we think of our Nation's struggle for freedom in its early years, we also must think of Casimir Pulaski and his indelible contribution to our Nation's birth.                          ____________________
