Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  It is obvious in this debate the high road of environmental humility and common sense is not bothered by heavy traffic on this floor.  This is a rehash of the debate we had during the clean water debate of several months ago. It is a clear-cut issue.  I want to talk about the permit activity of section 404. That is the way that our wetlands program is being administered. It is a classic example of regulatory overkill.  Nobody wants to stand in the was of protecting the Nation's true wetlands. We reformed it during the consideration of H.R. 961, and we defeated several amendments, including an amendment by the gentleman from New York who gives new meaning to perseverance.  The gentleman talks about cavalier treatment. The cavalier treatment comes from Federal enforcement trivializing the rights of ordinary citizens and farmers and ranchers in my district and all across this country.                              {time}  1200  I am talking about the taking of private property for no environmentally sound purpose or reason, or public need. We have got at least four Federal agencies in the wetland regulatory soup. We have low spots in the field throughout farm country being designated a wetland. No self-respecting duck would ever land there. This is ridiculous.  Later in September the House Committee on Agriculture will bring to this floor a farm bill that will rely less on Federal spending, it will get the Government out of agriculture, but we made a deal to the Nation's farmers and ranchers we will move to a more market-oriented farm policy, but please, please, we must have regulatory reform. Rid us of the cost burdens that are unnecessary, and costly, and drowning us in red tape and intrusion.  Defeat the Boehlert amendment.
