 I find these remarks do not make any sense. What they are saying is, unless you think as they do, you are not really Hispanic. In other words, if you do not think as they do, you cannot possibly be Hispanic. What an outrageous idea in 21st century America. The tag line that Mr. Estrada ``isn't Hispanic enough'' is code words for ``he isn't liberal enough.'' Yet at this Democraticpress conference, participants describe the underrepresentation of Hispanics in the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government.  The President has nominated one of the most qualified attorneys in the country to be a judge on the second highest court of the land, and this person, of outstanding capabilities, with degrees from Columbia and Harvard, happens to be a Hispanic. Not only is he Hispanic, but he is an immigrant to this country who at the age of 17 came here from Honduras speaking little English. He learned the language, worked hard, rose to the top of his legal profession. One would think these groups would be happy with this nomination. But no, they stand in firm opposition to Mr. Estrada. You see, these groups believe a person is only Hispanic when he or she believes what these groups believe.  That is intellectual prejudice. I urge my colleagues to resist the rhetoric of ideological prejudice and to overwhelmingly support the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court for the DC Circuit.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                [From the National Review, Feb. 6, 2003]           Dems to Miguel Estrada: You're Not Hispanic Enough                            (By Byron York)       The headline from Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle's news      conference Wednesday was his threat to filibuster the      appeals-court nomination of Miguel Estrada. ``There is      overwhelming opposition within our caucus to Mr. Estrada,''      Daschle said. ``Because we're in the minority, we have no      other option in some cases . . . than to filibuster      nominations. We don't take that responsibility lightly, but      we hold it to be an important tool that we will use.''      Daschle said he will make the filibuster decision next week.       But the more interesting story from Daschle's appearance      was the strange disconnect between the reasons he gave to      oppose Estrada and the reasons cited by a number of Hispanic      interest-group leaders who appeared with Daschle.       To hear Daschle tell it, Estrada's alleged refusal to      answer questions at his confirmation hearing had virtually      forced Democrats to vote against him, and perhaps to      filibuster the nomination. Democratic senators take their      advise-and-consent role very seriously, Daschle said, and,      ``In our view, we have been thwarted from fulfilling our      constitutional obligation.''       But to hear representatives from the Congressional Hispanic      Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education      Fund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and      others tell it, the Estrada nomination should be killed not      because of Estrada's alleged refusal to answer questions or      because of constitutional obligations but because Estrada,      who was born and raised in Honduras before coming to the      United States and learning English at the age of 17, is      simply not authentically Hispanic.       ``Being Hispanic for us means much more than having a      surname,'' said New Jersey Rep. Bob Menendez, a member of the      Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ``It means having some      relationship with the reality of what it is to live in this      country as a Hispanic American.'' Even though Estrada is of      Hispanic origin, and even though he lives in this country,      Menendez argued, he falls short of being a true Hispanic.      ``Mr. Estrada told us that him being Hispanic he sees having      absolutely nothing to do with his experience or his role as a      federal court judge. That's what he said to us.'' Menendez      found that deeply troubling.       But Menendez was relatively kind to Estrada compared to the      representatives of Hispanic interest groups. Angelo Falcon,      an official of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education      Fund, railed about the ``Latino Horatio Alger story that's      been concocted'' about Estrada's success and, more generally,      about the ``concocted, invented Latino imagery'' of Estrada's      life.       ``As the Latino community becomes larger and larger in the      country, as we gain more political influence, as we become      more diverse, the issue of what is a Hispanic becomes more      problematic,'' Falcon explained. ``It's not good enough to      simply say that because of someone's genetics or surname that      they should be considered Hispanic.''       Marisa Demeo from the Mexican American Legal Defense and      Education Fund went even farther. Not only is Estrada not      authentically Hispanic, Demeo argued, but his elevation to      the federal bench would ``crush'' the American dream for      millions of genuine Hispanics in the United States.       Demeo was particularly angry at Republican Judiciary      Committee member Sen. Charles Grassley, who last week said      that, ``If we deny Mr. Estrada a position on the D.C.      Circuit, it will be to shut the door on the American dream of      Hispanic Americans everywhere.'' ``Actually, the reverse is      true,'' Demeo said. ``If the Senate confirms Mr. Estrada, his      own personal American dream will come true, but the American      dreams of the majority of Hispanics living in this country      will come to an end through his future legal decisions.''       Through it all, Daschle stood by impassively. He couldn't      very well cite Estrada's alleged lack of authentic Hispanic-     ness as a reason to filibuster and kill the nomination; even      the most partisan Democratic senator would have a hard time      making that argument. Yet he remained quiet while his allies      bashed Estrada in the most personal terms.       It made some observers question just why Democrats are      opposing Estrada. Do they really believe their words about      their ``constitutional obligations,'' or are they going along      with the angry interest groups who are pushing them to do it?
