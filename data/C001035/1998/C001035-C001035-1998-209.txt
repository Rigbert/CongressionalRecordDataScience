President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues as one of the original cosponsors of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. The Rehabilitation Act, originally adopted almost 80 years ago, has developed during succeeding years into one of this country's most important efforts assisting disabled persons in achieving their potentials for employment.  This law authorizes programs helping persons with disabilities attain their full employment potential as self-supporting, contributing members of society. It provides supported employment services for persons who cannot work independently and offers the services disabled persons need to lead independent lives even if an individual is not capable of working. Through the Rehabilitation Act, federal-state programs provide comprehensive services that help persons with physical and mental disabilities become employable, achieve independence, and participate more fully in society.  The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1998, which we are introducing today, reaffirm the commitment of the federal government to its disabled citizens and continues the progress we have seen in previous reauthorizations. This bill advances Federal-State rehabilitation efforts in numerous ways. This morning I want to mention three of the changes I believe are the most significant: first, the linking of vocational rehabilitation services to other workforce investment programs; second, the authorization of core services to individuals not eligible for services under an order of selection; and third, the simplification of access to vocational rehabilitation services.  This bill, which will be incorporated into the S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, will be functionally linked to the state workforce, job training, and vocational and adult education systems authorized by S. 1186. The Rehabilitation Act will thereby become part of the effort by Congress to replace a fragmented array of programs with an integrated federal system of workforce development without sacrificing the integrity and effectiveness of the vocational rehabilitation program. This process is already underway in Maine through the Maine Department of Labor's one stop career centers. This legislation will make it easier for Maine and other states to create a seamless system of employment assistance for our disabled citizens.  The second improvement is the authorization of core services to all eligible disabled persons. Because the Rehabilitation Act requires the states to serve the most severely disabled individuals, large numbers of individuals with lesser disabilities have been cut off from services. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 will permit a state to provide core services to those individuals who are not eligible for full services under the state's criteria for order of selection. Under this provision of the law the states may provide individualized counseling and guidance, individualized vocational exploration, supervised job placement referrals, and assistance obtaining reasonable accommodations even if the individual does not qualify for actual rehabilitation services. This will extend important and highly effective services to a large, deserving population and should greatly enhance these individuals' success in obtaining employment.  A third advance is the simplification of the procedures by which eligibility for rehabilitation is established. Under these amendments, individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income are presumed to be eligible for services providing they intend to seek employment and have an impediment to employment caused by their disability.  In addition to these significant changes that directly affect the clients of the vocational rehabilitation program, this act makes important changes that will make the administration of the vocational rehabilitation program more efficient and reduce a state's administrative burden. One example of this is the coordination of a states vocational rehabilitation plan with the submission of the other job training plans submitted under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This will help to eliminate duplicative provisions, submissions and reports.  Another is the requirement for cooperation and collaboration through cooperative agreements among the state's vocational rehabilitation agency and other components of a state's workforce investment system. While these agreements will be most visible as they affect access and delivery of services, they will also bring about coordination of information and financial management systems leading to simplified and improved management of a state's job training efforts.  I am proud to cosponsor the reauthorization of an act which has helped so many disabled individuals achieve employment and independent lives.                                 ______                                       By
