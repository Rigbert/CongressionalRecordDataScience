Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend eight dedicated teachers from Northwest Indiana, who have been voted outstanding educators for the 1997-98 school year. These individuals, Mary Czapko, Donna Dowty, Marilynn Edwards, Bill Gresh, Peter Hedges, Nancy Mills, Judith Musselman, and Mary Tanis, will be presented the Crystal Apple Award at a reception at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana, today, May 6, 1998. Mary Czapko will also receive the torch of Knowledge Award for being selected the outstanding member of this distinguished group of educators.  Mary Czapko has been a first grade teacher at Lincoln Elementary School in Roselawn, Indiana for 22 years. She is known as a dedicated teacher by her colleagues, since she puts so much time into planning her lessons and developing special projects for the school and her surrounding community. Mary has since handedly organized such programs as ``Green Eggs to Hamlet'', which involved convincing community members to read to young children in all three of the public libraries in her area. She was also active in ``Read Across America'' family reading night on Dr. Seuss' birthday, and was instrumental in developing the ``Math Their Way'' program in the North Newton School Corporation. An individual with a strong commitment to early childhood education, Mary has even used her own money to purchase books to create a resource library for all teachers in the North Newton School Corporation.  Donna Dowty, a teacher described by her colleagues as someone who puts the needs of children first, has also taught within the North Newton School Corporation for 22 years. Donna began her career as a kindergarten teacher at Lincoln Elementary School, where her development of a kindergarten graduation program has remained a tradition for 23 years. Over the years, she has taught kindergarten, first, and second grade at Morocco Elementary School, and she has become well-known for working with parents for the betterment of their children's education, as well as doing whatever it takes to get a child to succeed. Donna participates in a variety of programs and committees, including the Parent Teacher Organization and technology committee. One of her most noteworthy accomplishments was obtaining a 4R grant for mini-computer labs in Morocco Elementary School's kindergarten and first grade.  Marilyn Edwards has been a science teacher with Taft Middle School for over 20 years. During this time, she has become known for making the success of her students her top priority. A strong belief in cooperative learning has marked her career. Hands-on learning methods are used in her own classroom, and she has been instrumental in integrating lab activities into the school's curriculum. Some organizations to which Marilynn belongs include: the Indiana Science Assessment Teachers' Association; the Indiana Science Teachers' Association; and the National Science Teachers' Association. Locally, she serves on the Crown Point and Taft Professional Development Committees, and she is a member of Taft School's Improvement Team, which guided the staff's transition from a junior high school to a middle school. Marilynn is described by those who know her as a professional, caring, and hard-working teacher who has improved education at all levels.  Bill Gresh, who has worked at Lowell High School for 12 years, has made his mark on education by placing the school's Media Center at the forefront of technology and innovation. Bill changed the Lowell High School Library into a Media Center, beginning with the installation of an electronic card catalog and CD ROMs, and culminating with the current online services in place. Over the years, Bill's focus has remained clear. to make available a plethora of current resources available to students, faculty, and staff. Bill's colleagues describe him as a professional who is available, approachable, and accommodating. If a new teaching idea is being considered, Bill is known to work with the necessary individuals to make worthwhile projects a reality. As a 20-year veteran of the teaching profession, Bill remains devoted to securing for teachers the tools they need to deliver state of the art instruction to their students.  Peter Hedges has been a science teacher at Highland Middle School for the past 34 years. Peter is known by his students and colleagues, alike, for his enthusiastic and good-humored approach to teaching. His wit makes his presentations entertaining and informative for his students, and encourages them to become excited about the subject matter. Those who work with Peter describe him as being a voice of reason, as he often reminds them that the reason for being a teacher is to educate children. His colleagues agree that they are better people for having known and worked with him.  Nancy Mills has been a devoted Spanish teacher for 25 years, 19 of which she has spent teaching at Lowell High School. For many years, Nancy has successfully taught the fourth year Spanish class at Lowell. According to Purdue University, 56 of the 76 credits college credits Lowell students accumulated through Advanced Placement (AP) testing last year, were granted to Spanish students. Indeed, every member of Nancy's 1997 Spanish class earned college credit.  Judith Musselman has been a Speech and English teacher at Highland High School for 34 years. Throughout her career, Judith has a reputation among her colleagues for working to advance the expertise, knowledge, and preparedness of the students she has instructed.She has done so, not only through classroom instruction, but also through participation in various extracurricular endeavors. Judith has worked to improve the departmental curriculum, participating in departmental meetings, becoming involved in various training programs, and holding an active role in major committees, such as the technology committee. Over the years, Judith has worked to provide her students within an excellent education, and she has been rewarded as many of her students return to thank her for the work ethic she instilled in them.  Mary Tanis has been a Social Studies and English teacher at Kahler Middle School in Dyer, Indiana for 24 years. Throughout her career, Mary has designed a variety of creative projects in her classroom, which have sparked the interest of her students and fellow teachers. She has, for instance, implemented Arbor and Earth Day projects in her classroom. 16 years ago, she created a genealogy project, which is still used to teach children about their different heritages. Mary has also been a forerunner in keeping students apprised of technological resources available to them, and she was one of the first teachers in her school corporation to use the Internet as a classroom tool for instilling in students an interest in current events, history, and the weather. Mary's efforts to focus her young students on current affairs has led several of her former students to run for political office.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding educators on their receipt of the 1998 Crystal Apple Award. The years of hard work they have put forth in shaping the minds and futures of Northwest Indiana's young people is a true inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
