 President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and my able colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. We call it the Higher Education Investment Act of 1995. We hope that this bill will launch an individual income tax credit for interest paid by young people on their student loans.  Our own young people are the ones who truly must balance the Federal budget for the long run. I believe that if we on Capitol Hill want to do our part to balance the Federal budget for the long run, then we must aid human investment in one of its highest forms: knowledge gained through education. As the U.S. Senate, with an obligation toward the national economy, we must underwrite higher education as an economic investment toward future Federal tax revenues. This bill is the workable legislative vehicle.  As a practical matter of income tax credits, the Higher Education Investment Act of 1995 provides targeted taxpayers with a credit for up to 20 percent of the interest paid during the first 5 years in which payments are required on qualified educational loans. A student taxpayer may utilize both this credit and the standard deduction. Thus, a young person, or young married couple, can utilize this credit regardless of whether they are fortunate enough to have the money to begin buying a home and enjoying its related tax benefits. In fact, we intend this bill to aid young people, who are just starting out in life, in their effort to retain enough cash so that they too can have a chance at beginning the good life that many of us from older generations have enjoyed.  As a Congress, we have been decades in saddling the next generation with the burden of paying off our national debt. At a minimum, we should allow its members a mechanism to leverage themselves to accomplish their enormous task. To earn the necessary cash flow to succeed, and to not slip into a lower standard of living that we currently enjoy, the members of the next generation must arm themselves both with knowledge and income potential. During the past decade, tuition and fees at both public and private colleges and universities have increased at rates far exceeding inflation. During the same decade we in Congress eliminated the interest deduction for student loans. Thus, we require the next generation to not only borrow more than we borrowed, we force them pay more than we paid. All of us must find it ironic that, in their efforts to settle up on our open account, which is full of our excesses, we have denied them the same tax benefitted education that we enjoyed.  The social cost is enormous. Large volumes of student loan debt steer students away from socially useful though low paying careers such as teaching, research, or public service. It curbs entrepreneurial action because entrepreneurial ventures involve risk, and large, fixed, monthly student loan repayment obligations do not lend themselves to a young person's appetite for risk. Without this student loan interest credit, which is consistent with a progressive tax code, we will fail to invest in our most long lived and productive assets: the minds of our electorate.  Therefore, Mr. President, we challenge our colleagues to once again underwrite knowledge by first underwriting and co-sponsoring this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include the bill in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1273       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
