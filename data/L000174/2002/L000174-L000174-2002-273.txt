President, I rise today to introduce the Enhanced Protection of Our Cultural Heritage, EPOCH, Act of 2002. This legislation will increase the maximum penalties for violations of three existing statutes that protect the cultural and archaeological history of the American people, particularly Native Americans. The United States Sentencing Commission recommended the statutory changes contained in this bill, which would complement the Commission's strengthening of Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure more stringent penalties for criminals who steal from our public lands. I welcome the Commission's suggestion and am pleased that Senators Inouye, Clinton, Bingaman, and Boxer have joined me as cosponsors.  This bill will increase the maximum penalties for the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, ARPA, 16 USC Sec.  470ee, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, 18 USC Sec.  1170, and for 18 USC Sec.  1163, which prohibits theft from Indian Tribal Organizations. All three statutes currently impose a 5-year maximum sentence, and each includes a lower maximum for a first offense of the statute and/or a violation of the statute involving property of less than a specified value. This bill would create a 10-year maximum sentence for each statute, while eliminating the lower maximums under ARPA and NAGPRA for first offenses.  Such maximum sentences would be consistent with similar Federal statutes. For example, the 1994 law proscribing museum theft carries a 10-year maximum sentence, as do the general statutes punishing theft and the destruction of government property. Moreover, increasing the maximum sentences will give judges and the Sentencing Commission greater discretion to impose punishments appropriate to the amount of destruction a defendant has done.  Making these changes will also enable the Sentencing Commission's recent sentencing guidelines to be fully implemented. The Commission has increased sentencing guidelines for cultural heritage crimes, but the statutory maximum penalties contained in current law will prevent judges from issuing sentences in the upper range of the new guidelines. Those new guidelines have the enthusiastic support of the Justice and Interior Departments, the Society for American Archeology, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, numerous Native American nations, and many others. Congress should take the steps necessary to see the guidelines take full effect.  Two of the three laws we amend with this legislation protect Native American lands and property. The third, ARPA, protects both public and Indian lands, and provides significant protection to my State of Vermont. For example, ARPA can be used to prosecute those who would steal artifacts from the wrecked military vessels at the bottom of Lake Champlain that date to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. U.S. Attorneys can also use ARPA to prosecute criminals who take items that are at least 100 years old from a protected site on Vermont State property without a permit, and then transport those goods into another State. In addition, ARPA protects artifacts found on the approximately 5 percent of Vermont land that is Federal property, land that includes many ``ghost towns'' that have long been abandoned but are an important part of our history.  Those who would pillage the rich cultural heritage of this Nation and its people are committing serious crimes. These artifacts are the legacy of all Americans and should not be degraded as garage sale commodities or as fodder for private enrichment.  I would like to thank a number of people for their help and advice about this legislation. Charlie Tetzlaff, as well as the rest of the staff at the Sentencing Commission, helped us understand the importance of this issue, and made protecting our cultural heritage a priority when he served as United States Attorney for Vermont. Art Cohn, the director of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, and Giovanna Peebles, Vermont's State Archeologist, were very helpful in explaining how our laws protect the cultural heritage of Vermont and the rest of the Nation, and I am grateful for their support for this bill.  Passage of this legislation would demonstrate Congress' commitment to preserving our Nation's history and our cultural heritage. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense initiative.  I would ask that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2598       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
