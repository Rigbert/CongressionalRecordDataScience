 President, today the Senate will be in a period for morning business. The majority leader has stated it is our intention, it is our hope to proceed to consideration of S. 2290, the asbestos bill, today. Although we do not yet have an agreement on proceeding to the bill, we are continuing to work with our Democratic colleagues in an effort to move forward with that important legislation.  Although we will be in a period for morning business, Senators will be able to come to the floor today to deliver statements on the asbestos bill. As the leader announced before we recessed for the Easter holiday, there will be no rollcall votes today.                          ____________________
