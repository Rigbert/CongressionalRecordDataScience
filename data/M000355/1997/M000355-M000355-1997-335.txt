 BENNETT. Yes, I yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure it is a question, but rather an observation. Also, the BYU Cougars, as a result of the Cotton Bowl appearance probably--I don't have the figure in front of me, maybe staff does--probably got about $2.5 million as opposed to the roughly $8 million that would have been available had they been selected, as they obviously should have been selected, for an alliance bowl. We are talking not just about bragging rights here, we are talking about real money. We are talking about a $6 million differential, Mr. President. So this is not just putting a trophy in the school gym. This is a big business with huge economic implications.
