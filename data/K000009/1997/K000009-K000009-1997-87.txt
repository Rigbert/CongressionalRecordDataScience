Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Obey amendment. As I recall what happened in the committee, when we were working through this issue, it was quite well discussed in the committee; the administration had asked for $154 million for the actual sales commissions. This is money, $154 million, that goes to agents who are brokering crop insurance in our country and their commissions.                              {time}  2215  It is $154 million. It is not an insignificant amount of money. And, in fact, at that level we estimated every sales agent would receive a 24.5 percent commission. Now, that is a pretty healthy commission, even at 24.5 percent.  What happened once the bill came out of the subcommittee and moved to the full committee, at that point in the manager's amendment the proposal was to increase the sales commissions to $188 million, which would raise the amount of commission back to the level of about 27 percent. So we are really talking about whether somebody who is selling insurance out there is making a 27-percent commission or if they are making a 24.5-percent commission.  And if the GAO study had not been so clear on abuses in the program, I think that people who hold my opinion on this would not feel so strongly. We really do not believe, and we have taken the advice of the Department of Agriculture on this, we do not believe this is going to in any way diminish the amount of crop insurance available to farmers but, in fact, will put in the kind of regimen that we need in that program to make sure we counter abuses.  Mr. Chairman, I do not really know why the proponents of the higher level of commission were able to prevail at the full committee level, but it seems to me we are being responsible in this amendment. We are trying to cut back on the abuses that the GAO identified.
