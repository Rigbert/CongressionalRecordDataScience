Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       At the end of title II, add the following:                  Subtitle E--Miscellaneous Provisions     SEC. 25001. CERTAIN REVENUES GENERATED BY THIS ACT TO BE MADE                    AVAILABLE TO THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING                    COMMISSION TO LIMIT EXCESSIVE SPECULATION IN                    ENERGY MARKETS.       The Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) is amended      by redesignating section 44 as section 45, and by inserting      after section 43 the following:     ``SEC. 44. REVENUES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMODITY                    FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION.       ``(a) Establishment of Treasury Account.--The Secretary of      the Treasury (in this section referred to as the `Secretary')      shall establish an account in the Treasury of the United      States.       ``(b) Deposit Into Account of Certain Revenues Generated by      This Act.--The Secretary shall deposit into the account      established under subsection (a) the first $10,000,000 of the      total of the amounts received by the United States under      leases issued under this Act or any plan, strategy, or      program under this Act.       ``(c) Availability and Use of Funds.--       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amounts in      the account established under subsection (a) shall be made      available to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to use      its existing authorities to limit excessive speculation in      energy markets.       ``(2) Subject to appropriations.--The authority provided in      paragraph (1) may be exercised only to such extent, and with      respect to such amounts, as are provided in advance in      appropriations Acts.''.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 641, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.                              {time}  1045  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned earlier, the chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, under oath before the United States Senate, testified 3 years ago that the price of oil was $30 to $40 higher than it should have been, and the price at that time was about $100 a barrel, a little less than it is today. So $30 to $40 of the cost of each barrel of oil didn't have to do with the company passing through exploratory costs or lease costs or anything else; 30 to 40 percent of the cost of every barrel of oil is due to speculation by commodities traders on Wall Street, flash traders, derivatives traders, and others.  This isn't your grandfather's swaps market or commodities market. It is not users hedging themselves against future inflation. It is not producers hedging themselves. No, it is rampant speculation by people who have no intention of ever accepting delivery of a barrel of oil, have no use for a barrel of oil, except to manipulate its price to make it more expensive to make money for themselves and the people they represent, which is a very small minority of Americans, less than 1 percent. Meanwhile, the other 99 percent of Americans pay more at the pump.  We should do something about this. Now, there are those who think the modest position limits in Dodd-Frank will be a horrible, onerous burden on these speculators, and that maybe they can only extract $20 a barrel--maybe only $10 a barrel out of us--so you would only be paying an extra 30 cents at the pump to Wall Street. But as it stands today, after you take out other associated costs, about 60 cents a gallon that every American is paying at the pump today, no matter what the price is, where they live in the country, whether it is very high or very low, is going to Wall Street speculative interests.  We should do something about that. If we want to provide relief to the American people at the pump, we should do something about that.  This amendment is very simple. It establishes an account where money from lease sales would go to this account, and it would be made available to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission so they could upgrade their computers and do other things to better track and rein in speculators. Basically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been choked to the point, in terms of personnel and equipment, I think they are still using Commodore 64s, and they are trying to chase supercomputers. We can do better, and we could do something real for the American people here today other than Groundhog Day on the fifth anniversary and repassage of this legislation that will not become law.  Now there are those who will say you are increasing the deficit or whatever. No, it just says those leasing moneys would be put into this account, and they would be subject to appropriation. We would then have to convince the Appropriations Committee that it would be a good thing to upgrade the Commodity Futures Trading Commission so they could crack down on someof the flash trading and speculation that creates volatility and higher prices for Americans. I think this would be a very good thing to do.  I reserve the balance of my time.
