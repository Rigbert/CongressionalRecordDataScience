Chairman, this is an amendment to close a gap that I see in the vital needs of the American people. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, as the father of the Civil Support Weapons of Mass Destruction Team, knows well that the National Guard is a unique repository of expertise with capabilities of response to weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological, or radiological events, events that are far beyond the capabilities of most civilian units even in our major cities. They certainly exceed the capabilities that our States have to fund and train such teams at this point in time; yet we would all admit that a very real threat exists, and we are spending a tremendous amount of time around theworld attempting to prevent such attacks on our country. But if the worst should happen, we are going to need these teams, and we are going to need more than we have. The Congress has authorized 55, but at this point, as I understand it, 27 are fully operational, and another 5 are in training, and yet there are 23 that have not yet received funding.  My intention with this amendment was to push the Congress to make a difficult choice between a weapons system and these teams. We have to make difficult choices around here in the hopes that we can move forward.
