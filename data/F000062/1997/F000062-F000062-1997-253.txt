 President, as he told the Post:       I go to the banks, offices, just like any Mexican. Every      day I pass by roadblocks, police, soldiers, and there are no      problems. I'm in the streets all the time. How can they not      find me? Because they're not looking for me.  According to law enforcement, the Sonora cartel cultivates, smuggles, and distributes heroin and marijuana to the United States, as well as transporting Colombian cocaine. It has operations reaching into Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  The Washington Post found him, but the Mexican police, up to the last few days, were not even looking for him. Perhaps the State Department would explain how this qualifies as ``full cooperation'' with the United States. I do not see it.  The other incident was a typical February story. I sometimes wish February would last all year round because the pressure of the March 1 certification decision seems to produce all kinds of results that we are unable to get the rest of the year, but on March 2, frequently it is business as usual.  Just hours before the President's decision on certification was to be made public, the Mexican Government announced with great fanfare the arrest of Humberto Garcia Abrego, a leader of the Gulf cartel.  Leave aside the question of why Mexican authorities were unable to arrest this man the rest of the year but miraculously found him on February 27. What happened next is critical to the integrity of the effort.  Only hours after the decision to certify Mexico was announced, Humberto Garcia Abrego simply walked out of custody. The Mexican Attorney General's office called his release ``inexplicable.'' You could not write a script that would illustrate our problem with Mexico's inability to deal with the cartels any better than this incident.  Yet, the State Department assures us that there have been ``encouraging results and notable progress.'' Not with respect to the cartels. I sincerely do not believe that the cartels' operations have been altered, reduced or impeded at all.  Those officials whom the cartels cannot buy they kill.  The cartels have unleashed a reign of terror on honest Mexican law enforcement officials. The DEA reports that 12 prosecutors and law enforcement officers have been assassinated in Mexico in just the last year alone, most of them in connection with the Tijuana cartel.  Let's start with an incident on February 22, 1996, just about a year ago. Approximately 40 Juarez municipal police opened fire on agents from the Mexican Attorney General's office, resulting in the death of one commandante and one agent. DEA suspects the local police were providing protection for drug traffickers.  On February 23, 1996, Sergio Armanda Silva, a former operations chief of the Baja federal police, was assassinated.  On April 17, 1996, Mexico City's previous top prosecutor, Arturo Ochoa Palacios, was gunned down while jogging.  May 1996, Mexico City's top prosecutor, Sergio Moreno Perez, was kidnapped with his adult son in Michoacan state. Their bodies were later discovered in a car in Mexico City's suburbs.  June 27, 1996, drug agency commandante Daniel Beruben-Jaime was assassinated in Jalisco.  July 19, 1996, Isaac Sanchez Perez, the former Baja federal police commander, was shot in the back of the head and killed in Mexico City.  August 17, 1996, Tijuana prosecutor Jesus Romero Magana was gunned down outside his home. He was investigating the Arellano-Felix organization.  September 14, 1996, Baja federal police commander Ernesto Ibarra Santes, two of his bodyguards and a cab driver were machine-gunned down in Mexico city.  Ibarra had vowed to go after the Arellano Felix brothers and to purge the federal police ranks of any corrupt federal agents who stood in his way. He held his post for 28 days.  September 21, the body of Hector Gonzalez-Baecenas, assistant to Garcia Vargas, was found in the trunk of another car. Also tortured.  September 23, 1996, the body of 43-year-old Jorge Garcia Vargas, Tijuana district chief of the Federal antinarcotics agency was found in the trunk of a car along with the body of Miguel Angel Silva Caballero, a former Federal police commander. Both showed signs of torture.  November 3, 1996, a former prosecutor named Martin Ramirez-Alvarez was murdered in Tijuana. His wife reported that an unknown number of individuals stopped them in a vehicle utilizing red and blue police strobe lights. They dragged Ramirez-Alvarez out of the vehicle and shot him point blank six times. It is believed the Arellano-Felix organization is responsible for the assassination.  On January 3, 1997, 27-year-old State Prosecutor Hodin Gutierrez-Rico was assassinated in front of his wife and children at his residence in Tijuana. Gutierrez-Rico was investigating the murder of a Tijuana municipal police chief and Presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. More than 120 spent shells were found on the ground, and his body was deliberately run over several times by a van.  And so it goes. These murders are, to me, the most compelling because their message is undeniable: ``Get too close, and you are dead.'' And not one of these cases has been solved to date. This is why the corruption of the military general placed in charge of the counternarcotics effort is so paralyzing. The question remains: If the highest military man can be corrupted, then who is left?  But Mexico's failure to combat the cartels effectively is having an alarming spillover effect into American cities. Robert Walsh, special agent in charge of the San Diego office of the FBI told my office that all of the major Mexican cartels have members of United States gangs working for them.  These agents distribute the drugs shipped in by the cartels and ship the cash generated from drug sales back to Mexico. They also carry out revenge murders on orders from Tijuana or Juarez.  Prof. Peter Lupsha of the University of New Mexico, who has studied the cartels for decades, says, ``I don't believe anyone in La Cosa Nostra could order a murder 2,000 miles away and expect it to be carried out. Carillo-Fuentes can do that and much more.''  That is why the State Department's utter denial that the problem is getting worse is so dangerous. As much as these cartels are destroying Mexico, their reach is expanding. They have agents in many of our large and mid-size cities. Their drugs are reaching our children. The gangs they hire kill ruthlessly to protect their turf in our cities.  It is no exaggeration to say that the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans are literally at stake in the war against the cartels. And the State Department's refusal to face up to facts does not protect a single child from the bullets of a drug-running gang or a driveby shooter.  Let me speak about money laundering.  The next item of progress in the State Department's statement of explanation is that ``the Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of legislation which have armed the Government of Mexico with a whole new arsenal of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical diversion, and organized crime.''  Let us see how good the new money-laundering law is.  It is true that in May 1996, the Mexican Congress adopted a law that for the first time specifically identified money laundering as a criminal act. At that time, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz Martinez committed to develop the regulations that would implement this law by January 1997.  The draft of these regulations, which would require banks and other institutions to report suspicious transactions of currency, were due in January. Well, it is now March and the regulations have not been forthcoming.  No doubt, the implementation date of these regulations, now scheduled for June 1997, will slide, as will the issuance of a second set of regulations, governing the reporting of large-scale transactions.  These regulations are essential to combating money laundering. Reporting requirements discourage would-be money launderers, tip off law enforcement officials to unlawful activity, and create a paper trail that can be a powerful investigative tool.  But until Finance Minister Ortiz issues the regulations and they are implemented, it is business as usual. To date, not a single Mexican bank or exchange house has been forced to alter its operations.  And until the regulations have been issued, we have no real way of evaluating the impact of the law. Any law is only as good as its implementation. It is a giant leap of faith by the State Department to cite the passage of a money-laundering law as a sign of major progress when, to date, it has been neither implemented nor enforced.  There are some key questions that must be answered:  Will the regulations prevent bank employees or ministry staff from tipping off drug cartels about investigations?  Second, will the regulations provide immunity for employees who report a suspicious transaction and are acting in good faith? If not, they may be reluctant to report transactions as required, or killed if they do.  Third, will the regulations contain exemptions for any industries? They should not.  In addition, there is a major weakness in the new law in that it does not provide for sanctions against banks and financial institutions that fail to comply with reporting requirements. Without such sanctions, Mexico's money-laundering laws will remain woefully inadequate.  Now, there is a report today in the Financial Times of London that Mexico will introduce its antilaundering regulations this week. We shall see. Those regulations will need to be evaluated. But why has it taken Mexico until mid-March, and a crisis over certification, to get to this point? That is not a sign of a fully cooperating country.  Meanwhile, massive money laundering continues in Mexico unabated. And it is spilling across the southwest border.  California State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Chief George Doane testified last March that ``at a money counting and shipping house in the Los Angeles area, agents located $6 million in cash and financial records in a residence occupied by three Hispanic nationals, indicating that $75 million had been counted, packaged, and shipped from the residence via a commercial bus company to Mexico.''  An analysis done by the DEA of all transactions between the San Antonio Federal Reserve and area depository institutions showed a currency surplus of $2.96 billion in 1995--a clear sign that cartels have successfully laundered money to their final destination in Mexico.  The DEA's Donnie Marshall told Congress in September that a DEA investigation known as Zorro II in the Los Angeles area ``resulted in the arrests of 156 people, the seizure of approximately 5,600 kilograms of cocaine, and over $17 million in U.S. currency. The majority of this $17 million was seized as it was being prepared for shipment to Mexico or seized from vehicles that were en route to Mexico.''  Marshall also described cambios, or exchange houses outside the banking system, located along the borders of Texas and California, which are a significant factor in the laundering of drug proceeds where Mexican traffickers intermingle cash derived from drug sales with legitimate exchange business. My staff recently visited 22 of these exchange houses.  So the State Department sees encouraging results and notable progress in the area of money laundering as well. I say that today there is no effective effort to deter the laundering of drug money anywhere in Mexico.                               Corruption  The State Department's statement of explanation sees progress even where--by its own admission--none exists. This is how the Department describes Mexico's so-called progress on combating corruption:       In an effort to confront widespread corruption within the      nation's law enforcement agencies, former Attorney General      Lozano dismissed over 1,250 federal police officers and      technical personnel for corruption or incompetence, although      some have been rehired, and the Government of Mexico indicted      two former senior Government officials and a current      Undersecretary of Tourism.  Now, the sentence, in a sense, refutes itself. When you say that some have been rehired, of course, if they were innocent, we would want them to be rehired. But if they were guilty, we would want them to be prosecuted. So let's look and see what happened.  According to the DEA, of the 1,250 officers dismissed for corruption, not a single one was successfully prosecuted--not one.  The rash of murders of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in Tijuana is a case in point. These assassinations have been made possible in large part because the Tijuana police have been so thoroughly corrupted by the Arellano-Felix organization.  According to the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 1997, court papers recently filed in United States district court by the Mexican Government in an extradition case contain testimony to the effect that--and let me remind you that this is from court papers submitted by the Mexican Government--``the state attorney general and almost 90 percent of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges in Tijuana and the State of Baja California . . . are on the payroll'' of the Arellano-Felix organization.  In the same San Diego court documents, a former presidential guard, army lieutenant Gerardo Cruz Pacheco, told how he recruited soldiers to unload drug shipments and helped Tijuana cartel gunmen assassinate Baja federal police commander Ernesto Ibarra Santes in September.  The Federal judicial police have been so corrupted by the cartels that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between them and the criminals. That is why some were encouraged by the prospect of increased participation of the Mexican military, which has not been so tainted by corruption, in the anti-drug effort.  But that's why the startling revelation about Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of the National Institute to Combat Drugs--Mexico's top counternarcotics official--who is a 42-year veteran of the armed forces, has cast grave doubts upon that hope.  When the Mexican Army planned a raid of the wedding of the sister of Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, the drug lord had been tipped off in advance, some say by General Gutierrez himself. As a result, he escaped arrest by leaving early or not attending. But Mexican troops found federal police providing protection for drug traffickers at the wedding.  And most concering to me is that corruption is spreading rapidly across the border into the United States. For example:  In Calexico, CA, former INS inspector Richard Felix admitted to FBI agents that he pocketed up to $500,000 in bribes for permitting loads of cocaine and marijuana to pass uninspected through his port of entry lane.  In El Paso, former Customs and INS inspector Jose Trinidad Carrillo gave drug traffickers a price list for his help in getting drugs through his border-entry lane: $10,000 per car, or $40 per pound of marijuana and $250 per pound of cocaine.  Stories of officials of U.S. border towns being bribed are now surfacing. Some of this I heard myself in the testimony of a border rancher to the Judiciary Committee last year.  President Zedillo appears to be trying his best to fight drug trafficking, and he has honest people on his side, like Elvira Ruiz, one of the few female police chiefs in Baja, whose life has been consistently threatened by the cartels.  But the efforts of these people are unfortunately being completely overwhelmed by the uncontrollable tide of corruption.  The arrest of General Gutierrez has been cited by the administration as evidence of the Mexican Government's commitment to fight corruption. But the way in which this situation was handled raises serious questions about Mexico's willingness to cooperate with the United States.  On February 6 of this year, Defense Secretary Enrique Cervantes Aguirre confronted General Gutierrez, asking him to explain how he came to live in an apartment that was beyond the means of his salary. The general began suffering a heart attack and was placed in the hospital. After 12 days of investigating, on February 18, Defense Secretary Cervantes had Gutierrez placed under arrest for accepting bribes from the Carrillo-Fuentes cartel.  Yet during that entire 12-day period, the Mexican Government gave no indication to the United States that it suspected that its top drug official was corrupt. In that time, U.S. officials continued regular contacts with Gutierrez' National Institute to Combat Drugs, not knowing that its operations were directed by a man in the pocket of drug kingpins.  General Gutierrez had been in Washington shortly before he was first questioned about his spending habits. He met with our drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who called him a man of absolute, unquestioned integrity. Why would Mexico allow Gutierrez to visit Washington when he was suspected of corruption, and why--at the least--would they not alert the United States side?  Our own drug enforcement officials have been forced to conduct damage assessments to determine how much and what kind of intelligence was provided to the general, and perhaps passed right onto the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes. We are left to worry that the lives of our agents in the field and our informants have been placed in jeopardy.  So we can praise the Mexican Government for arresting Gutierrez, but their delay in notifying the United States of their suspicions about the general begs an important question: Is this a sign of the full cooperation for which Mexico has just been certified?                 Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement  The State Department's statement of explanation then goes on to describe the extensive cooperation that has taken place between the Mexican and United States Governments:       The United States and Mexico established the High-Level      Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint      solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate      bilateral anti-drug efforts. The HLCG met three times during      1996 and its technical working groups met throughout the      year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments      developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to      both countries which will be used as the basis for a joint      counter-drug strategy.  All the high-level meetings in the world don't amount to a hill of beans unless there is cooperation and coordination on the ground between law enforcement agencies of the two sides.  Once again, the State Department's assertion that these meetings are a sign of real progress misses the point. Whether or not our leaders can work together is less important than whether our cops can work together.  And plainly, at the moment, they cannot. Given the staggering level of corruption in the Mexican police, it is no wonder that DEA Administrator Constantine told the House Committee last week: ``In short, there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship.''  That statement by itself should call into question Mexico's qualification to be certified. It is echoed by law enforcement agents on the ground:  On March 7, 1997, Ed Ladd, president of the California Narcotics Officers' Association, issued a statement in which he announced that the association's board had voted unanimously to support congressional efforts to overturn the decision to certify Mexico. This vote, Mr. Ladd said, ``is based on our longstanding experience with the widespread corruption and lack of cooperation shown by the Mexican government.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text the statement of Ed Ladd, president of the California Narcotic Officers' Association, be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
