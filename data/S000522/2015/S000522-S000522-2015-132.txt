Mr. Speaker, I recently hosted a briefing entitled Catholic Engagement on Nuclear Disarmament: What are the moral questions? and one of the speakers, Dr. Stephen M. Colecchi, presented the following statement:       At the time of Senate ratification of the New START Treaty      in 2010, Cardinal Francis George, OMI, then President of the      U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, whose death we recently      mourned, declared: ``The horribly destructive capacity of      nuclear arms makes them disproportionate and indiscriminate      weapons that endanger human life and dignity like no other      armaments. Their use as a weapon of war is rejected in Church      teaching based on just war norms.''       The Cardinal was standing on a firm foundation of      longstanding teaching when he made that assertion. The 1983      pastoral letter, ``The Challenge of Peace,'' established the      U.S. Catholic bishops as a moral voice on nuclear      disarmament. The bishops argued that ``each proposed addition      to our strategic system or change in strategic doctrine must      be assessed precisely in light of whether it will render      steps toward `progressive disarmament' more or less likely.''       Ten years later in the ``Harvest of Justice is Sown in      Peace,'' the bishops declared: ``The eventual elimination of      nuclear weapons is more than a moral ideal; it should be a      policy goal.'' This vision continues to shape their public      engagement.       At the time of the drafting of the 1983 pastoral, I worked      as a religious educator and was active in efforts to engage      Catholics in discussions of the various drafts of the peace      pastoral. The process of producing this document was      significant. The bishops actively solicited feedback from      both experts and people in the pew on each of three drafts.      The bishops remained the teachers, but they acknowledged that      prudential judgments were also involved and this required      dialogue.       Consultations were held at the national and local levels,      and in many settings, at universities, parishes and think      tanks. These dialogues helped shape the final pastoral      letter, but perhaps more importantly they also raised      awareness of the fundamental issues related to nuclear      weapons among many Americans. Today the Conference of Bishops      is working with others to revitalize Catholic thinking and      engagement on issues involving nuclear weapons today as      decades have passed since they first became involved with      this issue in a major way.       Over the years, in light of Church moral teaching, the      bishops have also exercised leadership regarding specific      elements of U.S. nuclear policy. In the late 80s they raised      moral questions regarding missile defense initiatives. The      bishops supported the Strategic Arms Reduction treaties      (Start I and II) in the early 1990s. And in the late 90s they      supported the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, lamenting its      defeat in the Senate. The bishops welcomed the 2002 Moscow      Treaty as a positive step, but called on the United States,      and by implication other nations, to do much more.       During the past decade, the Conference of Bishops has      opposed federal funding for research on the Robust Nuclear      Earth Penetrator, the Reliable Replacement Warhead and new      nuclear weapons. They weighed in on the Nuclear Posture      Review, asking President Obama to narrow the purpose of the      nuclear arsenal solely to deterring nuclear attack. They made      a major effort to offer vigorous support for Senate      ratification of the New START Treaty in 2010, and have      supported and welcomed the P5+1 dialogue with Iran over their      nuclear program, as has the Holy Father and the Holy See.       At its Deterrence Symposium in July 2009, the U.S.      Strategic Command turned to the Conference of Bishops to      offer moral reflections. Cardinal Edwin O'Brien, then an      Archbishop and a member of the bishops' International      Committee, gave a major address on ``Nuclear Weapons and      Moral Questions: The Path to Zero.'' He urged the nuclear      powers to ``move beyond'' deterrence. Subsequently, he joined      Global Zero and addressed their February 2010 summit in      Paris.       In his speech at the 2009 Deterrence Symposium, Cardinal      O'Brien reiterated the longstanding position of the U.S.      bishops: ``The moral end is clear: a world free of the threat      of nuclear weapons. This goal should guide our efforts. Every      nuclear weapons system and every nuclear weapons policy      should be judged by the ultimate goal of protecting human      life and dignity and the related goal of ridding the world of      these weapons in mutually verifiable ways.''       U.S. Church leaders are not naive about the challenges that      lie along the path to a world without nuclear weapons.      Cardinal Francis George wrote a letter to President     Obama in 2010 in which he ``. . . acknowledged that the path      to a world free of nuclear weapons will be long and      difficult. It will involve many steps:       Verifiably reducing nuclear arsenals as the new START      Treaty continues to do;       Ratifying and bringing into force the Comprehensive Test      Ban Treaty;       Reducing our nation's reliance on nuclear weapons for      security as the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review began to do;       Securing nuclear materials from terrorists;       Adopting a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty to prohibit      production of weapons-grade material;       Strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency to      monitor nonproliferation efforts and ensure access to      peaceful uses of nuclear power; and       Other actions that take humanity in the direction of a      nuclear-weapons-free world.''  The Cardinal went on to say, ``We are pastors and teachers, not technical experts. We cannot map out the precise route to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, but we can offer moral direction and encouragement. Although we cannot anticipate every step on the path humanity must walk, we can point with moral clarity to a destination that moves beyond deterrence to a world free of the nuclear threat.''  Given these longstanding concerns of the U.S. Bishops to reduce nuclear weapons and secure nuclear materials, in April 2015, Bishop Oscar Cantuu, Chairman of the Committee on International Justice and Peace, spoke on a panel on ``Nuclear Weapons and the Moral Compass'' sponsored by The Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See and The Global Security Institute at the UN Headquarters in New York, and in November 2014, Bishop Richard Pates, a member of the Committee, spoke at a seminar on ``Less Nuclear Stockpiles and More Development'' sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Rome.  The bishops of the United States are deeply engaged in the moral enterprise of working for a world without nuclear weapons. As Bishop Cantuu said in his April UN talk: ``To achieve this goal, we must, in the words of Pope Francis, acknowledge that `now is the time to counter the logic of fear with the ethic of responsibility, and so foster a climate of trust and sincere dialogue.'
