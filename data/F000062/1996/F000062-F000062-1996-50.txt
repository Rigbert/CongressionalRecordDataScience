 President, today, with Senator Snowe, I am introducing a bill to set up a toll-free service so that people with life-threatening diseases can find out about research projects that might help them.  Today there are thousands of serious and life-threatening diseases, diseases for which we have no cure. For genetic diseases alone, there are 3,000 to 4,000. Some of these are familiar, like cancer, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Others are not so common, like cystinosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Wilson's disease, and Sjogren's syndrome. Indeed, there are over 5,000 rare diseases, diseases most of us have never heard of, affecting between 10 and 20 million Americans.  Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. Diabetes afflicts 15 million Americans per year, half of whom do not know they have it. Arthritis affects 40 million Americans every year. 15,000 American children die every year. Among children, the rates of chronic respiratory diseases--asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis--heart murmurs, migraine headaches, anemia, epilepsy, and diabetes are increasing. Few families escape illness today.                                The Bill  The bill we introduce requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a ``one-stop shopping'' database, including a toll-free telephone number, so that patients and physicians can find out what clinical research trials are underway on experimental treatments for various diseases. Callers would be able to learn the purpose of the study, eligibility requirements, research sites, and a contact person for the research project. Information would have to be presented in plain English, not medicalese, so that the average person could understand it.                        A Constituent Suggestion  The suggestion for this information center came from Nancy Evans, of San Francisco's Breast Cancer Action, in a June 13 hearing of the Senate Cancer Coalition, which I cochair with Senator Mack. She described the difficulty that patients have in trying to find outwhat experimental treatments might be available, research trials sponsored by the Federal Government, and by private companies. Most of them are desperate; most have tried everything. She testified that the National Cancer Institute has established 1-800-4-CANCER, but their information is incomplete. It does not include all trials and the information is often difficult for the lay person to understand.  In addition, the National Kidney Cancer Association has called for a central database.                         People in Serious Need  To understand the importance of this bill, we have to stop and think about the plight of the individuals it is intended to help. These are people who have a terminal illness, whose physicians have tried every treatment they can find. Cancer patients, for example, have probably had several rounds of chemotherapy, which has left them debilitated, virtually lifeless. These patients cling to slim hopes. They are desperate to try anything. But step one is finding out what is available.  One survey found that a majority of patients and families are willing to use investigational drugs--drugs being researched but not approved--but find it difficult to locate information on research projects. A similar survey of physicians found that 42 percent of physicians are unable to find printed information about rare illnesses.                          Help for Physicians  Physicians, no matter how competent and well trained, also do not necessarily know about experimental treatments currently being researched. And most Americans do not have sophisticated computer hookups that provide them instant access to the latest information through commercial, government, or medical databases. Our witness, Nancy Evans, testified that she can find out more about a company's clinical trials by calling her stockbroker than by calling existing services.  I have had many desperate families call me, their U.S. Senator, seeking help. Others have lodged their pleas at the White House. Others call lawyers, 911, the local medical society, the local chamber of commerce, anything they can think of. Getting information on health research projects should not require a fishing expedition of futile calls, good connections, or the involvement of elected officials.  In 1988, Congress directed HHS to establish an AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service. It is now operational, 1-800-TRIALS-A, so that patients, providers, and their families can find out more about AIDS clinical trials. All calls are confidential and experienced professionals at the service can tell people about research trials underway which are evaluating experimental drugs and other therapies at all stages of HIV infection.                       Improving Health, Research  Facilitating access to information can also strengthen our health research effort. With a national database enabling people to find research trials, more people could be available to participate in research. This can help researchers broaden their pool of research participants.                        Modest Help for the Ill  The bill we introduce does not guarantee that anyone can participate in a clinical research trial. Researchers would still control who participates and set the requirements for the research. But for people who cling to hopes for a cure, for people who want to live longer, for people who want to feel better, this database can offer a little help.  It should not take political or other connections, computer sophistication or access to top-flight university medical schools to find out about research on treatments of disease when you have a life-threatening illness.  Mr. President, I hope this bill will offer some hope to the millions who are suffering today and I hope Congress will act on the bill promptly.                                 ______                                       By
