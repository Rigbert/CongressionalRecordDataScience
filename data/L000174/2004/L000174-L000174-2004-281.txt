President, if I may respond without the Senator losing his right to the floor, he is relying on a statute--if I recall, without hearings; there was an amendment to the Sarbanes-Oxley bill a couple years ago on the floor. If we are talking about criminal statutes and changing them by whim, that is one that said no more debate on this. I am bringing up something that was debated rather thoroughly in the Appropriations Committee, including a bill the Senator from Virginia and I voted for last year.
