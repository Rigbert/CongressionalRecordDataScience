Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass legislation that would give a real prescription medicine benefit to our Nation's seniors. The Republican plan failed to meet the real problems that face our Nation's seniors. Our seniors have been receiving a bad deal when it comes to prescription medicine. Now is the time to give our seniors a good deal, a better deal, a fair deal.  The American people need and want a meaningful benefit that is voluntary, universal, affordable and accessible to all of our seniors. There is no room here to play partisan politics. No senior, but no senior should have to choose between putting food on the table and getting his or her heart medicine. This is not just, this is not right, and this is not fair.  My Republican brothers and sisters, this is our moral obligation, to do what is right.                          ____________________
