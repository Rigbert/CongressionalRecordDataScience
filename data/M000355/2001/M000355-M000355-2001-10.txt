 Landrieu):  S. 1708. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to ensure thecontinuity of medical care following a major disaster by making private for-profit medical facilities eligible for Federal disaster assistance; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parity in Emergency Preparedness and Response Act of 2001. The horrific attacks of September 11 and subsequent anthrax exposures have focused our attention on the need to prepare and respond to emergencies, whether they result from acts of nature or the misdeeds of man. The legislation I introduce today will correct a provision in current law that prevents many hospitals from working with the Federal Government to prevent and respond to disasters. When tragedy strikes, the most important consideration shouldn't be a hospital's tax status, but rather its ability to care for the injured.  In 1974, Congress enacted the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, commonly referred to as the Stafford Act. This important legislation helps States and communities plan for emergencies and take steps to minimize the damage inflicted by a potential disaster. Once a disaster strikes, the Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide communities the resources they need to respond quickly and recover completely.  While the Stafford Act has helped countless communities respond to disasters, it has one glaring shortcoming, it prohibits the President and Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, from offering assistance to hospitals that are owned or managed by private companies. As a result, there are 36 hospitals in my home State of Kentucky which are ineligible to receive Federal disaster mitigation and recovery funds.  I find it incomprehensible that the Federal Government would deny needed disaster assistance to a county hospital, simply because of its ownership, management structure, or tax status. Is a tornado any less devastating in one community than another, simply because of a local hospital's tax status? Are they any less deserving of the Federal Government's support? I think not.  What I find most troubling about this disparity is that it disproportionately affects rural communities, whose hospitals are frequently owned by the community but operated by private companies. Many small towns and rural counties prefer this sort of relationship because it allows them to ensure their citizens have access to needed health care services, while relieving themselves of the burdens of operating a modern hospital. In the rural Kentucky communities of Caldwell, Cumberland, Crittenden, Fleming, Marshall, Monroe, Ohio and Bell Counties, the community owns the hospital but contracts with a private management firm to direct the hospital's day to day operations. As a result of this relationship, these publicly owned hospitals are not eligible for Federal disaster mitigation or recovery assistance.  Hospitals are critical community resources which must be able to provide services in an emergency, regardless of their ownership or management structure. That is why I am proud to introduce the Parity in Emergency Preparedness and Response Act with my colleague from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. This legislation would eliminate the disparity which exists between nonprofit and investor-owned hospitals and allow all eligible hospitals to apply for disaster mitigation and recovery funds. Our bill does not create an entitlement for hospitals that are owned or operated by private companies. The Stafford Act is clear in stating the President ``may make contributions'' to help damaged hospitals respond to and recover from an emergency, and this legislation does nothing to diminish the President's discretion in this regard.  Since September 11, 2001, the need to ensure that our Nation's public health infrastructure is capable of responding to unanticipated emergencies has received renewed attention in Congress. In fact, the Senate will soon consider comprehensive legislation to address the growing threat of bioterrorism and protect the safety of our food supply. While I strongly support the intent of this legislation, it will be woefully incomplete if it does not allow all hospitals, including investor-owned hospitals, to apply for disaster assistance.  Hospitals play a vital role in responding to emergencies, regardless of their management structure. I look forward to working with Ms. Landrieu and our colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation and ensure that all of America's hospitals are prepared to respond to disasters.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of hospitals which would become eligible for disaster assistance under my legislation be printed in the Record, and I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1708       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
