 President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Connecticut in sponsoring legislation aimed at preventing the commencement of an arms race in Latin America.  For the past two decades, the United States has prohibited the sale or transfer of advanced military equipment to the region. The ban, instituted by President Carter, has been generally maintained since the late 1970's, including during the administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush. The lone exception occurred in 1982, in response to a perceived Cuban military buildup, when the United States sold F-16 fighter aircraft to the Government of Venezuela.  The ban was instituted during a different era, when many nations of the region were under the rule of military dictators. To be sure, the nations of Latin America have made important advances since that period. Politically, dictatorship has given way to democracy. Every nation of the hemisphere--with the glaring exception of Cuba--is now governed by a democratically chosen leader. Additionally, after the lost decade of the 1980's--a period of negative economic growth in many nations of the region--the region is beginning to recover economically. Indeed, the nations of the region have made tremendous progress in the past few years, shedding the statist policies of past decades and embracing free markets and free trade.  Although the times have changed, the need for restraint in the sale of arms has not. First, although the region is advancing economically, it is abundantly clear that few nations of the region can afford the high costs that an arms race would impose. Second, an arms race in the region would be destabilizing--not only among nations of Latin America, but within those nations where civilian control of the military is not yet fully consolidated. The Armed Forces remain important institutional actors in many nations of the region; the increased emphasis on arms procurement and arms budgets could undermine the priorities and powers of the civilian leadership.  In the past year, there has been considerable discussion within the Clinton administration, and among the nations of the region, about the wisdom of lifting the U.S. ban on the sale of advanced weapons. In this respect, it is important to note that many senior figures in Latin America have come down on the side of restraint. In April of this year, for example, the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government--an organization consisting of current and former hemispheric leaders from leading countries in the region--called on Latin American governments to ``accept a moratorium of two years before purchasing any sophisticated weapons.'' In the interim, the Council urged governments of the region to ``explore ideas to restrain such arms,'' and urged governments that sell arms, including the United States, ``to affirm their support for such a moratorium.''  This legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduce today would heed that request by expressing support for such a moratorium, and banning the transfer to the region of highly advanced weapons by the United States, unless such transfer conforms to an international agreement governing sales to, or purchases by, nations of the region. In other words, if a regional arms control agreement is negotiated permitting some sales but prohibiting others, arms transfers by the United States would be allowed, provided such transfers conform to the arms control agreement then in place.  It should be emphasized that this bill would not ban all sales of military equipment to Latin America. Rather, it would merely continue, in law, the policy and practice adhered to by the executive branch for the past two decades: to not sell sophisticated military equipment such as advanced combat aircraft and attack helicopters to the nations of Latin America. It would permit U.S. firms to continue to sell other military equipment to Latin America--a market in which the United States now holds the largest share, and in which U.S. firms have sold a total of nearly $800 million over the past 4 fiscal years.  Mr. President, it is the policy of the United States to promote greater hemispheric integration--an objective pursued in the process initiated at the Summit of the Americas, which was hosted by President Clinton in 1994. The policy set forth in this bill advances that objective by honoring the request of several Latin American nations that they pursue a regional arms control approach before advanced weapons are introduced into the region. I urge my colleagues and the administration to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
