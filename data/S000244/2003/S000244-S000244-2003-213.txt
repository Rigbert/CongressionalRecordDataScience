Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) has spent a lot of time referring to suits by local district attorneys being removed to Federal court under this bill because she believes they would not be covered by the exemption contained in the bill for State attorney generals.  I would say to the gentlewoman that we believe that suits by local elected district attorneys do fall within that exempted category, and are not covered by the bill. It is clearly the intent of the bill to exclude elected law enforcement officials like district attorneys.  If we need to work further with the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) as this bill moves forward to clarify that intent with regard to suits by local officials, I would offer her to do that. However, I do want to make it quite clear that private attorney general actions are another matter. If the gentlewoman will withdraw her amendment, we can work on clarification of this. Otherwise, I would urge the membership to vote against the amendment since the gentlewoman has rejected my offer.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
