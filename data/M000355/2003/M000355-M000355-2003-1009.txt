 196, the digital and wireless technology bill. Under the agreement, the Senate will vote on the measure at approximately 12 noon.  Upon the disposition of that bill, the Senate will resume consideration of the Owen nomination. The majority leader has asked me to announce that while he regrets being forced to file cloture on this important appeals court nomination, he believes it is vital that the Senate fulfill its advise and consent responsibility. With that being said, I inform my colleagues that the cloture vote on the Owen nomination will occur Thursday morning, and Members will be notified when the vote is scheduled.  I also announce to my colleagues that the majority leader is working with the Democratic leader to clear several items for floor action. The items under discussion include the State Department authorization bill, the bioshield bill, the FISA legislation, and several judicial nominations. Therefore, Members should anticipate additional votes during tomorrow's session.
