President, I see the distinguished manager of the bill rising. What I was going to do, I will tell the Chair, I was going to speak on the balanced budget, but I see the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. I was going to speak a few minutes and yield to him, to accommodate a scheduling problem I have. I do not want to interfere with the prerogatives of the chairman. I have to be at another place in about 6 or 7 minutes.
