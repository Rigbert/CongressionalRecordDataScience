Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 27th Anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.   Congress passed the ADA to break down the physical and societal barriers that kept disabled Americans from fully participating in the American Dream. From creating standards for wheelchair accessibility in places open to the public, to requiring 911 phone lines to be equipped to respond to hearing-impaired callers, the ADA has transformed the lives of millions of Americans. The progress we've made is remarkable, and I'm proud to have been part of these efforts.   Throughout my career, I have seen few pieces of legislation that bring all people together as much as the ADA. Not only did this historic legislation pass both chambers with large bipartisan majorities, but the ADA Amendments Act passed unanimously in 2008. This legislation shows that Congress can come together to solve problems for the betterment of the American people.   I proudly stand with the thousands of advocates who come to Washington, D.C. this week to continue the fight for the rights of all Americans.                          ____________________
