  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 2.8 million jobs lost, 1.1 million long-term unemployed with expired benefits, 24 months into a jobless recovery spurred by record deficits and trickle-down tax cuts. But finally, today, hope is on the horizon.  Mr. Speaker, a $275 billion highway bill, it should be more, is pending. It would create real jobs to meet real needs, put Americans to work; and, yet, the White House is threatening a veto. April fool, or is it fools at the White House?                          ____________________
