 Biden, and Mr.              Leahy):  S. 348. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to encourage States to enact a Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, to provide standards and protection for the conduct of internal police investigations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.        THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1997 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, American families turn on the news every night and get bombarded by the reality that the war against crime and drugs is escalating. No one understands the dangers of this domestic war better than the men and women who serve on the front lines. I'm talking about our Nation's police officers.  These dedicated individuals offer up their lives as an act of service every day. They know the stress and the strain of walking the daily beat, of being caught in the crossfire in a world of gangs and drugs. These officers experience first-hand the casualties of our national epidemic.  As the Washington Post reported this Sunday, seven law enforcement officers right here in the Nation's Capital have been killed--in little more than 2 years. Moreover, the ambush of these ``men and women wearing badges [occurred]--even though the officers posed no immediate threat to their attackers.''  Our Nation's police officers endure unfathomable pressure every day as they fight to take back our streets. In the words of one officer, ``the ultimate sacrifice could occur at any time. * * * [The gangs and criminals] have rewritten the rule book.''  To make matters worse, the pressure of crime and drugs--of gangs and thugs--is multiplied by the fear of unjust disciplinary actions. Our law enforcement officers face intrusive investigations into their professional and personal lives--oftentimes at the behest of some recently arrested criminal looking for a payback.  Our officers live in the fear of: being investigated without notice; being interrogated without an attorney; and being dismissed without a hearing.  We must act now to address this situation by guaranteeing our police officers their basic and fundamental rights. So, today, along with Mr. Biden and Mr. Leahy, I proudly introduce the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights.  This bill protects rights that most of us take for granted. For example, it allows police officers to be involved in, or refrain from, political activity.  The bill also gives significant due process rights to every police officer subject to investigation for noncriminal disciplinary action. Some of these rights include:  The right to be informed of the administrative charges prior to being questioned; the right to be advised of the results of an investigation; the right to a hearing and an opportunity to respond; and the right to be represented by counsel or other representative.  We owe our law enforcement officers a national debt of gratitude for their valiant fight in a battle that must be won. I ask my colleagues to show their appreciation and understanding of the plight of our police force. We must act boldly to equip every officer with basic and fundamental rights.  Finally, I must conclude by explaining that this bill is a product of years of input from the men and women who have experienced these daily pressures, and continue to endure them. This legislation has benefited from the thoughtful ideas and past support of many law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.  In particular, I am grateful to the contribution made by the Fraternal Order of Police. Over the past 6 years, I have worked closely with the Kentucky FOP to develop and promote this legislation. Seasoned and well-informed officers like Ray Franklin and Mike Hettich, both of whom are National FOP officers from my home State, have worked with me in refining the language of this bill and developing grassroots momentum. I would also like to say a personal word of thanks to Verlin Flaherty, Rick McCubbin, and Martin Scott.  The time has come to protect those who protect us. We must give our law enforcement officers the basic and fundamental rights that they desperately need and deserve.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 348       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
