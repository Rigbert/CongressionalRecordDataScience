Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act--a modest, common-sense solution to the problem of pay inequity.  Equal pay for equal work is not only a core value of mine and others--it's the law. Full implementation of that principle, however, remains elusive.  The Paycheck Fairness Act, which was first introduced in 1997 and passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support in 2009, is a serious initiative to realize the noble goal of true equality.  Among its provisions, this legislation would:  Encourage businesses to rely on information about the market value of a position, industry standards, the duties of the job, and theirbudgets in order to set salaries, by prohibiting reliance on the prior salary history of prospective employees.  Allow workers to share their personal salary information free from retaliation, with commonsense exceptions for FIR professionals.  Improve research on the gender pay gap by instructing Department of Labor (DOL) to conduct studies and review available research and data to provide information on how to identify, correct, and eliminate illegal wage disparities.  Assist the DOL in uncovering wage discrimination by requiring the collection of wage data from federal contractors, and direct the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to conduct a survey of available wage information and create a system of wage data collection.  Support small businesses with technical assistance by providing support to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices.  Momentum has continued to build, with more than 260 diverse organizations signing a letter in support of the bill, including the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, which represents business associations and groups across the country, and the Main Street Alliance, a national network of small business owners.  Madam Chair, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families, if the disparity in median annual earnings for women and men working full-time, year-round were closed, women would have over $10,000 more in earnings each year. For millennial women, closing this gender wage gap could add up to more than $1,000,000 in lost income over a career.  This not only impacts these women immensely, but also directly impacts those with families. Over 62 percent of two-parent, married households with children, have both parents employed, which means these families would add $10,000 more to their family's total earnings per year.  Madam Chair, this bill makes good economic sense. Companies are recognizing the benefits and the power of women's increased economic participation, and some have already enacted policies similar to those outlined in the Paycheck Fairness Act. Companies like Staples and Amazon have ended inquiries into job applicants' salary histories to avoid importing prior pay discrimination into their wage setting process. These moves are directly aligned with the Paycheck Fairness Act's provision banning reliance on salary history in determining future pay, so that prior pay discrimination doesn't follow workers from job to job.  We have also seen a movement, spearheaded by investors, to motivate companies to disclose their pay data. After a gender pay shareholder proposal from the investment management firm Arjuna Capital, Citigroup publicly released the results of its pay equity review in 2018 covering a third of its global workforce, and another, more comprehensive review, in 2019. This data release went even further than the Paycheck Fairness Act's provisions, which would only require that companies give this summary information to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), not the public.  According to a 2017 report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, the poverty rate for all working women would be cut in half if women were paid the same as men. The same study indicates the U.S. economy would have produced an additional $512.6 billion in income if women had received equal pay for equal work. With 64 percent of mothers being the primary, sole, or co-breadwinners of their families, equal pay for women means America's families are better off.  Ensuring women have equal pay would have a significant positive impact on our families and our economy and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and Labor, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-8 modified by the amendment printed in part A of House Report 116-19. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:                                 H.R. 7       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers over      the past 50 years.       (2) Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act of 1963,      many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men      for equal work. These pay disparities exist in both the      private and governmental sectors.       (3) In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due      to continued intentional discrimination or the lingering      effects of past discrimination. After controlling for      educational attainment, occupation, industry, union status,      race, ethnicity, and labor force experience roughly 40      percent of the pay gap remains unexplained.       (4) The existence of such pay disparities--       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the      wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;       (B) undermines women's retirement security, which is often      based on earnings while in the workforce;       (C) prevents women from realizing their full economic      potential, particularly in terms of labor force participation      and attachment;       (D) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and      the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the      workers of the several States;       (E) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in      commerce;       (F) constitutes an unfair method of competition in      commerce;       (G) tends to cause labor disputes, as evidenced by the tens      of thousands of charges filed with the Equal Employment      Opportunity Commission against employers between 2010 and      2016;       (H) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods      in commerce; and       (I) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal      protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and      14th Amendments to the Constitution.       (5)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of      discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex      continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair      Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the      Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).       (B) These barriers have resulted, in significant part,      because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not worked as Congress      originally intended. Improvements and modifications to the      law are necessary to ensure that the Act provides effective      protection to those subject to pay discrimination on the      basis of their sex.       (C) Elimination of such barriers would have positive      effects, including--       (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy created      by unfair pay disparities;       (ii) substantially reducing the number of working women      earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence      on public assistance;       (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all family      members to earn a fair rate of pay;       (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination on the      basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are      afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and       (v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress' power      to enforce the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.       (6) The Department of Labor and the Equal Employment      Opportunity Commission carry out functions to help ensure      that women receive equal pay for equal work.       (7) The Department of Labor is responsible for--       (A) collecting and making publicly available information      about women's pay;       (B) ensuring that companies receiving Federal contracts      comply with anti-discrimination affirmative action      requirements of Executive Order 11246 (relating to equal      employment opportunity);       (C) disseminating information about women's rights in the      workplace;       (D) helping women who have been victims of pay      discrimination obtain a remedy; and       (E) investigating and prosecuting systemic gender based pay      discrimination involving government contractors.       (8) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the      primary enforcement agency for claims made under the Equal      Pay Act of 1963, and issues regulations and guidance on      appropriate interpretations of the law.       (9) Vigorous implementation by the Department of Labor and      the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, increased      information as a result of the amendments made by this Act,      wage data, and more effective remedies, will ensure that      women are better able to recognize and enforce their rights.       (10) Certain employers have already made great strides in      eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their      achievements should be recognized.     SEC. 3.

Such defense shall not apply     where the employee demonstrates that an alternative      employment practice exists that would serve the same business      purpose without producing such differential and that the      employer has refused to adopt such alternative practice.       ``(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), employees shall be      deemed to work in the same establishment if the employees      work for the same employer at workplaces located in the same      county or similar political subdivision of a State. The      preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting broader      applications of the term `establishment' consistent with      rules prescribed or guidance issued by the Equal Employment      Opportunity Commission.''.       (b) Nonretaliation Provision.--Section 15 of the Fair Labor      Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 215) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a)--       (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``employee has filed''      and all that follows and inserting ``employee--       ``(A) has made a charge or filed any complaint or      instituted or caused to be instituted any investigation,      proceeding, hearing, or action under or related to this Act,      including an investigation conducted by the employer, or has      testified or is planning to testify or has assisted or      participated in any manner in any such investigation,      proceeding, hearing or action, or has served or is planning      to serve on an industry committee; or       ``(B) has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the wages      of the employee or another employee;'';       (B) in paragraph (5), by striking the period at the end and      inserting ``; or''; and       (C) by adding at the end the following:       ``(6) to require an employee to sign a contract or waiver      that would prohibit the employee from disclosing information      about the employee's wages.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply to instances in      which an employee who has access to the wage information of      other employees as a part of such employee's essential job      functions discloses the wages of such other employees to      individuals who do not otherwise have access to such      information, unless such disclosure is in response to a      complaint or charge or in furtherance of an investigation,      proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d), including      an investigation conducted by the employer. Nothing in this      subsection shall be construed to limit the rights of an      employee provided under any other provision of law.''.
