Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. Studds, has introduced H.R. 622, a bill to implement the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries. This legislation will allow the United States to become a member of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization [NAFO].  Currently, the United States is not an active member in NAFO, even though we were involved in the negotiations which created this organization in 1978. Since this organization is active in recommending how resources that are harvested by U.S. fishermen are being managed and conserved, I support H.R. 622. This legislation will give the administration a more active role in NAFO's management and conservation recommendations, while giving U.S. fishermen greater access to the organization's research.
