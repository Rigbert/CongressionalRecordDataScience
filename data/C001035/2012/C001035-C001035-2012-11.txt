President, last week I came to the floor and was honored to give tributes to some of our departing colleagues. Tonight I am going to take advantage of this time to pay tribute to two other outstanding Senators, colleagues and friends of mine whom I will miss greatly. They are Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Scott Brown.
