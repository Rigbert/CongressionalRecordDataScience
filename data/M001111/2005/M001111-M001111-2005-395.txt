 President, I am pleased today to introduce a bill with Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Clinton that will help our Nation's high school students graduate with the knowledge necessary to succeed in post-secondary education and the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.  Unfortunately too many high school students today are not completing high school at all or with the skills necessary to enter post-secondary education or the workforce. The statistics are staggering. Every day, 3,000 teenagers drop out of high school. This year over 500,000 students will drop out of high school. Overall, less than 70 percent of high school students will graduate and less than 50 percent of high school students of color will graduate.  Of 100 9th graders, less than 70 percent will graduate on time, only 38 percent will directly enter college, only 26 percent will still be enrolled in their sophomore year, and only 18 percent will graduate from college. That number is even lower for minority students. Forty percent of students entering 4-year colleges and nearly 70 percent of students entering community colleges will take remedial classes in reading, writing or math, extending their years in and the cost of college.  Only one-third of the U.S. workforce has any post-secondary education but it is estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st century will require a post-secondary education. Business will spend billions of dollars on remediation for their employees in reading, writing and math.  We can do better and we must do better for our Nation's students, their families, and American business. Currently, high school students are graduating at meager rates and even if they are graduating from high school, they are not leaving high school with the skills and knowledge to enter the workforce or be successful in college. That is why I have written and am introducing the Pathways for All Students to Succeed Act or the PASS Act.  The PASS Act targets high school reform in three key areas: core academics, improving graduation rates, and assistance to low-performing schools to improve student achievement through innovative models. The PASS Act will help improve student achievement in core academics and reduce the need for remediation in college and the workplace through grants for schools to hire literacy and math coaches. Literacy and math coaches bring professional development back into schools and classrooms. Coaches help teachers identify which students are having reading or math problems, how to respond to such problems, and how to integrate literacy and math skills across curricula.  The PASS Act also targets dropouts and low graduation rates through grants for academic counselors and a meaningful graduation rate calculation. Time after time I have talked to students in their senior year who have said, ``I didn't know I needed four years of math to graduate and get into college.'' Part of the problem is that our counselors are completely overwhelmed. The current national average ratio of students to counselors is over 450 to 1. My bill would provide grants to bring that ratio down to 150 to 1. Academic counselors will also work with students and their families to create 6 year graduation and career plans that will help students identify what classes they need to graduate and achieve their post-secondary goals, whether those goals are training or college, and identify support services such as GEAR UP and TRIO that are available to the student.  The PASS Act also provides grants to schools for data collection, and specifically on graduation rates. Currently schools do not have a way to accurately calculate graduation rates. The Department of Education only requires schools to report the graduation rate based on 12th grade data and we all know that is not when students drop out. The PASS Act provides schools with funding to collect, disaggregate, and report accurate graduation rates so that schools can correctly diagnose and address problems facing specific student populations.  And lastly the PASS Act provides additional funding for schools labeled ``in need of improvement'' to implement proven, innovative reforms leading to gains in student achievement. I often talk to principals who tell me they know what they need to do to improve their schools; they just don't have the funds to make the necessary changes. Such reforms include smaller learning communities, adolescent literacy programs, whole school reforms, personalized learning environments, and programs that target transitions between middle and secondary school.  Congress must act now and act boldly to correct the shortfalls in our nation's high schools. We can and must do better. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and addressing the needs of our high school students.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 921       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Pathways for All Students to      Succeed Act''.          TITLE I--READING AND MATHEMATICS SKILLS FOR SUCCESS     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of      1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), as amended by the No Child      Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110, 115 Stat. 1425),      provides a strong framework for helping children in the early      grades, our Nation still needs a comprehensive strategy to      address the literacy problems and learning gaps of students      in middle school and secondary school.       (2) Approximately 60 percent of students in the poorest      communities fail to graduate from secondary school on time,      in large part because of severe reading deficits that      contribute to academic failure.       (3) Forty percent of students attending high minority      enrollment secondary schools enroll in remedial reading      coursework when entering higher education, in an effort to      gain the skills their secondary education failed to provide.       (4) While 33 percent of all low-income students are      enrolled in secondary schools, only 15 percent of the funding      targeted to disadvantaged students goes to secondary schools.       (5) Data from the 1998 National Assessment of Educational      Progress show that 32 percent of boys and 19 percent of girls      in eighth grade cannot read at a basic level. These numbers      do not change significantly in the secondary school years and      are even more dramatic when students are identified by      minority status.       (6) The 2002 National Assessment of Educational Progress      writing scores indicate that while the percentage of fourth      and eighth graders writing at or above a basic level      increased between 1998 and 2002, the percentage of 12th      graders writing at or above a basic level decreased. These      numbers show that our concentrated efforts for elementary      school students have improved their writing skills, but by      neglecting the needs of secondary school students, we are      squandering these gains.       (7) The United States cannot maintain its position as the      world's strongest economy if we continue to ignore the      literacy needs of adolescents in middle school and secondary      school.       (8) The achievement gap between White and Asian students      and Black and Hispanic students remains wide in the area of      mathematics.       (9) The 2003 National Assessment of Education Progress      shows that the achievement gap between the mathematics scores      of eighth grade Black and Hispanic students and White      students is the same in 2003 as in 1990.       (10) The 2003 National Assessment of Education Progress      shows that eighth grade students eligible for a free or      reduced-price school lunch did not meet the basic mathematics      score, unlike non-eligible students.       (11) According to the latest results from international      assessments, 15-year-olds from the United States performed      below the international average in mathematics literacy and      problem-solving, placing 27th out of 39 countries.       (12) Only 13 of the United States workforce has any post-     secondary education, yet 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st      century will require post-secondary education.     SEC. 102.

TITLE II--PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In 2003, approximately 60 percent of students in the      poorest communities failed to graduate from secondary school      on time.       (2) All ninth grade students should have a plan that      assesses the student's instructional needs and outlines the      coursework the student must complete to graduate on time,      properly prepared for college and career.       (3) Research shows that 1 of the most important factors      behind student success in secondary school is a close      connection with at least 1 adult who demonstrates concern for      the student's advancement.       (4) Secondary school counselors can help students receive      the instructional, tutorial, and social supports that      contribute to academic success.       (5) Model programs around the Nation have demonstrated that      effective academic and support plans for students, developed      by counselors serving as academic coaches, in cooperation      with students and parents, result in a higher percentage of      students graduating from secondary school well prepared for      college study.

TITLE III--FOSTERING SUCCESSFUL SECONDARY SCHOOLS     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Personalization of the school environment has been      proven to be an essential factor in helping low-performing      secondary school students succeed.       (2) Effective schools provide ongoing, high-quality      professional development for teachers and administrators to      improve instruction.       (3) Student success is dependent upon alignment of      curriculum, instruction, and assessment.       (4) Successful schools adapt instruction to the unique      interests and talents of each student.       (5) Successful schools have high expectations for all      students and offer a rigorous curriculum for the entire      student body.       (6) Ongoing assessment is the best way to measure how each      student is learning and responding to the teacher's      instructional methods.       (7) Effective secondary schools have access to, and      utilize, data related to student performance prior to, and      following, secondary school enrollment.       (8) Despite significant increases to the program, only      about 7 percent of funding for title I of the Elementary and      Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) goes      to secondary schools.       (9) Every year, 1,300,000 students do not graduate with      their peers, which means every school day, our Nation loses      7,000 students.       (10) Nationally, of 100 ninth-graders, only 68 will      graduate from high school on time, only 38 will directly      enter college, only 26 will still be enrolled for the      sophomore year, and only 18 will end up graduating from      college. The numbers for minority students are even lower.       (11) Even secondary school graduates going on to college      are struggling with basic literacy skills, with 40 percent of      all 4-year college students taking a remedial course and 63      percent of all community college students assigned to at      least 1 remedial course.
