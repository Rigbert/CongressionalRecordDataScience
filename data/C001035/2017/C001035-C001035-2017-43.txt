 There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Penobscot Community Health Care,                                                   August 2, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Penobscot Community      Health Care's General Practice Dental Residency program, a      Teaching Health Center training 3-6 residents a year (with      over 28 residents trained since 2011) and serving 15,000      dental patients in Bangor, Maine, I want to express our      appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop      legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching      Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We      know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with      multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American      Association of Teaching Health Centers, to create the best      possible legislation that will fund     adequately this vital program for at least another three      years and provide for expansion to additional medically      underserved areas of our country.       THCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and      are providing more than a million patient visits in      underserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of      this program is vital in all of the communities they are      located, and preserving this program is critical to the      health of hundreds of thousands around the country. This      investment of federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled      with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that every      dollar is used exclusively for primary care training, all in      community-based settings. Residents trained in community-     based settings are three times more likely than traditionally      trained residents to practice primary care in a community      based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings      remain in communities where they are needed most.       Penobscot Community Health Care appreciates your leadership      on this important issue and is pleased to support your      legislation, which is helping to address the doctor and      dentist shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban      and rural. You have always championed Community Health      Centers, and concurrently Teaching Health Centers,      recognizing the need for accessible, affordable health care      for all no matter if you live in Caribou, Maine or New York      City.       Thank you for your tireless efforts and leadership in the      United States Senate as you strive to preserve and improve      health care for all Americans.           Sincerely,                                             Kenneth Schmidt, MPA,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                 Resurrection Family Medicine,                                      Memphis, TN, August 1, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Resurrection Health      Family Medicine Residency, a Teaching Health Center training      25 residents and providing 15,000 patient visits per year in      Memphis, TN, I write to express our appreciation for your      relentless efforts to develop legislation to continue funding      and expand the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical      Education (THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff      have worked long and hard with multiple stakeholder      organizations, including the American Association of Teaching      Health Centers, to create the best possible legislation that      will fund adequately this vital program for at least another      three years and provide for expansion to additional medically      underserved areas of our country.

Resurrection Health Family Medicine Residency appreciates      your leadership on this important issue and is pleased to      support your legislation, which is helping to address the      doctor shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban      and rural.           Sincerely,                                                Jeremy Crider, MD,     Residency Director.                                  ____                                          The American Congress of                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jon Tester,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: The American Congress of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with more than 58,000      physicians and partners dedicated to advancing women's      health, is pleased to endorse the Training the Next      Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. Your bill      would help improve access for women in rural and underserved      areas to timely, high quality health care by training primary      care physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists.       Today, women living in half of all US counties are in areas      without an ob-gyn, including one of Maine's 16 counties, and      35 of Montana's 56 counties. Furthermore, the ob-gyn      workforce is aging and a large number of ob-gyns are retiring      at a time when the female population is expected to increase      36% by 2050. ACOG projects an ob-gyn shortage of 18% by 2030.       Your bill will help alleviate these workforce challenges by      ensuring the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical      Education (THCGME) program can continue to train ob-gyns and      other primary care physicians in an efficient and effective      manner. Community-based THCGME medical training programs are      critical to filling workforce shortages, as physicians      trained through this program are more likely to practice in      underserved communities. According to the Health Resources      and Services Administration (HRSA), primary care residents      trained in community-based settings are three times more      likely to practice in an underserved community-based setting.      An investment in THCGME to improve access to care in rural      and underserved communities has a long-term impact positive      impact.       Thank you for introducing this legislation to improve      access to high quality care for women. Should you have any      questions or if we can be of assistance in any way, please      contact Mallory Schwarz, ACOG Federal Affairs Manager.           Sincerely,                                      Haywood L. Brown, MD, FACOG,     President.                                  ____                             American Osteopathic Association,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jon Tester,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the American      Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the nearly 130,000      osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students we      represent, thank you for introducing the ``Training the Next      Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.'' This      important bipartisan legislation renews the commitment to the      continued development of the Teaching Health Centers Graduate      Medical Education (THCGME) program to help ensure a robust      primary care workforce in our nation's rural and underserved      communities. We are grateful for your leadership on this      critical issue.       The THCGME program is a vital source of training for      primary care residents to help expand access to care in rural      and underserved communities throughout the country. These      programs, located in 59 teaching health centers in 27 states,      currently train 742 residents in much-needed primary care      fields including family medicine, internal medicine,      pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry,      geriatrics, and dentistry. The majority of these programs are      accredited by the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD)      programs, supporting nearly 800 osteopathic resident      physicians through their training since the program began.      And true to the intent of the THCGME program, residents who      train in these programs are far more likely to practice      primary care and remain in the communities in which they have      trained.       As osteopathic physicians, we are trained in a patient-     centered, hands-on approach to care that focuses on the whole      person, including the physical, mental, and psychosocial      aspects of health. Our training and philosophy includes a      strong emphasis on primary care--in fact, approximately half      of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care      specialties. Given this strong presence in primary care,      osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and      goals of the THCGME program that has proven successful in      helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary      care workforce.       Your legislation provides much-needed stability through      continued funding for the THCGME program, and also creates a      pathway for the expansion of existing centers as well as the      creation of entirely new teaching health centers. We deeply      appreciate your commitment to training the future of the      primary care workforce and thank you for introducing this      important legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to      assist you in securing its enactment into law.           Sincerely,                                                Mark A. Baker, DO,     President.                                  ____                                          Council of Academic                                               Family Medicine,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jon Tester,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the Council      of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including the Society of      Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of Departments of      Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency      Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group, we      thank you for introducing the Training the Next Generation of      Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. This legislation is an      important step to providing sustainable funding and growth      for a critical program that helps address the primary care      physician shortage in our country. We appreciate your      leadership on this issue and give you our whole-hearted      support for the legislation.       To help sustain this important program the proposed      legislation provides suitable funding for current Teaching      Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) programs to      help address the crisis-level shortage of primary care      physicians. The funding level included in the bill will allow      for a per resident amount to be paid for training that is on      par with the Heath Resources and Services Administration      (HRSA) funded study identifying a median cost of      approximately $157 thousand per trainee. Evidence shows     that the THC program graduates are more likely to practice in      rural and medically underserved communities. We are pleased      that the proposed legislation supports ten new THC programs,      with a priority for those serving rural and medically      underserved populations and areas, recognizing the importance      of growing this successful program.       The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), an      advisory body empaneled by Congress, has urged Congress to      continue of the THCGME program stating that ``THCGME programs      deliver excellent value in physician training,'' and that the      program encourages training in ``delivery systems that      emphasize team-based care in Patient Centered Medical Homes      that maximize quality at a moderate cost''; Additionally, the      Institute of Medicine (IOM), [now National Academy of      Medicine] in a 2014 report identified the THCGME program as      helping meet the need for primary care physicians, especially      those who provide care to underserved populations and worthy      of a permanent funding source.       The current authorization for this vital program expires at      the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative action, the      expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the      primary care physician shortage, and a lessening of support      for training in underserved and rural areas. We are grateful      to you both for your exceptional leadership in supporting and      sustaining this vital program by introducing this bill and      helping to shepherd it toward enactment.       The CAFM organizations and our members are pleased to work      with you to secure this legislation's enactment.           Sincerely,     Stephen A Wilson, MD,       President, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.     Valerie Gilchrist, MD,       President, Association of Departments of Family Medicine.     Karen B Mitchell, MD,       President, Association of Family Medicine Residency      Directors.     William Hogg, MD,       President, North American Primary Care Research Group.                                  ____                                            RiverStone Health,                                     Billings, MT, August 2, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Montana Family      Medicine Residency and RiverStone Health Clinic, one of the      nation's original eleven teaching health centers training 24      family medicine residents and serving over 15,000 residents      or Yellowstone and Carbon County, NIT, I want to express our      appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop      legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching      Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We      know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with      multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American      Association of Teaching Health Centers and the National      Association of Community Health Centers, to create the best      possible legislation that will fund adequately this vital      program for at least another three years and provide for      expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our      country.       THCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and      are providing more than a million patient visits in      underserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of      this program is vital in all of the communities they are      located and preserving this program is critical to the health      of hundreds of thousands around the country, particularly      those who lack access to healthcare absent their local      community health center and its providers. This investment of      federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private,      nonfederal resources, guarantees that every dollar is used      exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based      settings.       Residents trained in community-based settings are three      times more likely than traditionally trained residents to      practice primary care in a community based setting ensuring      that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities      where they are needed most. Some 70% of our residency's over      100 graduates practice in MT, a state with widespread      provider shortage areas and multiple counties with no medical      care provider at all.       RiverStone Health and Montana Family Medicine Residency      appreciate your leadership on this important issue and are      pleased to support your legislation, which is helping to      address the doctor shortage that plagues so many communities,      both urban and rural.           Sincerely,                                     John Felton, MPH, MBA, FACHE,                                 President & CEO / Health Officer.                                 ______                                       By
