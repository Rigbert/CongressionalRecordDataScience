Speaker, for the better part of a year University of Maryland basketball fans have been celebrating and enjoying the National Championship won by the Terps in April 2002. This was a wonderful accomplishment for which coach Gary Williams and his players have been widely praised, and they deserve a tremendous amount of respect and credit for bringing, the University its first men's basketball title,  But there is another individual whose contributions to the 2001-02 championship season should not be overlooked--former Maryland coach Charles ``Lefty'' Driesell, who earlier this year retired after 41 years in the coaching ranks. When coach Driesell arrived in College Park for the 1969-70 season, after having turned small Davidson College into a respected Division I basketball program, his stated goal was to make Maryland ``the UCLA of the East.'' And while no university has ever won titles at the rate of John Wooden's Bruins, the fact is that Lefty Driesell established at the University of Maryland one of the nation's elite basketball programs.  Maryland fans now take for granted that the Terps will challenge for the ACC title, receive an invitation to the NCAA tournament, and be among the handful of serious contenders for a trip to the Final Four. But that wasn't always the case.  Consider that during the first 50 seasons of men's basketball at the University, prior to the arrival of Coach Driesell, the Maryland men's basketball team won 53 percent of its games, twice finished the season ranked in the AP poll, and played in the NCAA tournament one time. In the 33 full seasons since Lefty came to Maryland, the Terps have a winning percentage of 65 percent, have been ranked 14 times, and have made a remarkable 19 NCAA tournament appearances.  Because of the level of success that has been achieved and maintained, the University is now able to recruit from among the nation's top high school players. But it is the initial success, or ``turning a program around,'' that is the difficult first step. Coach Williams' two Final Four appearances and National Championship last year were built on the foundation established by Lefty Driesell in the 1970s and 1980s.  Coach Driesell's career numbers are almost too much to comprehend, but a few are worth noting. He retires with 786 wins, behind only Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp and Bob Knight; he compiled 22 career 20-win seasons; he is the only coach to win at least 100 games at four schools, and one of only three coaches to take four schools to the NCAA tournament; he was twice voted ACC coach of the year and won more games during his 17 seasons in College Park than any other Maryland coach.  But Charles Driesell was not just the ``Lefty'' we all came to know and love as the Maryland basketball coach. Joyce Gunter, his wife of more than 50 years, his four children and 8 grandchildren know him as a loving and committed father and husband.  He has also been officially recognized by the NCAA as a hero for his actions the night of July 12, 1973. Driesell was surf fishing with some friends around midnight in Bethany Beach, Delaware when they spotted flames shooting from a nearby townhouse complex. Coach Driesell broke down the door and started getting the people out of the burning buildings, and he is credited with having saved the lives of ten children that evening.  For his actions, Driesel received the NCAA Valor Award in 1974, which is presented to a coach or administrator currently associated with intercollegiate athletics, or to a current or former varsity letter-winner at an NCAA institution who, when confronted with a situation involving personal danger, averted or minimized potential disaster by courageous action or noteworthy bravery. In the nearly 30 years since its creation, the award has only been presented eight times, which speaks to the true heroism of Coach Driesell's actions that night.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Charles ``Lefty'' Driesell on his much-deserved retirement and thank, him for his contributions to the University of Maryland, its fans and the citizens of the great state of Maryland.                          ____________________
