 Speaker, I would like to call your attention to an article printed in the March edition of the Labor Party Press.                [From the Labor Party Press, Mar. 1999]                    Don't Blow Away Social Security                         Social Security Basics       Under Social Security, workers contribute a certain amount      of their pay into the system through their work life. They      then earn entitlement to family benefits when they retire,      become disabled, or die.       Social Security is funded through payroll taxes (FICA, or      Federal Insurance Contribution Act) on both the employee and      employer. Currently each pays 6.2 percent on all wages and      salaries up to a maximum of $68,400 in income. The payroll      taxes we pay today finance the benefits for today's retirees.      From the money we contribute, the government writes Social      Security checks and mails them to beneficiaries.       Any extra money collected through payroll taxes goes into a      Social Security Trust Fund. Until the 1990s, the Social      Security Trust Fund was relatively small. However, it has      ballooned in size in the post decade--and in fact has helped      create the much celebrated ``balanced budget.''       Some 44 million Americans receive benefits from Social      Security. Thirty million of these are the elderly and their      dependents, 6 million are the disabled and their dependents,      and 7 million are the survivors of decreased workers.       About 92 percent of people over 65 receive Social Security      benefits. Since 1935, when the labor movement helped force      passage of Social Security, the program has dramatically      reduced poverty among the elderly and disabled.      Unfortunately, though, some people who really need it--like      farmworkers--still aren't entitled to Social Security.                   What's Good About Social Security       Social Security has dramatically cut poverty among the      elderly and disabled. While about 12 percent of seniors      currently live in poverty, without Social Security, 42      percent would be poor. About two-thirds of the elderly rely      on Social Security to provide over half their retirement      income. Social Security is especially essential since the      U.S. does not require employers to provide pensions.       Social Security is progressive. Those who have been paid      high salaries throughout their lives will get a much smaller      percentage of their salary replaced by Social Security than      those who have worked all their lives in low-wage jobs. An      average wage-earner retiring in 1997 will get back about 44      percent of his or her earnings from Social Security. A high      wage-earner gets back about 25 percent. And a low wage-earner      gets about 80 percent.       Social Security benefits just about everyone. About 92      percent of people over 65 get Social Security. It's a program      that working-class, middle-class, and poor people can all get      behind.       Social Security is efficient. Because it is run entirely by      the federal government, puts all the money into one pool and      invests it in one place. Social Security only spends about      one percent of benefits on administration.                     What Other Countries Do Better       All seven major industrialized countries (Japan, Canada,      United Kingdom, U.S., Germany, France, and Italy) have      systems that are, like ours, pay-as-you-go. Today's workers      support today's retirees.       Italy, Germany, and France spend 12-14 percent of their      gross domestic product to support retirees. The U.S. spends      6.9 percent. Japan, Canada, and the UK pay slightly less than      us.       In the U.S., the average-earning worker can expect to get      42-44 percent of his or her income replaced on retirement. In      Germany, France, and Italy the rate is 50 percent.       In the U.S., Germany, and Japan, retirement age is now 65.      It's lower in France, Italy, and Canada. In the U.K., it's 65      for men and 60 for women. (The U.S. retirement age is slated      to go up to 67 for people born after 1960.)       All the industrialized countries have programs to cover the      healthcare costs of retirees, but American retirees have to      pay more out of their pockets than seniors in the other six      countries. Today, U.S. seniors pay a third of their medical      costs themselves.                What We Should Do About Social Security       The Social Security system is quite sound, and with only      minor modifications, it should stay that way. We don't have      to institute privatization, raise the retirement age, cut      benefits, reformulate the cost-of-living index, or increase      the payroll tax on workers to ``save'' Social Security.       One modest and relatively painless change to Social      Security would wipe out a big chunk of the shortfall that      some are projecting: Eliminate the payroll-tax earning cap.      Currently, the Social Security payroll tax is not paid on      wages in excess of $68,400. Since the ranks of the very rich,      have been growing, this has resulted in something of a drain      on Social Security. In the early 1980s, 90 percent of all      wages fell under the threshold. Now it's 87 percent, and it's      expected to drop to 85 percent. Why not make it 100 percent?       Says economist Dean Baker: ``If you eliminate the cap      altogether, it would wipe out about three-quarters of the      projected Social Security shortfall. The amount that will be      paid out in Social Security benefits won't be that much more      than before, because it's a progressive pay-out structure.      Someone who earned a million or two in their lifetime might      only get an annual Social Security payment of $50,000, say.''       Another proposal the Labor Party has suggested: raise the      payroll tax on employers--but not workers. Workers have seen      a net drain on their incomes for the past couple of decades,      and this would be one way to begin to tip the balance in the      other direction.                               ____________________
