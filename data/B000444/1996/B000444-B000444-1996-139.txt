 President, I rise today to pay tribute to three brothers who are pioneers in Delmarva's flourishing poultry business. Over the past 50 years, Charles C. Allen, Jr.; Warren L. Allen; and John R. ``Jack'' Allen, have built what was once a small, mom and pop family business, into one of our Nation's top poultry companies, Allen Family Foods Inc. Their contributions to the industry and to our State of Delaware are as rich and diverse as the history of the poultry business itself, and I congratulate them on their half-century of dedication and achievement.  Their parents, C. Clarence and Nellie Allen, first got into the poultry business in 1919, incubating about 250 chicks. Things got off to a bit of a shaky start for the Allens. On one occasion Nellie banished Clarence to the garage after one of his chicken incubation experiments nearly burned their house down. But the Allens persisted and 4 years later in 1923, the family expanded the operation by purchasing a 38-acre farm on the outskirts of Seaford, DE. This 100-year-old farmhouse became one of the first commercial chicken houses on the Delmarva peninsula and remains the company's headquarters.  Charles Jr., Warren, and Jack continued the family tradition and expanded this once-modest enterprise vigorously through the years. Today, Allen's Family Foods is a privately held, multimillion dollar, integrated poultry company. Allen's processed chicken is sold in stores from Virginia to Massachusetts. Charles C. handles the farming side of the business; Warren is vice president in charge of finance; and Jack is secretary-treasurer. The elder Allens have in turn brought their three sons: Charles C. Allen III; John R. Allen, Jr.; and Warren L. ``Wren'' Allen Jr., into the business, ensuring that Allen's Family Foods will be operating in Delaware well into the next century.  In addition to this commercial success, the Allen family has made tremendous contributions to their community. Warren Allen served three 2-year terms as the Delaware State Representative for the 38th district, in addition to service as the chairman of the advisory council of the Delaware Home and Hospital for the Chronically Ill in Smyrna, and on the board of trustees of the Delaware State Hospital. Charles Allen was campaign manager for the hospital's expansion fundraising drive. Their generosity also led to the creation of the Allen Little League baseball field at Williams Pond. For their lifetimes of service, the Delmarva Poultry Industry recently honored Charles, Jr., Warren, and Jack as the 1995 distinguished citizens; the first time in history that this award has been shared by three members of one family. I can think of no more deserving individuals and I again extend my congratulations to the Allen family.  The story of Allen's Family Foods encompasses all that is just and good in America: Ingenuity, perseverance, dedication, and compassion for our fellow citizens. Simply put, Delaware is a better place because of the Allen Family. Again, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to my friends Charles, Jr., Warren, and Jack, and wish them many more years of health, happiness, and prosperity.                          ____________________
