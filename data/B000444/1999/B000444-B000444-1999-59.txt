 President, I will respond very briefly and then yield to my friend from North Carolina.  My knowledge of Senate procedure pales in comparison to the Senator from North Carolina. I am not being solicitous. That is a statement of fact. But it is my understanding that the only procedural means by which we could move from this treaty to other business without a vote would be if there were a motion to move from the Executive Calendar to the legislative calendar. That would, as I understand it, require 51 votes. That is the only thing of which I know. I do not know if anyone is going to do that.
