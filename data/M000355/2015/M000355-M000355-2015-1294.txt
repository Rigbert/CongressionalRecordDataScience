 President, I rise to congratulate and pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian, Mr. Charles E. Bullock. Mr. Bullock is a veteran of World War II who enlisted in the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. But Mr. Bullock was a student at the old Hazel Green High School at the time. He missed his senior year because he was stationed in Europe fighting the Nazis. Mr. Bullock had gone from studying history to making it.  More than 70 years after putting on his country's uniform, Mr. Bullock received his high school diploma at long last from the Laurel County Board of Education at a meeting of that organization. This proud veteran and recipient of the Bronze Star received a warm, heartfelt round of applause from the assembled audience twice--once upon receiving his diploma, and again as he left the room.  I want to congratulate Mr. Bullock, 88, on receiving his diploma, and I thank him for his service to our Nation in uniform. This country owes him a debt that can never be truly repaid, for his valiant fight against the Axis Powers during World War II. It is appropriate as we approach Memorial Day that every American reflect on the freedoms we cherish and that Mr. Bullock fought to defend. I know my colleagues join me when I extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Charles E. Bullock in praise of his service.  An article detailing Mr. Bullock's receipt of his high school diploma appeared in the area newspaper the Sentinel-Echo. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:World War II Veteran Receives High School Diploma--Bullock Joined Army                      in Wake of Pearl Harbor Attack                          (By R. Scott Belzer)       Charles E. Bullock, 88, didn't know he would not finish his      senior year of high school at Hazel Green in 1942. He also      didn't know he would have to wait more than 70 years to      receive his high school diploma.       Bullock--a World War II veteran--was honored on Monday at      the bi-weekly meeting of the Laurel County Board of Education      with an official Laurel County high school diploma, 73 years      after enlistment and deployment cut his high school career      short.       ``After the attack on December 7, 1941, many young men      enlisted in the armed services to soldier on behalf of their      country,'' said Dr. Doug Bennett, superintendent of Laurel      County Schools. ``Some of the young men were high school      students aged 17 or 18 who left their high school studies      before graduation in order to enlist. We're pleased to have      one of those young men with us this evening.''       Bennett went on to laud Bullock's choice to leave Hazel      Green High School to fight in World War II, stating that      Bullock chose to be a part of history rather than study it.       ``He was called to fight and protect the freedoms we enjoy      today,'' Bennett said. ``No longer was he reading about      history but became part of making history on the front      lines.''       Bennett said that Bullock represented the best and highest      ideals of Laurel County and was glad to be a part of his      formal recognition.       ``I appreciate what you men have done,'' Bullock said.      ``They took me out my senior year of Hazel Green High School      because I wasn't in my second semester. They took six of us      out of the high school and put us in the army. Three months      later we were fighting in Belgium, France and Germany.''       Bullock said he stayed in the army until the war was over      in 1945. He was awarded a Bronze Star, a medal awarded for      acts of heroism, meritorious achievement or meritorious      service within a combat zone. The medal, unfortunately, was      another thing he had to wait for.       ``I never got it when I came out,'' said Bullock. ``The      dischargers said `You can wait and get your medals, it'll      only take 15 days,' and I said, `I'm going home.' About 70      years later I got so mad about some things going on and went      before Congressman Hal Rogers and he said he'd help me and he      did.''       School board member Joe Schenkenfelder quoted Ronald Reagan      in 1983 to end the presentation.       ``I've been thinking about this all day and I finally found      a quote-so often we don't know why we recognize our veterans      or why we send men and women out to fight for our country,''      said Schenkenfelder. ``I thought this was very fitting:      `Freedom is never more than one generation away from      extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the      bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed down      for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset      years telling our children and our children's children what      it was once like in the United States where men were free.'
