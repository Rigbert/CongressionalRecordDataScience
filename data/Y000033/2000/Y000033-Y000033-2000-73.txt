Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 614, the Indian Tribal Regulatory Reform and Business Development Act. This important bill would establish a 21-member authority within the Federal Government to facilitate the removal of obstacles to business development with respect to the economies of Native American communities.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. We have many, many times where individual Indian tribes try to improve their lot only to find the process for developing an economic base is slowed down by the very government that they are under trust to. So I urge the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
