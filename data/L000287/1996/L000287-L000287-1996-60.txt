Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague yielding. This bill is a bill that funds some 20 Federal programs including the EPA. The Superfund Program is a piece of the EPA. Presently, within this measure is $1.33 billion for the Superfund Program.  If we see a reauthorization bill, and the kind of work that will allow this program to go forward in a positive measure, we would add back the $861 million that is the subject of this discussion.  If the gentleman will continue to yield, I was a bit astonished by the comments of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Markey]. Almost since I have been here in the House, I have sat back in wonderment as the gentleman has been a member of the committee responsible for authorizing Superfund. The Administrator of EPA 1\1/2\ years ago told us this program was broken. I have never seen the gentleman's proposed legislation. I do not see fixes coming out of the committee. I do not see fixes coming from the department.  I hope that the authorizing committee will go forward with the bipartisan effort and support necessary for the program to work.
