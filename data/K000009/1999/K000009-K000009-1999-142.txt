Chairman, I would just like to state for the record that the gentleman clarified something very important that I would like to put on the Record, and that is the industrial fund match in each of these centers: at Mississippi State, an average of $783,458 for the last 5 years; Oregon State University, over $670,000; Michigan State University, $605,000, and the list goes on. We will submit it for the Record.  But the point is there are not only industry matches, there are also State matches. So this is truly a Federal, State, private sector cooperative program, and I thank the gentleman for coming to the floor.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) for his leadership on the floor and for holding this colloquy with me to clarify the Agriculture Research Service funding level for rainbow trout research.  Is it correct that the chairman's amendment offered in subcommittee markup provided that within the funds provided to the Agriculture Research Service the committee recommends an increase of $500,000 for research at the University of Connecticut on developing new aquaculture systems focused on the rainbow trout?
