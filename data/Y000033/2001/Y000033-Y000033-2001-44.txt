I thank the gentleman, because this goes forth to the Senate side, or, I should mention, the other body. God knows what is going to happen on that side.  Again, I say to my good friends, we must fund these projects. For those who have not gone over to the committee room, anybody on this floor listening to this telecast, look at the technology that is available, that is being shown there today. But it takes money to build those machines. We need those machines.  The battle last week or 1-1\1/2\ weeks ago was all over federalization. The battle should be, can we rise to the occasion through technology. I believe we can do that.  Go over and see what is there right now. The reason we have not used it, very frankly, is the FAA has been dragging their feet for the last 10 or 15 years. Under this bill we have passed, I believe the Secretary of Security can demand and issue the permits for the purchase of those pieces of equipment, but we need the money to do it.  I thank the gentleman, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) for a fine defense bill. I think this is a bill to be proud of, regardless of what has been said on the floor. We must get past this bill and move it forward.
