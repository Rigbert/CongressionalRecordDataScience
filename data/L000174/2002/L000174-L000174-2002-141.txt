We will have memorials and other events throughout the State of Vermont today, just as we will in other States.  Many of us had been at the Pentagon earlier this morning, heard the moving statements, and saw the resolve of the men and women who protect this Nation. We heard our President and Secretary of Defense and others.  It is right that throughout the country we have different events to mark this occasion.  I want to especially compliment Judge Sessions for what he is doing in Vermont. If there is anything that speaks to the resiliency of this Nation, the greatness of this Nation, it is welcoming immigrants, saying our borders are not sealed, our borders are open.  We want to welcome people who will continue to make this country great, just as did my paternal great-grandparents and my maternal great-grandparents who came to this country not speaking any English but who sought employment and a new life. My grandfathers were stone cutters in Vermont, immigrant stock. My wife was the first generation of her family to be born here in the United States. It is immigrants who have made this Nation strong.  What Judge Sessions is doing is telling us that our borders and our country and our arms are still open to the mix of people from throughout the world who will continue to give us the diversity we need, just as our Constitution gives us diversity and guarantees that diversity in the first amendment. We now have new Americans who will be here with the same rights and privileges the rest of us have, and the Nation will be a better place for it.  I yield the floor.
