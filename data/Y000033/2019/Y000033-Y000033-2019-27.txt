Chair, we discussed before that this bill was written by the gentleman from California. It only impacts Alaska and impacts it only, and I am the only Congressman. I strongly oppose this legislation.  My amendment, very frankly, was to try to solve one of the problems, the lack of consultation with the people in Kaktovik, the Inuits, and only listen to one side, the Gwich'in.  This amendment says, yes, they will have to consult with the Inuits, and they have to consult with the people of Kaktovik, and it would require them to understand that if they didn't agree with it, very frankly, this would not go forth.  It is a good amendment. If the gentleman says this is culturally real, you have to listen to both sides. You have divided us. This amendment solves that problem.  Adopt this amendment and make this bill a little bit better but not totally good.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
