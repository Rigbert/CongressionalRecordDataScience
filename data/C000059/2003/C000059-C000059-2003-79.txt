Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the city of Corona, CA are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. John O'Doherty is one of these individuals. On January 11, 2003, the Corona Chamber of Commerce hosted an Installation and Awards Banquet in celebration of John's year as president.  John has been an invaluable member of the Corona Chamber of Commerce, having served as Treasurer, 2nd Vice President, 1st Vice President, president Elect and currently, as President. His commitment to involvement has set a benchmark for those who follow him. During the past year, John has presided over Board, Executive and membership meetings as well as attending almost every after-hours activity. He prides himself on being involved beyond his direct duties as President. In addition to this extensive Chamber event involvement, John became a regular at the city council meetings giving a Chamber update to the mayor and council members.  As his tenure as President, John had several noteworthy accomplishments. The Chamber grew in membership from 780 members to over 900. He also encouraged and participated in the growth and expansion of Chamber events such as Good Morning Corona which grew to an average attendance in excess of 100 and quarterly Membership Meeting Luncheons, which hit the all time high this year with over 320 members in attendance. Committee growth was also a legacy of this fine leader and under his tutelage, many Committees were motivated to reach landmark performance goals. The Chamber also reintroduced the Five P.M. Christmas Holiday, expanded the scope of the Business Expo and finely tuned the Ambassadors, who assisted many businesses in grand openings, open houses and ground breaking ceremonies.  Under John's exemplary leadership, the Chamber was a visible participant in the annual Corona Beautiful program, run through the City of Corona's Economic and Redevelopment Department. He also oversaw a very successful Casino Night which raised proceeds that went to scholarships for high school students in the local area. The Chamber also hosted a very successful 13th Annual Corona Night with the Anaheim Angels.  John has set a standard for excellence and commitment that will be difficult to duplicate. John's diligent work as the President of the Corona Chamber of Commerce has contributed unmeasurably to the betterment of the city of Corona. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that all of the members of the Chamber are grateful for his service and salute him as his term comes to an end. I look forward to working with him in the future for the good of our community.                          ____________________
