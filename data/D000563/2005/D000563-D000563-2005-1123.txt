President, this is a very brief and simple amendment. It designates MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, IL, as a port of entry.  MidAmerica Airport is the civilian side of Scott Air Force Base, one of the region's largest employers. MidAmerica and Scott Air Force Base have a successful joint-use plan.  MidAmerica is classified as a foreign trade zone and is a finalist to be classified as an interior transshipment point for international air cargo. The MidAmerica Airport does not currently have international traffic, although a passenger terminal was built to host pre-9/11 Customs activities. International air cargo transport is nonexistent in the region, and it would give MidAmerica a means to enhance the region's economy. This would be beneficial to homeland security and would enhance economic development in the metro East St. Louis region.  Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be set aside.
