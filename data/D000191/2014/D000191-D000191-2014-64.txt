We had the same debate last year. This bill passed and has languished in the Senate and will not go anywhere in the Senate. We had the same the year before, the year before, and the year before.  You can pretend that you care about high oil prices at the same time while protecting the unbelievably obscene profits of the oil industry. You can pretend that the fact that they are sitting on 28.1 million acres of leases offshore that they have yet to develop doesn't exist and they need to lease more acreage.  They basically sit on these leases for years and watch the value of their asset, which is the oil underneath, rise. They have no incentive, actually, to drill in many of these areas because they pay a de minimus--a few bucks an acre kind of lease on an annual basis--and, hey, what a great activity.  Meanwhile, the speculators on Wall Street, according to the head of ExxonMobil--who is a pretty good authority--have jacked up the price because of speculation about 60 cents a gallon at the pump.  So every American should know every time they go to the pump, they can thank speculators on Wall Street, and inaction on the Republican side of the aisle either attempts to delay any minimal regulation or reforms of wild speculation of flash trading in the commodities market.  Instead, they are going to pretend, if we let more leases that the oil companies can sit on, that somehow the price will begin magically to come down, even though all the development in the last few years and the doubling of exports of oil of gasoline and diesel has not brought down the price. It is a so-called world market.  We produce it more cheaply here, but we pay the same price as the most expensively produced North Sea oil, so it is all kind of meaningless.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed.                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 113-493.
