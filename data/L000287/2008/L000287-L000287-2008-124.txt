Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, a uniquely American holiday, I rise today to remind this Congress that we are all one people, one family, one America. We all come from different backgrounds, but in millions of homes across the country, our celebrations look very much the same. We will gather around our dinner tables with family and friends giving thanks. This day is a reminder that we are all together in this American experiment, that we should celebrate our diversity, but also recognize our shared values.  I commend to every family the publication called America's Table: A Thanksgiving Reader. The pamphlet is short and simple, and it is meant to be read at the Thanksgiving meal or as people contemplate the meaning of Thanksgiving. This booklet tells the story of American people by sharing profiles of men and women of diverse backgrounds. I am honored to be one of the people profiled in this year's publication.  The American Jewish Committee began publishing America's Table annually on the Thanksgiving after the 9/11 disaster. They partner with ten human relations organizations, including the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the National Council of La Raza to distribute this wonderful pamphlet.  We all have our stories of how we came to this great land. We must use this opportunity to celebrate our differences and our oneness as Americans. I submit a copy of this year's America's Table for the Record, and I hope and pray that Americans will continue to use it as a way to help build the Beloved Community, a nation at peace with itself.                            America's Table                         A Thanksgiving Reader            celebrating our diverse roots and shared values       You are holding the eighth annual edition of America's      Table.       As in past years, the brief narrative on the white pages is      intended to be read aloud at the Thanksgiving meal. It helps      us express gratitude for living in a nation where each of us,      regardless of background, is entitled to a place at the      table.       The facing pages contain profiles of eight accomplished      Americans. These profiles can be read at the Thanksgiving      meal or whenever you have time. Five of the profiled      individuals arrived in America recently. Another is descended      from slaves. All are deeply engaged in helping America fully      achieve the promise of opportunity and mutual respect.       By reading America's Table on Thanksgiving, we add new      meaning to our most beloved and universal holiday as a time      to celebrate our diverse roots and shared values. In some      homes, a leader designates the parts to be read. At other      gatherings, people simply go around the table, switching      readers at each sentence, paragraph, or page. Do whatever      feels right for you and your family and friends.       And enjoy a warm and peaceful holiday.

They reveal individual lives that represent the story of      our nation.       These are the names of the generations that built America.       They recall our parents and grandparents and mirror      ourselves.       These are the names of the generations that will care for      America.       They remind us why we gather at this Thanksgiving table.

America is heaven for women and children       Hong was eleven when the family arrived in St. Louis, in      1977. Local people were welcoming, she recalls, but the      schools offered no programs for students like Hong who spoke      no English. ``I went to school and slept all day.''       Her immigrant experience and the influence of her parents,      both religious leaders and social reformers, shaped her      career choice. After graduation from the University of      Pennsylvania, Hong returned briefly to Korea, where young      activists inspired her.       Back in the United States, she worked in Washington, D.C.,      for Korean and Asian organizations before moving to New York      to engage at the grassroots level ``on work that flows from      my identity as a Korean-American immigrant.''       As head of the New York Immigration Coalition, Hong now      helps immigrants of all backgrounds cope with what she      describes as a convergence of issues facing new arrivals,      including: poverty, lack of English language skills, and      limited access to government services. These challenges, says      Hong, are compounded by anti-immigrant sentiment.       ``Part of my job is to challenge people that this is not      what this country is about, to tap into people's better      instincts of generosity and justice.''       The insightful questions of our children, innocently asked,      compel us to reconnect with our past.       When our families came to America.       How they got here.       What they found.       Why they came.       At every table the answers are different, but much the      same.       Many of us were immigrants and refugees from all regions of      the world, fleeing the afflictions of poverty and oppression.       Drawn by the promise of a better life, we chose America and      she took us into safe harbor.       Not every journey was easy.       The first arrivals sometimes shunned those who followed.       Not every journey was voluntary.       The first African slaves landed in Jamestown a year before      the Pilgrims settled in Plymouth.       Not every journey was righteous.       Native Americans were devastated by a new nation's need to      conquer, cultivate, and build.       A.G. Lafley knows something about diversity.       On his father's side, Lafley is descended from a French      Canadian man who migrated to New England in the 1850s and      married a Native American woman. A few decades later, his      mother's family arrived in Boston from County Cork, Ireland.       ``My mother was adamant about understanding the world and      people who are different from you,'' says Lafley. ``She was a      card-carrying member of the League of Women Voters. I      remember being dragged around in the '52, '56, and '60      presidential elections in neighborhoods we didn't live in.''       Lafley enrolled as a Ph.D. student in history before a      hitch in the Navy overseeing retail supply shifted his career      goals. After Harvard Business School, he joined Cincinnati-     based Procter & Gamble in 1977, becoming CEO in 2000 and      chairman in 2002.       For Lafley, diversity is a competitive advantage at a      company that employs 138,000 people from 140 nationalities      and ethnicities, and provides household and personal care      products for more than three billion consumers.       Lafley recalls a recent conversation with a young mother      and her family in a modest home on a hillside above Sao      Paulo, Brazil. ``We sit around the kitchen table,'' he says.                       I learn through her story       ``It may take a little longer to work across cultures and      languages,'' says Lafley, ``but we're going to come up with      more ideas and create something that will make a      difference.'' Sometimes the difference is big.       ``We developed a unique and proprietary product that can      render any source of water anyplace in the world potable.''       Jean Nganji ``Are you Hutu or Tutsi?''       The question was raised by a teacher when Jean Nganji was a      seven-year-old schoolboy in Rwanda.       ``Go home and ask your parents,'' the teacher commanded.       The next day, he recalls, ``I said, `I am Tutsi' ''      Nganji's parents then pushed him hard to excel academically.       ``Why?'' he asked.       ``Just listen,'' they said. ``Don't ask questions.''       The answer soon emerged, as Nganji was forced to repeat      grades, despite his competence, because he was Tutsi. When he      realized that a Tutsi admissions quota made it difficult to      attend college in Rwanda, he was accepted at a small school      in Massachusetts with the help of his friend Andre, who had      moved to America.       The two young men became college roommates soon after      Nganji arrived in the United States, in October 1989. But      Andre was Hutu, and a year later, with the outbreak of war,      the friendship ended.       The genocide started on April 6, 1994. On April 15, Nganji      learned that his parents and youngest brother were killed.      The daughter of his eldest brother, who perished, was saved      by her nanny, a Hutu woman who claimed the four-year-old was      her little sister.       Today, Nganji lives near Boston. He tells his story at      schools in America and travels regularly to Rwanda on a      project that helps Tutsi and Hutu youth tell their stories      through film. ``I have found therapy and peace talking to      young people.''      Do not fall into the traps of ignorance, bigotry, and racism                 We are each part of America's journey       We did not leave history behind, like unwanted baggage at      immigration's door.       Our particular pasts and our shared present are wedded in      hyphenated names:       African-American,       Irish-American,       Italian-American,       Korean-American,       Polish-American.       We are not always on a first-name basis with one another.       But we quickly become acquainted in playgrounds and      classrooms, in college dorms and military barracks, and in      offices and factories.       We feel at home.       In some parts of the world, our differences would be      threatening.       We feel enriched.       In America, our differences resonate in our names,      language, food, and music. They inspire art and produce      champions and leaders.       We feel free to disagree.       We are a family, and what is a family gathering without      debate?       Gurpreet Singh Ahuja was completing his residency in New      Delhi, in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated.       Reports that the prime minister was shot by Sikhs set off      reprisals throughout India. ``As a physician in the hospital,      I saw the charred bodies of those young men and women.''       The violence contradicted his experience growing up. ``As a      Sikh, we're reminded to respect all faiths. They're all paths      to the same central truth.''       He and his wife, Jasjit Singh, also a doctor, moved to New      York, in 1986, where they continued their medical training      before moving to Washington, D.C., and then to Southern      California. They visited family in India annually.       ``Every time I stepped foot back on American soil it would      give me a great sense of exhilaration and liberation.''       That feeling was tested in the aftermath of 9/11 and the      rash of hate crimes that began with the murder of a Sikh      living in Arizona. The events evoked memories of 1984. Says      Ahuja,              I never lost faith in the system in America       He helped establish the California Sikh Council to promote      tolerance and educate     people about the Sikh faith, and now serves as president of      the council. Jasjit Singh is vice president of the Central      Orange County Interfaith Council.       ``As a relatively recent immigrant, I am very appreciative      of the opportunities that this country has given me,'' says      Ahuja. ``Our value system must remain steadfast. That's what      distinguishes us from most any other country in the world.''       Nina Totenberg ``Ninotchka, we're proud of you.''       Nina Totenberg still cherishes her father's words. She had      just endured a period of intense scrutiny after her reporting      led to testimony by law professor Anita Hill, during the      confirmation hearing of Justice Clarence Thomas.       Her father, Roman Totenberg, a world-renowned violinist,      performed across Europe by age eleven. A Polish Jew, he left      Europe in 1935. ``He saw the rise of Hitler,'' says his      daughter, ``but he came to America because it represented a      kind of equality and meritocracy that did not exist in      Europe.''       Nina Totenberg's mother, Melanie, shared her interest in      American politics. ``I remember my mother watching the Army-     McCarthy hearings on TV all day every day, explaining to me      what was going on,'' says Totenberg. ``I knew who all those      senators were and I was eight years old.''       At 16, reading The Making of the President, the classic      book about the 1960 election, Totenberg confirmed her      childhood desire to be a witness to history. ``I wanted to be      a reporter from the time I realized that I couldn't be Nancy      Drew.''       For the past three decades, Totenberg has reported for      National Public Radio and is best known for her coverage of      the Supreme Court. ``There are a lot of injustices in the      world and in this country,'' she says. ``The ones that I can      do something about--I will try to do something about.'' She      credits her father, who still teaches at age 97.      You can't get my dad to do something he thinks is not right       We believe in fairness.       In America, the loudest voice does not always have the last      word, and every voice has a right to be heard.       We act with hope.       Not because life is perfect, but because we are free to      face life, and all its imperfections, on our own terms.       We rely on faith.       In a sturdy and tested framework of law and government that      works because of the confidence we place in it and in each      other.         We are each responsible for keeping America on course       ``Are we there yet?'' the children ask.       We know the answer.       We pursue justice.       But still have a way to go.       We celebrate freedom.       But endlessly debate what it means to be free.       Our table is brimming.       But not everyone receives a fair portion.       John Lewis Growing up in a large family on a small farm in      rural Alabama, John Lewis cared for the chickens.       When his parents wanted to sell or trade chickens, or have      one for dinner, ``I would protest,'' Lewis recalls. ``They      were creatures of God, and we didn't have a right to abuse      them.''       Lewis was fifteen in 1955, when Emmett Till, a black      teenager, was brutally murdered in Mississippi, Rosa Parks      refused to move to the back of the bus, and Martin Luther      King, Jr., organized the Montgomery bus boycott. Listening to      King on the radio, ``It was like he was saying, `John Lewis,      you can do it,                   You, too, can make a contribution       Lewis went to Nashville, to study nonviolence and become a      minister. He participated in sit-in demonstrations, Freedom      Rides, and the creation of a campus group called the Student      Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.       ``Even when I was being beaten, I saw these individuals      almost like the chickens,'' he says. ``They were innocent      creatures and something happened to them.''       As chairman of SNCC, at 23, Lewis stood with King and other      civil rights leaders on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial      during the March on Washington in August 1963, preaching,      ``Wake up, America.'' He has exerted leadership in Congress      since 1986, representing the district around Atlanta. ``We've      made progress,'' says Lewis. ``The world is so different from      the world I grew up in.''       Still pursuing his vision of a ``beloved community,'' Lewis      asserts, ``We need to turn toward each other to create a      greater sense of community and belonging.''       Tasneem Shamim. In the late 1990s, at about age 40, Tasneem      Shamim began to feel spiritually empty.       She missed a sense of compassion and universality, which      she remembered from her childhood in India and could not find      in the mosques in New Jersey, where Shamim, a doctor, lives      with her husband and three children.       ``One of my early memories is going with my grandmother to      the small villages. My grandmother started organizations to      help women out of poverty and oppression.''       To help reconnect with her feelings, Shamim visited the      holy sites in Mecca and Medina, and she decided to cover her      hair. Her mother and sister were concerned about potential      antagonism, and one friend asked, ``Do you have to go to      chemotherapy?''       For Shamim, the head scarf is an opportunity to prompt and      answer questions about Islam. Most important, it makes her      more conscious of her roles in life.       ``You become a doctor mostly to please God. God says, `You      cannot help Me, but help the creatures that I have created.'      ''       Shamim also began studying Sufism, a spiritual strand of      Islam. At the urging of a Sufi leader that she express her      religion in good works, Shamim established the Muslim Women's      Coalition, a national organization devoted to community      service and mutual respect.                 People accept that America is a quilt       Progress can be slow as we propose and protest, argue and      advocate.       But we are grateful to be part of this vigorous democracy.       We enjoy its unparalleled privileges and accept its      obligations:       To pursue our dreams while helping others.       To advance our convictions while respecting others.       To prepare our children for the gift of the American      journey.                          ____________________
