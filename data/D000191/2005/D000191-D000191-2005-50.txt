  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many years of service of House Parliamentarian Muftiah McCartin, who completes her excellent work in this body later this week. Ms. McCartin joined the Parliamentarian's Office in 1976, and has served during the tenure of six Speakers and six Presidents. In 1991, she became the first woman to be appointed a Parliamentarian.  The minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, is someone who understands the importance of breaking glass ceilings. She had hoped to be here personally to congratulate Muftiah on her outstanding work and her dedication over the many years.  She goes on to say Muftiah always had such a wonderful smile and warm demeanor on the House floor, which I might comment often lacks smiles and warm demeanors. Well, it is warm; sometimes heated. As we know, it can get heated in debate and very partisan, but she has always been a calm and rational presence to Members on both sides of the aisle and their staff who seek parliamentary advice. She brought a keen mind and a clear understanding of House rules that have served this institution very well.  In addition to the long, grueling hours she has spent on the House floor, she has managed to raise four wonderful children: Marissa, Elaine, Sandra, and Luke, one of whom has the great, good sense to have moved to my congressional district. That is my district, not Ms. Pelosi's. I am sure she will welcome spending the extra time with her family and her husband, Terry.  Muftiah, today we thank you for your service to this great institution and wish you the very best. You have been a tremendous asset to the work we do every day, and we will miss you. Thank you again for your many years of commitment toward making the House of Representatives a better place.
