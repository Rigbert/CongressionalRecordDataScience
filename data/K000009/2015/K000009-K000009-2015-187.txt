Speaker, we cannot thank our public servants enough for the job that they do for this country day in and day out. The Federal Government simply cannot function properly without good leaders who are committed to the world and security of our Nation.  BG Dennis Doyle distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious service and superb achievements to the Office of the Surgeon General and the United States Army from 1 November 2005 to 1 November 2015 while serving in a succession of several high positions of great importance. His outstanding leadership, passionate pursuit of excellence, and tireless efforts greatly contributed to the overall readiness of the Army, the transformation of Army Medicine to a System for Health and the delivery of high quality health care to our Armed Forces. During his tenure as Commander of the 10th Combat Support Hospital (CSH) in Fort Carson, Colorado, BG Doyle was hand selected to also command the 43rd Area Support Group (Rear) while the 4th Infantry Division deployed. He superbly commanded both organizations ensuring the Group sustained a high level of readiness in support of Fort Carson tenant units. He proved a staunch supporter to the installation, community, and all post operations supporting deployed Fort Carson units in combat. While deployed with the 10th CSH, BG Doyle delivered world class combat health care for nearly 40,000 patients, which included 4,000 admissions and over 8,500 operating room procedures with many of these involving the most difficult combat trauma cases in the world. His success in this tremendously challenging mission was recognized as magnificent not only by his chain of command but also by the U.S. Ambassador, the Commander of Multinational Forces-Iraq, the Commander of Multinational Coalition-Iraq, the Iraqi Prime Minister, and many U.S. and Iraqi government officials. BG Doyle served as the Deputy Commander for Administration at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). During that time, Walter Reed was the largest military treatment facility in the Department of Defense and flagship for Army Medicine and Home of Warrior Care. During his tenure, BG Doyle's results-oriented approach ensured the command's success in every facet of customer service, operations, personnel readiness, and adequacy of human and monetary capital. He oversaw the establishment of a one stop welcome center to ease the logistical burden for our Warfighters and their Family Members. His keen administrative acumen and innovative problem solving were the driving force in over $24M in facility renovations, $4M in housekeeping service enhancements, improved logistics customer response times, and the establishment of a 24/7 operations cell.  Following Walter Reed, BG Doyle was centrally selected to command the 30th Medical Command (MEDCOM) in Germany. Despite assuming command just nine days before deploying to Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan, BG Doyle expertly led his team to quickly assume its critical role as the first Theater Medical Command for Afghanistan, Task Force 30th MEDCOM. Combat seasoned, creative, articulate, technically and tactically proficient, and solution oriented, BG Doyle consistently provided sound, balanced operational advice as the medical Task Force Commander and USFOR-A Surgeon. His joint service command assessed the USFOR-A medical infrastructure and organization and took action to ensure the finest care was provided for all U.S., Coalition, and Afghan forces by a deliberate redistribution of scarce medical resources. He directed a comprehensive analysis of health service support for Regional Command West expansion efforts resulting in the development of force request that met the regional commander's need. BG Doyle led a joint team that provided unmatched combat health service support across the Combined Joint Operations Area--Afghanistan and delivered the highest war time survival rates up to that point in the conflict. A strategic thinker, BG Doyle also forged solid international relations with ISAF medical partners and host Nation assets to ensure unity of effect and effort for all medical assets in the area of responsibility. After Europe, the Surgeon General hand selected BG Doyle to command the William Beaumont Medical Center (WBAMC) in Fort Bliss, Texas. During this period, he also served as the Deputy Commanding General (DCG)--Readiness for Western Regional Medical Command (WRMC) and Chief of the Medical Service Corps. BG Doyle quickly transformed the William Beaumont culture to fully support the Fort Bliss transition from a TRADOC installation to the Army's largest and busiest FORSCOM power projection platform. He exploited partnering with the Veterans' Affairs for a mutually efficient use of limited resources resulting in the award of the largest Fiscal Year 12 VA/DOD Joint Incentive Fund project valued at over $5M. His team also opened a new WTB campus, established a collocated Integrated Disability Evaluation System site, and launched Embedded Behavioral Health, and Child and Family Assistance Centers. The Surgeon General recognized BG Doyle as a transformational leader and once again hand picked him to command the Pacific Regional Medical Command knowing that he possessed all the skill sets required to direct and influence the right Army Medicine capabilities in support of the Army's and DoD's rebalancing strategy. He was also designated as Commanding General, Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Army Pacific Surgeon, Chief, Medical Service Corps, and Manager for the Hawaii enhanced Multi-Service Market (eMSM). His overall performance and contributions were nothing short of stellar.  Balancing five hats, he effective established connections, and strengthened and influenced strategic partnerships with PACOM countries including Korea, Japan, Philippines and Thailand. His PRMC team provided unmatched support to USARPAC and USPACOM interests in the Asia-Pacific. His strategic leadership inspired trust in the health system throughout the Pacific achieving consistent patient satisfaction rates of over 85 percent. In addition, PRMC's Integrative Pain Management Center ranked as the best in the Army because of the close clinical collaboration with multiple disciplines and an emphasis on weaning Soldiers off their pain medication drugs. PRMC was recognized as one of the most productive Regional Medical Commands exceeding patient safety standards and quality measures as well as leading the way in an external accreditation survey and Risk Management oversight spanning the entire PACOM area of responsibility with facilities in Korea, Japan, and Hawaii. The Surgeon General personally selected BG Doyle to serve as her Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7 based on unequalled operational experience, strategic acumen and proven leadership. His transformative excellence was deemed an imperative during a period of significant cultural and organizational transformation. Upon assuming his role, BG Doyle was immediately faced with operationalizing The Surgeon General's transformation from a healthcare system to a System for Health. He infused irreversible momentum in promoting the Performance Triad, the primary mechanism to influence readiness and health by targeting Sleep, Activity and Nutrition behaviors for Soldiers, Family members and all 3.9 million beneficiaries. In the Total Army Force concept, BG Doyle has also been instrumental in driving toward COMPO 2 and implementation with full support from the Chief of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard. The nuances of implementation in the Reserve Components have been fully explored to ensure that this is executable for our Citizen Soldiers. Furthermore, BG Doyle's operational perspective was instrumental in ensuring the direct correlation of Army Medicine command structures with supported Army Corps and ASCC commanders. The decisions currently being enacted represent the largest organizational changes in the past few decades and will ensure that MEDCOM is a balanced, agile and streamlined organization postured to support Army Force 2025 and Beyondconcepts. In parallel with the command's deliberate, strategic initiatives, BG Doyle served as the single mission command focal point synchronizing and integrating TSG/CG, MEDCOM command guidance for the command despite geographic dispersion across five continents and supporting roles to COCOMs and ASCCs. This superb operational coordination/synchronization was accomplished through the Army's largest Direct Reporting Unit, a complex, integrated Army-wide health service system. BG Doyle's bold, transformational leadership was the driving force for the brilliant translation of command intent and communication throughout the staff and major subordinate commands and was affected in an extremely dynamic environment immediately following OTSG/MEDCOM OneStaff reorganization. His passionate desire to lead the preeminent healthcare force in the world: the best led, trained and equipped for without peer, has raised the collective skill level and efforts of the entire headquarters. As a result of tireless, direct engagement on the part of BG Doyle, the command now functions with superior efficiency in establishing core or functional crisis action teams and integrated process action teams to respond to a wide array of complex problem sets. All of Army Medicine's System for Health efforts are grounded in the imperative to optimize performance. Every provider to patient interaction will be viewed through the lens of improving the development, performance, resilience and accelerated rehabilitation of the Professional Soldier Athlete. Through his efforts BG Doyle has established the MEDCOM G-3/5/7 function as the preeminent staff element of its kind in support of the Army's largest direct reporting unit. He has ensured the success of the MEDCOM through the essential task of synchronizing the efforts of the command and communicating the mission, vision and intent of the commander. His impact on this command and the Army is immeasurable. BG Doyle represents the very best of Army and Nation.  Brigadier General Doyle's distinctive accomplishments reflect the highest credit upon himself and the Department of Defense.''                          ____________________
