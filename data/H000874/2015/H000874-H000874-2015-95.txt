Hoyer, you are wrong.  Apparently, there is nobody on the floor who is going to suggest that the will of this House, as represented by a majority that would vote on this bill, would not be for extending the Export-Import Bank, saving American jobs, making sure that America is competitive in the international markets.  My colleagues, reject this rule. Exercise our responsibility to the American people and to American workers, and let's pass the Export-Import Bank today before we go home.
