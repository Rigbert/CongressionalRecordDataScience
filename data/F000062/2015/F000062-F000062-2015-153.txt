 President, as the Democratic sponsor of this amendment, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for his leadership on this issue. The fact is, this amendment is essentially the same as the House stand-alone bill that passed unanimously.  Members, it is a fact that approximately 76 percent of sex trafficking of underage girls takes place on the Internet--76 percent.  We know at least 19 Web sites that post ads for commercial sex acts with children. They are paid for so doing.  The amendment essentially does two things. It adds the word ``advertises'' as one of the sex trafficking offense verbs. Second, it clarifies that only the ``knowing'' intent and not the ``reckless disregard of the fact'' intent applies to the new offense.  We have checked with the Department of Justice. We believe it meets constitutional standards. We believe it is necessary and is long overdue. I urge an ``aye'' vote of all Members.
