 President, I am glad that the bipartisan Senate border supplemental has passed with an overwhelming vote. I commend Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and the members of the Appropriations Committee for breaking the logjam.                                S. 1790  Mr. President, on the NDAA, the Democratic leader and I have had extensive discussions on the path forward on the Defense bill. For the information of all of our colleagues, we intend to stay in session this week to finish the NDAA bill and allow for a vote in relation to the Udall amendment. Senators should plan to vote on Friday on the Udall amendment. Yet the vote--here is the good news--will start first thing in the morning and be held open into the afternoon to accommodate as many Senators as possible.  To be clear, obviously, I believe that the Udall amendment can and should be defeated--I hope with a resounding vote in the Senate--and that we should put this issue to rest before we break for the Fourth of July recess. Holding up the Defense authorization bill is not an acceptable outcome.
