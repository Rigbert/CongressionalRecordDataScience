President, today I wish to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway in northern Maine. This 92-mile stretch of lake, shore, and river is a shining example of the dedication of the people of Maine to protect and preserve the natural beauty and heritage that define our great State.  For thousands of years, the Allagash was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Wabanaki, and the river's northerly flow provided an important transportation link between the Maine coast and the Saint John River. The Waterway's Native American heritage is found in such appellations as Umsaskis Lake and Musquacook Stream. In 1857, Henry David Thoreau explored the upper reaches of the Allagash during his third trip to the Maine woods and learned from his Penobscot guide that the river's name referred to the useful bark that could be harvested from the vast forests along its banks.  In the years that followed, the Allagash became a vital part of Maine's timber industry. While hiking through the region's remote wilderness, it is possible to come upon abandoned steam locomotives deep among the trees, remnants of the vast lumbering operations of the early 20th century. As the Allagash, rich with fish and game, became a favorite destination of outdoor enthusiasts from around the world, the surrounding woodlands have remained very much a part of Maine's working forest economy.  In 1966, the people of Maine recognized the special qualities of the Allagash and voted to protect it by approving a $1.5 million bond to ``develop the maximum wilderness character'' of the river, and the Maine Legislature established the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. Two years later, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie authored an amendment to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 that combined permanent Federal protection with permanent State administration. In 1970, the Allagash Wilderness Waterway was granted Federal designation as a wild river and became the first State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic River System.  The Allagash Wilderness Waterway captures the essence of the great north woods. This 50th anniversary is the time to celebrate the commitment to safeguard for generations to come this special place that captures the essence of the people of Maine.                          ____________________
