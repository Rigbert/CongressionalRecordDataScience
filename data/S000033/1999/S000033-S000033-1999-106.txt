 It is a very radical concept. Is the gentleman suggesting that somebody who works by the sweat of their brow for 50, 60, 70 hours a week trying to make $25,000, $35,000, or $40,000 a year to maintain their family at a level of dignity and decency, that those people should be paying less in taxes than people who make millions of dollars investing in the stock market?  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, I was not even taking it that far, but that is an interesting point.
