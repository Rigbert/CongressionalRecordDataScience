Mr. Speaker, yesterday Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann was the keynote speaker at the 14th annual National Catholic Prayer Breakfast here in Washington, D.C.  Archbishop Naumann's incisive remarks were extraordinarily inspiring, hope filled, uplifting, yet challenging. Like a modern-day Jeremiah, he spoke truth to the nation. After detailing some of the ``threats to the well-being of our nation,'' Archbishop Naumann said ``However, the most serious crisis for our country is none of the above, but rather a God-crisis--a crisis of Faith. . . .  He said, ``We have no permanent enemies, but only confused brothers and sisters who have yet to encounter the Lord of Life and to experience His unconditional love and amazing grace. . . . It is our task to reclaim our culture one mind, one heart, one soul at a time.''  I respectfully ask my colleagues in both the House and Senate and on both sides of the aisle to take a few minutes to read the Archbishop's remarkable words.                   National Catholic Prayer Breakfast                     Washington, D.C., May 24, 2018                           I. Acknowledgments       It is a great honor to be with you this morning and to      address this distinguished gathering. As we assemble as a      people of Faith to pray for our nation, we must first give      thanks for our many blessings. We enjoy religious liberty,      freedom of speech and expression, the right to assemble--to      name only a few of the freedoms for which our Founders fought      and subsequent generations sacrificed heroically to preserve.      Despite our economic challenges, middle class Americans enjoy      creature comforts that were unavailable to kings of earlier      ages. For all this and so much more, we must give thanks to      God from whom all blessings flow.       At the same time, there are certainly many challenges      facing our nation. Within the past week we had another deadly      school shooting. There are several tense international      situations, e.g. the Holy Land, Iran, Syria and Korea. Many      Christians throughout the world experience brutal religious      persecution. Racial tensions remain high in many cities. One      third of American children are being raised in homes without      their biological fathers. The legal status of more than a      million young people who were brought to this country as      children remains in limbo. In Massachusetts, Illinois and the      District of Columbia Catholic Charities is no longer able to      place children for adoption. Our nation continues to give      legal protection to doctors and organizations that profit      from the killing of more than one million innocent unborn      children. There are efforts in the courts and some states      legislatures to coerce Catholic Hospitals to perform      abortions.       Unfortunately, this is by no means an exhaustive list of      the serious threats to the well-being of our nation. However,      the most serious crisis for our country is none of the above,      but rather a God-crisis--a crisis of Faith.                            II. Is God Dead?       Is God Dead? This was the title cover story for the April      8, 1966 edition of Time Magazine, when I was a junior in High      School and Time was the most influential periodical in the      United States. The 1966 article began with these words:       ``Is God dead? It is a question that tantalizes, both      believers, who perhaps secretly fear that he is, and      atheists, who possibly suspect the answer is No.       ``Is God dead? The three words represent a summons to      reflect on the meaning of existence. No longer is the      question the taunting jest of skeptics for whom unbelief is      the test of wisdom and for whom Nietzsche is the prophet who      gave the right answer a century ago. . . .''       At the time, the subject was considered shocking and      provocative. I was reminded of this article while reading the      2017 book, The Benedict Option, by Rod Dreher who makes the      case that we need a new St. Benedict to form vibrant      Christian communities to preserve the truth of the Gospels      during a new Dark Age of unbelief.       Dreher notes the decline in church attendance, the large      number of Millennials who profess atheism or even more      commonly     identify themselves as spiritual, but not religious. This      non-religious spiritualism is a new paganism, where God is      not the God of revelation who makes Himself known to us, but      a god or gods that are fashioned in our own image to re-     enforce our own desires. Dreher gives his assessment of the      status of Faith in America: ``. . . God may not be quite      dead, but he is in hospice care and confined to bed.''                         III. A Crisis of Faith       Our culture is indeed experiencing a crisis of Faith that      leads to a denial of truth. Once the relationship between man      and God is severed, man becomes just a highly developed      organism. Human life becomes just another thing in a world of      things. Materialism reigns and breeds utilitarianism--our      value is determined by our usefulness. We no longer possess      inalienable rights that are God-given and from which no human      being can deprive us.       The pursuit of pleasure becomes the highest goal. This      hedonism is a futile seeking of greater and more intense      pleasures that in the end leave us more and more empty.      Suffering and death become the great enemies that we strive      futilely to eliminate or at least impede       It is this loss of a sense of God that also leaves us      vulnerable to lose sight of the innate value of each and      every human being. We consider those who are profoundly      disabled as more vegetable than human. We experience their      care as a burden rather than an opportunity for the      expression of the noblest form of love.       We begin to see human life at its earliest stages as      something too tiny to have rights, but something very useful      to destroy in order to exploit its components in the hope of      healing or restoring youth to those already born. This loss      of a sense of God also leaves us helpless to find meaning in      suffering. Suffering becomes the other real evil and thus to      be avoided at all costs. If it is impossible or perhaps      difficult to eliminate the suffering, then it becomes      acceptable to eliminate the one suffering.              IV. The Essence: An Encounter with a Person       Pope Emeritus Benedict, in his writings and speeches      reflecting on the essence of what it means to be Catholic      declared it is not our dogma and doctrine. Obviously, it is      not that he thought these to be unimportant, after all he had      been the Prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the      Faith--he was the architect of the Catechism of the Catholic      Church. Yet, important as they are, they are not the essence      of Catholicism. Similarly Pope Benedict maintained that      living an ethical life is not the heart of what it means to      be Catholic. Again, he was not claiming this is      insignificant, but it is the fruit of our Faith, not its      essence.       Pope Benedict asserts the essence of Catholicism is an      encounter with the person of Jesus Christ. Without that      personal encounter, our dogma and doctrine makes no sense.      Without this encounter we will not have the capacity to      persevere in living a virtuous life.                      V. Jesus, the Man Who Lives       Malcolm Muggeridge--the late BBC television personality,      while an agnostic, filmed a documentary on Mother Teresa of      Calcutta entitled Something Beautiful for God. Muggeridge      made Mother Theresa a household name in the English speaking      world. Muggeridge's experience of Mother Theresa's selfless      love changed the trajectory of his life.       The BBC subsequently assigned Muggeridge to do a      documentary on Jesus. In Bethlehem at the Church of the      Nativity while observing the prayerfulness of Christian      pilgrims venerating the spot commemorated as the birth place      of Jesus, Muggeridge was inspired to name his documentary--     Jesus, the Man Who Lives. Muggeridge realized Jesus was not      just another historical figure, but he was still alive and      animating the lives of his disciples like Mother Teresa and      millions of other saints canonized and uncanonized for the      past 2,000 years.       It is this same Jesus we encounter every time we open our      hearts to His presence in prayer. It is this Jesus, the Lord      of Lords and King of Kings, who conquered death and is alive,      whom we receive in the Eucharist.       It is this Jesus who transformed Peter from the coward of      Good Friday to the martyr in Rome, who changed Paul from a      persecutor of His disciples to the greatest Christian      missionary, who inspired Francis of Assisi to abandon a      frivolous life of comfort and through simplicity and poverty      to awaken the world to the Gospel. It is this same Jesus who      motivated Thomas More to resign as Chancellor of England and      die a Martyr's death rather than betray his conscience, who      emboldened the North American Martyrs to make the perilous      crossing of the Atlantic to evangelize Native Americans well      aware that they would meet violent deaths, who led St. Damien      to provide pastoral care for the lepers of Molokai knowing      the probability that eventually he would succumb to the      dreaded disease, and who gave Blessed Stanley Rother, a farm      boy from Oklahoma the courage to stay with his flock in      Guatemala despite being a target of the death squads. This is      to name only a tiny fraction of some of the more well-known      disciples who found abundant and eternal life in losing their      lives following Jesus, the Man Who Lives.                   VI. A God Who Died but Is Not Dead       The Original Sin was the decision by our first parents to      push God out of their garden in order to become their own      gods. This is the archetype of every sin. God's response to      humanity's rebellion is mercy. God does not abandon us to      dwell in the darkness created by our rejection of His love.      Instead, God comes to rescue us just as he saved Israel from      the slavery of Egypt. Sin masquerades as freedom but in      reality enslaves us to disordered cravings. Jesus came to      liberate us from the bondage of sin and to vanquish death      destroying its power to rob life of its meaning and render it      absurd.       The method of this rescue was not to use His almighty power      to force us into submission to His will, but it was through      His incarnation to become one with us in all things but sin.      Like a special operations soldier dropped behind enemy lines,      Jesus entered fully into our humanity, enduring unspeakable      suffering because of our sin.       Jesus defeats humanity's twin enemies, sin and death, by      walking through death to eternal life. We believe in a God      who died but is far from dead. The triumphant, risen Lord is      still animating the lives of those who open their hearts to      encounter His love. Thus for the Christian, we are never      without hope.       In recent years, I have been drawn to read the memoirs of      former atheists who have become Catholic. Two of my favorites      in this genre are Jennifer Fulwiler's Something Other Than      God and Sally Read's Night's Bright Darkness. Both of their      conversions illustrate, if we just open a crack in our      hearts, God's amazing grace will come rushing in.                       VII. A New Great Awakening       In our prayer this morning, let us pray for a religious      revival in our nation, another great awakening. For those of      us who have encountered the Risen Jesus we have a      responsibility to bring His love and mercy to others,      especially as Pope Francis so often reminds us to those on      the peripheries. We are called to be Missionary Disciples,      communicating the love of Jesus to others and bringing others      to encounter the Risen Lord.       We have no permanent enemies, but only confused brothers      and sisters who have yet to encounter the Lord of Life and to      experience His unconditional love and amazing grace. We are      called to renew our nation, not primarily by enacting laws,      but by announcing the Joy and Hope of the Gospel of Jesus to      individuals in desperate need of its good news. It is our      task to reclaim our culture one mind, one heart, one soul at      a time.                          ____________________
