Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his comments. I hope to work with the ranking member and of course the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the subcommittee, to see if we cannot get these monies somehow into this program. It is a good program.  Again, though, I think it should be coming from the general fund and not necessarily from the funds that were set aside for the improvements of these airports.                             Point of Order
