Madam Speaker, as we consider the agriculture relief package today, I urge my colleagues to support the increase of funding for Urban forestry. In my district, the city of Atlanta, loses 50 acres of green space each day. The city, once known as the city of trees, is in danger of becoming the city of asphalt, strip malls and sprawl. Urban forestry helps to correct this problem.  Madam Speaker, this is an important issue. It is about more than just a few trees and parks. We need to open green space in our cities so that families can come together and watch the wonder of nature. We need open green spaces in our communities so that young people can belt 3-2 pitches over the fence. We need open green space in our neighborhood so that our seniors can sit and talk about the days gone by.  Madam Speaker, we need urban forestry.                          ____________________
