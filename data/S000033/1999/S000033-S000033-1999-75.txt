 Chairman, I think we both recognize that the problem that we have is we do not have enough money to do all of the things that we would like to do. The gentleman is not hearing me argue against SPR. We are arguing priorities.  The gentleman will not deny that there were no hearings on this important issue. And I know that the gentleman cannot tell us with certainty, because it is not the case, that all 50 States are prepared to put in their 25 percent. And the gentleman cannot tell us, I know he cannot because nobody can, that there are not perhaps a number of States who for a variety of reasons will not participate and that a lot of low-income people will be hurt as a result.
