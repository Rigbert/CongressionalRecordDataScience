Speaker, reclaiming my time, I presume, am I correct, that the gentleman's effort would be to try to pass it prior to the expiration of the last temporary extension, or would the gentleman anticipate another, which I guess would be the tenth or the eleventh extension; or does the gentleman think he can perhaps get it through prior to Wednesday night?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Everyone is working as hard as they can. As the gentleman knows, this bill has taken a long time to work out the differences between the House and the Senate. We get very close every time we reach the deadline of an expiration date.  The expiration date is set on Wednesday. Everybody is going to be working over the weekend, and we are working as hard as we can with the goal to bring that conference report to the floor before the expiration of the short-term funding measure.
