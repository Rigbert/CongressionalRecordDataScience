Speaker, I rise today to honor the inspiring career of Dr. Charlotte Groff, of Berrien Springs, Michigan. A dedicated and selfless individual, Charlotte has enthusiastically educated students of St. Joseph and Coloma schools over the past 50 years.  Since 1954, Charlotte's contributions to our community have been tremendous. Over this time she has played a role in the development and success of countless students, and watched as these students grew into pillars of the communities of southwest Michigan and beyond.  Throughout her vast career, Charlotte has held many teaching positions and has taught in diverse teaching capacities--all with great distinction. Charlotte has taught every summer in the Coloma migrant program since its inception in 1968--except for the 2 years she worked on a doctoral degree. Also, since 1975 she has been a reading specialist for children from disadvantaged homes.  As Charlotte retires this summer, she closes one chapter of her inspiring and remarkable legacy of educating our youth. I am confident that this retirement is far from being the end to Charlotte's teaching. The numerous lives that will be educated and touched by Charlotte will no doubt continue for many years to come. The passion that she has for teaching is everlasting and I wish her all the best in retirement. Charlotte will be truly missed in Coloma Community School and throughout southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
