President, today I introduce the School Improvement through Teacher Quality Act of 2007, to foster the development of a highly skilled and effective teacher workforce capable of improving student achievement in this country.  We are slated to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act this Congress for the first time since 2001. The key to this reauthorization will be ensuring that states, districts, and schools are given the resources, tools, and support to improve student learning, including targeted, high-quality efforts to improve a school when it is identified as in need of improvement under the law.  Improving teacher quality is the single most effective step we can take to increase student achievement and turnaround failing schools. Studies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the difference in student test scores can be attributed to teacher quality. Unfortunately, new teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, face such challenging working conditions that nearly half leave the profession within their first 5 years, one-third leave within their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end of their first year.  However, research has shown that offering new teachers comprehensive, multi-year mentoring and guidance cuts attrition rates in half, and helps these teachers become high-quality professionals who improve student achievement. At the same time, we know that experienced teachers also need effective, sustained professional development to maintain and improve their teaching skills.  For these reasons, I am introducing the School Improvement through Teacher Quality Act of 2007, cosponsored by Senators Murray, Obama, and Brown. This legislation amends Title II of the No Child Left Behind Act to create a new $500 million formula-based program for school districts to provide targeted assistance so teachers in low-performing, high-poverty schools get comprehensive, high-quality multi-year guidance and mentoring for new teachers and systematic, sustained professional development for experienced teachers.  First, this legislation would direct funding to districts with failing schools to help implement a high-quality induction program for teachers throughout at least their first two years of full-time teaching. This intensive support for beginning teachers would incorporate proven strategies such as: rigorous mentor selection; ongoing mentoring with school-protected release time; research-based professional development for mentors and school leaders; and research-based teaching practices, formative assessments, and teacher portfolios. Research has demonstrated that such mentoring for beginning teachers at institutions like the New Teacher Center at University of California, Santa Cruz provides a return on investment, $1.66 for every $1spent; increases the new teacher retention rate, to 88 percent after 6 years in some California districts; and strengthens beginning teacher effectiveness to such an extent that their students demonstrate learning gains similar to those students of their more veteran counterparts.  Second, the School Improvement through Teacher Quality Act of 2007 would offer funding for struggling schools to provide their veteran teachers with ongoing professional development and training, including helping such schools develop and implement rigorous curricula aligned to State standards and student needs; design and evaluate assessments; implement strategies to improve student achievement and teacher effectiveness; train teachers, principals, and administrators in effective coaching strategies, analyzing school and student data, and strategies for teaching students with disabilities and English Language Learners; and utilize teacher leaders, coaches, or content experts to support learning and model effective collaboration skills.  This assistance would be tied to a modified definition of professional development based on successful nationwide models such as the National Staff Development Council, with an increased focus on collaboration among teachers, including engaging established teams of teachers to plan and develop instruction across grade level and content area and to evaluate and analyze data on student achievement and learning goals. This professional development would occur multiple times per week during the regular work day, and be supported by school principals through school-based coaches, mentors, or lead teachers who allocate time, resources, and structured facilitation to the learning teams or cohorts.  Lastly, this legislation requires that an external evaluation be conducted of the mentoring and professional development programs authorized and supported under this act. Outcomes would be based on measures such as teacher retention, student learning gains, teacher instructional practice, and parent, family, and community involvement.  We must act on this bill and continue to push for increased Federal investment in improving schools through enhanced teacher quality and professional development. The stakes are too high, not just in terms of meeting the current highly qualified requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, but to take the next step and ensure that each and every classroom in America is taught by an effective teacher. Teachers are the key to student success and student success will in turn keep our country competitive in today's global economy.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its inclusion in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1979       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. REFERENCES.       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this      Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an      amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the      reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Teacher quality is the single most important factor      influencing student learning and achievement.       (2) Studies have found that 40 to 90 percent of the      difference in student test scores can be attributed to      teacher quality.       (3) New teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools,      face such challenging working conditions that nearly half      leave the profession within their first 5 years, \1/3\ leave      within their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end      of their first year.       (4) The rate of attrition is roughly 50 percent higher in      poor schools than in wealthier ones.       (5) A report by the Alliance for Excellent Education      estimated that the cost of replacing public school teachers      who have dropped out of the profession is $2,600,000,000 per      year.       (6) Comprehensive induction cuts attrition rates in half,      and helps to develop novice teachers into high-quality      professionals who improve student achievement.       (7) Research has demonstrated that comprehensive, multi-     year induction--such as that provided by the New Teacher      Center at University of California, Santa Cruz--provides a      return on investment ($1.66 for every $1 spent); increases      the new teacher retention rate (to 88 percent after 6 years      in some California districts); and strengthens beginning      teacher effectiveness to such an extent that their students      demonstrate learning gains similar to those students of their      more veteran counterparts.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to build      capacity and grow effective teachers and principals in our      Nation's schools through--       (1) comprehensive, high-quality, rigorous multi-year      induction and mentoring programs for beginning teachers; and       (2) systematic, sustained, coherent team-based, job-     embedded professional development for experienced teachers.
