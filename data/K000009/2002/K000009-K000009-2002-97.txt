Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly recognize the life's work of one of Toledo, Ohio's most notable citizens, Robert Maxwell, who is retiring from his career after 38 years. Truly, Robert Maxwell is a ``Golden Guy.''  Bob moved through the ranks of the Lathrop Company, over which he began a tenure as President in 1986. That tenure saw outstanding growth as he developed the Lathrop Company into a premier construction company in our region.  Even as he built the company, Bob fulfilled a deep sense of commitment to the community, involving himself in many concerns including 911 services, Toledo Public Schools' Partners In Education, the Toledo Area Chamber of Commerce, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to name but a few.  Although Bob is well known as an excellent businessman and community oriented philanthropist, his true passion is his family. Always, his wife and children are first in his mind and heart and his pride in his family is evident. He will surely receive many accolades upon his retirement, as he has throughout his career, both from his peers and the organizations he supports, but none are so important as his family and his place in it. In fact, he will tell you that his family means everything to him. Thus, though he leaves a storied career, it is to his family that he retires.  The writer David Lawrence once wrote, ``My soul knows that I am part of the human race, my soul is an organic part of the great human race, as my spirit is part of my nation. In my very own self, I am part of my family.'' Perhaps unconsciously, Bob Maxwell lived out this thought. Professionally and civically, he addresses his responsibility and his place in the family of man. Personally, he carries forth as a family man. Now as he leaves the working world, we wish Bob all the best in his retirement. May he spend his days doing all that he enjoys with those he loves.                          ____________________
