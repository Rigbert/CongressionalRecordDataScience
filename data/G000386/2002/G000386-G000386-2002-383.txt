 President, during consideration of the Defense appropriations bill on Friday, December 7, my distinguished colleagues, the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, and Senator Harkin, a member of that subcommittee as well as the chairman of the Agriculture committee, engaged in a colloquy regarding the George Washington University's, proposed Project Alpha. I support this unique effort to deal with potential terrorist threats to the U.S. food supply. I have been working with GWU since May on this project. In July, Iowa State University joined the consortium at my request. I want to point out that support for this very worthwhile program and requests for its expeditious implementation come from both sides of the aisle. I am glad that Iowa State University can contribute its expertise in this area as a major partner in this effort and that the National Animal Disease Center will also be a key player.  An important component of the Project Alpha formula is its ``National Decision Assessment Immersion Center,'' to be located in existing facilities at the Virginia Campus of the George Washington University and to serve as a model for replication by those wishing to pursue individual variations of this new approach to complexity management in national security.  As was pointed out in the December 7 colloquy, Project Alpha is a proactive approach to terrorist threats to U.S. national security, a concept initiated and developed long before the tragic events of 9-11. It utilize advanced technology in complexity-analysis techniques designed to help us both predict and prevent or ameliorate critical situations before they can become real-world disasters. Project Alpha combines sophisticated information-gathering and data-mining methodologies with high-performance data analysis, professional-level subject and issue expertise, decision support systems of proven efficacy, and state-of-the-art technology for communication and information dissemination.  Project Alpha offers the opportunity for exploration of the broadest range of threat possibilities, available options and their effects and ultimate consequences, especially those that would normally remain unforeseen and unpredicted. The program will allow rapid exploration of a massive range of relationships and interactions that are beyond the ability of our liner-reductions minds alone to follow or foresee. Project Alpha provides a mechanism for complexity consequence-projection of far greater scope, magnitude and immediacy than has ever before been available. The crucial element that makes this possible is the rapidly expanding supercomputing technology that has not yet been harnessed for this purpose. Through its use, Project Alpha can facilitate direct encounters with the unexpected and the unintended in order that potential terrorist events may be anticipated and rendered preventable, manageable and unsurprising. The purpose of Project Alpha is to help use learn more what we don't know in ways that we might never imagine, so that real-life catastrophes can be avoided. Protecting the U.S. food supply is high on the list of national security priorities, and the application of Project Alpha to this critical need can be of significant public benefit in dealing with the threat of agroterrorism now and in the future.                          ____________________
