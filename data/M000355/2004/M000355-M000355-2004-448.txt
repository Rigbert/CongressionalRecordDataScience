  Earlier today we were able to lock in a final list of first-degree amendments to the bill. While this will help Senators Warner and Levin begin working on a schedule for the consideration of amendments, I was disappointed the list included, unfortunately, 200 possible amendments. I encourage Senators on both sides of the aisle to show restraint in offering amendments. Nothing requires all 200 of those amendments, in fact, be offered. With everyone's cooperation, we should be able to finish this bill this week.  With that being said, the chairman and ranking member will be here tomorrow working through those amendments. We do expect rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow in relation to these amendments and Senators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.
