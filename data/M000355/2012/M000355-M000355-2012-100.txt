 President, today I rise in memory of Janie Catron of Corbin, KY. Elaine and I mourn the passing of our dear friend Janie, who served as my field representative in eastern Kentucky for many years when I was first elected to the Senate. She was a great friend and she will be missed. Elaine and I send our condolences to Janie's family and to all those who knew her.  Born on July 2, 1940, in Eubank, KY, to Jesse and Pauline Griffin, Janie was a registered nurse by trade. She was ordained in the Sacred Order of Deacons with the Episcopal Diocese of Lexington and began serving as Chaplain of St. Agnes House. She also was my eastern Kentucky field representative for 10 years.  Always interested in politics, Janie was active her whole life in civic service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In 1977, she was named the Fifth District governor of the Kentucky Federation of Empowered Women. She, besides aiding me in eastern Kentucky, was active in the State central committee and even became secretary of the committee. In recognition of her dedication to Kentucky and the Republican Party, in 1995, she was inducted into the Fifth District Lincoln Hall of Fame, which honors Kentuckians who have committed to promoting the values of the Republican Party.  Yet, Janie's legacy is greater than her career and political recognitions. As a pastor, she will be remembered as a woman who aided those around her and helped improve their lives. As a mother, she will be remembered as a selfless woman who always loved her children. As a friend, I will forever admire how hard she worked for the people she loved and the causes in which she believed.  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in extending condolences to Janie Catron's children, family, and friends. The Times Tribune, a publication from Whitley County, KY, published an obituary that highlighted Janie's life achievements. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       [From the Times Tribune, July 10, 2012]                              Janie Catron       Reverend Janie G.

Janie was born on July 2, 1940, in Eubank, daughter of the      late Jesse and Pauline Griffin. She was a member of the      Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Lexington. Janie was      ordained in the Sacred Order of Deacons with The Episcopal      Diocese of Lexington, where she served as a chaplain of St.      Agnes House. She was very devout to her calling and held a      particular interest in pastoral care. She was selfless and      giving in her actions, words, and deeds, and genuinely      enjoyed helping to improve the lives of those around her. A      registered nurse by profession, she also enjoyed Kentucky      politics and worked for 10 years as the eastern Kentucky      field representative for U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
