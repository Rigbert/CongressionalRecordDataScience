Mr. Speaker, the Helsinki Commission mourns the recent death of its esteemed Director of International Policy, Ambassador Samuel G. Wise, Jr. He faithfully served his country through years in the Marine Corps, the U.S. Foreign Service, and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I am privileged to have worked alongside him during his many years with the Commission, as he offered sage advice, well-reasoned insight and guidance based on years of experience in the diplomatic community. His appointment as Ambassador when he was Deputy Head of the U.S. Delegation to the 1986-89 Vienna Review Meeting was well deserved.  Typical of Ambassador Wise's commitment to the work of the Helsinki Commission and the best national interests of the United States, he most recently served on the U.S. Delegation to the Vienna Review Conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe held last November. He attended and offered timely and indispensable advice in drafting the Declaration of the OSCE Lisbon Summit held in early December. Ambassador Wise's participation in these international meetings were tireless and his contributions, highlighting the fundamental importance of human rights throughout the work of the OSCE, were significant and lasting.  The numerous letters of condolences which have been received at the Helsinki Commission are indicative of the impact Ambassador Wise has had on the OSCE community. From diplomats, to human rights activists, to friends and colleagues, the effect of this one life has been eloquently chronicled. Some reminisced about their ``fond memories of his personality, professional expertise and intellectual brightness.'' Others recognized his dedication ``to promote the goals of the United States and of the Commission, as stated in the Helsinki Accords and in other documents issued subsequently.'' One noted that ``compassionate and engaged, Sam was the consummate Helsinki expert whose objectivity and capacity to get it right were unrivaled. Highly regarded by the entire OSCE community, his loss is irreplaceable.'' Respected as ``a man of integrity and honored convictions'' and remembered as a ``warm and compassionate human being,'' Ambassador Wise has admirers virtually around the globe.  Both as a Commissioner and, most recently, as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I sought and appreciated very much the counsel which Sam provided. The combination ofSam's gentle spirit and his winsome manner proved effective in his dealings with Members of Congress and staff, as well as the Department of State and the diplomatic community. His insights, experience, sound advice and friendship will be sorely missed. My prayers are with his family as they grieve the loss of their husband and father.                          ____________________
