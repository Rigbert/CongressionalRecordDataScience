 President, the administration needs to fulfill its commitment to the region. If Congress can help, so much the better. But we must be very careful not to go too far.  The Chief of the Forest Service told me last week he is well on his way to providing promised timber sales levels. But he lacks the human resources to do so. My amendment transfers money from road construction programs to need personnel to get these sales out. It does not simply waive the rules.  When Judge Dwyer approved option 9, he did so with conditions. He expects full funding for implementation, and he expects monitoring and assessment for compliance with the standards and guidelines.  Mr. President, I am concerned that if we do not heed his advice, Judge Dwyer will rule option 9 invalid and once again forbid all harvesting in the Northwest. Our communities simply cannot afford that blow.  My amendment provides needed financial resources. Additionally, it says that if the agencies follow the rules set forth in option 9, anyone challenging a timber sale will have to cross a very high legal hurdle to prove that a timber sale is environmentally harmful.  Let me say one final word about option 9. If people have a problem with option 9, they have a problem with the laws: National Environmental Policy Act, and National Forest Management Act. If we are going to revisit the merits of option 9, we should instead take a broad look at the laws governing it. We should not take short cuts in a rescissions bill without the benefit of hearings and public involvement.                              section 318  Finally, my amendment directs the Forest Service to find replacement volume for sales old under fiscal year 1990 appropriations bill, dubbed section 318, that are tied up because they may contain the threatened marbled murrelet. The companies who bought these sales years ago deserve what we promised them: timber. My amendment delivers that.  Mr. President, two of the provisions of this bill have only regional effects. The primary provision--salvage of damaged Federal lands--is national in scope and affects the health of forests [[Page S4874]] throughout this Nation. We must not give the agencies free rein to cut timber without regard to environmental considerations.  My amendment is a moderate, reasonable alternative. It expedites salvage. It expedites option 9. It ensures appropriate levels of environmental protection. And most importantly, it protects communities and workers from burdensome, frustrating litigation. Such litigation is sure to result from the underlying bill.  Mr. President, 10 days ago I went to Gray's Harbor in my home State of Washington, and I talked to people who have lived through the nightmare of Congress and the courts deciding their lives. They are just starting to get back on their feet. Hope is beginning to return. They do not want more empty promises. They do not need congressional interference that may backfire. They do need promises kept, and they do need Congress to act with common sense.  That is what my amendment does, and I urge my friends here in the Senate to support it.  Mr. President, I retain the balance of my time.
