As you and Senator Kennedy have pointed out so accurately, the maximum award has not been raised, contrary to the President's promise. In addition, the $3.7 billion shortfall exists today. We have taken a step on our side to remedy the shortfall, but it is unclear what the other side and the conferees will do. So that is another detriment to the Pell Grant Program.  But I will ask a final question of the Senator. The President's budget not only inadequately funds the Pell Grant Program, but it eliminates the LEAP Program--Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships--a collaboration between the State and Federal governments to provide need-based grants to low-income students.  The President's budget also zeroes out funds for the Perkins Loan Capital Contributions, which provides low-interest loans to millions of low-income college students.  Additionally, the President's budget fails to increase funding for the campus-based programs, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study, as well as the early awareness programs, TRIO and GEAR UP.  I again inquire whether the Senator is aware that in addition to the blows that have been taken to the Pell Grant Program, so many other Federal programs that aid particularly low-income Americans are not being adequately funded. I think that goes directly to your point, I say to the Senator, that 200,000 young Americans with talent, ambition, and drive are unable to go to college because we are not providing the resources.
