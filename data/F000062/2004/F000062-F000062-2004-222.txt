 I sincerely hope that Chinese and Tibetan leaders will take this opportunity to work together in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue to overcome differences that have plagued relations between China and Tibet for too long.  After the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949-1950, China and the Tibet Government signed the ``Seventeen Points Agreement'' to make Tibet an autonomous region in the People's Republic of China and grant the Tibetan people the right of autonomy in determining the shape of their religious, cultural, and social institutions.  Nevertheless, in the ensuing years the Chinese Government did not fulfill its commitments, leading to the 1959 Lhasa Uprising and the flight of the Dalai Lama. Forty-five years later, tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees have been forced to flee their homeland in the face of repeated oppression and human rights abuses and those that remain are still unable to practice their religion freely and preserve their cultural autonomy.  Despite this tragedy, the Dalai Lama has consistently stated that his goal is not independence for Tibet but rather cultural and religious autonomy for the Tibetan people and negotiations within the framework enunciated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979.  Last year, in his speech to commemorate the Lhasa Rebellion, the Dalai Lama said:       As far back as the early seventies in consultation with      senior Tibetan officials I made a decision to seek a solution      to the Tibetan problem through a ``Middle Way Approach.''      This framework does not call for independence and separation      of Tibet. At the same time, it provides genuine autonomy for      the six million men and women who consider themselves      Tibetans, to preserve their distinctive identity, to promote      their religious     and cultural heritage that is based on a centuries-old      philosophy which is a benefit even in the 21st century, and      to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau.      This approach will contribute to the overall stability and      unity of the People's Republic of China.  I have worked on behalf of Tibet and the Tibetan people for over 20 years and I have done everything in my power to bring China and Tibet together to settle their differences peacefully at the negotiating table. I have personally carried messages from the Dalai Lama to China on these issues and there is no doubt in my mind that he is fully prepared to negotiate with China to achieve a just and lasting peace for the Tibetan people.  It is disappointing that another year has gone by and more progress has not been achieved in settling these issues. The road ahead of us is long but we must persevere to ensure that the Tibetan people will one day achieve the freedom and autonomy to shape their own society. It is my sincere hope that China will cooperate with the Dalai Lama in resolving their differences on Tibet.                          ____________________
