Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013.  As our servicemembers return home from war, it is incumbent on all of us and all Americans to ensure that they are receiving the support and opportunities they need to succeed in civilian life. This bill establishes the Economic Opportunity Administration, which would focus its efforts entirely on veteran education, employment, small business, and housing. The bill also contains the text of legislation I introduced earlier this year along with my colleague from California, Representative Takano, which is vital to my and his congressional districts.  For community college districts that have multiple colleges as part of the district, the Department of Veterans Affairs requires each campus to certify that their veteran students are enrolled for a specific number of classes before the VA will disburse student benefits. Under current regulations, each of the colleges in the district must write letters to other colleges within the district to verify their classes and meet regulations. For the Riverside Community College District in Riverside, California, this unnecessary paperwork delays benefits to veterans and increases processing times and the costs to college districts as well as the VA.  This bill, which was wrapped into H.R. 2481, corrects that problem by permitting each college in the district to verify and certify veterans for all classes attended within the district rather than just for classes attended at that particular college. H.R. 331 would update the rules, which would mean veterans would receive their benefits sooner, and the VA would have less paperwork to process.  I would like to thank subcommittee Chairman Flores and his staff, Ranking Member Takano, full committee Chairman Miller, and full committee Ranking Member Michaud for their efforts to support our veterans, and specifically for the Veterans Economic Opportunity Act.
