 I ask unanimous consent that the material of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Coalition, Health, the National Association of Attorneys General and others, who objected to this provision be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Federal Trade Commission,                                        Department of Justice,                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The Federal Trade Commission and the      Department of Justice (the ``Agencies'') are writing in      response to your letters of October 26, 1995, requesting the      Agencies' comments on two antitrust provisions in H.R. 2425,      the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995. The Administration      supports the increased availability of provider networks to      promote competition and expand competitive choices for      consumers. Further, the Administration believes that      legislative reforms, which include appropriate consumer      protection safeguards, are necessary to achieve this goal.      The Federal Trade Commission has taken no position on aspects      of Medicare reform other than the comments in this letter on      the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425.       However, the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425--one a      broad exemption for medical self-regulatory entities and the      other a relaxation of antitrust rules for provider service      networks--are unnecessary and could seriously undermine the      cost containment goals of Medicare reform efforts. Moreover,      these provisions would deprive all consumers--not only      Medicare beneficiaries--of the benefits of competition in      health care markets. The Agencies urge that Congress not      enact these provisions.        antitrust exemption for medical self-regulatory entities       Section 15221 of H.R. 2425, ``Exemptions from Antitrust      Laws for Certain Activities of Medical Self-Regulatory      Entities,'' would create a special antitrust exemption for      medical groups' setting or enforcing of ``standards'' that      are ``designed to promote quality of health care services.''      If enacted, it would provide broad antitrust immunity for      anticompetitive activities that purport to improve the      quality of care, but in fact raise health care costs and      deprive consumers of choices in the marketplace, by      anticompetitively excluding other economic participants from      health care markets.       Antitrust enforcement actions have stopped physicians,      acting through medical societies and hospital medical staffs      under the guise of quality concerns, from engaging in      boycotts, price fixing, and other conduct harmful to      consumers. These enforcement actions have been instrumental      in enabling competitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-     service medicine to enter health care markets in the face of      provider opposition. For example, the Agencies enforcement      actions have challenged: medical societies' standards that      banned procompetitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-     service medicine--including physicians' employment by HMOs      and affiliation with non-physicians; hospital medical staff      boycotts, coercion of hospitals, and abuse of the      credentialling process, to block the development of      innovative forms of health care delivery, such as health      maintenance organizations; and medical societies' boycotts of      insurers to force them to pay higher fees to the societies'      members.       The unfortunate fact is that self-regulatory bodies      sometimes act to obstruct competition, and when they do so      their actions are often couched in quality-of-care terms.      This kind of conduct is not a thing of the past. Continued      antitrust enforcement against such anticompetitive activities      is essential if competitive forces are to play a role in      containing health care costs.       Encouraging industry self-regulation that is aimed at      improving quality is a laudable goal, but legitimate self-     regulatory activity is already permitted under current      antitrust law. The Federal Trade Commission and the      Department of Justice have not brought suits against such      legitimate conduct. In fact, they have repeatedly spread the      message that such conduct is lawful.       The Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.R.      2425 indicates that the exemption for medical self-regulation      is intended to address concerns about private lawsuits      challenging peer review. The Report states that the Health      Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101,      which eliminated private damage actions for good faith peer      review that is undertaken with certain procedural safeguards,      has been beneficial, but that antitrust suits have continued.      Even if some unjustified suits continue to be brought,      concerns about possible imperfections in that statute's      limitations on private damage actions would not justify H.R.      2425's broad exemption from all antitrust enforcement,      particularly including actions by the government.       The potential harm from the broadly worded exemption is not      significantly limited by Section 15221(b)(2)'s exclusion from      immunity where conduct is undertaken ``for purposes      of financial gain.'' As noted above, quality of care is      typically offered as a justification for anticompetitive      conduct by health care providers, sometimes based on the      sincere--but erroneous--belief that competition is      inappropriate in the health care industry. Moreover,      making the availability of immunity turn on defendants'      intent, rather than on the objective market consequences      of the challenged behavior, offers no real protection for      consumers. The absence of a motive for personal financial      gain does not lessen the injury to consumers that occurs      when competitors engage in conduct that is unreasonably      anticompetitive.       The Congressional Budget Office concluded that this      provision would increase federal spending, rather than      promote the cost containment goals of H.R. 2425. And the      impact would not be limited to the Medicare program. Granting      private medical organizations the power to adopt and enforce      standards without the check against abuses that antitrust law      provides is likely to stifle innovation, unnecessarily limit      consumer choice, and frustrate health care cost containment      efforts.       special antitrust treatment for provider service networks       Section 15021 of Subtitle A of H.R. 2425, ``Special      Antitrust Rule for Provider Service Networks,'' would exempt      certain groups of health care providers from the per se rule      against price-fixing that applies throughout the rest of the      economy. This provision is not necessary for the development      of the provider-sponsored entities that the Medicare reform      bills seek to encourage. It could, however, both undercut      H.R. 2425's reliance on competition to provide more cost-     effective services to Medicare beneficiaries, and impair non-     Medicare competition as well.       Like the Senate Medicare bill, H.R. 2425 would permit      certain provider organizations to contract directly with the      Medicare program to provide all covered services in return      for a monthly capitation payment. These organizations are      called ``provider service networks'' in the Senate bill and      ``provider-sponsored organizations'' (PSOs) in H.R. 2425.      ``Provider service networks'' (PSNs) under H.R. 2425 are      groups of providers that may contract with a PSO--in essence      as subcontractors--to provide services to Medicare      beneficiaries.       Section 15021(a) provides that the conduct of a PSN or its      members in fixing prices would be evaluated only under the      ``rule of reason'' antitrust analysis, rather than under the      ``per se'' rule usually applicable to price fixing by      competitors. Legitimate provider joint ventures already      receive ``rule of reason'' treatment, for example, where      their members share substantial financial risk. This is      because risk-sharing among members of such a group gives each      member the incentive to assure that the group as a whole      provides services in a cost-effective manner, achieving      efficiencies and cost-savings that competition is intended to      secure. Under Section 15021(a), however, members of a PSN who      do not share any financial risk, and thus do not have those      same incentives for cost-savings, would be able to set fees      collectively for services provided through a PSO without      regard to the usual ``per se'' rule against price fixing.       No special antitrust rule is necessary to allow providers      to form groups or networks, develop fee schedules for      participating providers, or set up providers panels, so long      as the providers share financial risk. In fact,      risk-sharing among providers in a group appears integral to the      purposes of the legislation: PSOs and other entities offering      Medicare products are required to assume full financial risk      for the provision of all covered services, in exchange for a      predetermined capitation payment. Under existing antitrust      law, such groups already receive rule of reason treatment,      and any other provider group that similarly shares financial      risks would receive the same antitrust treatment. H.R. 2425      would allow PSNs that do not involve risk-sharing to qualify      for special antitrust treatment by meeting certain criteria.      However, none of these criteria is a substitute for the      incentives created by substantial financial risk-sharing.       The goal of promoting more cost-effective delivery of      Medicare services would not be furthered by allowing groups      of competing providers in a PSN to agree on the prices they      would demand from the PSO for treating patients under a      Medicare PSO contract, bargain collectively with the PSO, and      threaten a boycott if the PSO did not accept the providers'      terms. In such a case, even though the anticompetitive effect      of the conduct is clear and no countervailing efficiencies      are produced, the bill would require the antitrust agencies      to conduct a resource-intensive analysis of the market under      the rule of reason. Given the constraints on federal      antitrust enforcement resources, this can only mean that some      plainly anticompetitive activities will go unprosecuted.       The impact of the exemption could also extend beyond PSOs      to all managed care organizations operating in a particular      market. By allowing competing providers to agree on prices in      the context of bargaining to provide services to a Medicare      PSO, the exemption could have the unintended effect of      dampening competition among those same providers for non-PSO      business. Providers who agree on prices to be demanded of      PSOs may implicitly agree to adhere to similar demands when      dealing with other plans. Even absent bad intentions, once      competing providers have met to negotiate their fees for PSO      business, the information they have exchanged and the      understandings they have reached would likely spill over into      their dealings not only with other MedicarePlus      organizations, but also with the various organizations that      provide health care benefits to non-Medicare patients.       In sum, the antitrust provision in H.R. 2425 would harm      consumers and would run counter to the cost-reduction goals      of Medicare reform efforts.       The Department of Justice has be advised by the Office of      Management and Budget that there is no objection to the      submission of this letter from the standpoint of the      Administration's program.           Sincerely,     Anne K. Bingaman,       Assistant Attorney General.       By direction of the Commission.     Robert Pitofsky,       Chairman.                                                                    ____                                               September 26, 1995.     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Finance     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are a coalition of physician group      practices, non-physician providers, employers, managed care      networks and insurers who are opposed to including special      antitrust preferences for physicians as part of Medicare      reform legislation.       Physicians are not alone in feeling the pressure of      increased competition. All of us doing business in the health      care market are facing increased competition. Yet, we do not      believe that competitive pressures warrant special antitrust      preferences for physicians or any other provider. Such      preferences are unnecessary and harmful to competition and      consumer choice in the marketplace. If the goal is to apply      the successes of the private health care market to reforming      the Medicare program, then weakening the antitrust laws for      physicians is truly misguided. Senior citizens and all      consumers should have health plan choices--but choices that      are indeed competitive.       The attached Washington Post article underscores the need      to maintain strong antitrust enforcement in order to ensure      that consumers, not competitors, determine the range and      prices of goods and services offered in the health care      marketplace.       Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) is      seeking special treatment under the antitrust laws. Under the      AMA's proposal, physicians would be allowed to agree on the      prices they will charge and collectively negotiate with      lawyers while essentially remaining individual competitors.      In other words, little substantial risk-sharing on the part      of physicians would be required, effectively reducing      incentives to compete on cost, quality and efficiency. In      addition, physician networks would be subject to more lenient      enforcement of the law than all other providers.       Advocates of changes to the law contend that current      antitrust laws and enforcement must be relaxed to allow      physicians to compete on a ``level playing field'' with other      network organizers such as hospitals. HMOs and insurers.      While this argument may appear reasonable at a glance, a      closer examination of the issue reveals quite the opposite.      The antitrust changes that the AMA seeks to include as part      of Medicare reform are little more than well-disguised      attempts to side-step the strong free market protections      afforded by current law.       The following briefing paper tells the real story.           Sincerely,         American Group Practice Association, American Association            of Nurse Anesthetists, Academy of Nurse Practitioners,            American Nurses Association, AETNA, American Managed            Care and Review Association, American College of Nurse            Mid-wives, Association of Private Pension and Welfare            Plans, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association,            Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association, CIGNA, FHP Health            Care, Group Health Association of America, Health Care            Compare, Corp., Health Insurance Association of            America, Kaiser Permanente, Kansas City Blue Cross &            Blue Shield, Metrahealth, National Association of            Manufacturers, National Capital PPO, Nat's Assoc. of            Nurse Practitioners in Reproductive Health, Opticians            Association of America, Sierra Health Services, The            Erisa Industry Committee, The Principal Financial            Group, The Prudential, U.S. Healthcare, Inc., Wausau            Insurance Companies.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1995]              Doctors, Hospitals Sued on Monopoly Charges       The Justice Department yesterday charged doctors and      hospitals in two states with using monopoly power to block      lower-priced managed health care systems from competing--in      one case for almost a decade.       It was the first time the agency's anti-trust division      filed price-fixing lawsuits accusing hospitals of scheming      with doctors to ensure their own higher profits while health      care costs rise.       Both groups--in Danbury, Conn., and St. Joseph, Mo--denied      the charges. But both also agreed to consent decrees in which      they promised to change the way they do business.       The complaint said that beginning in May 1994 and      continuing through August, Danbury Hospital, the only      acutecare facility in the area, forced patients to use its      outpatient facilities, joined with ``virtually all of the      doctors on its medical staff' to raise fees, and purposely      limited the size and mix of its medical staff to reduce      competition among local doctors.       In Missouri, the Justice Department said, the price-fixing      conspiracy occurred from April 1986 through June 1995. The      complaint said about 85 percent of the doctors in Buchanan      County formed a group in 1986 ``to prevent or delay the      development of managed care in the area.''       In 1990, the group then joined with the only local      hospital, Heartland, to form Health Choice to further lock up      the medical services and profits in the area, the lawsuit      said.Special Antitrust Preferences for Physicians Limit Competition, Choice                 and Innovation in the Health Care Market       Current antitrust law does allow for the formation of      physician-sponsored networks.       Physicians can join together and agree on price and other      terms of business so long as they ``integrate'' by sharing      financial risk. Risk-sharing can be achieved in a variety of      ways and is critical to ensure that physicians do not come      together to simply fix prices while remaining separate      competitors. Numerous physician networks have successfully      ``integrated'' and are now competing in virtually every      market in the country. Some of the most notable examples are      the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the Cleveland Clinic in      Ohio. These multi-specialty physician group practices were      formed under existing antitrust laws, without special      preferences.       Alternatively physicians can also join together to form      Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and negotiate fees      with HMOs and other third-party payers without integrating      their practices. These more loosely organized groups can      perform many of the same functions as their fully integrated      counterparts, including quality assurance, utilization      review, and administrative services. Guidelines issued by the      Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission      (FTC) make this clear.       Loosening integration requirements is harmful to consumers      because it reduces the incentive for providers to compete.      Current integration requirements are not barriers to the      formation physician-sponsored plans. They are barriers to      price-fixing, boycotts and other forms of anti-market      activities. Ultimately, substantial financial integration is      what drives competition on quality, efficiency and cost.       Physicians are not disadvantaged with respect to other      providers under the antitrust laws.       The purpose of strong antitrust enforcement policies is to      protect consumers, not competitors. The notion that      physicians need special antitrust preferences because the      antitrust laws are biased against physicians is inaccurate      and misleading. Joint ventures arranged by like competitors      in every other industry are subject to essentially the same      level of scrutiny as physician-sponsored networks.       Similarly, insurers and other providers are not exempt from      antitrust enforcement. If insurers either agreed among      themselves on payment levels or tried to wield market power      by driving prices down, they too would run afoul of the      antitrust laws.       In its 1995 Report to Congress, the Physician Payment      Review Commission (PPRC)      concluded that ``the available evidence of problems is not sufficient      to warrant creating safe harbors or other exemptions from the      antitrust laws for physician-sponsored networks at this time.      Amending the antitrust laws is a serious step that should be      undertaken only in the face of compelling evidence that      change is required. The limited available factual evidence,      however, does not currently suggest the widespread existence      of problems.''       Consequently, what the AMA is really asking for is the      ability to compete outside the free market principles that      every other competitor must abide by.       Special antitrust treatment for physicians, such as loose      integration requirements and substitution of the rule of      reason for the per se rule would diminish consumer power in      the marketplace.       A number of changes to the antitrust laws have been      advocated by the AMA, ranging from outright exemptions to      relaxing risk-sharing requirements and elimination of the per      se rule. The per se rule has allowed the courts and      enforcement agencies to efficiently call a halt to activities      that are blatantly harmful to consumers. It reflects a      determination that some conduct--such as price-fixing and      group boycotts--is so likely to harm consumers that it should      be found unlawful in all circumstances. It is a rule that      applies to all providers and all industries.       The rule of reason, in contrast, requires a balancing of      the competitive harm arising from particular conduct against      the possible economic benefits it produces. However, it is      also more difficult under this rule to challenge      anticompetitive conduct because many more creative defenses      and justifications can be raised. If antitrust enforcement      agencies could only prosecute antitrust violations by      provider physician-sponsored networks under the rule of      reason, they would be forced to utilize greater resources and      face a reduced likelihood of success. If rule of reason      treatment was extended to provider-sponsored networks, but      not to other types of health care networks, provider      organizations would enjoy distinct advantages that would not      be shared by other health plans. This would put those plans      at a competitive disadvantage.       History is replete with examples of physician group      boycotts and efforts to keep other physician group practices      and non-physicians, such as nurse mid-wives and nurse      anesthetists, from offering consumers choice. One of the best      examples of this is the experience of the physician-owned      Cleveland Clinic. In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)      put a halt to physician boycotts aimed at preventing      Cleveland Clinic doctors from establishing a practice in      Florida. This case was brought under the per se rule--the      very rule from which AMA seeks an exemption. Similarly, prior      to 1979, the AMA bound its members to rules that prevented      physicians from contracting with HMOs. These rules      effectively prevented price competition among doctors and      hindered the development of new, innovative health care      delivery systems, such as HMOs and PPOs. The Supreme Court      agreed and forced the AMA to drop its anticompetitive rules.       The DOJ and FTC have provided substantial guidance to      health care providers to address their concerns.       In response to concerns raised by providers, the Department      of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)      jointly issued the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy      in the Health Care Area. These statements, or guidelines,      provide a detailed road map of the analysis that the federal      enforcement agencies will apply to the most significant      issues facing the health care industry. The guidelines      include ``safety zones'' clarifying what types of mergers,      joint ventures, and other activities would be considered      lawful. The DOJ/FTC have made a special effort to address      physician networks and rural health care markets.       For physicians and other providers who have questions about      forming integrated networks, the agencies offer opportunities      for more specific advice through their business review and      advisory opinion letter process. The agencies' business      review and advisory opinion procedures allow parties to      obtain a statement of the agencies' enforcement intentions      before the transaction is implemented. The agencies have      committed to providing expedited 90-day reviews. The agencies      have also committed to continued monitoring of evolving      health care markets so they can respond to changes on an on-     going basis. To date, virtually every physician-sponsored      network has been approved.       The health care industry has responded enthusiastically to      these initiatives. According to a January 1995 Bureau of      National Affairs (BNA) survey of counselors advising      providers, the ``almost blanket clearances by the Justice      Department and FTC of proposals to create managed care      networks is assuaging health care industry concerns about the      impact of antitrust law . . .''                                                                    ____         Business for Medicare Reform: APPWP--The Benefits            Association; The Business Roundtable; The ERISA            Industry Committee; National Association of            Manufacturers; National Business Coalition on Health;            U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                                 October 17, 1995.

Dear Representatives: We are writing as representatives of      small and large businesses who have been supportive of your      efforts to save Medicare by passing the Medicare Preservation      Act. We have been gratified by the commitment you have made      to fundamentally restructuring Medicare by drawing on the      successful health care reform strategies pioneered by private      employers. Moreover, employers have been willing to accept      considerable costs in order to save Medicare.       Just a very few years ago, most health care policymakers      and analysts believed that the private sector could not      contain health care costs. Employers have proved this wrong,      by using their purchasing power to create more competitive      markets and demanding better care at lower cost. Based on our      knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we have      important reservations about a limited number of the Medicare      Preservation Act's provisions. We are concerned that these      provisions would undermine the very strategies that (a)      employers have used to control costs and improve quality and      (b) the Act uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable      Medicare program. We urge you to reconsider these provisions.       Our most important concerns are as follows:       Antitrust Changes for Health Care Providers. We are      extremely concerned by the antitrust law changes included in      Sections 15021 and 15221 of the Act, which would affect      employer-sponsored health plans as well as MedicarePlus      plans. We ask that they be stricken.       Unfortunately, organized medicine has a long history of      attempting to suppress alternative health care delivery      systems. Antitrust enforcement has been an important tool in      overcoming this opposition to innovative ways of delivering      higher quality care at lower cost. Section 15221's changes to      antitrust law would allow organized medicine to engage in a      much higher level of anticompetitive activity, thereby      increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. In      contrast, employers have created the new, competitive health      care market and better ways to measure and improve quality      under current antitrust law, which also leaves broad      leeway for health care providers to collaborate in      legitimate self-regulatory activity.       Employers have been able to control costs and improve      quality by using their purchasing power to create competitive      health care markets. The antitrust law changes in Section      15021 would shift the balance between health care providers      and purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers'      ability to be effective purchasers and jeopardizing their      hard won victories over health care cost inflation and poor      quality care. Putting purchasers at a disadvantage by      changing antitrust law risks a return to health care      hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.       Medical Liability Reforms. Employers have long supported      medical liability reform, including changes to the collateral      source rule. However, the version of collateral source rule      reform in the Act eliminates employers' right of subrogation.      This shifts the cost of treating injuries caused by a      negligent provider from the provider who caused the injury to      employers. We urge that you revise the Act to provide for a      different version of collateral source rule reform that      appropriately prevents double recovery by plaintiffs without      inappropriately shifting responsibility for injuries caused      by negligent providers to employers.       Medicare Secondary Payer Expansions. The Act expands      employers' Medicare secondary payer liability. This does      nothing to improve health care efficiency or quality. Rather,      it simply shifts costs to private sector payers. Small      employers in particular are vulnerable to this kind of cost-     shifting. We urge that the expansions of Medicare secondary      payer liability be eliminated.       As you know, managed care plans able to efficiently deliver      high quality care have played a key role in employers'      market-based health reform strategy. No aspect of the      Medicare Preservation Act is more important to employers than      its treatment of managed care plans. We are gratified that      the Act as introduced by Chairman Archer and Chairman Bliley      did not include antimanaged care rules. Including antimanaged      care rules in the Act would increase costs and reduce      quality. Moreover, including antimanaged care rules would      directly and adversely affect employer-sponsored health plans      as well as MedicarePlus plans, since the same networks will      serve Medicare beneficiaries and employer-sponsored plans.       It is our understanding that most of the antimanaged care      rules adopted in committee as amendments to the Act have been      stricken. (These amendments included restrictions on (1) the      criteria health plans may use when selecting providers, (2)      efforts to eliminate medically inappropriate emergency room      treatment and (3) denial of care that is not medically      necessary.) We applaud this result. We urge you to strike the      remaining antimanaged care amendment (restricting permissible      contractual relationships between health plans and providers)      and to continue adhering to the policy of avoiding      antimanaged care rules as the Medicare Preservation Act moves      through the legislative process.       It also is our understanding that a technical error in the      medical liability reforms that would have inadvertently      expanded employers' liability by interfering with current      grievance procedures provided for under the Employee      Retirement Income Security Act has been resolved. We      appreciate your efforts to resolve this matter, which is      vitally important to employers who voluntarily sponsor health      benefits for their employees.       Again, we strongly support your efforts to save Medicare.      It is essential that they succeed. However, as      representatives of the businesses that originated the      strategies that the Medicare Preservation Act is built on, we      urge adoption of a few technical changes that would greatly      strengthen the Act's ability to achieve its goals. These      changes also would eliminate our concerns about the Act's      effects on businesses that voluntarily offer health benefits      to their employees.       We would be pleased to further discuss these issues with      you at your convenience.                                                                    ____                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                 Business for Medicare Reform,                                                 October 23, 1995.     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,     Chairman, Finance Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Roth. We are writing as representatives of      small and large businesses that are working hard to control      health care costs and improve quality. We have been gratified      by the Finance Committee's decision to fundamentally improve      Medicare by drawing on the successful health reform      strategies pioneered by private employers.       Just a few years ago, most health care policymakers      believed that the private sector could not contain health      care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, by using their      purchasing power to create more competitive markets,      demanding better care at lower costs, measuring outcomes and      consumer satisfaction, and developing networks through      selective contracting with the best providers. Based on our      knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we are      concerned that potential floor amendments to the Finance      Committee bill would undermine the very strategies that (a)      employers have used to control costs and improve quality and      (b) the bill uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable      Medicare program. These potential amendments include      antitrust exemptions for health care providers and mandated      point-of-service coverage by network-based plans. We strongly      oppose these potential amendments to the Finance Committee      bill.       The damage that would be caused by adding these amendments      to Medicare reform legislation would not be limited to higher      Medicare costs and lower quality. Because Medicare is such a      large factors in health care markets and because Medicare and      employer-sponsored health plans will use the same provider      networks, antitrust exceptions for providers and antimanaged      care rules would directly harm employer-sponsored plans.      Working Americans and their families would face higher costs,      reduced coverage and lower quality.                   opposition to antitrust exemptions       One potential amendment would grant an antitrust exemption      to medical self-regulatory organizations. Unfortunately,      organized medicine has a long history of attempting to      suppress coordinated health care delivery systems. Antitrust      enforcement has been an important tool in overcoming this      opposition to innovative ways of delivering higher quality      care at lower cost. An antitrust exemption for medical self-     regulatory organizations would allow organized medicine to      engage in a much higher level of anticompetitive activity,      thereby increasing costs and reducing the quality of care.      Notably, current antitrust law leaves broad leeway for health      care providers to collaborate in legitimate self-regulatory      activity.       Employer-led efforts to improve accountability and quality      in the health care system by making data available to health      care consumers has been a leading cause of the positive      changes in the health care market. This data has become      available--often in the face of provider resistance--only      because private employees took the initiative to develop it      and demand that providers supply it. Granting providers an      antitrust exemption, thereby permitting them to monopolize      the quality standard-setting process, will seriously erode      accountability for quality and value.       Another potential antitrust amendment would grant an      exemption to provider-sponsored organizations. Employers have      been able to control costs and improve quality by using their      purchasing power to create competitive health care markets.      An antitrust exemption for provider-sponsored organizations      would shift the balance between health care providers and      purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers'      ability to be effective purchasers. Putting purchasers at a      disadvantage by changing antitrust law risks a return to      health care hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.                 opposition to point-of-service mandate       A recent Lewin-VHI study found that a point-of-service      mandate would add even more to the nation's health care bill      than an ``any willing provider'' mandate. Experience confirms      a point-of-service mandate's high cost. A study of Florida      employers' 1993 health crisis found that point-of-service      plans cost over 20 percent more than HMOs. Prohibiting      closed-panel plans from participating in Medicare would force      even those Medicare beneficiaries who want to enroll in a      closed-panel plan--such as the 3 million seniors who already      have chosen such plans over the traditional Medicare system--     to pay higher premiums.       A point-of-service mandate undermines the entire purpose of      Medicare reform. Because the traditional Medicare program is      unsustainable, the Finance Committee bill encourages      beneficiaries to shift to private health plans. A point-of-     service mandate would drive up private plans' costs,      encouraging continued enrollment in the government-run      system. As a result, Medicare reform would fail to produce a      modernized, more efficient Medicare.       Both point-of-service plans and closed panel plans have      earned an important place in the market--based on consumers'      choices, not government mandates. In fact, employers have      found that employee enrollment in closed panel HMOs increased      at the same time that point-of-service plan availability and      enrollment increased. Market forces rather than government      microregulation should determine point-of-service plans' role      in Medicare. Certainly, the federal government should not      deny consumers the freedom to choose and the savings of      private health plans that only contract with selected      providers. Moreover, the Finance Committee bill requires all      plans that only contract with selected providers, like every      other private plan (but not the traditional government-run      Medicare program), to meet quality standards.       The Finance Committee made the right choice by keeping      antitrust exemptions for organized medicine and a point-of-     service mandate out of its Medicare reform bill. We urge you      to oppose any floor amendments that would add these      provisions, or any other antimanaged care rules, to the      Finance Committee's Medicare bill.                                                                    ____                                           National Association of                                            Attorneys General,                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.     Hon. Newt Gingrich,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Gingrich: As Chair and Vice-Chair of the      Antitrust Committee and Chair and Vice-Chair of the Health      Care Task Force of the National Association of Attorneys      General (NAAG), we are writing to express our concern about      two antitrust provisions included in H.R. 2425, the Medicare      Preservation Act of 1995. These provisions, sections 15021      and 15221 of the Act, are unnecessary and could frustrate the      cost-containment goals of the Medicare legislation. We urge      that these provisions not be included in the final Medicare      reform package.       The Attorneys General, as chief law officers of their      states, are the primary enforcers of the states' antitrust      law, and also represent their states and the citizens of      their states in federal antitrust litigation. As chief legal      officers, the Attorneys General have had and continue to have      an important role in the development of national competition      policy. We know first-hand that the antitrust laws benefit      consumers by protecting competition and promoting efficiency,      innovation, low prices, better management and greater      consumer choice. Although the Attorneys General as a group      have not had an opportunity to consider this legislation,      past NAAG policy positions have consistently opposed both new      antitrust exemptions and the weakening of antitrust      enforcement standards for specific industries.       Section 15221 of the Act provides an exemption from both      state and federal antitrust laws for activity relating to      medical self-regulation. We believe that inclusion of this      provision is inadvisable. Unfortunately, state Attorneys      General have had experience with physicians and other health      care providers who have engaged in anticompetitive      activities, including physicians' attempts to eliminate      competition from HMOs, PPOs and allied health care      professionals. For this reason, in a 1993 Resolution, the      Attorneys General stated their belief that exempting health      care providers from the antitrust laws is undesirable. Nor is      the exemption contained in section 15221 necessary. Current      antitrust law permits collaborative activities, including      standard-setting activities, that benefit the public and do      not injure competition.       Section 15021 of the Act provides that certain actions of a      provider service network or an individual member of that      network shall not be deemed illegal per se under either      federal or state antitrust law, but shall instead be judged      under the ``rule of reason.'' We are concerned that this      relaxation of antitrust standards could lead to higher      prices and fewer choices for consumers. Under current law,      per se treatment is reserved for the most anticompetitive      conduct, including horizontal price-fixing. As stated in a      1986 NAAG Resolution, the Attorneys General oppose new      industry-specific antitrust standards because present      antitrust standards adequately protect the interests of      businesses, as well as consumers, by preventing activities      that have no pro-competitive justification. More      specifically, in the health care area, the Attorneys      General believe that competition promotes more affordable      health care, development of innovative new delivery      systems, and increased information for health care      consumers.       Finally, we are concerned about the broad preemption of      state antitrust enforcement, particularly in section 15221,      which is not limited to protection of activities within the      Medicare program. In a 1994 Resolution, the      Attorneys General opposed preemption of state antitrust enforcement in      the health care area because such preemption crodes state      sovereignty and threatens the system of federalism      established by the Constitution. Health care is predominately      a local industry that varies significantly from state to      state. The Attorneys General, as chief law enforcement      officers, should continue to be able to prevent      anticompetitive behavior within each state.

Dear Senator. It is our understanding that the      reconciliation bill before the Senate includes a number of      anti-consumer provisions which may violate the Byrd rule.      Those provisions include antitrust exemptions for provider      service networks, elimination of laboratory testing standards      for most tests performed in physician offices, preemption of      state authority to implement consumer protection standards      for managed care plans and physician self-referral.       On behalf of the following organizations, we strongly ask      that you support every effort to remove these harmful      provisions from the reconciliation bill. Inclusion of the      items listed above will drive up costs, threaten patient      safety and reduce the quality of health care for all      Americans.           Sincerely,         AIDS Action Council, American Public Health Association,            Church Women United, Citizen Action, Consumer            Federation of America, Consumers Union, National            Association of Social Workers, National Farmers Union,            National Council of Senior Citizens, Neighbor To            Neighbor, Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Service            Employees International Union.
