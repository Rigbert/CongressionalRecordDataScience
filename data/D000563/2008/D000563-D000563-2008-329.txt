. tomorrow, Tuesday, July 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3268, the energy speculation bill, as under the previous order. I further ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. tomorrow to allow for the weekly caucus luncheons to meet. Finally, I ask that if cloture is invoked, the postcloture debate time from 2:15 p.m. until 6:15 p.m. be equally divided and controlled in 30-minute alternating blocks of time, with the majority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans controlling the next 30 minutes.
