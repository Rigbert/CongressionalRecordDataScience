 President, I rise today to honor the life of a truly brave American who has passed away while defending our country. SSG Mark Wall died April 27, 2006, in Mosul, Iraq, where he was serving his country as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Staff Sergeant Wall was assigned to C Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry regiment in Fort Wainwright, AK. He was deployed to Iraq in August of 2005 and served near Mosul. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to his parents, Arthur and Helen Wall, his two brothers and his sister.  Mark Wall graduated from Alden High School in 1997 where he participated in basketball, football, track, chorus, and band. He was a Boy Scout, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout in 1997. He also participated in 4-H, garden and photography projects, and FFA. Staff Sergeant Wall joined the Iowa National Guard in February of 1997. He attended classes at Ellsworth Community College studying agricultural business and worked as an electrician's helper before joining the Active-Duty Army in May of 2000.  I understand that Mark had a passion for the outdoors and took advantage of that passion while he was in Alaska, prospecting for gold, hiking, fishing, and skiing.  I would like to again give my condolences to the family of SSG Mark Wall. He served his country with pride and passion, and we are all saddened by his loss. I would like my colleagues in the Senate to take a moment and remember the life of Mark Wall and remember the tremendous sacrifice he gave for us and our great country.                          ____________________[Pages S4327-S4328]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                    Lance Corporal Stephen R.
