Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), our chairman, who is new this year to this subcommittee, although certainly not new to the Committee on Appropriations, he is our senior member next to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), for their leadership. I want to talk not about the overall bill, as it is a good bill. I will enthusiastically vote for this.                              {time}  1430  It speaks to the health needs of America. It speaks to the educational needs of our children. It speaks to working people, as well.  But I want to refer to a couple of specific items. First of all, immunization. Immunization, I believe, is a critical concern, not only of this bill but of this country. There are areas of this country where immunizations are not nearly where they ought to be. In fact, generally speaking, we went back about 1 percent, from 78 to 77, overall immunizations of children in this country.  It is inconceivable that in the year 2001, despite all of the technological and scientific advances that we achieved during the last century, Mr. Speaker, that nearly 1 million American children do not enjoy the benefits of full immunization. Indeed, only 77 percent of our 2-year-olds are adequately immunized. We need to continue to work to increase funding for this important program.  In addition, I would like to say how pleased I am that this conference report contains language that will continue to fund state-assistive technology programs. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) for focusing on this issue. In the scheme of things, in terms of the billions of dollars we are spending on this bill, this is a small item, but a very, very large item in ensuring that those with disabilities will fully participate in the opportunities of our society.  This assistive technology is critical. Many may not have known, but the current law for the assistive technology program includes a provision requiring a sunset of State grant programs, which was to occur in cycles, to gradually decrease States' funding until eliminated.  In fiscal year 2002, nine States would have been eliminated for funding: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, and Nebraska. We have turned that around. We have provided funds. I appreciate their leadership, again, on that issue, and say that this is a good bill. It is a good bill for our country, and it is a good work product of our committee.  I thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for his leadership and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), as well.
