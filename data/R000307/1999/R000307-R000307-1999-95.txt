President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration en bloc of S. 1060 through S. 1062--that is Calendar Order Nos. 115, 116, and 117--that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the appropriate portion of S. 1059, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, according to the schedule which I send to the desk; that these bills be advanced to third reading and passed; that the motion to reconsider en bloc be laid upon the table; and that the above actions occur without intervening action or debate.
