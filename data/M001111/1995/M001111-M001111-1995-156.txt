 President, I have listened carefully to the words of the Senator from West Virginia on his sense-of-the-Senate resolution and am also willing to accept the amendment on the grounds that I see it as the precursor to having a hearing on this so that all sides can be aired. I would want to make sure that we were not precluding anyone's ability to be in the Press Gallery with this kind of amendment. I think those kinds of questions and answers can be gathered. I understand that is what this amendment is trying to attain and with that would not object to it.
