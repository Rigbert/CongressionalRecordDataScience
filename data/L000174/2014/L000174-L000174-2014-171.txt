President, when Vermonters contemplate the history of our great State, many think fondly of our former State archivist, Gregory Sanford. With his flowing gray beard and quick wit, Gregory is a noted scholar on all things relating to Vermont's history and culture. Gregory retired from his post as the Vermont State archivist in 2012. The appreciation of the extent of Gregory's intellect and influence is not limited to Vermonters. His impressive career was recently chronicled in Archival Outlook, a publication of the Society of American Archivists.  Throughout his career, Gregory Sanford served as a critical resource for journalists, legislators, town moderators, and anyone else searching to put today's events into historical context. He brought excitement to the daunting but essential task of preserving State records. It was his vision, passion, and ability to anticipate the myriad of ways that technology would alter the job of State archivist that set Gregory Sanford apart. As the Archival Outlook piece notes, Gregory spent his career imagining innovative solutions to difficult problems with limited resources.  During his years as State archivist, Gregory was also an ambitious author who worked to explain how our laws affect the lives of everyday Vermonters, often invoking colorful analogies to do so. His regular column, ``Voices from the Vault,'' never lacked for detail or readership. In short, Gregory brought history to life, and worked tirelessly to preserve it, which is precisely why this profile of Gregory Sanford is entitled, ``The Sense of Wonder.'' My State of Vermont is so fortunate for his many contributions, and I ask unanimous consent that the Archival Outlook article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From Archival Outlook]                          The Sense of Wonder Vermont State Archives and records administration building named for                             gregory sanford                   (By Terry Cook and Helen Samuels)       Most archivists work in buildings devoted, in whole or      part, to preserving historical archives or managing dormant      institutional records. Over the course of their careers, some      get the opportunity to participate in the design of new      buildings for these purposes. A mere handful are privileged      to lead teams to conceptualize, design, build, and occupy a      combined historical archives and records center. But only      rare--and very special--archivists do all that and then have      such multipurpose buildings named in their honor--in fact,      only one to our knowledge in the United States. Our colleague      and friend, Gregory Sanford, is that rarest of archivists.      This is his story, or at least the story of why he achieved      this signal and singular honor.\1\       Professional innovator and leader on many fronts, our      Gregory is modest to a fault. Part of this is his genuine      belief that he is just working away, trying the best he could      to make a difference, in a small state in a far corner of the      country, neither looking for nor expecting recognition from      practicing a profession that he loves so well. Many people in      life who are modest have much to be modest about, but not      Gregory, for he has envisioned, thought, and accomplished      much, and in so doing set some valuable models for our      profession.       One marvels over the scope of his publications, both formal      and scholarly, and much more pervasively and influential, his      hundreds of newspaper columns and lively speeches given all      across his state, in schools, before local societies, in the      broader New England region, and beyond, as well as before      hundreds of meetings of legislative committees, all extolling      the merits of archives and good records management,      demonstrating through story and character, wild analogies and      moving metaphors (more on that later!) The power of archives      to inform, educate, transform, and amuse--and (as the      official building plaque notes) create a ``sense of wonder''      about the past and its impact on all Vermont citizens.       He transformed a state papers office of one person located      in a tiny office, with shared records storage in the basement      of the executive office building, into a dynamic institution,      the Vermont State Archives and Records Administration      (VSARA), currently with fourteen staff members, an updated      archives and records law (that he authored), and a newly      renovated and expanded archival and records center building.      In accomplishing this, Gregory has worked tirelessly with      legislators, bureaucrats, educators, media, and anyone who      would listen, to give records management, and especially for      digital records, both visibility and strategic direction for      his state in the information world. The result is a      resuscitated records management service now exists under the      control of the state archivist, rather than languishing in      the state's general services department.       His highly innovative use of the archives and its      collections to frame and give context to current issues of      debate in the state, so citizens and legislators do not      ignore the wisdom of past, is especially admirable. This      ``continuing issues'' approach to archival public programming      makes the relevance of archives very apparent to citizens and      sponsors, legislators and media personnel, beyond the well-     known uses of archives for history, genealogy, and general      support to government. In effect, and not without some      political risk to himself, Gregory has championed the      fundamental principle of archives being arsenals for      democracy through an informed citizenry. For controversial      issues facing the state and its legislators, he repeatedly      uncovered past precedents where denials flourished that such      existed; outlined forgotten past examples of workable      government processes where chaos now reigned until his      intervention; showed that sacred cows of state policy assumed      to be sacrosanct since time immemorial had in fact changed      many times, and could thus be readily changed again. In his      column, Voices from the Vault, appearing in the Secretary of      State's monthly publication, as well as on the VSARA web      site, Gregory applied his vast knowledge of state records and      Vermont history, its constitution and laws, and his own wide      reading and sense of wonder. Gregory thus for many years kept      ``continuing issues'' burning, showing the relevance of      archives and records to living life now. So much so that      legislators and media turned to him for ``backgrounders'' on      many public issues, and those he gave them in his interviews      and in his Voices from the Vault columns--always with flare,      good humor, and self-deprecation, but also with dedication,      passion, and keen intelligence.       Despite his tiny resource base in the state archives and      many pressing home and family responsibilities, Gregory has,      as a committed professional, applied for and received several      NHPRC grants. He wanted to push the frontiers of archival and      records management research, strategy, and best practice, to      try to understand, codify, and share more widely the lessons      he was learning in Vermont with his wider profession. The      most noted of these, in our opinion, was the Vermont State      Information Strategy Plan (VISP), in which we both had      marginal roles as consultants, but enough to observe the      project first hand.       VISP was a gubernatorial initiative embracing executive      agencies. Though the archives was not originally envisioned      as a VISP participant, Gregory succeeded in getting it a      place at the table. He had been impressed by some of the      appraisal thinking occurring in the archival profession in      the late 1980s centered around functional analysis and      macroappraisal. Instead of appraising records by their      subject and informational-value content, which is impossible      for modern records given their huge extent in paper, their      interconnectedness across many creating institutions in our      complex world, and their transient digital formats, archival      theorists like Hans Booms in Germany, Helen Samuels in the      United States, and Terry Cook in Canada shifted the focus for      appraisal to the functional context of creation: which      functions, programs, and activities within which structural      entities would be most likely to produce the best records,      including evidence of citizen's interaction with the state,      rather than which of the billions of modern records      themselves might have potential research value.       Gregory was impressed by these ideas, but he took      functional analysis a step further, and built it back into      the information system planning of the state. Based on      research into the mandates, structures, and especially      functions, programs, and activities of every state agency, he      automated the results to produce a grid that matched      functional activity with the several (sometimes many) offices      performing aspects of that activity. He demonstrated that      promotion and control of tourism, for example, was spread      around nine separate agencies that did not talk to each      other, or that a single mother with dependent children at      school, when seeking benefits, would have to contact and then      fill in similar information on application forms for each of      the twelve agencies. By revealing this overlap and      duplication, VISP permitted consolidation, in a virtual      sense, of these programs through information systems that      talked to each other for greater effectiveness, reduced      duplication and inefficiency, made things easier for clients      of the government to get service (applying once, not twelve      times), helped the state promote itself (tourists now got one      effective consolidated message when they wrote, rather than     perhaps a few of nine partial ones). And of course archival      appraisal could now be focussed functionally on the location      of the best records in the VISP matrix to document the      state's activities with its citizens, because the state's      functions had finally been mapped and understood.       Though support for VISP waned with changing gubernatorial      administrations, the Vermont State Archives and Records      Administration, through the collaborative work of Gregory and      his deputy (and now successor) Tanya Marshall, used VISP      insights to model and then encourage state agencies to move      to a functions-based, multiple-access-point, facet-designed      file-classification system for its records management      programs.       Our Gregory achieved innovative results with minimal      resources and much imagination. He is one of those effective      facilitators working with ``power'' behind the scenes, as      well as frequently and openly in the public and media, to      make things happen. He is not just a dreamer and thinker,      orator and writer, thorough researcher and master      storyteller, though he does all that with considerable      aplomb. He is also a roll-up-the-sleeves practical archival      administrator who builds buildings, writes laws, plans and      carries out ambitious programs, and lobbies effectively for      his profession with panache and passion.       But what of ``the sense of wonder''? While the dedication      plaque on Gregory's building recognizes his ``devoted      service'' to archives and public records, which we trust the      foregoing account justifies, what state formally memorializes      ``the sense of wonder'' of any of its public servants?      Indeed, what government anywhere celebrates ``the sense of      wonder'' through a building dedication? To understand that,      we need to turn from what he did for historical archives and      managing public records to how he did it, to that sense of      panache and passion just mentioned, to ``the sense of      wonder'' he so often felt himself and shared so effectively      with others.       While the sense of wonder most especially describes      Gregory's endless curiosity and voracious reading, to say      nothing of his being a mountain of a man with a huge      improbable beard, what made that sense of wonder as state      archivist so special was his endless commitment to inform      Vermont citizens about the value and relevance of public      records, but always in the most engaging fashion. In this way      he passed on to those readers his own sense of wonder.       During Vermont's bicentennial celebration in 1991, for      example, Gregory organized a series of debates to engage      Vermont citizens around issues of current importance, such as      the death penalty and term limits. These debates were held in      each of the several cities that served over time as the      state's capital. While Gregory explored current issues, he      was always able to provide historical context, through      stories and examples drawn from his deep historical      understanding of the records. Citizens were empowered to feel      at the center of their government, working through      contemporary issues themselves with rich historical context      to temper and inform debate.       Gregory used his many speaking engagements to offer wry      perspectives on record and information management. Regularly      invited to address freshmen legislators as part of their      orientation, Gregory once introduced the importance of the      ``big picture'' of records management through an analysis of      the impact of dog urine on trees in New York City! Two dogs      at one fire hydrant that you see at brief glance, is one      thing; almost seven million gallons of urine squirted      annually on expensive (and now dying) city trees is quite      another picture. Similarly, one shelving bay of records in      the corner office is one thing; millions of documents across      scores of agencies, if not well managed in a statewide      integrated recordskeeping system, is quite another. We      suspect those legislators went home and never quite forgot      that image, records management, or Gregory. Nor would they      have forgotten the man who appeared before them, based on a      daughter's dare, with his huge beard newly dyed a bright      fuchsia color!       But Voices from the Vault was his regular forum to      demonstrate the relevance of records to current debates, but      always incorporating that special touch of Gregory's humor      and his own sense of wonder. Here is a fine example from his      January 2011 Voices from the Vault column that, additionally,      provides insight into his goal for his columns:       ``Most people, alas, don't find records/archival management      a particularly titillating topic. Therefore I usually start      my column with some misdirection, attempting to ensnare      readers before they realize they are reading about records.      This month I appeal to the reader's prurient interests and      offer a sex column. Female dragonflies, according to those      who study such things, possess `sperm storage organs.' These      are special sites which incubate sperm, keeping it alive for      months until the female is ready for fertilization. Male      dragonflies, however, are only concerned with passing along      their own genes. To them, the thought of the females      cheerfully flying about, slowly incubating the genes of      rivals is not a happy one. So, over time, the sexual organ of      the male dragonfly evolved to include a little scoop. This      allows the male to empty out the female's storage organ      before filling it with his own seed.       ``Government is like that. New administrations,      secretaries, and commissioners arrive in Montpelier and      immediately clear out the records of the previous occupants.      They then refill the various storage organs of government      with records of their own programs and initiatives. I confess      that the analogy is not exact since in many cases those      leaving government clean out their own record storage units      before departing.       ``The news media comment on these transitions often      speculating on the legacy of the departing administration.      This impulse to quickly define a particular administration's      legacy raises numerous interesting issues, notably the      tension between continuity and change inherent to our      democratic system of government. In other words, to what      degree are we documenting the continuities of government and      to what degree are we documenting the initiatives and actions      of specific administrations or state officers? Obviously      these are not mutually exclusive efforts, but they require      decisions over what files should be left in situ for      continuity of operations; what records should be sent to the      state archives to ensure long term access; and what records      can be disposed of without violence to statute or      administrative need?''       In 2009 Gregory introduced a column dealing with the      history of Vermont Special Session in the following way:      ``Traditional marriage is at risk in Vermont. No, no not that      one; it appears to be doing fine. I am talking about the long      standing union between car fenders and duct tape. Duct tape      is no longer good enough to get your car inspected. I am      currently organizing a Tape Back Vermont campaign. I thought      of imploring the governor to convene a special session of the      general assembly to address this unprecedented attack upon      the customs and usage of home auto body repair. This required      some preliminary investigation on the history of special      sessions,'' which Gregory then traces from 1777 forward.       One of Gregory's 2012 columns was entitled ``Sexing Chicks      and the Appraisal of Public Records.'' The column begins with      a brief introduction about how in the 1920s the Japanese      discovered ``that by squeezing a day-old chick's intestines      it was possible to see slight anatomical differences . . .      and thus males could quickly be culled and feed expenses      reduced.'' After this anatomical lesson, Gregory admits that      though the analogy is not precise, ``Sexing chicks is not      unlike appraising public records. [Archivists] don't want to      pay upkeep for records that don't have value. We need ways to      recognize the variations in public records so we can      correctly determine their ``gender'' with high accuracy. Good      records analysts, like good chick sexers, handle large      volumes, quickly, and have sufficient training and experience      to develop contexts for accurately interpreting what they      see.''       His gift to inform, amuse, and educate while promoting the      archives was truly amazing. To further appreciate his      delightful skill in writing about archives and documents,      readers are encouraged to discover more of these wonderful      columns at http://vermont-archives.org/publications/ voice/.\2\       That we all who feel the wonder of archives could so      imaginatively translate that into workplace reality as did      Gregory, and could have such enlightened employers as the      State of Vermont to recognize the merit of ``wonder'' so      publicly!                                 Notes       \1\ One of the buildings of the Illinois State Archives,      but not its records center, is named for long-time State      Archivist and pioneering records theorist, Margaret Cross      Norton. And a new wing of the Alabama Department of History      and Archives (the state archives) has recently been named for      that institution's long-time director, Edwin C. Bridges. A      few archives may have reading rooms or public areas named      after famous archivists, but these are hard to verify.      Examples (with stories) would, we are sure, be welcome for      mention in future issues of Archival Outlook. We thank Teresa      Brinati and Richard J. Cox for their helpful advice. In      Canada, one Dominion Archivist (Sir Arthur Doughty) has an      official historic plaque, and even a statue, raised in his      honor, and all the Dominion and National Archivists are      recognized by a sculpture inside LAC's Gatineau Preservation      Centre, but none have their ``own'' buildings!       \2\ Sanford's final article for this publication was      printed in the July/August 2012 issue. Since then, Sanford's      successor, Tanya Marshall, has continued contributing to the      publication.                               ____________________
