 Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, I will be happy to do that. Of course, it will be out there from now until Tuesday morning so people will have ample opportunity to take a look at it. As soon as the clerk can Xerox a copy, I am sure he will be glad to give it to the Senator from Illinois.
