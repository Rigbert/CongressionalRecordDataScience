 President, I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian who is being honored by the Commonwealth and by the many people who know and respect his life's work. The late John David Goodlette came from small town beginnings: he was born in Hazard, KY, in 1925 to Dudley and Lillian Goodlette. He would go on to become a highly respected rocket engineer who was instrumental in the Viking missions to land American spacecraft on the surface of the planet Mars.  From a young age, John had a passion for flight and aircraft. He would assemble model aircraft as a hobby, and this hobby soon grew to include piloting gliders and small aircraft. John's interest in flight led him to study engineering, and after graduating from Hazard High School in 1943, he would enroll at the University of Kentucky, where he studied mechanical engineering. His studies were interrupted by his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, when John served as a tugboat captain in the South Pacific. After resuming his studies at UK, he graduated in 1949.  The majority of John's professional career was spent at the Martin Marietta Corp., now known as Lockheed Martin, where he worked for 39 years. His research initially focused on jet propulsion, heat transfer, and thermodynamics, but he soon found himself immersed in developing rocket programs for the company.  In 1956, John was selected to lead Martin Marietta's Titan intercontinental ballistic missile project. The project led him to increase his familiarity with nuclear physics, high-speed gas dynamics, and electrical engineering.  Then came the project that would be the highlight of John's career: the Viking project. John served as chief engineer on this project for 10 years, which culminated with the successful landing of two Viking spacecraft on the surface of Mars in July and September of 1976.  ``The Viking was one of those heart-in-the-mouth things,'' John has been quoted as saying. ``We never knew for sure it was going to work. That kept us going at a fever pitch to make sure all went right.''  The Viking program was the most expensive and ambitious mission to Mars to that point and resulted in the bulk of our knowledge of the Red Planet for the next several decades. They were highly successful missions for which John Goodlette rightfully deserves a large share of the credit.  John is being inducted into the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame for his pioneering role in aviation and space exploration. Students and aviation enthusiasts from all over the Commonwealth, but especially from Hazard, can be proud of what this son of Kentucky accomplished in a brilliant career devoted to technology and science.  John also serves as an inspiration at the Challenger Learning Center of Kentucky, which uses space exploration as a tool to excite and inspire students to learn science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The Center is located in Hazard, John's hometown.  John would go on to serve as a vice president of Martin Marietta and retire in 1991 after 39 years with the company. He has sadly passed on now and is unable to witness this historic occasion in his honor, but members of his family will be present at the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame induction ceremony.  I know John's three children, Sarah, David, and Alice, must be proud of all their father accomplished in his remarkable career. John not only served his country in uniform, he also added greatly to the sum total of knowledge in the universe for the benefit of his country and all of mankind.  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, I want to thank the Goodlette family and express my admiration and respect for John David Goodlette's life and work. We are truly grateful for his passion to exploration and his service.                          ____________________
