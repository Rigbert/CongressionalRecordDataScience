Mr. Chairman, I think it needs to be pointed out that the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan) has put $834 million into the Child Survival and Disease program, and it is a significant increase, but the explosion of AIDS certainly makes it an issue that requires more attention.  We know that there is very little being done in the area of shelters, of helping those people who have the disease to get a longer and a higher quality of life. Much of the focus has been on prevention, and surely much of the focus should be on prevention. But for those who have it, those who have the ``slims,'' as they call it in Africa, need to be helped through their terrible ordeal, and there is much more that we could be doing to help in that way.  I commend my friend for offering the amendment. I am glad to be one of the cosponsors, but, again, I do think it should be underscored there is $834 million in here for child survival and diseases. This is a tweak, but it is an important tweak.
