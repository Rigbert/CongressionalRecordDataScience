President, I am disappointed that one or more Republican Senators are holding up final passage of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, H.R. 2215.  This bipartisan bill is supported by the Bush Administration and cosponsored by Senator Hatch, the ranking Republican Member of the Judiciary Committee. It was unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee back on October 30.  This bill, with a bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Hatch and myself, has cleared the Democratic cloakroom for final passage but someone on the other side of the aisle has placed a secret hold on it. I would urge my Republican friends to permit the Senate to take up and pass this critical legislation.  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, provides permanent enabling authorities which will allow the Department of Justice to efficiently carry out its mission.  At a time when the Department of Justice is conducting the most sweeping investigation into terrorist conspiracies in our Nation's history, the Senate should pass this legislation.  Indeed, Title II our bipartisan bill provides the Department of Justice with additional law enforcement tools in the war against terrorism. Section 201 permits the FBI to enter into cooperative projects with foreign countries to improve law enforcement or intelligence operations, and Section 210 provides special ``danger pay'' allowances for FBI agents in hazardous duty locations outside the United States.  In addition, the bill as passed by the Committee, contains language offered by Senator Feinstein to authorize a number of new judgeships.  Title III of this bipartisan legislation authorizes eight new permanent judgeships as follows: five judgeships in the Southern District of California; two judgeships in the Western District of Texas; and one judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina. Section 312 would also convert two temporary judgeships in Illinois into permanent judgeships, create one new temporary judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina, and extend the temporary judgeship in the Northern District of Ohio for five years.  I strongly support Senator Feinstein's amendment, as do many of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis, including Senator DeWine, Senator Durbin, Senator Edwards, and others. I believe that the need for these new judgeships is acute.  Finally, the bill creates a separate Violence Against Women Office to combat domestic violence. This section of the bill was crafted by Senator Biden and Senator Specter--another bipartisan partnership in this legislation. There is strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate to create a separate Violence Against Women Office within the Department of Justice.  Senator Hatch and I have also worked together to craft a bipartisan floor amendment which compiles a comprehensive authorization of expired and new Department of Justice grants programs and improvements to criminal law and procedures.  For example, our bipartisan floor amendment authorizes Department of Justice grants to establish 4,000 Boys and Girls Clubs across the country before January 1, 2007. This bipartisan amendment authorizes Department of Justice grants for each of the next 5 years to establish 1,200 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. In fact, this will bring the number of Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000. That means they will serve approximately 6 million young people by January 1, 2007.  In 1997, I was very proud to join with Senator Hatch and others to pass bipartisan legislation to authorize grants by the Department of Justice to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. We increased the Department of Justice grant funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs from $20 million in 1998 to $60 million in 2001. That is one reason why we have now 2,591 Boys and Girls Clubs in all 50 States and 3.3 million children are being served. It is quite a success story.  But the authorization for these Department of Justice grants to Boys and Girls Clubs across the country has expired. This bipartisan legislation will renew and expand these grants.  Parents, educators, law enforcement officers, and others know we need safe havens where young people can learn and grow up free from the influence of the drugs and gangs and crime. That is why the Boys and Girls Clubs are so important to our Nation's children.  Our bipartisan amendment also includes the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001. I am pleased that we have included in this package the version of S. 304 that the Judiciary Committee passed unanimously on November 29. This legislation ushers in a new, bipartisan approach to our efforts to reduce drug abuse in the United States. It was introduced by Senator Hatch and I in February. Senator Hatch held an excellent hearing on the bill in March, the Judiciary Committee has approved it, and the full Senate should follow the committee's lead. This is a bill that is embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as law enforcement officers and drug treatment providers.  This legislation provides a comprehensive approach to reducing drug abuse in America. I hope that the innovative programs established by this legislation will assist all of our States in their efforts to address the drug problems that most affect our communities.  Our bipartisan amendment also includes provisions to protect witnesses who provide information on criminal activity to law enforcement officials by increasing maximum sentences and other improvements to the criminal code.  And our bipartisan legislation contains amendments, authored by Senator Sessions, that modify the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Science Improvement Act of 2000 to enhance participation by local crime labs and to allow for DNA backlog elimination. I was proud to cosponsor the Coverdell grants bill last year and support it to help bring the necessary forensic technology to all states to improve their criminal justice systems.  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act should result in more effective, as well as efficient, Department of Justice for the American people. But it must pass the Senate soon and be reconciled with the House-passed bill in a conference.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to lift the secret hold on this bipartisan legislation to support the Department of Justice.                          ____________________
