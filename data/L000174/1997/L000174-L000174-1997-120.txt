President, for the last 2 weeks, we have seen firsthand the threats facing our rivers. In Maryland and Virginia, rivers have been plagued with fish washing up along the banks with lesions. Although the State and Federal fish and wildlife agencies have not been able to pinpoint the cause, I think we all can assume it is linked to the health of these rivers. The President's American heritage rivers initiative was launched to identify those rivers which are facing the greatest threats and assist communities revitalize the health of their backyard resources.  In Vermont, many of our rivers have already suffered such environmental harm that they can no longer sustain healthy fish populations. Even in Vermont's first nationally designated wilderness area, the 16,000 acre Lye Brook wilderness of the Green Mountain National Forest, streams are too toxic for fish. While the streams are remote from Vermont's population centers and industries, it stands square in the path of storms from the midwest, which carry pollutants that puff out of coal-fired power plants and cause acid rain.  Although I would argue that Vermonters are the most environmentally aware and involved citizens in the country, they cannot take on these environmental threats alone. The American heritage rivers initiative will empower these communities to access Federal resources to help them protect, preserve and develop their river resources. This is assistance Vermonters have been asking for--assistance where the community identifies the need, where the community controls the projects and where the community decides the outcome. This program is voluntary. This program is grassroots.  Since the President announced this initiative, I have heard from Vermonters up and down the Connecticut River asking me to nominate their river for this initiative. Although I whole-heartedly support the nomination of the Connecticut River, I told those communities that the nomination had to come from home, not from Washington. And this is as it should be. The nomination of the Connecticut has created a new enthusiasm for the Connecticut River in Vermont. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I received that demonstrates the widespread interest in nominating the Connecticut as part of this initiative.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 Connecticut River                                      Watershed Council, Inc.,                              Easthamption, MA, February 18, 1997.     Re ``Heritage River'' designation for the Connecticut River.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: In his ``State of the Union'' address,      President Clinton announced a national conservation      initiative of singular relevance to the Connecticut River. He      stated his intention to designate ten of the Nation's most      significant rivers as ``American Heritage Rivers.''       The Connecticut not only merits national recognition, but      it is the symbol of what a heritage river should be--an array      of extraordinary local conservation and economic development      actions that are bolstered and reinforced by government      resources and expertise. We ask for your support and active      efforts in Washington to see that the Connecticut is selected      as one of the Nation's ten Heritage Rivers.       Designation is intended to create a partnership between the      federal government and those who work at the local level to      protect and responsibly use river resources. It will not      bring federal regulation and mandates. Instead, it will      redirect federal resources and expertise to help Valley      residents safeguard our river environment, sustain and renew      our river communities, and preserve the historic and cultural      fabric of our river Valley. Individuals, communities, and      organizations already working in the watershed will define      the partnership and determine the support they want from the      federal government to aid us in conserving our river      resources and building the watershed economy.       The Watershed Council has put together a ``Connecticut      River Fact Sheet'' for you, detailing the many resources that      make the River special and worthy of heritage designation (a      copy is enclosed). Summarized, the top three reasons are:       1. The Connecticut is New England's longest river and      largest river system. The 410-mile river has a 11,260 square-     mile watershed that encompasses parts of four states--     Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.      Besides its rich diversity of plants, animals, birds, fish      and other wildlife, the Connecticut supports recreation,      power generation, agriculture, and urban revitalization. It      provides 70% of Long Island Sound's freshwater. Its ``special      places'' include the Northern Forest at its headwaters, the      Connecticut River Macrosite below Hanover, NH, an      internationally recognized estuary wetland area below      Middletown, CT, and a host of significant historic, geologic      and cultural sites in the Valley.       2. The Connecticut River faces challenges that local and      state governments alone cannot resolve. The New England      Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission is about to      issue a report entitled ``The Health of the Watershed''      detailing the water quality threats facing the River.      Problems that need attention include nonpoint source      pollution, toxins in fish, erosion, flow fluctuation,      combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and upgrading existing sewage      treatment plants.       3. There are willing local partners up and down the River      ready to work in partnership with the federal government.      There is a diverse network of nonprofit groups and local      agencies ready to take advantage of the opportunities and      resources that designation would bring to the Connecticut      River. These include nonprofit land trusts and local      conservation and historic preservation groups in each of the      four states; hydropower dam operators; the Great Falls      Discovery Center partnership in Turners Falls; the 13      regional planning commissions in the Valley such as the North      Country Council, the Joint River Commissions, the Franklin      County and Pioneer Valley Planning Commissions, the      Connecticut River Assembly and the Gateway Commission; urban      revitalization efforts like Riverfront Recapture in Hartford      or the Springfield Economic Development Council; Hartford's      Metropolitan District Commission; and statewide and regional      conservation organizations like the Connecticut Chapter of      The Nature Conservancy, the Society for the Protection of New      Hampshire Forests, the Vermont Natural Resources Council, and      the Connecticut River Watershed Council.       For the Connecticut to shine in the company of rivers that      are already part of our national consciousness--the      Mississippi, the Columbia, the Rio Grande--we must all      champion its heritage nomination. Competition for this      national recognition and the allocation of scarce federal      resources it will mean will surely be fierce.       The decision on which rivers will be designated is expected      within the next 90 days, so time is of the essence. We urge      you to write to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit this month to      express your support for selecting the Connecticut as a      heritage river. Secretary Babbit has visited the Valley      several times in the recent years and has spoken eloquently      about the Connecticut's natural and cultural values, so he      personally knows our River.       If you have further questions about the President's      American Heritage Rivers Initiative or need more information      about the Connecticut, please do not hesitate to have your      staff contact me. Meanwhile, the Council is already working      with a network of individuals, communities, and organizations      to gather the local nominations that will win the designation      for our River.           Sincerely,                                                   Whitty Sanford,                                     Associate Executive Director.
