Speaker, today freedom of speech on this floor is at stake. Two weeks into this Congress we see what gag rules are all about when no Ethics Committee has been appointed by the Speaker, when Members are purposefully muzzled in committees, when no hearings are allowed, when witness lists are completely controlled, we understand what a gag rule is.  In doing our people's business we have a right to know where a new author's personal interests, financial interests get tied up with his public duties. The deal for a $4.5 million advance for three books not written, plus royalties are signed with a company owned by Rupert Murdock, the very man who owns Fox News Network and could directly benefit by the obliteration of public television and radio, positions that the top official in this House has already publicly said he supports.  So we trade Big Bird and Barney for the gag rule.                          ____________________
