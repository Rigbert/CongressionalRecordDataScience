President, the time during morning business tomorrow will be dedicated for Senators to pay tribute to the late Senator Edward Kennedy.  Senators will be notified when the vote on the confirmation of the Sunstein nomination is scheduled. If all time is used, the vote would occur around 11:30 p.m. tomorrow night.  Finally, as a reminder to all Senators, at 2:45 p.m. tomorrow, George LeMieux will be sworn in as a Senator from the State of Florida.                          ____________________
