Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields], for holding and organizing this special order, and I want to thank my friend and my colleague for those very kind words. Thank you for being my friend.  Mr. Speaker, It is time to pay tribute to those great men and women who have dedicated their lives to making sure that African-Americans are able to enjoy all of the rights and freedoms of this great Nation. It is also a time for us to reflect on the distance we have come as Americans and the distance we have yet to travel.  Since I have been in the Congress, I have made a special effort to encourage the preservation of black history. Earlier this month, I introduced a bill to establish a National African-American Museum in Washington, DC. the bill seeks the establishment of a national museum dedicated to the heritage and culture of African-Americans.  The museum would collect, catalogue, conserve, and exhibit materials related to the art, history, and culture of African-Americans. It would be housed in the Art & Industries Building, a facility on the Mall.  A better understanding of American history has the power to inspire and uplift present and future generations of Americans. Our history is a precious resource. We should do all that we can to preserve it, and to ensure its accuracy by including the history of all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Today, I rise to remember three giants of American history. Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B. DuBois provided visionary leadership for African-Americans in the 20th century. Their ideas have served as the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the black struggle in America. Their arguments for full social, political and economic rights provided the ammunition for African-Americans to overturn segregation and outlay discrimination.  Mr. Speaker, these men were men of great vision. I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude and humility to be able to stand on their shoulders.  As the great abolitionist, Frederick Douglass personally lobbied President Abraham Lincoln to abolish slavery. Douglass was easily the most influential African-American public figure of the 19th century. He preached that agitation and protest were the instruments of freedom for an oppressed people. Frederick Douglass planted the seeds of liberation and inspired generations to pursue social justice at all cost.  During his lifetime, Booker T. Washington was known to many as the Wizard of Tuskegee. An innovative and determined leader, Washington founded prestigious Tuskegee University in southern Alabama. Washington preached that social uplift would result from economic prosperity and independence. Washington sought a pragmatic approach to the betterment of the African-American people.  Though he was criticized by some for not being forceful enough in advocating political freedom for African-Americans, Booker T. Washington was a visionary whose philosophy guides us still as we seek economic empowerment. Indeed, Washington's views will continue to guide us as we move into the 21st century.  W.E.B. DuBois, the author of ``The Souls of Black Folk,'' can be considered the intellectual father of the American civil rights movement. A founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, DuBois offered an uncompromising vision for political and social freedom. His writings helped to inspire the legal foundation of the NAACP that eventually led to the desegregation of public schools and facilities. [[Page H2050]]  DuBois devoted his entire life to the pursuit of social justice and political freedom.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to claim these men as my heroes and my mentors. They have inspired me and millions of Americans. It is fitting and appropriate that we pay tribute to these men.                              {time}  2110
