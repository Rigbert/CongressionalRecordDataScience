Mr. Speaker, we should, should help families who work hard and play by the rules for this reason. For this reason, I oppose the Republican proposal.  This Republican plan raises taxes on 32 million hard-working American families and gives a tax break to the richest people in America. It is Robin Hood in reverse.  The Republicans cut school lunches, student loans, and environment. About this, there can be no doubt.  Republicans attack Medicare. The elderly may have to choose between paying their doctors and paying their rent.  Why do the Republicans steal from our children, the elderly, and the poor? They say they want to help families, and then they raise taxes on 32 million working American families and give a tax break to their wealthy friends. This is extreme, this is radical; this is mean, just plain mean.  Where is the decency? Where is the sense of right and wrong? Where is the morality? This proposal is mean-spirited. It is just plain wrong.  Vote no on this mean, extreme proposal.
