President, today I wish to recognize someone who may not be familiar to members of the Senate, but in my State is synonymous with what makes Oregon a place that values the environment, its natural resources and its scenery.  Gail Achterman of Portland passed away on January 28 of pancreatic cancer. Gail was a special friend for more than 40 years. When I arrived on the Stanford University campus in the summer of 1969, Gail and I were tour guides together, two Democrats at the conservative Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace. We laughed about it then, and kept sharing jokes and stories for more than 40 years.  Gail leaves behind an impressive legacy of public service and dedication to environmental causes that will endure for years to come. Her professional resume is impressive: Lawyer, director of the Institute for Natural Resources at Oregon State University, chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, natural resources advisor to a former governor and member of too many State councils, boards and commissions to list here.  Even more impressive, however, was her life-long commitment to those things that make Oregon great. For an example, look no further than the indispensable role she played in creation of the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area in 1981. Anyone who has seen the majestic Columbia River Gorge knows it is one of the most beautiful places on earth--a crown jewel in a landscape filled with natural beauty. I was proud to be part of protecting The Gorge and proud of partnering with Gail in making that happen.  I want to extend my condolences to her husband Chuck and to her family and assure them that Oregon is a greater State thanks to my special friend Gail and the ideals she believed.                          ____________________
