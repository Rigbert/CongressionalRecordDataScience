President, reserving the right to object, I am not familiar with this bill. I have been informed by our cloakroom that there are objections to this from Members who are familiar with the content of the bill and/or members of the Foreign Relations Committee. I hope those as well can be resolved this evening. Absent that happening, I will have to object to this unanimous consent request.
