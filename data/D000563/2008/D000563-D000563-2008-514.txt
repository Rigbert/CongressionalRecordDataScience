President, today I am pleased to introduce with Senator Levin a resolution recognizing the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence. Day.  Two years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and months after the end of the Civil War, many African-Americans were still being denied the freedom that had been won. Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce that the Civil War had ended and ensure that the slaves were free. African-Americans who had been enslaved began celebrating June 19 the following year as the anniversary of their emancipation, the day their dreams of freedom became reality.  As Americans, we can't afford to forget the lessons learned from slavery and that terrible stain on our nation's history. Juneteenth reminds us to stay vigilant in our efforts to secure equal opportunity for all Americans to keep working for justice. Justice is true freedom and equality for all citizens, regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background.  I thank Senators Obama, Reid, Stabenow, and Brownback for joining Senator Levin and me in recognizing historic Juneteenth Independence Day. I encourage my colleagues to support this important resolution.                          ____________________
