Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to entertain a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde]. I would ask the sponsor of the just-passed Congressional Review Act of 1996, the gentleman from Illinois and chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary [Mr. Hyde], whether the bill, if signed by the President this week will apply to the Department of Agriculture's rules that will be promulgated under the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act.
