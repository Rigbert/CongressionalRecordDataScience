Mr. Speaker, as the 105th Congress convenes today, I am pleased to reintroduce the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation is to enable the homeless, who are citizens of this country, to vote. The bill would remove the legal and administrative barriers that inhibit them from exercising this right. No one should be excluded from registering to vote simply because they do not have a home. But in many States, the homeless are left out and left behind. That is not right. It is not fair. It is not the way of this country.  During this century, we have removed major obstacles that prevented many of our citizens from voting. Not too long ago, people had topay a poll tax or own property to vote. Women and minorities were prohibited from casting the ballot.  Before the Civil Rights Movement, there were areas in the South where 50 to 80 percent of the population was black. Yet, there was not a single registered black voter. In 1964, three young men in rural Mississippi gave their lives while working to register people to vote. Many people shedded blood and some even died to secure voting rights protection for all Americans.  Mr. Speaker, over 30 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson proposed that we ``eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and opportunity to vote.'' Eight months later, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, making it possible for millions of Americans to enter the political process. The time is long overdue to ensure that every American has the opportunity to exercise this fundamental right.  Our Nation has made progress. The 19th amendment finally gave women the right to vote. The motor voter law made voter registration more accessible to working people. Yet, despite tremendous progress, we still have work to do. I have dedicated my life to ensuring that every American is treated equally and that everyone has the right to register and vote. I ask my colleagues to join me in opening the political process to every American--even those without a home. I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring and supporting passage of the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1997.                          ____________________
