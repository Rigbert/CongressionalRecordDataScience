  Simply put, there are Internet companies that are profiting off the rape and abuse of children. This must stop.  One way we can combat sex trafficking over the Internet is to make it a crime for a person such as the owner of a Web site to knowingly advertise a commercial sex act with a minor. As I said, Senator Kirk and I have introduced such an amendment. It would create a new offense of knowingly advertising a commercial sex act with a minor on the Internet.  The amendment is identical to a House bill that has 52 cosponsors and passed that Chamber by voice vote.  If we come to a point where we are voting on amendments to Senator Cornyn's bill, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I know Senator Kirk and I would bring it to the floor.  Last October, 53 attorneys general offered a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the bill that Senator Kirk and I introduced last June that is similar to the amendment. This is the list of the attorneys general.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of 53 attorneys general.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                                            Attorneys General,                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2014.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We, the      undersigned state and territorial attorneys general, urge you      to join us in the fight against human trafficking in the      United States. We commend your recent action to pass      legislation to increase federal penalties and victim      restitution and encourage you to act to protect children from      being trafficked on the Internet by passing S. 2536, the Stop      Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act (SAVE Act).       Human trafficking is tied as the second largest and is the      fastest growing criminal industry in the world, generating      roughly $150 billion each year. According to a study of      Department of Justice human trafficking task force cases, 83      percent of sex trafficking victims identified in the United      States were U.S. citizens. Shockingly, there are numerous      cases nationally of children being used in prostitution as      young as 12.       Every day, children in the United States are sold for sex.      The use of the ``adult services sections'' on websites such      as Backpage.com has created virtual brothels where children      are bought and sold using euphemistic labels such as      ``escorts.'' The involvement of these advertising companies      is not accidental--these companies have constructed their      business models around income gained from those participating      in commercial sex. In just one week this June, law      enforcement arrested 281 alleged sex traffickers and took 168      children out of prostitution in a nationwide FBI crackdown      where many child victims were offered for sale on ``escort''      and other ``adult services'' websites. Organized crime groups      as well as street gangs are involved with human trafficking,      and many of these perpetrators use the Internet to sell their      victims.       The undersigned attorneys general respectfully request that      the Senate Judiciary Committee pass the SAVE Act so that      these websites that are facilitating trafficking through      their very business model will have to take steps to verify      the identity of individuals posting advertisements and the      age of those who appear in these advertisements.       We thank you in advance for your continued dedication to      the eradication of human trafficking.
