Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations and the countries awarded for being the most peaceful in the world.  Let me begin by congratulating those Nations that were selected to participate in the Symposium--Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Japan, Malawi, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Uruguay, and Vietnam.  Earlier this year, I led a congressional delegation to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King's visit to follow in the footsteps of Gandhi. Soon afterwards, my good friend Mrs. Harriet Fulbright, widow of the late, great Senator J. William Fulbright, and her staff introduced me to the Global Peace Index and the Symposium.  Mahatma Gandhi once said,''Peace will not come out of a clash of arms but out of justice lived and done by unarmed nations in the face of odds.'' As Mrs. Fulbright explained the symposium and the GPI, I was impressed by the methodology of the research, the focus on peace, and the true commitment to improving the global community.  Every year Vision of Humanity researchers develop the Global Peace Index, GPI, based on a variety of economic and analytical factors. The results are based on a variety of economic and social indicators that rank over 140 countries on their peacefulness and evaluate the economic benefit of peace. The Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations then brings together representatives from the two most peaceful countries in each of the nine global regions on the GPI.  While here, the delegates engage in comprehensive dialogue about how to build and maintain peace. The countries that participate in the forum have unique histories, perspectives, and domestic and regional realities, but they must be commended in their significant progress in combating domestic poverty and making strides towards creating more peaceful communities. Together, we have a collective responsibility to combat poverty and violence and promote peace, diplomacy, and stability.  I hope that all my colleagues will find time to review the report and the Symposium summary. Again, let me commend the Global Symposium for this international forum highlighting the strategies and benefits of global peace.                          ____________________
