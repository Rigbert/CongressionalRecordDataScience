Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that was crafted in conjunction with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson) and the administration to fund the microfinance loan facility.  The amendment provides that up to $5 million may be used to leverage up to $30 million to rescue a U.S.-supported microenterprise institution whose financial situation has been undermined by natural catastrophes or other events out of the control of that institution.  We have seen key microfinance institutions undermined in Bangladesh and Central America where it is hard to run a bank after all your clients have been killed or made homeless by a flood or by a hurricane. With the ad hoc rescue packages we have assembled in the past, we have been able to not only prevent the collapse of U.S.-backed microfinance institutions, but to turn them into lending agents of the recovery process, especially in Honduras.  This amendment would help create a microfinance loan facility to ensure that we no longer have to put together ad hoc packages to rescue such institutions. I think it is a good amendment, and I hope it has the full support of the Chamber.
