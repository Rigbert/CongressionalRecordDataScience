Chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) and I have discussed this amendment, and I know we discussed it with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Turner) as well. I want my colleagues to know that I very much appreciate the gentleman's focus on this and his concern with this, and hopefully this matter can be resolved.  Mr. Chairman, it would be my intention not to object to the adoption of this amendment at this time.
