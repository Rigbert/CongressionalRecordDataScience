 First off, I would note, as he typically does, the Senator from Arizona came and talked to me before and was very straightforward with what he was going to do.  This talks about recoveries available under the False Claims Act. I think the Senate expert on the False Claims Act is Senator Grassley, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley opposes this, as do I. I know there are going to be other amounts the distinguished Republican leader is going to bring up, but my reason in opposing them--and he has explained each one of them to me ahead of time, so there is no surprise--but I will oppose them because I believe without whistleblowers, a lot of these billions of dollars in fraud that have been found wouldn't have been found. Without the whistleblowers, the Government--the American taxpayers--wouldn't recover so much.
