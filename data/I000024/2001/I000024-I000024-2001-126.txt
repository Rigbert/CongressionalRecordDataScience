President, it is my privilege to stand before you today to honor a man who has lived to see three centuries. On February 23, 2001, Mr. John Harries, of Edmond, Oklahoma, will be 107 years old.  Born on a farm twelve miles west of Waukegan, Illinois, in 1894, John has witnessed many major events throughout his lifetime, including two world wars. Showing true patriotism, he left dental school and joined the army at the onset of World War I. While fighting in France, he was exposed to mustard gas, which severely damaged his lungs. But the sacrifices he made in the name of freedom did not go unnoticed. Recently, France awarded him the French Legion of Honor for his service. This is the highest medal that the French award to foreigners.  Retiring in 1967, John spent most of his professional life at Salerno Baking Company in Chicago, where he was chief salesman. He was married to his wife, Mildred, for 66 years until her death in July, 2000. He then moved to Oklahoma, where he now lives with his niece, Nancy Pruett. I am proud to honor John Harries for his service and dedication to our country and his long life. Please join me in wishing him a wonderful 107th birthday.                          ____________________
