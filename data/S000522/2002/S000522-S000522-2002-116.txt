Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Con. Res. 213 regarding the plight of North Korean refugees inside of China. I want to thank the chief sponsor, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), for introducing this important resolution nearly a year ago, long before this issue had hit the U.S. press. I also want to thank him for accepting language that I suggested that goes into more detail about the human rights situation inside of North Korea, and, most importantly, language that urges the State Department to begin work now and draft and pass a North Korea human rights resolution at next year's session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.  It is amazing to me that such a deplorable situation has received so little attention from the international community. That shameful silence must end.  Mr. Speaker, as has been described by my colleagues, hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are inside China today having fled from starvation and brutal repression inside of North Korea. Although many of them have left in search of food, many of them are genuine refugees. Many more of them, however, have become refugees because of the persecution that they would face if forcibly returned.  North Koreans who attempt to escape to third countries or who have contact with South Korean or missionary groups while in China face execution or imprisonment in labor camps in North Korea. As the front page of yesterday's New York Times pointed out, pregnant women returned to North Korea are forced to undergo abortions or their babies are killed once they are born. I will include that article for the Record.  At the ground breaking hearing, Mr. Speaker, convened by the gentleman from Iowa (Chairman Leach) of the Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific last month, we heard from three credible North Korean defectors who described the unbelievable brutality of the Pyongyang regime and the hardships those witnesses endured as refugees inside of China.  Two of the witnesses were rare survivors of North Korea's concentration camps, where nearly 200,000 of their countrymen and women are being held today. These camps are places where prisoners are worked or starved to death, where Christians are killed by torture, where people attempting to escape are publicly shot or dragged to death behind trucks, where newborn babies are killed in front of their mothers, and where prisoners are used as guinea pigs for chemical weapons experiments. The Korean people in the north are suffering unspeakable evil at the hands of Kim Jong Il.  Mr. Speaker, as a party to the U.N. refugee convention, China has bound itself not to return North Koreans who face a well-founded fear of persecution. However, for much of the past year, Chinese authorities have conducted a crackdown against North Korean refugees. They have routinely rounded up many North Koreans and forcibly sent them back to uncertain and sometimes deadly fates. North Korean undercover agents are active inside China helping to capture and return escapees.  Mr. Speaker, I urge strong supports for this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I include the New York Times article, ``Defectors From North Korea Tell of Prison Baby Killings'' for the Record.                [From the New York Times, June 10, 2002]        Defectors From North Korea Tell of Prison Baby Killings                           (By James Brooke)       Seoul, South Korea.--On a cold March day, the bleak      monotony of a North Korean prison work detail was broken when      a squad of male guards arrived and herded new women prisoners      together. One by one, they were asked if they were pregnant.       ``They took them away in a car, and then forcibly gave them      abortion shots,'' Song Myung Hak, 33, a former prisoner,      recalled in a interview here about the day two years ago when      six pregnant prisoners were taken from his work unit in the      Shinuiju Provincial Detention Camp. ``After the miscarriage      shots, the women were forced back to work.''       More and more escapees from North Korea are asserting that      forced abortions and infanticide are the norm in North Korean      prisons, charges the country's official Korean Central News      Agency has denounced as ``a whopping lie.''       In 2000 and 2001, China deported thousands of North Korean      refugees, with many ending up in North Korean prison camps.      People who later managed to escape again, to China and South      Korea, say that prisoners discovered to be pregnant were      routinely forced to have abortions. If babies were born      alive, they say, guards forced prisoners to kill them.       Earlier defectors from North Korea say that the prohibition      on pregnancy in prisons dates back at least to the 1980's,      and that forced abortions or infanticide were the rule. Until      recently, though, instances of pregnancy in the prisons were      rare.       China's deportations of thousands of illegal migrants from      North Korea in recent years has resulted in a sharp increase      in the number of pregnant women ending up in North Korean      prisons. Defectors, male and female, are reviled as traitors      and counterrevolutionaries when they are returned to North      Korea. But women who have become pregnant, especially by      Chinese men, face special abuse.       ``Several hundred babies were killed last year in North      Korean prisons,'' said Willy Fautre, director of Human Rights      Without Frontiers, a private group based in Brussels. Mr.      Fautre said that over the last 18 months, he and his      volunteers had interviewed 35 recent escapees from North      Korean camps.       Of the 35, he said, 31 said they had witnessed babies      killed by abandonment or being smothered with plastic sheets.      Two defectors later described burying dead babies, and two      said they were mothers who saw their newborns put to death.       ``This is a systematic procedure carried out by guards, and      the people in charge of the prisons--these are not isolated      cases,'' Mr. Fautre said in a telephone interview. ``The      pattern is to identify women who are pregnant, so the camp      authorities can get rid of the babies through forced      abortion, torture or very hard labor. If they give birth to a      baby alive, the general policy is to let the baby die or to      help the baby die with a plastic sheet.''       Lee Soon Ok, who worked as an accountant for six years at      Kaechon political prison, recalled in an interview that she      twice saw prison doctors kill newborn babies, sometimes by      stepping on their necks.       With virtually no medical care available for prisoners,      surgical abortions were not an option. Ms. Lee, 54 and an      economic researcher in Seoul, said: ``Giving birth in prison      is 100 percent prohibited. That is why they kill those      babies.''       Ms. Lee, who has written a book about her prison      experiences, seeks to focus attention on North Korea's prison      system. On May 2, she was one of three North Korean defectors      who testified on human rights abuses at a hearing of the      House International Relations Committee.       On Jan. 19, North Korea's official news agency said the      charges by Human Rights Without Borders that ``unborn and      newly born babies are being killed in concentration camps''      were ``nothing but a plot deliberately hatched by it to hurl      mud'' at North Korea. Since then, accusations of baby killing      in North Korean prisons have increased.       They were featured in February at a human rights conference      on North Korea, in Tokyo, and in March the claims were      included for the first time in the State Department's annual      human rights report on North Korea. They were raised in April      by European Union delegates to the United Nations Commission      on Human Rights, and in May by a former North Korean prisoner      who testified before a House committee.       North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not return      telephone messages about the charges. But on May 9, at the      United Nations conference on children in New York, the North      Korean delegate said his nation regarded each child as a      ``king of the country.''       But recent interviews with seven defectors now living in      the Seoul area provided a detailed and different picture of      North Korean prison camps.       All of the recent defectors except one, Mr. Song, allowed      publication of only their family names, which are common      Korean surnames. These four said they feared reprisals      against relatives in the North. Two defectors, who had      escaped almost a decade ago after working in the prison camp      system, allowed their full names to be used.       The defectors' names and phone numbers were supplied by      Human Rights Without Borders. They were interviewed      individually, in their homes, without human rights or     government officials present. South Korea's government,      seeking to avoid conflict with the North, discourages      defectors from speaking out.       In her Seoul apartment, Mrs. Lee, 64 and no relation to Lee      Song Ok, said she was still haunted by memories of prison      after being deported from China in 2000.       Mrs. Lee who is the widow of a North Korean general,      recalled thinking that she had won an easy job in the clinic      after arriving on June 14, 2000, at the Pyongbuk Provincial      Police Detention Camp. Then, she said, she saw a prison      doctor give injections to eight pregnant women to induce      labor.       ``The first time, a baby was born, I didn't know there was      a wooden box for throwing babies away,'' Mrs. Lee recalled.      ``I got the baby and tried to wrap it in clothes. But the      security people told me to get rid of it in the wooden box.''       That day, she said, she delivered six dead babies and two      live ones. She said she watched a doctor open the box and      kill the two live babies by piercing their skulls with      surgical scissors. The next day, she said, she helped to      deliver 11 dead babies from 20 pregnant women who had been      injected to induce delivery.       In 2000, from March to May, 8,000 North Korean defectors,      overwhelmingly women, were deported from China to North Korea      during a crackdown on prostitution and forced marriages,      according to D. K. Park, a retired United Nations worker who      works with Human Rights Without Frontiers along the border      between North Korea and China.       ``They blame North Korean women for having Chinese babies      and just kill the babies,'' Mr. Song, now a college student      in Seoul, said of his time in Shinuiju prison in 2000.       Mrs. Park, 41, no relation to the rights worker, said she      was among those caught in a Chinese sweep two years ago,      ending up in a work camp in Onsong, North Korea. She was nine      months pregnant at the time.       ``One day, they gave me a big injection,'' she said. ``In      about 30 minutes I went into labor. The baby I delivered at      the detention camp was already dead.''       For babies born alive in prison cells, defectors say, male      guards threaten to beat women prisoners if they do not      smother newborns with pieces of wet plastic that are thrown      between the bars.       ``Guards told the prisoners to kill the babies,'' recalled      Miss Lee, a 33-year-old vocational student who is unrelated      to the accountant and the general's widow. She said that in      2000, as she was moved among four camps, she saw four babies      smothered at the Onsong District Labor Camp in April, and      three smothered at the Chongjin Provincial Police Detention      Camp in late May.       ``The oldest woman in the cell did it reluctantly,'' she      said. ``The young women were scared. The mothers would just      cry in silence.''       Miss Lee, a former factory worker who survived in China      through marriage to an ethnic Korean Chinese, estimated that      70 percent of the people she saw deported from China in the      spring of 2000 were women, and about one-third were pregnant.       In the summer of 2001, a 28-year-old former North Korean      border guard surnamed Kim was imprisoned at the same Chongjin      detention camp. There, he buried three newborn babies wrapped      in ``blue-tinted plastic bags.'' He recalled, ``The prisoners      were ordered to get the babies coming from the mothers and to      kill them.''       His wife, a 25-year-old day-care worker in Seoul, said in      the same interview at their apartment here that during her 10      weeks at the same camp last summer, she counted seven babies      born and smothered in nearby cells.       The current wave of reported baby killings has      nationalistic overtones.       ``The guards would scream at us: `You are carrying Chinese      sperm, from foreign countries. We Koreans are one people, how      dare you bring this foreign sperm here,' '' Miss Lee, the      vocational student, recalled. ``Most of the fathers were      Chinese.''       But two decades before pregnant refugees were forced home      from China, infanticide was standard practice in the North      Korean prison system, a former guard said in an interview      near here.       ``Ever since Kim II Sung's time, it has been a North Korean      regulation to prevent women from delivering babies in      prisons,'' said Ahn Myung Chul, a 33-year-old bank employee,      who worked as a guard from 1987 to 1994 in four North Korean      camps. Mr. Ahn, who also trained guards, added in an      interview: ``If babies have to be delivered, babies have to      be killed. The trainers told military personnel that this is      the procedure.''       Foreign journalists traveling inside North Korea are      restricted to tightly guided tours, and requests by the      International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisons are      routinely rejected.       ``Those of us inside the country have no knowledge of the      existence of prison camps or practices inside them,'' Richard      Bridle, the Unicef representative in North Korea's capital,      Pyongyang, said by telephone. Asked about infanticide      policies, he said: ``The only stories we get are from      outside. There is no information circulating inside'' North      Korea.       North Korea's prison camp system currently holds about      200,000 people in conditions so brutal that an estimated      400,000 people have died in prison since 1972, according to      the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, a private      group based in Washington.       ``Nothing would surprise in accounts of this kind,'' Selig      S. Harrison, the director of the national security program at      the Center for International Policy, in Washington, and an      expert on North Korea, Mr. Harrison, a seven-time visitors to      Pyongyang, added: ``North Korea is a repressive, repugnant,      totalitarian state, and it certainly uses repugnant methods      in its prison system and in its concentration camps.''
