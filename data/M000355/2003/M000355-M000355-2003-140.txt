 The consent agreement provides for a limited list of amendments, and it is hoped we can finish that bill during tomorrow's session.  In addition, moments ago the Senate locked in an agreement with respect to the Syria accountability bill. We will be looking for an opportunity to schedule that bill during Tuesday's session. Therefore, Senators should anticipate rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow.                          ____________________
