Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues and to all of our constituents across the Nation that March, 2005, is National Eye Donor Month. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee, I have long been a champion of the cause of donation and particularly the needs of our nation's eye banks. But it was a special honor to be asked this year to participate in this proclamation, for 2005 marks the centennial of the first corneal transplant performed in 1905 by Dr. Eduard Zirm.  Since Dr. Zirm performed that first corneal transplant one hundred years ago, and in partnership since 1944 with our nation's eye banks, we have made tremendous progress. Each year in the United States, more than 46,000 people, ranging in age from nine days to 107 years old, have had their sight restored through corneal transplants, and hundreds of thousands are helped through important research to find cures for other blinding diseases.  But we cannot rest on our laurels. The purpose of Eye Donor Month is to educate each and every American individual and family about giving the gift of sight and to make a terrific difference in someone's life. This month marks an opportunity to raise public awareness and to honor past donors and their families. The process to become a donor takes just a few minutes. All donors need to do is to sign a card, and, most importantly, discuss their donation wishes with their families. Our eye banks across the nation, in partnership with the Eye Bank Association of America., will continue to work to ensure that all Americans will receive the tissue they need and that this tissue will be safe and effective.  As National Eye Donor Month proceeds, I encourage my colleagues to work with their local eye banks to increase awareness of corneal transplantation and the continuous need for donors, and I encourage all Americans to sign a donor card and speak with their families about their desire to give the gift of sight.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E513-E514]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH--MARCH, 2005                                 ______                                                             HON.
