 BENNETT. I would be honored.  Mr. McCONNELL. If I recall correctly, this is not the first election under which independent groups have been extraordinarily active in advertising in political campaigns. In fact, I recall quite precisely that independent groups aligned with the other side of the aisle, according to those who keep the statistics on this, spent twice as much in 2006 and a similar amount in 2008 as outside groups that might be typically aligned with Senators such as Bennett and McConnell. Where was the outrage a couple cycles ago?  I would ask my friend, did Citizens United in any serious way change the landscape, in any event?
