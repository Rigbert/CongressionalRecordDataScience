Chair, I thank the gentlewoman.  It takes care of the challenge that we had when there was no quorum, and the fact that we had no quorum was all about politics.  Don't make this about politics as well. An estimate of 80,000 jobs, $150 billion lost because we didn't have a quorum. Let's not twist in the wind.  This bill has 95 percent agreement. The gentleman who spoke before me said he voted for this last time. There is no change that, in my opinion, warrants a change in heart.  I know that there is some upset that the bipartisan bill that was agreed to didn't fly, but it didn't fly mostly because the outside came in and said: This will not help us; this will not affect the end that we want. That record ought to be clear, Mr. Chairman.  So the chairwoman worked on bringing a bill to the floor that will help. She has done that. I hope my colleagues will put their partisanship behind them, put protecting, frankly, their positioning in terms of negotiation behind them and vote for this bill.  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 6 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 5 minutes remaining.  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I would commend for the House that, yes, there is an opportunity for bipartisanship. I think that will be on the CR to extend the Export-Import Bank. It is an important institution. At its height, it supported almost 2 percent of American exports. It is a small amount of global trade, but it is important. We want to make sure the Bank continues to function, but this is not the bill to do that. We will take care of that in another vehicle, and I am hopeful we can have a bipartisan vote there.  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), my colleague.
