Mr. Speaker, they are at it again. Last night, the Republicans increased premiums for Medicare. They sneaked it in at the final hour. They sneaked it in on the same day they gave one more tax break to their rich corporate friends.  Mr. Speaker, this proposal raises premiums for seniors by 20 percent--by 20 percent. That is not fair. That is not right--not when 11 million women on Medicare have incomes less than $8,000. For these women--every dollar counts, and now they must pay more.  Why was this done? Seniors have a right to know why. There was only one reason--my Republican colleagues must give tax breaks to the rich. This premium increase will not help the Medicare trust fund. But it will help the Republican's rich friends. And it will hurt our Nation's seniors.  That is not right. Shame on the Republicans, shame.                          ____________________
