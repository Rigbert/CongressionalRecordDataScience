 The Town Council elected Charles H. Davidson as the first Fire Chief, and 26 men signed up as volunteer firefighters. R.B. Hopkins was named President.  In remembering the founding of the company, its current president, Lynn Rogers, rightly noted that, although the formal Ladies Auxiliary was not organized until years later, the women of Milton provided vital support to the town's fire service from the very start.  By a vote of 76 to 33, the citizens of Milton voted to purchase a fire truck, and the Town bought a Howe chemical and water engine, with the then hefty price tag of $1,250. In 1902, there was another purchase, a Fire King hose cart that can still be found at the Milton fire station today.  It wasn't long before the resources of the Milton Fire Company and its members were tested to their fullest; a disastrous fire struck the town in August of 1909. In just four hours, with the firefighters and the citizens working together against it, the fire raged through the lower part of Milton, destroying 18 buildings in the business district.  It was the kind of devastation that challenges the spirit and character of a community, just as we have been challenged as a nation this fall. And in the tradition of the American spirit and the American character, Milton came back, with its Fire Company helping to lead the way.  The Milton Fire Department has been a leader in the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association from the first meeting in 1921; the current President of the DVFA, Dale Callaway, is from Milton. The Department's leadership has been marked by incredible dedication, with officers who regularly serve for 25 years or more. Just one of many possible examples of this dedication, was when Linwood ``Jim'' Rogers asked to be replaced after 41 years as Treasurer, Denny Hughes took over, and he continues to hold the office 23 years later.  Over the years, the Milton Fire Department has grown with the town, with a new building dedicated in 1950, an additional property purchase in the 1960s and a renovation and addition in the early 1980s. An ambulance service has grown, from the first ambulance purchase in 1948, to the dedication of members of the Ladies Auxiliary in the 1970s, who took ambulance attendant courses to ensure quality service.  Lynn Rogers made another comment at the 100th anniversary celebration that I would like to cite. He said, ``The fire service of Delaware is a family. We no longer grow as one department; the fire service grows together; we depend on each other more every day, with the specialized emergencies that we all face.''  Even beyond the family of our small State, to the broader community of our Nation, we have learned that lesson together in recent weeks--the depths of our bond to one another, how we depend on each other, and the debt and support we owe to those we rely upon in an emergency.  The great tradition of the fire service is alive and well in Milton, DE, and as we approach November 14th, the 100th anniversary of the Milton Fire Department, I am proud to share the pride of Delaware, and to convey the congratulations of the United States Senate, to Chief Jack Hudson, President Lynn Rogers and all the members and friends of the Milton Fire Department and Ladies Auxiliary.                          ____________________
