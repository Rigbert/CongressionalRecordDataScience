Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1501 authorizes the National Park Service to conduct a study of the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Brooklyn, New York, to determine its eligibility to become a unit in the National Park Service.  The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park is a memorial to the more than 11,500 American prisoners of war who died in captivity aboard 16 British prison ships during the American Revolutionary War.  The study authorized by this legislation will determine if the site meets the test of national significance and provide different Federal, local, and nongovernmental management proposals. The study is informational. Congress would still have to act on separate legislation to designate the monument as a park.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us brought by the gentleman from New York has tremendous merit. This is a chapter of history that many of us have forgotten or didn't learn in school, but the 11,500 lives that were lost aboard British prison ships while our country fought for its independence during the Revolutionary War is certainly a very, very important national and nationally significant site.                              {time}  1745  The site has been managed by the New York Department of Parks and Recreation, but the gentleman from New York has rightly pointed out in his advocacy that this should actually be a site that has national significance. He therefore has authored--and hopefully today we will successfully see passed--H.R. 1501, which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to complete a study within 1 year on the feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, New York, as a unit of the National Park System. I would hope that this legislation would be broadly supported.  With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).
