President, I and my colleague from Vermont Senator Jeffords, would like to engage Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, Senator Graham, and Senator Mack in a colloquy regarding Senator Graham's disaster assistance amendment. I can certainly sympathize with what Senator Graham and Senator Mack are trying to do tonight with this amendment, and I support their amendment. The fires that have struck Florida in recent weeks have shocked people from across the country, and undoubtedly the damage to agriculture in the state has been severe. However, I would like to bring attention to the fact that a number of other states have also suffered significant damage from natural disasters in recent months. My own state of Vermont suffered significant flooding early this month. Eight of the state's fourteen counties were declared disaster areas. Other parts of the country are also suffering agricultural damage including areas of the west and southeast which are suffering serious drought conditions. Damage from these disasters is still being determined, however by the time we go to conference with the House on the Agriculture Appropriations bill, we will have a better idea about the extent of those damages. I hope that at that point we can revisit this disaster assistance and adjust the funding levels to reflect the full extent of agricultural damage from natural disasters being suffered by farmers throughout the country.
