Chairman, the previous speaker from the other side of the aisle, the PAC-pure gentleman from Tennessee, says that this bill is not a dollar short, referring to the Republican alternative. Amen, brother. It is a dollar long. It is dollars long. It is hundreds of thousands of dollars long. It is millions of dollars long. It ain't a dollar short. You said it like it is.  The American public wants less, not more money in campaigns. That is the message. That is what the Farr bill says, and is not what your bill says.  I tell my friend from Tennessee, it is not the Members that are calling it a sham. It is the community, the citizens, the activists who have been working for reform who call it a sham.                              {time}  1530  I say to my colleagues, you bet. It's a dollar long, not a dollar short.
