President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the lifetime of service that Mary Miller has given to the state of Vermont. I have been fortunate to have had Mary in my Montpelier office, working for the people of Vermont for 17 years. Anyone involved in rural development, small business, or affordable housing has undoubtedly seen for themselves her whole-hearted commitment to these issues which are so important for our small state. Even before joining my staff Mary was working to improve the lives of her fellow Vermonters through her service to Common Cause, and as a state legislator for her home base in Rutland County.  It is difficult to put into words Mary's boundless energy, her enthusiasm--and her ability to simultaneously make Vermonters feel good about what they are doing while helping them achieve their goals. At times I have felt that members of Congress are only Constitutional impediments to our staff. Mary is a humbling case in point. I have met hundreds of thousands of Vermonters over the past 25 years. I have been to every corner of the state many times over--and it's fair to say that often more people recognize Mary than recognize me. Sometimes it is not even close.  There is no mud season too miserable, no pothole too large, and no snowfall too deep to keep Mary from meeting with Vermonters. I remember one spring in particular when she traveled for miles over muddy, rutted dirt roads to meet a small business owner who had benefitted from one of the revolving loan funds I have worked to set up around the state. As I recall, in this particular case the owner was not home, but his dog was and gave her quite a reception. He may be the only revolving loan fund recipient in the state that Mary has not met, and even his dog would recognize her.  Despite this outreach schedule, that would put many of her chronologically challenged co-workers to shame, Mary has always found time for fun. Even as she approaches the age when more conventional people are thinking about retirement, Mary is planning her next white water rafting trip.  I know I am not alone in saying that I will miss her lively presence in the office. I will miss her colorful reports on the weather which close out the daily press brief and her unflaggingsupport for the Red Sox. But I don't plan on letting her get away too easily--I have Mary's e-mail address and it will be well used.  Mary is not retiring, just shifting her focus to new challenges, such as the mountains yet to be climbed, rivers yet to be rafted, grandchildren yet to be born. I know that her husband Sam is looking forward to seeing more of Mary as much as I regret seeing her leave. Vermont is lucky to have had Mary to itself for all these years.                          ____________________
