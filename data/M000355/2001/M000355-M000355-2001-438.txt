 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, March 21, at 2 p.m., to conduct an oversight hearing. The subcommittee will receive testimony on the Klamath Project in Oregon, including implementation of PL 106-498 and how the project might operate in what is projected to be a short water year.
