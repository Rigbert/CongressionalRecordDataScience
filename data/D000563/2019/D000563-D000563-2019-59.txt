President, I am going to take a chance this afternoon and vote for one of the President's nominees. Some of my colleagues have come up to me and said I am making a big mistake, and I hope I am not.  His name is Stephen Hahn. He is a medical doctor and an oncologist from MD Anderson in Texas, and he has been named to serve as the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner.  This is a relatively small agency by Federal standards that has a major-size impact on the lives of Americans and beyond. I think it is one of our most important agencies. It regulates so many things relating to safety and quality of life, and Dr. Hahn would come to this position at an auspicious moment in our history.  I refer, of course, to the fact that we are now battling a vaping epidemic across the United States of America.
