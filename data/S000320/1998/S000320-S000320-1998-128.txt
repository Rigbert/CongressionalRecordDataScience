 President, I rise today to honor Mr. Michael E. Stephens, the founder of ReLife, Inc., a nation-wide rehabilitation system, and the namesake of the Michael E. Stephens College of Business at the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Mr. Stephens is a remarkable man, a distinguished citizen and a leader in the field of health care and physical rehabilitation.  Mr. Stephens was born and raised in Alabama and began attending the University of Montevallo in 1962. However, his path through college was a long, complicated one. Though Michael Stephens is today a highly successful entrepreneur, recognized for his many accomplishments and his generous civic spirit, his first attempt at college was incomplete! Instead, Mr. Stephens left the University in 1966 for a series of jobs in the insurance industry. Several years later, at the age of 26, he broke his neck in a horrible diving accident. Despite being told he would never walk again, with extensive rehabilitation--and steely determination--Michael Stephens overcame the most significant obstacle of his life. Amazingly, he fully recovered in less than a year, and almost ten years after he had begun his college education, Mr. Stephens returned to the University of Montevallo.  Michael Stephens received his undergraduate degree in business from the University of Montevallo in 1973 and his Master's Degree in 1975 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He went to work in rehabilitative services for the Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital. Based upon his own experience, Mr. Stephens was committed to providing comprehensive services and quality care to people with physical disabilities. Under his leadership, Lakeshore Hospital became a world-class rehabilitative center. By introducing new rehabilitative services, such as speech therapy, recreational programs, psychological counseling and outpatient job training, Mr. Stephens created a new way of dealing with disability. In fact, Forbes Magazine said, ``Stephens turned little Lakeshore into a model laboratory for his idea about rehabilitation.'' In the mid-1980's, he founded the Lakeshore Foundation, a non-profit organization designed to assist people with physical disabilities. Specifically, the Foundation focused on training athletes. Almost overnight, Mr. Stephens' athletic program grew. Lakeshore's athletes went on to become among the most successful in the paralympics: breaking records in all events and winning numerous gold, silver and bronze medals. His successful approach to rehabilitation led to his founding of ReLife, a publicly-traded national health-services corporation, in 1986.  Through ReLife, Mr. Stephens realized his dream of reinventing rehabilitation. By 1992, ReLife ran over forty rehabilitation facilities. In 1994, when ReLife merged with HealthSouth Corporation, Michael Stephens focused his attention and considerable talents on other needs of his community. He became a member of the board of trustees of the Alabama Symphony Orchestra and the Naples, Florida Philharmonic Center for the Arts. Additionally, he is a former member of both the President's Committee on Hiring the Handicapped and the National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities and is active in the Alabama State Health Coordinating Council. Mr. Stephens' businessprowess is not limited to rehabilitation: he also owns several car dealerships, a real estate development company and a champion horse breeding farm.  His leadership was recognized by the University of Montevallo in 1995, when he was awarded the Doctor of Humane Letters. Mr. Stephens serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of the University, and recently donated one million dollars to their capital funds campaign.  As a result of business endeavors, community service, philanthropic projects and long-standing support for higher education, on October 9, 1997, the University of Montevallo honored Mr. Stephens by deciding to re-name the business school the Michael E. Stephens College of Business. The citation issued by the University's Board of Trustees stated: ``His leadership and service deserve lasting recognition and are worthy of holding as exemplary to this and future generations of Montevallo students, faculty, alumni and friends.'' Mr. Stephens has promised to remain very active in the Stephens College of Business, and I believe that all of the current and future Montevallo students will benefit greatly from his involvement.  On that day last year, Michael Stephens, loved and respected by all who have known him, was honored as a friend and leader to not only the University of Montevallo, but all the citizens of Alabama. I, too, want to honor Mr. Stephen's example of strength, vision, courage and community spirit. On behalf of my wife, Annette, an alumna of the University of Montevallo, we wish Michael Stephens our sincerest thanks and congratulations for his dedication to making a difference.                          ____________________
