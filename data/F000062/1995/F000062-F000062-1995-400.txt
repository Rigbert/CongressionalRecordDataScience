 President, the Associated Press story to which I refer cited two particularly alarming items.  First, the owner of a harbor warehouse in Los Angeles who continues to this day to profit from a Customs Service inspection station located on his property, even though he is currently under federal indictment on charges of bribing an immigration agent $10,000 for false documents for himself and employees.  Second, the Treasury Department inspector general's office has failed to secure a single indictment of a Federal official in the western region in the last 5 years, despite numerous allegations of wrongdoing.  The inspector general's office, which is responsible for investigating criminal offenses at the Customs Service and other agencies within the Treasury Department, has been successful in other regions of the country, having obtained 14 felony convictions in the Northeast region, 8 in the Southern region, and 1 in the Central Division--but none in the Western region where the problem is the most serious.  These allegations are very disturbing, and I believe they deserve the full and immediate attention of the Justice Department.                          Operation Hard Line  The Clinton administration recently announced a new Federal initiative to address the problem of cocaine smuggling across the southwest border. This effort, termed ``Operation Hard Line,'' will transfer between 40 and 80 Customs agents to the southwest border, direct new funds toward needed resources and technology, and focus with greater intensity on intelligence-gathering and assessment.  It is too early to say if Operation Hard Line will have an impact. But I am very skeptical. The problems at the border are simply too great for Band-Aid solutions.  Enforcing the border is a Federal responsibility and the fact is that the job is not being adequately performed.  The Federal Government must take strong action and make a long-term commitment to go after drug traffickers. The administration must demand that Mexico assist the United States in this effort in every way, as this Nation is assisting Mexico in so many other areas.  Forty 727-size planes constantly land in northern Mexico, offload tons of cocaine, and move them through our borders. How this happens and how we are going to stop it is something we must address. We cannot tolerate corruption at high levels in the Government of Mexico as is now being written up on the front pages of our newspapers, where a Mexican official responsible for stopping narcotics has a bank account of several million dollars. Where do we believe that money came from?  As a member of both the Judiciary and the Foreign Relations Committees, I intend to take an aggressive oversight role of Federal efforts to stop drug smuggling across this Nation's borders and will report regularly to my colleagues in the Senate on the progress.  I will also begin to explore legislation to deny United States foreign aid to countries such as Colombia, who do not take appropriate steps to control the flow of contraband out of their own countries.  This administration has just sent $20 billion in loan guarantees to Mexico, of which $6 billion has already been drawn down. I think the United States deserves cooperation from the highest levels of the Mexican Government in what is a major scourge on the relationship between our two countries, the trafficking of large amounts of cocaine.  Shortly, I hope to see for myself the Customs Service's surveillance efforts at the border. Recently, it was described in a television report on NBC's ``Dateline.'' What the story showed was a former Customs agent pointing out a truck, a huge container truck, going right through a Customs' checkpoint, and saying, ``This truck is a known drug smuggler. Watch what happens.'' And the truck went right through under the ``line release'' program.  I find it hard to accept that the Federal Government is so desperate to increase commerce that it will allow drugs to freely enter the United States.  Mr. President, I thank you for providing me with this opportunity to update my colleagues. I will report further on developments.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 12, 1995]           Border Inspections Eased and Drug Seizures Plunge                             (By H.G. Reza)   customs: corruption probes focus on u.s. policy to promote mexico                     trade. few trucks are examined.       San Diego.--The amount of cocaine seized from Mexican      trucks and cargo at the border plummeted last year, as U.S.      Customs Service officials pressed on with a program to      promote trade by letting most commercial cargo pass into this      country without inspection.       Not a single pound of cocaine was confiscated from more      than 2 million trucks that passed through three of the      busiest entry points along the Southwest border where federal      officials say most of the drug enters the country.       Of the 62,000 pounds of cocaine that Customs seized from      commercial cargo nationwide, less than a ton was taken from      shipments along the border with Mexico.       One reason for the sharp decline in seizures is that      Customs officials appear to be doing a poor job of      identifying and inspecting those trucks and cargo containers      being used for drug smuggling, according to an internal      report obtained by The Times.       ``The target selection methods are * * * critical and      apparently in more need of improvements given the huge number      of examinations without success,'' said the Dec. 13 report by      a Customs analyst.       Officials say liberalized importing procedures have      dramatically increased the number of trucks crossing the      border from Mexico, producing trade benefits for both      countries. And now the Customs Service is considering new      measures to speed up the entry of air and auto travelers into      the United States.       But, according to records and interviews, the facilitation      policy also has become the focal point of wide-ranging      corruption probes at a number of Southwest border crossings      and inspection facilities.       [[Page S4007]] Since last summer, federal authorities have      been looking into allegations that corrupt Customs officials      and inspectors are tipping smugglers that certain shipments      and vehicles have been targeted for narcotics inspections.       Sources said investigators also are examining allegations      that:       Some inspectors and officials in San Diego were bribed by      Mexican drug rings to remove intelligence information from      Customs computers.       Investigators also are focusing on allegations that      smugglers are transporting drugs in the uninspected trucks      that bring cargo from Mexico.       A principal target, sources said, is an inspector who in      1990 attempted to release a propane tanker although drug-     sniffing dogs had sounded the alarm. The tanker later was      found to be carrying four tons of cocaine.       Inspectors and officials in the Long Beach area were bribed      to allow trucks from Mexico and contraband, including AK-47      rifles and ammunition from China, to be smuggled into the      ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles in ship containers.       The investigation is concentrating on private warehouses in      the Long Beach area where cargo containers are examined by      Customs inspectors for contraband, drugs and compliance with      importation laws. The warehouses are customarily paid a fee      for use of their facilities and assisting in the inspections.       But sources said importers allegedly were charged up to      $425 per container for hundreds of examinations that were      never done. Investigators have been told that two Customs      officials received kickbacks.       In interviews, Justice Department officials declined to      confirm or deny the existence of the investigations. ``If      anyone has information regarding corruption within the      Customs Service, we would certainly be interested in      receiving that information,'' said Assistant U.S. Atty.      Michael Flanagan in Los Angeles, who is overseeing some of      the investigations.       Customs officials declined to comment on the      investigations. They also defended their low seizure rates      and the ``facilitation program'' that since the late 1980s      has allowed increasing numbers of trucks and cargo containers      to go uninspected at the border.       Lou Samenfink, Customs cargo control branch chief in      Washington, said he does not know why seizures have fallen      off and pointed out that the Customs Service instituted a new      and improved random system in October for identifying      shipments to be inspected.       ``It could just as easily be that [drugs are] not there,''      he said. ``It could certainly mean that our targeting policy      is wrong, or that it's so effective that the smugglers aren't      using commercial cargo to bring drugs in.''       The Drug Enforcement Administration reports that 244,626      pounds of cocaine were seized nationwide by federal law      enforcement agencies in 1993, the most recent year for which      statistics are available. And officials estimate that only      about 10% of the cocaine smuggled into the country is seized.       Joaquin Legarreta, spokesman for the DEA intelligence      center in El Paso, said most cocaine enters the United States      across the Mexican border, and most comes through regular      ports of entry in commercial trucks and passenger vehicles.       In 1986, Customs began a ``facilitation'' policy to speed      up the shipment of cargo from Canada, and the program was      expanded to the Mexican border in recent years.       As part of this policy, ``low-risk'' U.S. importers are      allowed to ship commodities from a Mexican manufacturer      virtually without inspection, after passing a rigorous      background check. Under the so-called ``line release''      program, some importers go months without having their      shipments inspected.       Former Customs Commissioner William Von Raab, who helped      establish the program on the Canadian border, said he was      shocked when it later was used on the Mexico border.       ``It's terrible. [This] was developed to be used at a      border with the highest level of integrity and lowest level      of risk,'' Von Raab said. ``I certainly would never have      deployed it at the Mexican border.''       The San Diego district has the lowest inspection rate for      commercial trucks, records show. Only 3.7% of the laden      trucks are inspected at Otay Mesa, Calexico and Tecate in      California and Andrade in Arizona, compared to an average      rate of 11.4% along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.       ``Obviously, we're in an area of international trade,''      said Rex Applegate, port director of the San Diego district.      ``We're not in a situation where we can just stop traffic for      the sake of narcotics risk. . . .We examined 3% of all the      laden trucks that crossed. That is a lot of trucks. That is a      lot of intrusion.''       Sources said inspections are conducted randomly, once every      500 to 2,500 entries, and certain shipments are targeted      based on intelligence information.       The facilitation program has resulted in increased truck      traffic all along the border, especially last year when      records show that laden trucks increased 51% and empty trucks      increased 38%. In anticipation of the North American Free      Trade Agreement a year ago, U.S. and foreign investors opened      new manufacturing plants on the Mexican side of the border,      triggering an increase in cargo shipments to this country.       Numerous inspectors and agents have told The Times they      believe that the facilitation policy has provided narcotics      smugglers with an easy way of bringing tons of cocaine into      the U.S.       ``The smugglers know our system as well or better than      us,'' said Jay Erdmann, an inspector for 25 years who is      retiring next month. ``Why should they smuggle the dope      through the desert when they can use line release?''       San Diego port director Applegate said the importing and      drug targeting procedures are ``very sophisticated.''       ``Quite frankly, the line inspector is not aware of this,''      Applegate said. ``These guys are like platoon sergeants      questioning the war strategy.''       But he also said inspectors have a responsibility to target      vehicles, based on behavioral analysis of the drivers.       ``This risk assessment * * * depends a lot on the      inspector's own knowledge,'' Applegate said.       A Dec. 13 document entitled ``1994 Port Tracking Report''      said Customs concentrates its drug enforcement efforts on      shipments from 16 ``high-risk'' countries in South and      Central America and the Caribbean.       The report said that, although most ``high-risk containers      pass through the Mexican border, ``substantially less''      cocaine was seized there last year than the previous year.       Nationwide, customs inspectors and agents seized 62,850      pounds of cocaine from commercial land, air and sea haulers      last year--only 2,000 pounds less than in 1993.       But along the Southwest border, 1,765 pounds was      confiscated in 1994--all at Calexico--compared to 7,708      pounds in 1993 and 234 pounds in 1992 when truck traffic was      lighter. Customs statistics show there was a similar decline      in marijuana seizures, from 17,736 pounds in 1993 to 9,459      pounds last year.       Officials were unable to provide statistics for cocaine      seizures in previous years along the entire border.       At the Otay Mesa commercial port--third largest on the      border and located seven miles east of San Diego--there were      no cocaine seizures in the past three years. There also were      no seizures during the period at El Paso, the second largest      commercial border crossing.       Laredo, Tex., the biggest commercial port, had no cocaine      seizures last year. Inspectors there found 5,027 pounds of      drug in 1993 and none in 1992.       Meanwhile, Customs officials have two new proposals to make      it easier for airplane and auto travelers, not just trucks,      to enter the United States, The Times has learned.       One plan under study, called Airport 2000, would require      airline employees to input the names of passport holders into      Customs computers.       Customs inspectors would then check the names for criminal      records or ties to drug smuggling. If the name used by the      traveler does not arouse suspicion, he would be allowed to      leave the airport without having to go through Customs      inspection.       ``Airport 2000 is a concept developed here and is passenger      oriented,'' said Dennis Shimkoski, a Customs Service      spokesman in Washington.       A plan being studied in San Diego would make optional the      now-mandatory license plate check of every vehicle entering      this country from Mexico. Like Airport 2000, the      plan was conceived to cut costs and ease entry into the      United States.       Computer checks of license plates have led to the seizure      of hundreds of stolen vehicles and thousands of pounds of      drugs. The computer checks also tell an inspector if the      vehicle is suspected of being used in smuggling and if the      driver has a criminal record.       Applegate dismissed complaints from inspectors and Customs      agents that the plan signals a retreat from the drug war and      invites corruption in the ranks of inspectors.       ``The issue is very simple. Our land border traffic is      increasing, and our budget is not,'' Applegate said. ``There      would be a certain number of inspectors who would view this      as the grossest sellout in customs history. [But] how much is      it costing the Customs Service to input all this data and      what are we getting for it?''       Von Raab, the former Customs commissioner, said he believes      that the proposals will weaken enforcement efforts. ``I have      always seen Customs as a regulatory agency to guard borders      and collect tariffs,'' he said.       Customs inspectors and agents have complained for years      about what they call a loophole in the facilitation program.      They alleged in interviews that drug rings are paying      unscrupulous truck drivers and trucking companies to smuggle      cocaine and other drugs--but Customs officials do not subject      drivers and trucking companies to the same background checks      as importers and manufacturers.       A veteran investigator who has worked on several high-     profile drug cases in San Diego said that ``you can have the      biggest drug dealer in Mexico drive a truck through the      compound * * * and the [line-release program's] computer      would never tell you who he was, even if he used his real      name.''       ``That's correct,'' said Barry Fleming, who supervises the      line release program in San Diego. ``Right now, I have to      agree with the inspectors. [The problem is] the carriers. How      do we operate in the unknown where we don't know the risk of      the driver, the tractor [truck] or the trucking company?''       When asked why there were no cocaine seizures at the Otay      mesa commercial port between 1992 and 1994, Fleming said:      ``Is it [because of faulty] targeting? Probably it is. We      don't have enough intelligence.''       Carolyn Goding, president of the San Diego Brokers Assn.,      agreed that there is ``nothing      [[Page S4008]] to stop an unscrupulous driver from throwing      some cocaine underneath the seat.'' However, she said the      program ``is working well for the honest importer by helping      facilitate the movement of cargo.''                                                                    ____                               Exhibit 2                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1995.     Hon. Robert Rubin,     Secretary, Department of the Treasury,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rubin: In an earlier letter, dated February      17, 1995, I requested an investigation and reevaluation of      federal efforts to seize illicit narcotics coming across this      nation's borders. Since then, I've learned a great deal more      and today I am writing to express my strong belief that the      Customs Service's ``line release'' program (as we know it      today) should be discontinued in California pending an      evaluation of its ability to seek out and confiscate illicit      contraband entering this country.       I understand approximately 10,000 companies now participate      in a broad effort to move large trucks across the border with      Mexico, often without inspection of cargo. I have asked the      Customs Service for a full list of the companies approved to      take part in the ``line release'' program but have yet to      receive this information. I would like to re-state my request      for this information.       My strong belief that the ``line release'' program should      be discounted pending further review is based on a number of      factors:       (1) It is known that the Cali Cartel in Columbia is      shipping tons of illegal drugs on planes as large as 727's to      Mexico, and then transporting drugs across the border and      into the continental United States in trucks. Recent press      reports have documented increased incidents of illegal      smuggling since the ``line release'' program began, and a      dramatic decrease of inspection and drug seizures. In fact,      in 1994 not a single pound of cocaine was confiscated from      more than two million trucks that passed through three of the      busiest entry points along the southwest border--Laredo and      El Paso in Texas, and Nogales in Arizona.       (2) Hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee have      demonstrated that drug smuggling is on the rise and      California has become the major point of cocaine importation      in the United States.       (3) An internal Treasury document recently brought to my      attention, and subsequently printed in a news report this      past Friday, suggests that serious deficiencies in the ``line      release'' program may actually facilitate the flow of illegal      drugs into California.       These developments have served only to increase my      skepticism as to whether the ``line release'' program ever      made sense at all. In 1993, before NAFTA, Customs officials      seized almost four tons of cocaine off trucks crossing the      border; in 1994 it was down to less than a ton. Attached is a      story from yesterday's New York Times which very accurately      reflects the way I feel. I have also attached recent stories      printed in the Los Angeles Times which raise alarming      questions about illegal drug smuggling across this nation's      2,000 mile border with Mexico.       In my opinion, the ``line release'' program only encourages      the continued and increased flow of drug smuggling.      California simply cannot be the testing ground for programs      that are ineffective and which only invite increased drug      smuggling.       I would appreciate a response as soon as possible regarding      this matter. I would also like your views as to whether you      believe Operation Hard Line, the new initiative by the      Customs Service to tackle the problem of cocaine smuggling      into California, adequately addresses the problems raised      about the ``line release'' program.       Thank you, in advance, for your personal attention to this      matter. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____                               Exhibit 3                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 1995.     Hon. Robert Rubin,     Secretary, Department of the Treasury,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rubin: Two weeks ago, I wrote to you      regarding my strong belief that the ``line release'' program      currently being administered by the Customs Service should be      discontinued in California pending an evaluation of its      effectiveness to seek out and confiscate illicit contraband      entering the United States. I have not yet received a      response.       I believe strongly that this is a urgent matter which      merits your priority attention. To this end, I am also      enclosing a copy of an Associated Press story from yesterday      which raises additional questions about the situation at the      border, including an alleged 1993 incident in which the then-     District Director of the Customs Service, who was later      promoted, may have prevented investigators from conducting a      surprise inspection of the ``line release'' program at the      southwest border. This investigation was aimed at determining      whether unauthorized trucks, potentially carrying drugs, were      allowed to cross the border without inspection.       As I stated in my February 27 letter, I believe the ``line      release'' program only encourages the continued and increased      flow of drug smuggling across the southwest border.       Again, I urge your priority attention to this matter and      look forward to a response to my original letter as soon as      possible.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 10, 1995]   Customs Fails To Act on Suspension for Indicted Warehouse Operator                           (By Michael White)       Los Angeles.--Eight months after a harbor warehouse owner      was indicted on bribery charges, he's still profiting from a      Customs Service inspection station on his property although      investigators urged that it be shut down.       That illustrates a lack of clout that frustrates the U.S.      Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General in its      role as watchdog over some of the government's biggest      moneymakers, including Customs and the Internal Revenue      Service, according to interviews and government records.       The problem is particularly acute in the agency's Western      region where, unlike the rest of the country, inspector      general's investigators have failed to obtain a single      indictment of a federal official in five years.       ``I think that was one of the reasons I was hired two years      ago, was to change the direction, and that doesn't happen      over night,'' said James Cottos, assistant inspector general      for investigations in Washington.       In the case of the harbor warehouse, the inspector      general's auditors recommended last October that National      Distribution Services be suspended from doing business. Its      owner, Steve Moallem, had been indicted on charges he paid an      immigration agent $10,000 for false documents for himself and      employees, records show.       Being picked as the site for an examination station can      mean big profits for a warehouse operator, who charges      importers for storing and unloading cargo to be inspected.       Neither Customs nor the Treasury Department itself has      acted on the recommendation to suspend the company.       ``We can't force the (Customs) agency to do anything,''      said Rick Dory, a Treasury Department attorney.       Customs spokeman Mike Flemming said the case is up to      Treasury officials in Washington.       The Inspector General's Office is charged with      investigating criminal offenses by management level employees      at Customs, the IRS, the Secret Service and a variety of      other Treasury agencies.       During Cottos' tenure, Treasury's Northeast Region has      logged 14 felony convictions. The Southern Region has had      eight and the Central Division one. Statistics for the      office's performance before his tenure were not available      because good records were not kept, Cottos said.       In the West, however, things are different.       The inspector general's office was absent last year when      the Justice Department launched a corruption investigation      among Customs officials in Los Angeles and San Diego, said a      source familiar with the investigation.       The unusual move was made at the insistence of witnesses      who doubted the effectiveness of the inspector general's      office, said the source, who spoke only on the condition of      anonymity.       The concern stemmed in part from a 1993 incident in which      the inspector general's office tried to investigate      allegations that cocaine-laden trucks were crossing the      border unimpeded under a Customs program intended to speed      the flow of cargo from Mexico.       In that case, inspector general investigators, accompanied      by Customs narcotics agents trying to make unannounced      inspections of vehicles and records at the Otay Mesa port of      entry near San Diego, were denied entrance by Customs      officials.       Under orders of Custom's San Diego District Director Rudy      Camacho, the investigation team was told to leave, according      to several sources who witnessed the incident.       They returned the next week in a visit arranged with      Camacho's office, but by then word of the operation had      leaked to truckers and import brokers they were targeting,      according to a January 1994 memo by the investigators.       ``Rudy Camacho ran them out of San Diego,'' said one      veteran inspector familiar with the incident.       Camacho, later promoted to commissioner of Customs' Western      region, said he told the investigators to leave because they      had, without his authorization, brought Customs inspectors      along. He said he had sole authority over Customs inspectors'      activities and scheduling.       His office later cooperated fully with the investigators,      he said.       Cottos said Treasury agencies often resist his office's      attempts to investigate internal wrongdoing.       ``People don't want anybody else to come in and do an      investigation of them,'' he said.
