Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Brigitte ``Brig'' Kelley, who passed away in California on December 10, 2017. Brig was the loving wife of former California State Senator David G. Kelley and she will be deeply missed.  Brig was born in Potsdam, Germany, a suburb of Berlin, to Dr. Herman-Walter Frey and Marie Frey-Richter on Nov. 20, 1926. She spent her youth in Berlin, Germany; Salzburg, Austria; Rome, Italy; and Freiburg, Germany. She studied English at the University of Freiburg and in 1948 she received a Quaker Scholarship to attend Mills College in Oakland, California.  Brig spent two years in the United States and upon her return met David, her husband to be. They married in 1953 and returned to Hemet in 1955 to settle on their citrus ranch in Bautista Canyon. Brig taught German in Adult Continuing Education and Spanish at Mt. San Jacinto Junior College. She loved collecting art and antiques--in particular Spanish and religious art--and enjoyed traveling all over the world.  I have had the distinct privilege of knowing Brig for many years. I was proud to call her my friend and I will deeply miss her. I extend my heartfelt condolences to my good friend Dave Kelley as well as the entire Kelley family. Although Brig may be gone, her legacy and memory will live on.                          ____________________
