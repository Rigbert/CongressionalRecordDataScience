President, before the Senator from Rhode Island leaves the floor, let me thank him for his kind comments. I have enjoyed working with him on issues such as hospice care and advanced planning. I know these issues are very important to him, as they are to me. I am happy we are able to collaborate on a GAO request and also on a hearing later this year.  So I thank him for his efforts in resolving this issue so that the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act could go forward.                          ____________________
