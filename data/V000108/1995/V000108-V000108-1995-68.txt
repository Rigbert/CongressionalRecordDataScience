Speaker, it is my honor to introduce you and my other colleagues to a fine, outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Don P. Johnson. On October 8, 1995, Don, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement after 19 years of service on the Munster Town Council. This commemorative dinner will be held at the Center for Visual Arts in Munster, IN.  Don has dedicated his life to public service throughout the years. A resident of Munster since 1971, he has been on the town council since 1977. On four different occasions, including this last term, Don has occupied the position of town council president. When he was not serving as president, he held the position of planning commissioner.  Moreover, Don has been employed as a financial analyst for LTV Steel Corp. since 1961, and he has been a ``Stick With Steel'' recycling representative.  In addition, community service has been a large part of Don's life. Don has served on the Main Street Task Force as a cochair, the Community Hospital board, the Lake County Solid Waste District, and the Munster Foundation Board as the director. In 1995, Don was appointed president of the Northwest Indiana Council of Towns and Smaller Cities [IACT]. In this capacity, he attended many IACT events while serving occasionally as a panelist. Don has also been active on the Munster Chamber of Commerce as an associate member, and a patron supporter of Munster High School drama and athletics programs. Moreover, Don serves on the Munster Lions Club, and he has been honored for attendance and fund raising. In 1995, he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Lions Club. As a member of the Westminster Presbyterian Church, Don serves as an auditing committee member, and he also supports the Habitat for Humanity and food pantry.  Don has also saved time to raise a successful family with his wife, Nancy, who is a teacher. Don and Nancy have raised three children: Gayle, and Air Force Academy graduate and teacher; Amy a teacher; and Douglas, a landscpae architect. In addition, Don and Nancy have four wonderful grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you, and my other colleagues, congratulate Don on his retirement from the Munster Town Council. His hard work and dedication to the council, as well as Indiana's First Congressional District, should be commemorated.                          ____________________
