 One of those customs is for home-State senators to be consulted on, and approve of, nominations from their States before the committee on the Judiciary moves forward with considering those nominations, be it a nomination to serve as a U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshall, or judicial officer. It is my understanding that the order does not change, in any way, the Senate's ``blue slip'' process.
