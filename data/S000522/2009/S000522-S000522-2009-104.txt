I thank Mr. Pence for his excellent remarks, and for the logic, the compelling logic that he brings to the floor, not just today, but so often.  This is a human rights issue. It is also a patient issue. You know, one of the overlooked--and the mainstream press sometimes gets it right, but we are only beginning to see, in some of the commentary post-decision on Monday by President Obama, one of the things he lifted was an executive order that President Bush put into effect on June 20, 2007 expanding approved stem cell lines in ethically responsible ways. And it provided a boost to the National Institutes of Health to do research on alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells that prioritizes research with the greatest potential for clinical benefit. He revoked this--he being President Obama. In other words, that which has worked, that has absolutely stunned, in a positive way, the community, the scientific community, now takes a back seat to what is essentially abortion politics, turning that which is unborn, that which is newly created into a commodity that could be destroyed at will.                              {time}  1745  Let me also say that the Washington Post had an excellent piece today by Kathleen Parker, and the headline was ``Behind the Cell Curve, Why is the President Ignoring a Scientific Gift?''  Kathleen points out: ``One fact is that since Obama began running for President, researchers have made some rather amazing strides in alternative stem cell research. Science and ethics finally fell in love, in other words, and Obama seems to have fallen asleep during the kiss. Either that or he decided that keeping an old political promise was more important than acknowledging new developments. In the process he missed an opportunity to prove that he is pro-science but also sensitive to the concerns of taxpayers who don't want to pay for research that requires embryo destruction.''  She points out that ``in fact, every single one of the successes,'' every one, ``in treating patients with stem cells thus far for spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis, for example, have involved adult or umbilical cord blood stem cells, not embryonic stem cells.  ``The insistence on using embryonic stem cells always rested on the argument that they were pluripotent, capable of becoming any kind of cell. That superior claim no longer can be made with the spectacular discovery,'' as I said at the outset, ``in 2007 of `induced pluripotent stem cells,' '' or iPS cells, ``which was the laboratory equivalent of the airplane. Very simply, iPS cells can be produced from skin cells by injecting genes that force the cells to revert to their primitive `blank state' form with all the same pluripotent capabilities of embryonic stem cells.  ``But `induced pluripotent stem cells' don't trip easily off the tongue,'' she goes on to say, ``nor have any celebrities stepped forward to expound their virtues. Even without such drama, however, Time Magazine named iPS innovation number one of its Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2007, and the Journal of Science rated it the number one breakthrough of 2008.  ``The iPS discovery even prompted Ian Wilmut, who led the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, to abandon his license to attempt human cloning, saying that the researchers `may have achieved what no politician could: an end to the embryonic stem cell debate.' ''  And yet now we see that Barack Obama has put that front and center again, choosing politics over science, over ethics, in promoting embryonic stem cell research when the clear future of stem cell research is in the area of induced pluripotent and in the area of adult stem cells.  I would like to yield to Dr. Broun, a distinguished medical doctor, for any comments he might have.
