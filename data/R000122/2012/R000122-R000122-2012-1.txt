Coming from a State that received a major disaster declaration due to the damage it sustained in Hurricane Sandy, including damage to the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, I recognize the importance of providing funding for projects in States impacted by the storm. The funds provided in this bill will be used in support of additional recovery activities directly related to the hurricane or to fund longer-term restoration activities for areas directly affected by Hurricane Sandy. The bill provides flexibility so that the Department can transfer the funds to any of its programs to fund the highest priority needs in these specific disaster areas. I expect these funds to be of great assistance to states like ours which were affected by this devastating storm.
