Bonior), our great leader from the State of Michigan, our Wolverine State, a few moments to talk about our proposal for permanent normal trade relations for China. One certainly could not say anything about our trade relations with China being ``normal.'' In fact, they are very abnormal, with more exports coming into our market from China for over 12 years now than our exports being able to get in there, even when tariffs have been lowered.  I wanted to say to the gentleman that I think that his fortitude on this as the days go on is magnificent. I just wish every American could see the hours and hours that the gentleman has put into this personally and all the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle enjoy working with the gentleman so very much.  I wanted to make sure to come down here during this time as we attempt to inform the American people and our colleagues about this upcoming vote next week on extending permanent trade relations with China, that every major veterans organization in this country has come out in opposition to granting permanent normal trade relations with China.  I wanted to say a word about that, because I know many of our Post Commanders, our State Commanders, our Auxiliary Leaders across this Nation, are phoning their Members of Congress. They have been doing it this week, they are going to continue over the weekend and into next week, and I thought I would read into the Record and provide for the Record some of what these organizations have said, starting with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, an organization of 1.9 million Members.  I have been on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of this Congress for my entire tenure here, and I was just so elated to see their letter this week, which said that we should not approve permanent relations with China. They asked that the current situation where we have an annual review here in this Congress be maintained until such time as China changes its policies and demonstrates that it is ready to treat its own people according to basic human rights standards of other modern industrialized nations.  They oppose China's proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction. They oppose their threats against this country and other countries in the Pacific, including the democratic Nation of Taiwan. The VFW basically says passage of the China trade bill essentially rewards China for mistreating its citizens.  I want to thank all of the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, all the Post Commanders, all the Ladies Auxiliary Presidents and members, for engaging in this issue and letting their voices be heard from coast to coast, especially where it matters most, and that is back at home, in the home district with the home Member of Congress.  Also the American Legion, 2.8 million members strong, this week came out against permanent trade relations with China. In its formal letter they say that they want to force China to meet four preconditions before any permanent trade relations with China are extended or for any entry into the WTO by China. Those four conditions are recognition of the Taiwanese right to self-determination; full cooperation on the accounting of American servicemen missing from the Korean War and the Cold War; abandonment of policies aimed at military dominance in Asia; and encouragement and promotion of human rights and religious freedom among the Chinese people themselves.  The National Commander of the American Legion Al Lance said in his letter, ``China should embrace Democratic values before it benefits from unfettered American investment.''  The Military Order of the Purple Heart, again, calling their Members of Congress around the country, I wish to extend the appreciation of this Member of Congress for their activism on this. Over 30,000 members of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and 600,000 living recipients of the Purple Heart. In their letter they say ``China as an international actor continues to behave in a manner that is threatening to international stability and U.S. security interests.'' They say this Congress should delay the granting of permanent normal trade status to China at this time because it would remove China from the review and the openness that occurs here on this floor of Congress, which does not even happen inside China itself. They are very worried about the proliferation of weapons from China to other places, and certainly their dismal human rights record.  Then the Military Order of Purple Heart goes on to say, ``Today China represents the most dangerous of the emerging threats to U.S. national security. Her designs on Western Pacific dominance, her extreme belligerence toward Taiwan and her persistent espionage and theft of U.S. advanced technologies are behaviors that must be checked before any reasonable consideration of permanent normal trade status can be undertaken.''  It says, ``Many of America's combat wounded veterans sacrificed life and blood to repel Chinese aggression during the Korean conflict, and now, 50 years after that war, China remains an unabashedly communistic regime. It is time for China to change if she wishes to be a truly welcome participant on the world stage.''  Mr. Leader, I know that I want to yield back most of the remaining time, but I would want to place on the record the official letter from the Fleet Reserve Association, representing 151,000 members, all career and retired Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen of the United States opposing permanent normal trade relations with China.  In addition to that, the Warrant Officers Association, representing nearly 20,000 warrant officers of active Army, Army Guard and the Army Reserve, in their letter saying ``China shows few of the peaceful democratic traits evidenced by our Nation's other major trading partners.'' ``In this instance,'' they say, ``trade and economic considerations cannot take precedence over the safety of our Nation and that of our allies and friends.''  A letter from the Reserve Officers Association, which we will place on the record, representing over 80,000 officers in all uniformed services, indicating opposition to permanent normal trade relations with China. They want the annual review here. They are very concerned about China's military threats against Taiwan, and threatened military action against the United States if we defend Taiwan.  Finally, from AMVETS, 200,000 veterans opposed in this organization to permanent normal trade relations withChina, saying the security issues take precedence over trade relations with foreign nations.  I would just say, finally, and again to thank all the veterans Commanders, the Ladies Auxiliaries, the Post leaders, the membership in all these organizations across the country that are weighing in, phoning their Members of Congress, I know we have gotten many calls in our community and that is happening across the country, to thank them for their activism, to encourage them this weekend and the coming week.  I want to place in the Record finally the request made by one of our valued colleagues from the State of California (Mr. Berman), who tried to get a provision as we voted on this agreement that would provide that in the event that this permanent normal trade status would be granted, that in the event that China would attack, invade, or blockade Taiwan, that permanent normal trade relations would be revoked.                              {time}  1430  The administration was not willing to include that in the measure that they have sent up to this Congress.                                                       AMVETS,                                         Lanham, MD, May 16, 2000.     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Cannon House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Wolf: AMVETS, the nation's fourth      largest organization, represents more than 200,000 veterans      who honorably served in the Armed Forces of the United      States, and opposes Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)      for China.       While the U.S. relationship with China is important, AMVETS      believes that national security issues take precedence over      the trade relations with foreign countries. We concur in your      belief that our nation cannot afford to give leverage to the      Republic of China--which exports weapons of mass destruction      and missiles, maintains spy presence in the U.S. and      continues to threaten Taiwan with military force.       When Congress votes in the House during the week of May 22,      let it be known that AMVETS says ``no'' to the Permanent      Trade Relations with China.           Sincerely,                                                Charles L. Taylor,     National Commander, 1999-2000, AMVETS.                                  ____                                   Reserve Officers Association of                                            the United States,                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Wolf: The Reserve Officers Association      (``ROA''), representing 80,000 officers in all seven      Uniformed Services, is concerned about the proposal to grant      Permanent Normal Trade Relations (``PNTR'') to China.       ROA acknowledges the importance of our relationship with      China, including our growing economic ties to China.      Nevertheless, ROA believes that it would be a mistake to      grant PNTR to China at this time. The annual process of      reviewing trade relations with China provides Congress with      leverage over Chinese behavior on national security and human      rights matters. Granting PNTR would deprive Congress of the      opportunity to influence China to improve its human rights      record and behave as a more responsible actor on the national      security stage.       Just within the past few weeks, China has made military      threats against Taiwan and threatened military action against      the United States if we defend Taiwan. Just four years ago,      China fired several live missiles in the Taiwan Strait,      necessitating a deployment of two American carrier battle      groups to the area.       A report issued last month by the CIA and FBI indicates      that Beijing has increased its military spying against the      United States. Less than a year ago the Cox Committee      reported that China stole classified information regarding      advanced American thermonuclear weapons.       Additionally, Beijing has exported weapons of mass      destruction to Iran and north Korea, in violation of treaty      commitments. Finally, China's record of human rights abuses      is well documented.       A recent Harris Poll revealed that fully 79% of the      American people oppose giving China permanent access to U.S.      markets until China meets human rights and labor standards.      On this issue, Congress should respect the wisdom of the      American people. Now is not the time to grant Permanent      Normal Trade Relations to China.           Sincerely,                                                Jayson L. Spiegel,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                United States Army                                 Warrant Officers Association,                                          Hemdon, VA, May 9, 2000.     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,     Member of Congress, U.S. House of Representatives, Cannon          House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Wolf. On behalf of the membership of      this Association I write to express support and appreciation      of your actions, and that of several of your colleagues, in      opposing Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China.       The USAWOA represents nearly 20,000 warrant officers of the      Active Army, the Army Guard, and the Army Reserve. These      highly-skilled men and women serve as helicopter pilots,      special forces team leaders, intelligence analysts, command      and control computer and communications managers, armament      and equipment repair technicians, and in other technical      fields critical to success of the modern battlefield. Daily,      many of them are in harm's way.       From our perspective, it appears that China has done little      to deserve such consideration. Of more concern is the fact      that China shows few of the peaceful, democratic traits      evidenced by our Nation's other major trading partners.      Indeed, China appears to striving to achieve not only      economic dominance of the Pacific Rim but also a significant      military advantage over her neighbors, and quite possibly,      the United States.       In this instance, trade and economic considerations cannot      take precedence over the safety of our Nation and that of our      allies and friends. Until fundamental, lasting changes take      place in China, normalization of trade relations should not      take place.           Respectively,                                                   Raymond A Bell,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                    Fleet Reserve Association,                                   Alexandria, VA, April 21, 2000.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Smith: Please be advised that the Fleet      Reserve Association (FRA), representing its 151,000 members,      all career and retired Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen      of the United States Armed Forces, joins you and your      colleagues in opposing Permanent Normal Trade Relations      (PNTR) for China.       FRA shares your concern that weapons of mass destruction      exported by that country can be used against U.S. military      personnel, and also our Nation's citizens. Further, China      already has obtained considerable knowledge of our Nation's      weapons technology without normal trade relations. Should the      United States open its doors to normal trade relations, it is      worrisome that China will discover even more of that      sensitive information.       One of the most important goals of this Association is to      protect its members as well as every active duty and reserve      uniformed member of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.      To fulfill that commitment, FRA must do all that it can to      oppose any move that could possibly send those brave men and      women into harms way without `rhyme or reason.' With the      possibility that the future will hang dark shadows over open      trading with a yet unproven China, FRA is sensitive to the      harm that country may inflict upon our Nation.           Loyalty, Protection, and Service,                                               Charles L. Calkins,     National Executive Secretary.                                  ____                           Military Order of the Purple Heart,                                                     May 15, 2000.     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Wolf: The Military Order of the Purple      Heart (MOPH), representing the patriotic interests of its      30,000 members and the 600,000 living recipients of the      Purple Heart, is seriously concerned with the      Administration's proposal to grant Permanent Normal Trade      Relations (PNTR) status to the Peoples Republic of China.       The MOPH is familiar with the current series of U.S.      Government reports concerning China to include: the Cox      Committee Report, the Rumsfield Commission Report, the 1999      Intelligence Community Report on Arms Proliferation, and      Chairman Spence's May 2000 HASC National Security Report on      China. These and other similar security assessments clearly      indicate that China, as an international actor, continues to      behave in a manner that is threatening to international      stability and U.S. national security interests.       Given the broad consensus that has formed about this issue,      to include the recent Harris Poll indicating 79% of all      Americans are against granting PNTR status to China, the MOPH      believes it both prudent and reasonable to delay the granting      of PNTR status to China at this time. Speaking as patriots      and combat wounded veterans, we believe that granting PNTR      status to China would relieve them from the current pressure      caused by annual Congressional review of their trade status.      Clearly, Congressional review has caused China to improve its      dismal human rights record and to modify to some extent its      proliferation of dangerous arms on the world market. Yet      these modifications must be seen as the beginning not the      end.       Today, China represents the most dangerous of the emerging      threats to U.S. national security. Her designs on Western      Pacific dominance, her extreme belligerence towards Taiwan,      and her persistent espionage and theft of U.S. advanced      technologies are behaviors that must be checked before any      reasonable consideration of PNTR status can be undertaken.       Many of America's combat wounded veterans sacrificed life      and blood to repel Chinese aggression during the Korean      Conflict. Fifty years after that war China remains an      unabashedly communistic regime. It is time for China to      change if she wishes to be a truly welcomed participant on      the world's stage. It is also time for Congress and the      Administration to reflect upon the sacrifices     of its combat wounded veterans and ensure that China will not      once again become our enemy. In the view of the MOPH this      objective must be reached before PNTR status should be      granted to China.           Yours in Patriotism,                                          Frank G. Wickersham III,     National Legislative Director.                                  ____                                          The American Legion,                                                   Washington, DC.                         For immediate release               China Trade Opposed by The American Legion       Indianapolis (Wednesday, May 10, 2000).--Taking into      account nuclear espionage charges, human rights abuses, saber      rattling against Taiwan, and influence-peddling indictments,      the 2.8-million member American Legion today demanded the      U.S. government withhold Permanent Normalized Trade Relations      with the People's Republic of China and oppose its entry into      the World Trade Organization.       The American Legion's board of directors, during its annual      spring meeting here recommended Congress and the Clinton      administration force China to meet four preconditions both      for entry into the WTO and for ending the annual      congressional review of its trade status:       Recognition of the Taiwan's right to self-determination;       Full cooperation on the accounting of American servicemen      missing from the Korean War and the Cold War;       Abandonment of policies aimed at military dominance in      Asia; and       Encouragement and promotion of human rights and religious      freedom among the Chinese people.       ``China should embrace democratic values before it benefits      from unfettered American investment,'' American Legion      National Commander Al Lance said: ``The American Legion sets      forth the prerequisites for peace and stability, without      which Communist China will become economically and militarily      more formidable even as it embarks on policies pursuant to      regional instability. A something-for-nothing trade      arrangement with China--one that severs trade from national      security and human rights--threatens stability, rewards      antagonism, and strengthens a potential foe of American sons      and daughters in the U.S. armed forces.''       Founded in 1919, The American Legion is the nation's      largest veterans organization.                                  ____                [Veterans of Foreign Wars News Release]   VFW Urges Congress to Reject Permanent Trade Relations With China       Washington, D.C., May 17.--The Veterans of Foreign Wars of      the United States today urged Congress not to grant Permanent      Normal Trade Relations with China.       Citing the need for a change in China's human rights      standards, the 1.9-million member VFW said. ``The United      States should maintain its current annual congressional      review of China's trade status until such time as China      changes it's policy and demonstrates that it is ready to      treat its people according to the basic human rights      standards of other modern industrial nations.''       In a letter to all members of Congress, VFW Commander in      Chief John W. Smart said, ``A vote against Permanent Normal      Trade Relations with China will send a clear message that the      United States does not tolerate China's persistent human      rights violations, and will not agree with it's proliferation      of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, it's      military threats against the United States and other      countries in the Pacific region including repeated threats      made against Taiwan.       ``Passage of the China Trade Bill, essentially rewards      China for mistreating its citizens, violating its current      trade agreements, threatening its neighbors and the United      States with military action, proliferating weapons of mass      destruction, stealing nuclear, military and industrial      secrets from the United States, increasing espionage against      the U.S., and practicing religious oppression. We believe      this bill sends the wrong message to China and the rest of      the world,'' Smart said.       The VFW was founded in 1899. As an organization of former      servicemen and women, the VFW remains committed to a strong      national security and the well being of those serving on      active duty, in the National Guard and the Reserves.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2000.  VFW, AMVETS, and Purple Heart Veterans Join the Ranks of Veterans'              Organizations in Opposition to PNTR for China       Dear Colleague: VFW, the second largest veterans'      organization, AMVETS, the fourth largest veterans      organization, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart,      have added their forceful voices in opposition to Permanent      Normal Trade Relations for China. Veterans groups      representing over 5.1 million members have now voiced their      objection to this critical trade legislation.       VFW, representing 1.9 million members, states: ``Passage of      the China Trade Bill, essentially rewards China for      mistreating its citizens, violating current trade agreements,      threatening its neighbors and the United States with military      action, proliferating weapons of mass destruction, stealing      nuclear, military and industrial secrets from the United      States, increasing espionage against the U.S., and practicing      religious oppression. We believe this bill sends the wrong      message to China and the rest of the world.''       AMVETS, representing more than 200,000 veterans, states:      ``We concur in your belief that our nation cannot afford to      give leverage to the Republic of China--which exports weapons      of mass destruction and missiles, maintains spy presence in      the U.S. and continues to threaten Taiwan with military      force. When Congress votes in the House during the week of      May 22, let it be known that AMVETS say `no' to the Permanent      Normal Trade Relations for China.''       Military Order of the Purple Heart, chartered by Congress,      and representing 30,000 members and the 600,000 living      recipients of the Purple Heart, states: ``Today, China      represents the most dangerous of the emerging threats to U.S.      national security . . . Many of America's combat wounded      veterans sacrificed life and blood to repel Chinese      aggression during the Korea Conflict. Fifty years after that      war China remains an unabashedly communist regime. It is time      for China to change if she wishes to be a truly welcomed      participant on the world's stage. It is also time for      Congress and the Administration to reflect upon the      sacrifices of its combat wounded veterans and ensure that      China will not once again become our enemy.''       National Commander Al Lance of the American Legion,      representing 2.8 million, states: ``China should embrace      democratic values before it benefits from unfettered American      investment. The American Legion sets forth the prerequisites      for peace and stability, without which Communist China will      become economically and militarily more formidable even as it      embarks on policies pursuant to regional instability. A      something-for-nothing trade arrangement with China--one that      severs trade from national security and human rights--     threatens stability, rewards antagonism, and strengthens a      potential foe of American sons and daughters in the U.S.      armed forces.''       The Fleet Reserve Officers Association, representing      151,000 members, career and retired Sailors, Marines, and      Coast Guardsmen, states: ``One of the most important goals of      this Association is to protect its members as well as every      active duty and reserve uniformed member of the Navy, Marine      Corps, and Coast Guard. The Fleet Reserve opposes Permanent      Normal Trade Relations for China.''       The Naval Reserve Association, representing 37,000 officers      and enlisted members from the Naval Reserve Services, states:      ``China is aggressively building its military. The PRC's      ambitions include reunification by force with Taiwan, and      territorial claim over the energy resources in the      international waters of the South China Sea.'' They conclude      by stressing, ``Now is not the time to offer Permanent Normal      Trade Relationships (PNTR) for China.''       The Warrant Officers Association, representing nearly      20,000 warrant officers of the Active Army, the Army Guard,      and the Army Reserve, states: ``In this instance, trade and      economic considerations cannot take precedence over the      safety of our Nation and that of our allies and friends.      Until fundamental, lasting changes take place in China,      normalization of trade relations should not take place.''       The Reserve Officers Association, representing 80,000      officers in all seven uniformed services, states, ``Just      within the past few weeks, China has made military threats      against Taiwan and threatened military action against the      U.S. if we defend Taiwan.

VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS, United States Army Warrant      Officers Association, Reserve Officers Association, The      American Legion, Naval Reserve, Military Order of the Purple      Heart, Fleet Reserve.       This vote is scheduled just a few days before Memorial Day,      a day which honors our armed forces personnel who have given      their lives for our freedom. We should heed the voices of our      men and women in uniform and America's veterans who are      asking us to vote no on PNTR for China.           Sincerely,                                                       Frank Wolf,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2000.If Congress Passes PNTR, China Can Export Cheap, Semi-automatic Weapons                               to the U.S.       Dear Colleague: Upon approving the annual Most Favored      Nation status for China in 1994, President Clinton issued an      embargo     on the imports of assault weapons from China. This complete      prohibition was issued because Chinese gun manufacturers had      exported almost one million Chinese rifles to the United      States--more than made by all U.S. manufacturers combined in      1992 according to the BATF.       The most popular import was the SKS semi-automatic rifle,      once a standard weapon among East Bloc forces and used      against U.S. troops in Vietnam. The SKS was the fourth most      frequently traced firearm in America--surprising since      handguns, not rifles, tend to be the guns that criminals use      most. They were particularly popular among neo-nazi's, white      supremacists and street gangs. What made them attractive was      their power and inexpensive price, only $55.95.       If Congress approves permanent NTR, World Trade      Organization regulations will apply to the U.S. ban of gun      imports from China. Under WTO regulations, the U.S. is      required to treat foreign and domestic goods identically.      Since these weapons are legal in the U.S., China will be able      to challenge our embargo on these dangerous firearms. The      U.S. would have to lift the import ban on China or prohibit      the manufacture of those assault weapons domestically.       Is the U.S. prepared to lift the import ban on assault      weapons from China?       Or is the U.S. prepared to ban the manufacture of those      weapons in the U.S.?       Don't give China the power to decide gun policy in the      United States.       Don't allow China to sell these cheap, dangerous assault      weapons on the streets of America.       Oppose PNTR for China.           Sincerely,     Pete Stark,       Member of Congress.     Carolyn McCarthy,       Member of Congress.

China Threatens War Over Taiwan       Dear Colleague: BEIJING (AP).--An official Chinese      newspaper threatened war today if Taiwan's president-elect      refuses to recognize that the island is part of China.       Stepping up pressure ahead of this weekend's inauguration,      Beijing wants Chen Shui-bian, who was elected March 18, to      recognize the ``one China principle'' to allay its fears over      his previous pro-independence stance.       China's government and entirely state-run media have for      weeks demanded that Taiwan accept that it is part of China as      a precondition for talks. But the China Business Times went      further, threatening war if Chen fails during his      inauguration Saturday to heed Beijing's demands.       ``If Taiwan's new leader refuses in his inaugural speech to      recognize the one China principle and even makes a speech      that inclines toward Taiwan independence, then relations      between the two sides will certainly take a turn. War in the      Taiwan Strait will be difficult to avoid,'' the newspaper      said in a front-page article alongside photos of a tank, a      warplane and military exercises.     SEC. 2. WITHDRAWAL OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS.       Pursuant to Article XXI of the GATT 1994, nondiscriminatory      treatment (normal trade relations treatment) shall be      withdrawn from the products of the People's Republic of China      if that country attacks, invades, or imposes a blockade on      Taiwan.           Sincerely,                                                 Howard L. Berman,                                               Member of Congress.                                 A BILL       Providing for the revocation of normal trade relations      treatment from the products of the People's Republic of China      if that country attacks, invades, or imposes a blockade on      Taiwan.       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS       The Congress finds that--       (1) Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (as defined in section      2(1)(B) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501      (1)(B)) allows a member of the World Trade Organization to      take ``any action which it considers necessary for the      protection of its essential security interests,''      particularly ``in time of war or other emergency in      international relations''; and       (2) an attack on, invasion of, or blockade of Taiwan by the      People's Republic of China would constitute a threat to the      essential security interests of the United States and an      emergency in international relations.     SEC. 2. WITHDRAWAL OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS.       Pursuant to Article XXI of the GATT 1994, non-     discriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment)      shall be withdrawn from the products of the People's Republic      of China if that country attacks, invades, or imposes a      blockade on Taiwan.     SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING CONTRACTS.       The President shall have the authority to determine the      extent to which the withdrawal under section 2 of normal      trade relations treatment applies to products imported      pursuant to contracts entered into before the date on which      the withdrawal of such treatment is announced. The President      shall issue regulations to carry out such determination.
