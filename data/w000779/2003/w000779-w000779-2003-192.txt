I think we all know if people see something taking place behind closed doors, in secret, without the open and full process of competitive bidding, it just engenders suspicion, it just engenders a sense of skepticism and cynicism about government that just does not have to be.  It is particularly troubling here because the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan organization of auditors, has already documented there is a problem. So we have a combination of taxpayer skepticism about work done in secret coupled with the long history of the General Accounting Office's skepticism about these reports, and here is an area that just cries out for sunshine.  I talked about sunshine being the best disinfectant, but certainly since we introduced this bill with Senator Collins over the last 21 days, the fact we have seen all these contracts--in fact, one of them where the agency just waives their own process, without an explanation--I think highlights the Senator's point that the Government's credibility is at stake.
