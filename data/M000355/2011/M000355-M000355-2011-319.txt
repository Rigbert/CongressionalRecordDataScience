 President, for the information of everyone, this next vote will be a 10-minute vote, and the next will be a 10-minute vote, so I wouldn't go too far from the floor.  I move to proceed to S. Con. Res. 21, a resolution submitted by Senator Toomey setting forth the congressional budget for the U.S. Government.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
