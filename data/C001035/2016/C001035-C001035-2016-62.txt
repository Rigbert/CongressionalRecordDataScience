President, I will be very brief. Let me just reiterate what I have been saying repeatedly. What the amendment Senator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I have introduced does is make very clear that HUD is prohibited from intervening in local decisions regarding zoning ordinances. That is in direct response to what some people have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on affirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow HUD to be a national zoning commissar. That is not the case, but to make absolutely sure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to prohibit HUD from intervening in local zoning matters. It is very different from the Lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly.  This is an important clarification that should take away any fear that there is any possibility of HUD using funds authorized by this bill to interfere in local zoning decisions.  I yield the floor.
