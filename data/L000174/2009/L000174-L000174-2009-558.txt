President, today, I am introducing the bipartisan State Secrets Protection Act. I am pleased that Senator Kennedy, who had so much to do with developing this proposal last Congress is an original cosponsor of the bill along with Senators Specter, Feingold, Whitehouse and McCaskill. After a lengthy debate, this bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee last April.  The State secrets privilege is a common law doctrine that the Government can claim in court to prevent evidence that could harm national security from being publicly revealed. During the Bush administration, the State secrets privilege was used to avoid judicial review and skirt accountability by ending cases without consideration of the merits. It was used to stymie litigation at its very inception in cases alleging egregious Government misconduct, such as extraordinary rendition and warrantless eavesdropping on the communications of Americans.  The 2006 case of Khaled El-Masri, who was kidnapped and transported against his will to Afghanistan, where he was detained and tortured as part of the Bush administration's extraordinary rendition program, is one such example. He sued the government alleging unlawful detention and treatment. A district court judge dismissed the entire lawsuit after the Government invoked the State secrets privilege, solely on the basis of an ex parte declaration from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and despite the fact that the Government had admitted that the rendition program exists. Mr. El-Masri has no other remedy. Our justice system is off limits to him, and no judge ever reviewed any of the actual evidence.  The State secrets privilege serves important goals where properly invoked. But there are serious consequences for litigants and for the American public when the privilege is used to terminate litigation alleging serious Government misconduct. For the aggrieved parties, it means that the courthouse doors are closed forever regardless of the severity of their injury. They will never have their day in court. For the American public, it means less accountability, because there will be no judicial scrutiny of improper actions of the executive, and no check or balance.  The State Secrets Protection Act will help guide the courts to balance the Government's interests in secrecy with accountability and the rights of citizens to seek judicial redress. The bill does not restrict the Government's ability to assert the privilege in appropriate cases. Rather, the bill would allow judges to look at the actual evidence the Government submits so that they, neutral judges, rather than self-interested executive branch officials, would render the ultimate decision whether the State secrets privilege should apply. This is consistent with the procedure for other privileges recognized in our courts.  We held a Committee hearing on this issue last year, and the appropriate use of this privilege remains an area of concern for me and for the cosponsors of this bill. In light of the pending cases where this privilege has been invoked, involving issues including torture, rendition and warrantless wiretapping, we can ill-afford to delay consideration of this important legislation. I hope all Senators will join us in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 417       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The court shall seal all records      to the extent necessary to protect national security.       ``(c) Attorney Security Clearances.--       ``(1) In general.--A Federal court shall, at the request of      the United States, limit participation in hearings conducted      under this chapter, or access to motions or affidavits      submitted under this chapter, to attorneys with appropriate      security clearances, if the court determines that limiting      participation in that manner would serve the interests of      national security. The court may also appoint a guardian ad      litem with the necessary security clearances to represent any      party for the purposes of any hearing conducted under this      chapter.       ``(2) Stays.--During the pendency of an application for      security clearance by an attorney representing a party in a      hearing conducted under this chapter, the court may suspend      proceedings if the court determines that such a suspension      would serve the interests of justice.       ``(3) Court oversight.--If the United States fails to      provide a security clearance necessary to conduct a hearing      under this chapter in a reasonable period of time, the court      may review in camera and ex parte the reasons of the United      States for denying or delaying the clearance to ensure that      the United States is not withholding a security clearance      from a particular attorney or class of attorneys for any      reason other than protection of national security.       ``(d) Protective Orders.--A Federal court may issue a      protective order governing any information or evidence      disclosed or discussed at any hearing conducted under this      chapter if the court determines that issuing such an order is      necessary to protect national security.       ``(e) Opinions and Orders.--Any opinions or orders issued      under this chapter may be issued under seal or in redacted      versions if, and to the extent that, the court determines      that such measure is necessary to protect national security.       ``(f) Special Masters.--A Federal court may appoint a      special master or other independent advisor who holds the      necessary security clearances to assist the court in handling      a matter subject to this chapter.     ``Sec. 4053.

If a motion to dismiss or for summary      judgment is based in whole or in part on the state secrets      privilege, or may be affected by the assertion of the state      secrets privilege, a ruling on that motion shall be deferred      pending completion of the hearings provided under this      chapter, unless the motion can be granted on grounds      unrelated to, and unaffected by, the assertion of the state      secrets privilege.       ``(c) Pleading State Secrets.--In answering a complaint, if      the United States or an officer or agency of the United      States is a party to the litigation, the United States may      plead the state secrets privilege in response to any      allegation in any individual claim or counterclaim if the      admission or denial of that allegation in that individual      claim or counterclaim would itself divulge a state secret to      another party or the public. If the United States has      intervened in a civil action, it may assert the state secrets      privilege in response to any allegation in any individual      claim or counterclaim if the admission or denial by a party      of that allegation in that individual claim or counterclaim      would itself divulge a state secret to another party or the      public. No adverse inference or admission shall be drawn from      a pleading of state secrets in an answer to an item in a      complaint.       ``(d) Supporting Affidavit.--In each instance in which the      United States asserts the state secrets privilege in response      to 1 or more claims, it shall provide the court with an      affidavit signed by the head of the executive branch agency      with responsibility for, and control over, the asserted state      secrets explaining the factual basis for the assertion of the      privilege and attesting that personal consideration was given      to the assertion of the privilege. The duties of the head of      an executive branch agency under this subsection may not be      delegated.     ``Sec. 4054. Procedures for determining whether evidence is        protected from disclosure by the state secrets privilege       ``(a) Asserting the State Secrets Privilege.--The United      States may, in any civil action to which the United States is      a party or in any other civil action before a Federal or      State court, assert the state secrets privilege as a ground      for withholding information or evidence in discovery or for      preventing the disclosure of information through court      filings or through the introduction of evidence.       ``(b) Supporting Affidavit.--In each instance in which the      United States asserts the state secrets privilege with      respect to an item of information or evidence, the United      States shall provide the court with an affidavit signed by      the head of the executive branch agency with responsibility      for, and control over, the state secrets involved explaining      the factual basis for the claim of privilege. The United      States shall make public an unclassified version of the      affidavit.       ``(c) Hearing.--A Federal court shall conduct a hearing,      consistent with the requirements of section 4052, to examine      the items of evidence that the United States asserts are      subject to the state secrets privilege, as well as any      affidavit submitted by the United States in support of any      assertion of the state secrets privilege, and to determine      the validity of any assertion of the state secrets privilege      made by the United States.       ``(d) Review of Evidence.--       ``(1) Submission of evidence.--In addition to the affidavit      provided under subsection (b), and except as provided in      paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States shall      make all evidence the United States claims is subject to the      state secrets privilege available for the court to review,      consistent with the requirements of section 4052, before any      hearing conducted under this section.       ``(2) Sampling in certain cases.--If the volume of evidence      the United States asserts is protected by the state secrets      privilege precludes a timely review of each item of evidence,      or the court otherwise determines that a review of all of      that evidence is not feasible, the court may substitute a      sufficient sampling of the evidence if the court determines      that there is no reasonable possibility that review of the      additional evidence would change the determination on the      privilege claim and the evidence reviewed is sufficient to      enable to court to make the determination required under this      section.       ``(3) Index of materials.--The United States shall provide      the court with a manageable index of evidence it contends is      subject to the state secrets privilege by formulating a      system of itemizing and indexing that would correlate      statements made in the affidavit provided under subsection      (b) with portions of the evidence the United States asserts      is subject to the state secrets privilege. The index shall be      specific enough to afford the court an adequate foundation to      review the basis of the invocation of the privilege by the      United States.       ``(e) Determinations as to Applicability of State Secrets      Privilege.--       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d)(2),      as to each item of evidence that the United States asserts is      protected by the state secrets privilege, the court shall      review, consistent with the requirements of section 4052, the      specific item of evidence to determine whether the claim of      the United States is valid. An item of evidence is subject to      the state secrets privilege if it contains a state secret, or      there is no possible means of effectively segregating it from      other evidence that contains a state secret.       ``(2) Admissibility and disclosure.--       ``(A) Privileged evidence.--If the court agrees that an      item of evidence is subject to the state secrets privilege,      that item shall not be disclosed or admissible as evidence.       ``(B) Non-privileged evidence.--If the court determines      that an item of evidence is not subject to the state secrets      privilege, the state secrets privilege does not prohibit the      disclosure of that item to the opposing party or the      admission of that item at trial, subject to the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence.       ``(3) Standard of review.--The court shall give substantial      weight to an assertion by the United States relating to why      public disclosure of an item of evidence would be reasonably      likely to cause significant harm to the national defense or      foreign relations of the United States. The court shall weigh      the testimony of a Government expert in the same manner as      the court weighs, and along with, any other expert testimony      in the applicable case.       ``(f) Non-Privileged Substitute.--If the court finds that      material evidence is subject to the state secrets privilege      and it is possible to craft a non-privileged substitute for      that privileged material evidence that provides a      substantially equivalent opportunity to litigate the claim or      defense as would that privileged material evidence, the court      shall order the United States to provide such a substitute,      which may consist of--       ``(1) a summary of such privileged information;       ``(2) a version of the evidence with privileged information      redacted;       ``(3) a statement admitting relevant facts that the      privileged information would tend to prove; or       ``(4) any other alternative as directed by the court in the      interests of justice and protecting national security.       ``(g) Refusal To Provide Non-Privileged Substitute.--In a      suit against the United States or an officer or agent of the      Unites States acting in the official capacity of that officer      or agent, if the court orders the United States to provide a      non-privileged substitute for evidence in accordance with      this section, and the United States fails to comply, the      court shall resolve the disputed issue of fact or law to      which the evidence pertains in the non-government party's      favor.     ``Sec. 4055. Procedures when evidence protected by the state        secrets privilege is necessary for adjudication of a claim        or counterclaim       ``After reviewing all pertinent evidence, privileged and      non-privileged, a Federal court may dismiss a claim or      counterclaim on the basis of the state secrets privilege only      if the court determines that--       ``(1) it is impossible to create for privileged material      evidence a non-privileged substitute under section 4054(f)      that provides a substantially equivalent opportunity to      litigate the claim or counterclaim as would that privileged      material evidence;       ``(2) dismissal of the claim or counterclaim would not harm      national security; and       ``(3) continuing with litigation of the claim or      counterclaim in the absence of the privileged material      evidence would substantially impair the ability of a party to      pursue a valid defense to the claim or counterclaim.     ``Sec. 4056. Interlocutory appeal       ``(a) In General.--The courts of appeal shall have      jurisdiction of an appeal by any party from any interlocutory      decision or order of a district court of the United States      under this chapter.       ``(b) Appeal.--       ``(1) In general.--An appeal taken under this section      either before or during trial shall be expedited by the court      of appeals.       ``(2) During trial.--If an appeal is taken during trial,      the district court shall adjourn the trial until the appeal      is resolved and the court of appeals--       ``(A) shall hear argument on appeal as expeditiously as      possible after adjournment of the trial by the district      court;       ``(B) may dispense with written briefs other than the      supporting materials previously submitted to the trial court;       ``(C) shall render its decision as expeditiously as      possible after argument on appeal; and       ``(D) may dispense with the issuance of a written opinion      in rendering its decision.     ``Sec. 4057. Security procedures       ``(a) In General.--The security procedures established      under the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C.      App.) by the Chief Justice of the United States for the      protection of classified information shall be used to protect      against unauthorized disclosure of evidence protected by the      state secrets privilege.       ``(b) Rules.--The Chief Justice of the United States, in      consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of      National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Defense, may      create additional rules or amend the rules to implement this      chapter and shall submit any such additional rules or      amendments to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence      and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of      Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence and      the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate. Any such rules      or amendments shall become effective 90 days after such      submission, unless Congress provides otherwise. Rules and      amendments shall comply with the letter and spirit of this      chapter, and may include procedures concerning the role of      magistrate judges and special masters in assisting courts in      carrying out this chapter. The rules or amendments under this      subsection may include procedures to ensure that a sufficient      number of attorneys with appropriate security clearances are      available in each of the judicial districts of the United      States to serve as guardians ad litem under section      4052(c)(1).     ``Sec. 4058.
