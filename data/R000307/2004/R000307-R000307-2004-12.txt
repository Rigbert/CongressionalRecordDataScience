President, this amendment makes explicit what is already implicit in the McConnell-Reid substitute amendment; namely, that the Intelligence Committee will have explicit jurisdiction for the consideration and reporting of nominees for civilian intelligence community positions.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and hope the managers will agree to incorporate the modification.
