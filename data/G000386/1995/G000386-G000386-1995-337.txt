 President, I rise to introduce a bill which would extend the Medicare-dependent Hospital Program.  This program expired in October 1994. As its title implied, the hospitals it helped were those which were very dependent on Medicare reimbursement. These were small--100 beds or less--rural, hospitals with not less than 60 percent of total discharges or with 60 percent of total inpatient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. The program enabled the hospitals in question to choose the most favorable of three reimbursement methods.  This program was extended, and phased out down to October 1994, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That act retained the choice of the three original reimbursement methods. But it reduced the reimbursement available from those original computation methods by 50 percent.  My legislation would not extend the program as it was originally enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Rather, it would extend for 5 years the provisions contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. My bill would also extend those provisions retroactively. That is, as though the program had not expired in October 1994.  As I noted above, the hospitals which benefited from this program are small, rural, hospitals providing an essential point of access to hospital or hospital-based services in rural areas and small towns.  Obviously, as those of my colleagues who have followed, and participated in, our debates about the health care needs of rural areas know only too well, if we lose these hospitals, we will also have a hard time keeping physicians in those communities.  [[Page S3613]] Mr. President, 44, or 36 percent, of Iowa's 122 community hospitals qualified to participate in this program, and 29, or 24 percent, chose to participate in 1994. I believe that this was the largest number of such hospitals of any State.  The percentage of all inpatient days attributable to Medicare patients is 77.4 percent for these hospitals, and Medicare discharges represent 65.5 percent of total discharges.  These Iowa hospitals will lose about $3 million dollars as a consequence of the expiration of this program, according to estimates made by the Iowa Hospital Association. The annual losses will vary from a low of $3,635 to a high of $248,016. Fourteen of these hospitals will lose $100,000 or more. Fourteen of these hospitals had negative operating margins in 1994. Those negative operating margins varied from minus $30,970 to minus $1,065,105. It is highly likely that the financial situation of these hospitals will be even worse in the coming years. Two of the hospitals with positive operating margins will probably begin to have negative margins with the expiration of the program.  The bottom line is that many of these hospitals are going to have a very difficult time continuing to exist when this program expires.  Mr. President, I am also going to work toward extension of the each/rpch program--the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital Program. If this program is extended to all the States, and if the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program is extended, the smaller hospitals in Iowa would be able to modify their missions in a deliberate and nondisruptive way and continue to provide essential health care services in their communities.                                 ______      By
