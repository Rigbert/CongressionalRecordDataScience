Speaker, on March 1st, the Peace Corps celebrated its 44th anniversary. It is especially fitting in these troubled times that we recognize the quiet dedication of the men and women of the Peace Corps. Since the inception of the Peace Corps in 1961, more than 178,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served in 138 countries, promoting the Peace Corps' mission of world peace and friendship. Today, the program remains phenomenally successful. The Peace Corps has 7,700 volunteers currently in the field, the highest number in 29 years; 5 of those hard working volunteers hail from our 9th District of Ohio.  The Peace Corps is a cross section of our population; recent college graduates work next to retired citizens. Individuals of all races and ethnicities devote their time and dedication, giving of themselves to help people who are less fortunate.  The Peace Corps operates in 72 countries. Just recently Peace Corps volunteers volunteered in Mexico for the first time, and another 20 countries have expressed interest in working with the Peace Corps. Peace Corps volunteers serve as teachers, business advisors, information technology consultants, health and HIV/AIDS educators and youth and agriculture workers. These volunteers serve as ambassadors to the world, promoting international understanding.  During National Peace Corps Week we honor all the volunteers past and present who have brought help and hope to people in need. Peace Corps volunteers serve from Belize to Ghana, Armenia, Mongolia, East Timor and beyond. We honor their service and compassion. I especially would like to thankthe volunteers from the 9th District: Gwenna Corvez, Michael Heydt, Lenore Johnsen, Bethany Tebbe and Sarah Wilson, who are serving in Uzbekistan, Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Togo, and Moldova. You bring honor to all of us.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E350-E351]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                PEACE CORPS CELEBRATES 44TH ANNIVERSARY                                 ______                                                            HON.
