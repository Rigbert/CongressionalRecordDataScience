Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the Conference Report on S. 1214, which the House approved last week and is now ready for signature by the President. I would like to point out a particular concern that is addressed in Section 445 of the conference agreement. Section 445 addresses the current problem, and the potential for greater future problems, of local jurisdictions seeking to impose taxes and fees on vessels merely transiting or making innocent passage through navigable waters subject to the authority of the United States that are adjacent to the taxing community. We are seeing instances in which local communities are seeking to impose taxes or fees on vessels even where the vessel is not calling on, or landing, in the local community. These are cases where no passengers are disembarking, in the case of passenger vessels, or no cargo is being unloaded in the case of cargo vessels and where the vessels are not stopping for the purpose of receiving any other service offered by the port. In most instances, these types of taxes would not be allowed under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Unfortunately, without a statutory clarification, the only means to determine whether the burden is an impermissible burden under the Constitution is to pursue years of litigation.  Section 445 of the Conference Report addresses this problem by clarifying the sole circumstances when a local jurisdiction may impose a tax or fee on vessels. Local governments, and other non-Federal interests, mayimpose taxes or fees only under an existing exception under the Water Resources Development Act or under extremely limited circumstances in which reasonable fees can be charged on a fair and equitable basis for the cost of service actually rendered to the vessel. The fees must also enhance the safety and efficiency of interstate and foreign commerce and represent at most a ``small burden'' on interstate and foreign commerce. Generally, taxes will not be allowed under this section. The sole exceptions are stated in Section 445.  Mr. President, I support Section 445 as an important correction of a silence in current law that should not be allowed to imperil legitimate commerce.                          ____________________
