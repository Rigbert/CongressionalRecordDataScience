President, as the ranking member of the nutrition subcommittee, I want to make very clear that I am looking forward to working with the chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar, with the ranking member, Senator Harkin, and with the chairman of the nutrition subcommittee, Senator McConnell, on the child nutrition reauthorization bill next year.  When I was chairman of that committee, and continuing under the helm of Senator Lugar, the Agriculture Committee worked together in a bipartisan fashion on nutrition legislation.  I am proud of all the members of that committee who over the years worked together on improving nutrition programs for children. I also had the privilege of working with the former majority leader--Senator Bob Dole--on many child nutrition matters.  The bill that I am introducing today does not represent my effort on a reauthorization bill--I will work on that bill with members of the committee, including the three leadership Members mentioned above.  Rather, this bill indicates changes that should be enacted into law regardless of other actions the Congress might take regarding child nutrition reauthorization.  It includes child nutrition provisions that were included, with some modifications, in the Senate-passed research bill--which passed the Senate by unanimous consent.  Over the recess I intend to consult with nutrition leaders in Vermont, the Under Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, Shirley Watkins, Secretary Glickman, national nutrition advocates and local program directors to gather information for the reauthorization effort.  Also, I urge the President to include sufficient funding in his budget proposals to fund this bill as well as other nutrition initiatives which the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Food and Consumer Services are working to develop.  I must compliment Under Secretary Shirley Watkins for the great job she has done so far. She has taken strong command of an agency that was adrift. Also, I continue to appreciate Secretary Dan Glickman's leadership role in the administration regarding nutrition programs and the strong support of his chief of staff, Greg Frazier.  I note also that Senator Tim Johnson has introduced a school lunch program bill. I will carefully study that bill over the recess. I will also look at the study conducted by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning called Energizing the Classroom.  Over the years many Vermonters have provided me with outstanding advice and guidance on child nutrition issues.  I intend to work with Jo Busha who heads the Child Nutrition Programs for the Vermont Department of Education. She has done a remarkable job in promoting school-based nutrition programs and was recently commended by the Food Research and Action Center for her accomplishments. I was very pleased to work with the committee on a bill that set up the school breakfast startup grant program which has worked extremely well in Vermont. It provided thousands of dollars to Vermont schools to cover the one-time costs of setting up a breakfast program.  I look forward to receiving advice from Mary Carlson, president of the National Association of Farmers' Markets Nutrition Programs, on the WIC-Farmer's Market Program known as the Farm-to-Family program in Vermont.  This program has helped in greatly expanding the number of farmers markets in Vermont and helped low-income families provide their children with healthy foods.  My bill would assure funding for this program and permit other States to participate in the program, or to increase their participation levels.  The bill provides assured funding for programs like the Vermont Common Roots program of Food Works, a nonprofit educational organization in Vermont which has been praised by educators and administrators as an effective educational tool.  Robert Dostis has done an outstanding job as the executive director of the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger. He also deserves a great deal of credit regarding the effort to get more schools on the school breakfast program. He has recently written a ``Report on Childhood Hunger in Vermont: A Handbook for Action.''  He cites some startling statistics in this report. For example, he notes that about 8,000 Vermont children are receiving food from local Vermont food shelves--which is double the figure for 1990.  In addition, nearly 222,000 meals are being served yearly at two dozen community kitchens in Vermont--that is 21 percent more than in 1994.  I will be also working with Donna Bister, as I have for years, on issues related to the WIC program and with Alison Gardner who is the Public Health Nutrition Chief, for the Vermont Department of Health.  I want to extend a special thanks to Dr. Richard Narkewicz of Vermont who is a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He recently visited me with his grandson Corey.  Most of all I want to thank the hundreds of volunteers who run Vermont's Food Shelves and Community Kitchens, and all of those helping out at Vermont's Community Action Agencies.  For many years I have watched the tremendous contributions made by the Vermont FoodBank in the fight against hunger. They have been a first line of defense against child hunger in Vermont and I look forward to working with their director, Deborah Flateman.  All of these Vermonters, and hundreds more who I have not mentioned, carry out the true Vermont tradition of extending a helping hand to neighbors in need.  My bill incorporates many ideas from Vermonters. I have often designed nutrition legislation based on ideas from State and local officials from around the Nation.  Since this bill is not a full reauthorization bill--which I will cosponsor at a later date with other members of the Committee--I have not automatically extended each expiration date in current law. I will certainly support such extensions as appropriate at a later date and will support many other improvements to the bill.  Section 101 is based on an idea provided to me by Joseph Keifer of the Vermont Food Works program. It provides modest Federal funding to help integrate food and nutrition projects with elementary school curricula for a few pilot tests of this provision.  Section 102 increases the reimbursement rates for the summer food service program to a level that should encourage strong participation. At the recommendation of the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger the bill also provides special funding to help defray the costs of transporting children to the food service locations. This additional financial support--of 75 cents per day for each child transported to and from school--is only applicable in very rural areas, as defined by USDA.  Vermont child care sponsors strongly recommended that I support funding for an additional meal supplement for children who are in a child care center for 8 hours or more. Section 103 of the bill does just that and thus helps working parents.  The bill provides for the eligibility of additional schools for the after school care meals program and expands funding for a program that provides meals to homeless preschool children in emergency shelters.  Title II of the bill creates a grant program to assist schools and others to establish or expand a school breakfast program, or a summer food service program. $5 million, per year, in mandatory funding would be made available for this effort.  The school breakfast start up program in Vermont, before it was terminated by Congress, was a remarkable success in part due to the hard work of Jo Busha, Bob Dostis, the Vermont School Food Service Association, and many others.  Also under Title II of the bill, the WIC Farmers' Market Program is provided guaranteed funding. I have worked on this program for a number of years with Mary Carlson of Vermont. Mary is now the president of the association that represents State farmers' market nutrition programs such as the WIC Farmers' Market Program. Making this tremendous program mandatory will assure funding and avoid any appearance of being in competition with the WIC program for appropriated funds.  The bill also sets forth a sense of the Congress that the WIC program should be fully funded, now and forever, for all eligible applicants nationwide. I know that reaching this goal has taken a long time. I appreciate all the help that Donna Bister, the Vermont WIC Director, and many other Vermonters, as well as Bread for the World at the national level, have provided on the WIC program. David Beckmann and Barbara Howell of Bread for the World have worked for years toward this goal.  Finally, I have heard from Alison Gardner about the problems she is having with funding for the Nutrition, Education and Training Program. Congress made that program mandatory but then changed its status back to a program subject to appropriations. My bill will provide $10 million a year for that program and provide a State minimum grant of $85,000 per year.  I want to emphasize again that my bill represents some important child nutrition initiatives. I hope they will all be included in the reauthorization bill. I look forward to working with Senators Lugar, Harkin, McConnell and all the other members of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on this effort just as we worked together on the child nutrition provisions in the Senate-passed research bill.  I also look forward to working with all the Members of the House of Representatives Education and the Workforce Committee. I know they have a keen interest in protecting children and I have enjoyed working in the past with Chairman Goodling and with the ranking minority member Mr. Bill Clay.  The last reauthorization bill passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives by unanimous consent. This shows how well the Congress can work together when the interests of children are at stake.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 1556       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
