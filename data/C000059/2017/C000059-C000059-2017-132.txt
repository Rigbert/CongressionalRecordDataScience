Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County, California, are exceptional. After ten years of exemplary service, Dr. George Beloz is stepping down as President of the Greater Corona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.  Dr. Beloz was born in Chicago and grew up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, where he was interested in fine arts and fishing. At an early age he sold daily newspapers on South Lakeshore Drive in Chicago, worked for Fannie Mae as a teenager and played the piano at church. After a couple of years in college, George was drafted into the Army and was assigned to Heidelberg, Germany where his wife joined him and they lived off-post and traveled throughout Europe while stationed there. After his military service he returned to college and completed his Bachelor's, Master's and PhD degrees, the latter two with the assistance of the GI Bill. He received his PhD from Southern Illinois University. After college, Dr. Beloz was recruited into the Foreign Service and worked for the U.S. Department of State for seven years learning the ropes in the Asian, the Middle Eastern and Latin American regional areas.  Dr. Beloz left the Foreign Service and held several administrative and educational assignments in the Orange County College District. He and his wife, Ruth, moved to Corona in 1983. Since moving to Corona, he was a candidate for the School Board in 1989 and served on the Board of Trustees for the Corona Public Library from 1993 to 1997. Dr. Beloz was appointed to the Citizens Oversight Committee for Measure C, the $169 million bond issue affecting Riverside City College, Moreno Valley and Norco campuses. In 2016, Dr. Beloz was appointed to the Corona Regional Medical Center Board of Governors. For the last ten years he has headed up the Greater Corona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (GCHCOC) by planning engaging evening meetings at Miguel's restaurant with a wide variety of speakers on topics of community interest that have contributed to increasing GCHCOC membership.  Dr. Beloz has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and my friend. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Beloz for his service to Corona--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
