 President, on the occasion of the 50th Birthday of the Girl Scouts of Conestoga Council, I would like to congratulate this fine organization.  Conestoga Council was formed in 1951 and presently serves nearly 4,000 girls in a twelve-county area in Northeast Iowa. The Council delivers traditional Girl Scout programming through troop meetings and activities, camp opportunities and educational learning. In addition, the Council supports eight in-school out reach programs for girls of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The Council has broadened its delivery approach by partnering with the Winnebago Council of Boy Scouts of America to offer day camp activities and experiences through Camp Quest to hundreds of children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to participate.  The Council continues to fulfill its mission of helping girls grow strong with the assistance of hundreds of volunteers throughout Eastern Iowa. Thousands of girls' lives have been touched and enriched through their experience with the Conestoga Council.  Again, I would like to express my congratulations to the Girl Scouts of Conestoga Council for reaching this milestone and I wish them all the best as they continue to serve girls in Northeast Iowa.                          ____________________
