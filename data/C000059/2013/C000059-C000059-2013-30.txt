Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Norco, California are exceptional. Norco has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Beth Groves is one of these individuals. This year, Beth will end her tenure as the City Manager for the city of Norco after four years of service.  Beth's passion and commitment for providing for the community began early. After graduating from Central Michigan University with a Bachelor of Arts in Applied arts, she went on to hone her talent, receiving a Masters in Public Administration from California State University Long Beach, and a Doctorate in Public Administration from the University of Laverne. Beth began her career as Community Relations Coordinator for Mission Hospital, in Mission Viejo, California, and eventually landed a position in the City Manager's Office of Corona, where she served from 1996 to 2008, ultimately becoming the City Manager of Corona. It is the expertise and knowledge gained through these experiences that have allowed to Beth lead Norco for the past four years in such a dynamic manner.  Under Beth's leadership, the city administration has actively promoted and supported the community. Beth is credited with many accomplishments during her time, including negotiating the Silverlakes agreements, establishing a new animal shelter despite many budget restraints, and maintaining the Preservation and Development Zone (PAD) program by working closely with both the planning director and historic commission. She has also encouraged economic development and a family-centered entertainment atmosphere by increasing filming and events that have taken place within the city.  In 2002, Beth received the ``Woman of Distinction'' Award in the category of International Good Will and Understanding from Soroptimist International of Corona, and the title of ``2007 Distinguished Citizen of the Year'' from the Temescal District of the Boy Scouts of America. She has also served as a Community Council Member for the Corona-Norco Chapter of the American Cancer society. The highlights of her extensive volunteer experience include The Foundation for Community and Family Health, Alternatives to Domestic Violence (ADV), Inspire Life Skills, and Peppermint Ridge.  Beth is no stranger to Southern California, having been a Corona resident for many years, where she is a mother to two adult sons and is a member of the Crossroads Christian Church. At the conclusion of her time as City Manager, Beth will remain a fixture in our community, serving as a full time professor at Cal Baptist University in Riverside, CA.  In light of all Beth has done for the city of Norco and the greater community, it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Beth's tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona and Norco and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she moves forward.                          ____________________
