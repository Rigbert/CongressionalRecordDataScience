 President, on May 5 of this year the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously reported out of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. It subsequently referred to the Committee on Armed Services, where it was reported out on June 8.  Senator Kerrey and I have once again worked very closely together to address our critical need for high-quality intelligence by allocating resources in a manner designed to ensure that this need is met.  In preparing this legislation, the committee conducted a detailed review of the administration's three major intelligence budget requests for fiscal year 2000. They are the National Foreign Intelligence Program, the Joint Military Intelligence Program, and the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities of the Military Services.  The committee held briefings and hearings with senior intelligence officials, reviewed budget justification materials, and considered responses to specific questions posed by the committee.  As in the past, the committee also impaneled a group of outside experts composed of distinguished scientists, industry leaders, and retired general and flag officers to review specific technical issues within the intelligence community.  The panel is known as the Technical Advisory Group and is similar to the Defense Department's Defense Science Board in some ways.  This group brings an invaluable level of expertise to the committee's work, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service.  Many of their recommendations have been incorporated into this bill before the Senate this evening.  Once again the committee has focused on what we refer to as the ``five C's''. They are: counterproliferation, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, covert action, and counterintelligence.  The last of the five, counterintelligence, has received a great deal of congressional and media attention in recent months in light of revelations of espionage activities by the People's Republic of China.  I am proud to say that the Intelligence Committee has been attempting to address the shortcomings of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly 10 years, often to no avail.  In fact, it was the Intelligence Committee that directed the study that finally led to the drafting and signing of Presidential Decision Directive 61.  Before I turn to the legislative provisions in this bill, I feel compelled to share with our colleagues some comments about the current state of our defense and intelligence preparedness.  In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, optimistic appraisals of ourintelligence and security requirements generated calls for dramatic cuts in defense and intelligence spending.  The first national security decision made by President Clinton on taking office in 1993 was to cut more than $120 billion from the defense budget. Substantial cuts were also made to classified intelligence programs.  Unfortunately, such optimistic estimates have proved sadly wrong.  Today we face a series of transnational threats spanning the spectrum of conflict from terrorist acts committed on U.S. territory to the development of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by Third World countries.  I recently traveled to the Balkans and reviewed some of our intelligence activities in Europe. Military and civilian personnel were routinely working in excess of 80 hours a week, and that pace was nonstop throughout the Kosovo conflict.  Regretfully, the problems the military and the intelligence community are experiencing are partly our fault. Congress accepted ``defense on the cheap,'' and we have gotten exactly what we paid for as we always do--an intelligence community and military force stretched to its limits.  I believe the result is clear: We are not prepared to meet the challenges of a complex and dangerous world.  National security cannot be had on the cheap, and we have attempted to address some of the shortfalls in this year's bill.  The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex--I remind every Senator--are available for review just off the Senate floor. I repeat: The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex are available to every Senator in this body for review just off the Senate floor.  I will now discuss the significant unclassified legislative provisions contained in the bill.  First, section 304 directs the President to require an employee who requires access to classified information to provide written consent that permits an authorized investigative agency to access information stored in computers used in the performance of Government duties.  This provision is intended to avoid the problems we have seen with the FBI's reluctance to access ``Government'' computers without a warrant in the course of an espionage investigation.  There should be no question--yes, there should be no question--that investigative agencies may search the computer of an individual with access to classified information. This provision makes that perfectly clear.  Second, sections 501 through 505 comprise the Department of Energy Sensitive Country Foreign Visitors Moratorium Act of 1999.  What is that? Section 502 establishes a moratorium on foreign visitors to classified facilities at Department of Energy National Laboratories.  The moratorium applies only to citizens of nations on the Department of Energy ``sensitive countries list.''  Section 502 also provides for a waiver of the moratorium on a case-by-case basis if the Secretary of Energy justifies the waiver and certifies that the visit is necessary for the national security of the United States.  Section 503 requires that the Secretary of Energy perform background checks on all foreign visitors to the National Laboratories. The term ``background checks'' means the consultation of all available, appropriate, and relevant intelligence community and law enforcement databases.  Section 504 requires an interim report to Congress on the counterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories and a net assessment of the Foreign Visitors Program at the National Laboratories to be produced by a panel of experts.  Most importantly, the report must include a recommendation as to whether the moratorium should be continued or repealed.  The Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly 10 years. Beginning in 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding and personnel dedicated to protecting our Nation's nuclear secrets.  Yet year after year--and this year as well--the committee has provided funds and directed many reviews and studies in an effort to persuade the Department of Energy to take action.  Unfortunately, this and prior administrations failed to heed our warnings.  Consequently, a serious espionage threat at our National Labs has gone virtually unabated and it appears that our nuclear weapons program may have suffered extremely grave damage.  I believe we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our National Labs. We understand that a moratorium on the Foreign Visitors Program may be perceived by some as a draconian measure, but until the Department of Energy fully implements a comprehensive and sustained counterintelligence program, we believe that we must err on the side of caution. The stakes are too high.  The moratorium requires a net assessment to be conducted by a panel of experts; this is an integral part of a comprehensive report by the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI on the counterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories.  Only then should we decide whether to lift the moratorium in favor of a comprehensive plan. I believe this is a very important point.  During our preliminary look in the committee into the problems at the DOE labs, we were convinced that the FBI could and should be required to inform an agency or department that they are investigating an employee of that particular agency.  Accordingly, section 602 of the bill requires the FBI to establish meaningful liaison with the relevant agency at the beginning stages of a counterintelligence investigation.  This section also amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995 to make clear that the FBI's obligation to consult with departments and agencies concerned begins when the FBI has knowledge of espionage activities from other sources or as a result of its own information or investigation.  In closing, I must remind the Members of this body, my colleagues, of an unfortunate fact. This is the last time that Senator Kerrey, the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska, will bring an intelligence authorization bill to the floor of the Senate as the vice chairman of the committee.  Senator Kerrey's tenure on the committee will conclude at the end of this year.  This past March 14, as some of you will recall, marked the 30th anniversary of the day that Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bob Kerrey, leading his SEAL team on an operation on an island in the bay of Nha Trang earned our Nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor.  No one who knows Bob Kerrey's military record would question his physical courage, but I would like to talk for just a few minutes about another type of courage he has, and that is moral courage.  In a town like Washington that rewards neither, he is the rare man who has both, I believe. The wartime history of the United States Navy has documented his physical courage, but I want to recognize his moral courage. And I want to tell you why.  Senator Kerrey has taken stands that many of us would consider politically unwise.  He took a stand on entitlements reform here in the Senate long before it was politically wise to do so. It can be said he laid his bare hand on the ``third rail of American politics'' and took the heat--something few in this body were willing to attempt.  As vice chairman of this committee, Senator Kerrey has often taken issue with his own administration when he believed it was in the national interest to do so. Indeed, he always puts the interests of the Nation ahead of politics.  Also, Senator Kerrey's knowledge of our intelligence needs is unparalleled in the Senate. And I will miss his service, as others will, on the Intelligence Committee.  Senator Kerrey has set a very high standard for his successor, and I thank him for his dedication and integrity, and also for his personal friendship. It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with Nebraska's senior Senator.  I look forward to joining him on the floor one last time when the conference report for this bill reaches the floor later this year.  Until that time, though, we will continue to work closely to conduct vigorous oversight of the intelligence activities of the United States in thenonpartisan spirit that created this important and unique committee.  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 1009 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate     S. 1009--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000       Summary: S. 1009 would authorize appropriations for fiscal      year 2000 for intelligence activities of the United States      government, the Intelligence Community Management Account,      and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability      System (CIARDS).       This estimate addresses only the unclassified portion of      the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting      the bill would result in additional spending of $172 million      over the 2000-2004 period, assuming appropriation of the      authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill      would affect direct spending; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures      would apply. However, CBO cannot give a precise estimate of      the direct spending effects because the data necessary to      support a cost estimate are classified.       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from      application of that all legislative provisions that are      necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that      the unclassified provisions of this bill either fit within      that exclusion or do not cover intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of the unclassified portions of S. 1009 is      shown in the following table. CBO cannot obtain the necessary      information to estimate the costs for the entire bill because      parts are classified at a level above clearances held by CBO      employees. For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that      the bill will be enacted by October 1, 1999, and that the      authorized amounts will be appropriated for fiscal year 2000.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     By fiscal years in millions of dollars--                                                                 -----------------------------------------------                                                                   1999    2000    2001    2002    2003    2004----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Spending Under Current Law for Intelligence Community Management:  Budget Authority \1\..........................................     102       0       0       0       0  ......

Outlays are estimated according to historical spending      patterns. The costs of this legislation fall within budget      function 050 (national defense).       The bill would authorize appropriations of $172 million for      the Intelligence Community Management Account, which funds      the coordination of programs, budget oversight, and      management of the intelligence agencies. In addition, the      bill would authorize $209 million for CIARDS to cover      retirement costs attributable to military service and various      unfunded liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered      mandatory, and the authorization under this bill would be the      same as assumed in the CBO baseline.       Section 305 would allow an individual who is or has been      affiliated with a Communist or similar political party to      become a naturalized citizen, if the individual has made a      contribution to the national security or national      intelligence mission of the United States. Under current law,      such individuals are not allowed to become naturalized      citizens, unless the affiliation was involuntary. Enacting      this provision could effect certain federal assistance      programs and the amount of fees collected by the Immigration      and Naturalization Service. Because the number of affected      individuals is expected to be very small, however, CBO      estimates that any effects on direct spending would not be      significant.       Section 402 of the bill would extend the authority of the      Central Intelligence Agency to offer incentive payments to      employees who voluntarily retire or resign. This * * * which      is currently scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year      1999, would be * * * through fiscal year 2000. Section 402      would also require the CIA to make a deposit to the Civil      Service Retirement and Disability Fund equal to 15 percent of      final pay for each employee who accepts an incentive payment.      CBO estimates that these payments would amount to less than      $3 million. We believe that these deposits would be      sufficient to cover the cost of any long-term increase in      benefits that would result from induced retirements, although      the timing of agency payments and the additional benefit      payments would not match on a yearly basis. CBO cannot      provide a precise estimate of the direct spending effects      because the data necessary for an estimate are classified.       Section 501 of the bill would require a background      investigation of citizens of a foreign nation before they      could enter a national laboratory of the Department of      Energy. Based on information from two of the three national      laboratories, CBO expects the laboratories to host about      10,000 foreign visitors a year. The cost to conduct an      investigation would depend on the type of background check.      According to the Defense Department, the cost for a minimum      national agency check is about $70, and the cost can increase      to $300 with additional credit bureau or local police agency      checks. Because some of these costs would be incurred under      current law, CBO estimates that the additional costs of      section 501 would be minimal.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Sections 305 and 402 of the      bill would affect direct spending, and therefore the bill      would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures. CBO estimates      that the direct spending costs of section 305 would be very      small. CBO cannot estimate the precise direct spending      effects of section 402 because the necessary data are      classified.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The Unfunded      Mandates Reform Act excludes from application of the act      legislative provisions that are necessary for the national      security. CBO has determined that the unclassified provisions      of this bill either fit within that exclusion or do * * *      intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined by      UMRA.       Previous CBO estimate: On May 5, 1999, CBO prepared a cost      estimate for the unclassified portion of H.R. 1555, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, as      ordered reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence, The House version authorizes * * * Intelligence      Community Management, and the estimated costs of H.R. 155 are      * * * higher.
