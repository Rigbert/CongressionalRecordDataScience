 President, the two leaders are continuing to discuss the process to consider the military tribunals legislation as a freestanding measure. If an agreement can be reached early tomorrow morning, then it is possible the scheduled cloture vote will be vitiated and the Senate will consider the bill under this consent agreement. Senators should be on notice that votes in relation to the military tribunal legislation can occur throughout tomorrow's session.  As the majority leader has previously stated, we have much work to complete this week; therefore, all Senators can expect full days and late nights to finish the remaining work.                          ____________________
