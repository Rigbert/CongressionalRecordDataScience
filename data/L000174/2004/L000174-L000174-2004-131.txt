President, I have worked closely with the United States Secret Service for many years. Their tradition of excellence and the quality of their protective services and investigations is well known. I know that the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, William Pickle, proudly served with them for many years.  As the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, with jurisdiction regarding United States Secret Service matters, Senator Hatch and I have introduced an amendment to ensure that the Service remains a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security. It is important that the Secret Service continue, as they did under the Department of the Treasury, to function as a cohesive unit and not have its functions divided. It is also important that the Secret Service, as they did under the Department of the Treasury, not be merged with other agencies which would dilute the Service's ability to achieve their crucial mission. It is also important to preserve their current chain of command structure.  Our amendment requires that the United States Secret Service be maintained as a ``distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security'' and that the Secret Service not be merged with any other Department function. Further, our amendment requires that all personnel and operational elements of the Service report at all times to ``the Director of the United States Secret Service'' who shall report directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security without having to report through other officials.  The United States Secret Service is doing an outstanding job in tough times and this amendment will assure that they keep fully devoted to their critical missions in the same excellent manner as they have done in the past.  I hope all Members will join us in including this important amendment in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.
