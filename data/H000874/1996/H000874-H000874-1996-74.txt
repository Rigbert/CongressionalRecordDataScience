Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I appreciate the support of the amendment by the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] as well. The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] and I and others have worked very hard to make sure that as we reduce the size of the Federal Government, which is a consensus, we have all agreed on that, and in fact as I said last night, the Federal Government is now and will be at the end of this year the smallest it has been since the Presidency of John Kennedy, smaller than either under Presidents Reagan or Bush, and that is a direction we have decided on together as a Congress to pursue with the administration. In fact, the administration proposed that procedure and objective and has supported it. We are going to reduce some 275,000 employees; perhaps even more with the budget cuts that have occurred.  In that process, as employers, we ought to make that reduction in as sensitive, humane, and managerially sound way as possible. Buyouts do that, and that is why I support them. In fact, the GAO has pointed out that buyouts are cheaper than RIF's, because the RIF requirements impose certain costs which exceed the costs of the buyout. As a result of that, I think this is a wise policy from the taxpayers' standpoint, and policy consistent with the morale of those who carry out the duties assigned to them by the Government and by us. Therefore, I therefore rise in support of the amendment.
