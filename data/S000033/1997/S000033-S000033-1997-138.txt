 Speaker, one of the reasons that I am an Independent is that I feel that to a large degree, both political parties are dominated by big money interests and it would be very hard for that candidate who is prepared to stand up to the large multinational corporations who have so much influence over our economy and over the politics of what goes on, it is no great secret.  I mean as the gentleman well knows, we hear a whole lot of discussion about the influence of big labor on the political process, the gentleman is aware that corporate America puts in seven times more money than labor does.
