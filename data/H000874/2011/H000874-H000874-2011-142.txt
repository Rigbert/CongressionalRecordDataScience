Today we celebrate the 85th birthday of an extraordinary American, an American who has served over five-eighths of his life in this House, an American whose father served before him, an American who has been sent to the Congress after Congress after Congress after Congress, a Member who has made an extraordinary contribution to the legislative history of this Congress and to the welfare of this country. John Dingell today is 85 years of age.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to now yield to somebody who has not served with him for 85 years, but has served with him for a very significant time on the extraordinarily important Energy and Commerce Committee, my friend from Texas (Mr. Barton).
