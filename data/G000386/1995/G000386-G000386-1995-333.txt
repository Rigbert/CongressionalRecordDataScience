 President, I rise to discuss my reasons for voting for the bill, but also to state some concerns I have about the direction that the Department of Defense is taking.  I want to commend, first of all, the Appropriations Committee and, of course, its chairman, Senator Hatfield, for doing what I think is a very responsible thing, and that is to offset the cost of the readiness through rescissions, not from other Departments of Government, but from Defense Department programs.  I recently requested both the CBO and the General Accounting Office, GAO, to review the defense budget to determine whether there were programs being funded that were not directly related to a strong military and our national security operations and responsibilities.  CBO identified $64 billion falling into that category, and the GAO identified $70 billion. Those are figures that cover the next 5 years. They suggested that these programs were absolutely clearly not related to our national security, but they identified these programs for review to determine whether these programs should be continued in the defense budget.  I am pleased to note that some of the programs contained in the reports that I requested have been used by the Appropriations Committee as offsets in this bill.  My view, in general, is that we should not only scrutinize nondefense spending in the defense budget but many defense-related items as well. So along that line, I commend specifically Senators McCain and Warner, both of them very respected members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for their work in identifying defense programs that should be cut or reduced, such as the B-2 bomber and the M-1 tank upgrade.  Because I firmly believe that we must closely scrutinize both military programs, as Senator McCain and Senator Warner have suggested, but also I go beyond that to other so-called nondefense spending, which is in the defense budget, before we consider increasing defense spending above this administration's proposed levels. And I hope you remember that for the 5 years in this year's budget, the President's proposing $25 billion above what it was in his first budget.  Now, I think that scrutinizing these programs is exactly what the Appropriations Committee has done in this bill. The committee found it unnecessary to increase defense spending to meet the readiness needs because it found alternative options to new spending.  Mr. President, last year I supported what we call in this body defense firewalls so spending cannot be taken out of defense and spent some place else. Many of my colleagues were concerned then that we might rob the defense budget to pay for domestic programs. Rather, we believe that if defense spending is reduced, it should be used to cut the deficit, not to increase domestic spending.  I also believe there is another corollary, because I believe that defense firewalls should work both ways. We should not rob funding for domestic programs to pay for defense spending either. There is clearly sufficient funding within the defense budget to meet readiness concerns. It is simply a matter of the Pentagon prioritizing its funding and improving its management. Because the Appropriations Committee has not robbed the domestic spending accounts to pay for defense readiness, I am willing to support this supplemental appropriations bill, and I commend the committee's work. I strongly urge the committee, however, to continue its good work and to resist in conference any efforts by the other body to pay for defense programs from domestic offsets.  Now, having said that, Mr. President, I wish to address briefly the issue of the obligations and expenditures of public money that has not been appropriated by the Congress and specifically to alert my colleagues to some pending requests from the Department of Defense to amend authorizing language, present statute, which I think gives them the capability of spending money not appropriated by the Congress.  The bill before us, if approved, would provide $126.3 million to bail out two Army fiscal year 1994 appropriations accounts. They would do it this way: $3.3 million for the military personnel account and $123 million for the operation and maintenance account. These two accounts are overobligated. They are overdrawn. They are in the red.  When the Army was ordered to deploy troops to Haiti, its financial accounts contained insufficient funds to cover the cost of the operation but we know that the Army deployed anyway. The Army spent money that it did not have. As a result of that operation, those accounts have negative balances. They are in the red to the tune of $126.3 million. If the $126.3 million is needed to meet legitimate obligations, then we in this Congress have no choice. We have to pony up the money because we have to pay our bills.  Well, under the Constitution, as we know, that is not the way the spending process of the Federal Government, including the Defense Department, is supposed to work because under our Constitution Congress has the sole authority to decide when and to what extent public moneys are committed.  Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that the bill before us contains unauthorized appropriations. Quite the contrary. The Department of Defense is authorized under the law to spend money in excess of available appropriations. That authority is contained in the Feed and Forage Act that dates back to the Civil War.  The authority was justified in those days. Troops often went on long periods without pay and had to forage to survive. Government chits were issued to exchange for food and redeemed later on for cash. The Feed and Forage Act is embodied in section 11 of title 41 of the United States Code. The Feed and Forage Act was last invoked by the Department of Defense on September 19, 1994. That decision generated the request for these $126.3 million that are in this bill. The authorizing documents were signed by Mr. Deutch, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Mr. Hamre, the Comptroller.  I ask unanimous consent that those be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1994.     Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Departments,          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Commander in          Chief, U.S. Special Operations Command.     Subject: Obligations in Excess of Appropriations for          Restoration of Democracy in Haiti.       The Department of Defense is likely to incur, in accordance      with applicable law, obligations in excess of available      appropriations to ensure the necessary funding to support      units of the U.S. Armed Forces conducting military operations      in connection with the restoration of democracy in Haiti.       I authorize the incurring of deficiencies for clothing,      subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, and      medical and hospital supplies, not in excess of the      necessities of the current year, under the authority of      Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 11), known as      the Feed and Forage Act. On my behalf, the Comptroller of the      Department of Defense shall make the reports to Congress      required by law with respect to the use of this authority.       [[Page S3659]] Also, pursuant to Section 2201(c) of Title      10 of the United States Code and the necessity based on      Presidential determination to increase the number of members      of the Armed Forces on active duty beyond the number for      which funds were provided in Appropriations acts for the      Department of Defense, I authorize the incurring of      deficiencies for costs of such personnel under Section      3732(a) of the Revised Statutes.       The Comptroller of the Department of Defense shall issue      such instructions as may be necessary to implement this      memorandum, including prescription of the dollar levels for      deficiencies by appropriations account.     John Deutch.                                                                    ____                                                Comptroller of the                                        Department of Defense,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1994.     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the Secretary of Defense,      this is to advise that the Secretary of Defense has invoked      the authority granted by Section 3732 of the Revised Statutes      (41 U.S.C. 11) to authorize the Military Departments to incur      obligations in excess of available appropriations for      clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters,      transportation, and medical and hospital supplies, not in      excess of the necessities of the current year in support of      U.S. military. He has also invoked the authority granted by      Section 2201(c) of Title 10 U.S.C. to authorize incurring      deficiencies for the costs of additional members of the Armed      Forces. This action will ensure that the Department of      Defense can support U.S. military operations in connection      with the restoration of democracy in Haiti.           Sincerely,                                                    John J. Hamre.
