President, in fiscal year 2004 I initiated a new fund in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act entitled ``Reconciliation Programs.'' This fund is managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation. In fiscal year 2006 it was funded at $15 million, and its purpose is to support reconciliation programs and activities ``which bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds from areas of civil conflict and war.'' Our intent is to support initiatives of organizations representing groups of people who have been in conflict with each other to promote better understanding and reconciliation.  This is a global program, and the funds have been allocated to support activities in countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. For reasons that should be obvious, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the focus of many organizations in that region that seek to bring representatives of both peoples together to build trust, improve understanding, and find common solutions to the roots of the conflict.  There are dozens of conflicts in the world, and $15 million is too little money to support all the meritorious reconciliation proposals. This is particularly true in the Middle East. USAID has funded several organizations that bring together Israelis and Palestinians, but funding constraints make it impossible to support every deserving organization. This unmet need is the subject of a recent op-ed in the Palestine Times which poses some important questions. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Rabbi Michael Cohen, who has done extraordinary work in this area, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Palestine Times, Dec. 5, 2006]                      Palestinian Permits and NGOs                        (Rabbi Michael M. Cohen)       The day after Israel observed the 11th anniversary of the      murder of Yitzhak Rabin Haaretz summed up the Arab-Israeli      conflict, ``After more than six years of continuous fighting,      neither side appears to have given up the basic assumption at      the beginning of the Intafada. The Palestinians and the      Israelis are both still convinced the other side understands      only force.''       The latest cease-fire in Gaza, shaky at best with Qassam      Rockets still being fired into Israel, is a move in the right      direction to quell the use of force by both sides. The truth      is that for the past year we have not been moving closer to      peace between Israel and the Palestinians. King Abdullah has      said more than once that unless there is tangible movement      towards peace in the upcoming months this conflict will be      cursed to go on for decades.       The Talmud teaches a very profound lesson about the use of      force and power. In separate moments the prophets Daniel and      Jeremiah question how mighty is God. The Talmud responds with      equal audacity by stating that God's might can also be found      and experienced when God decides to withhold his might and      power! This is a lesson too often lost in this holy corner of      the world.       There are scores of NGOs across Israel and the Palestinian      Authority working together that understand that force will      never translate peace into realty. In the ebb and flow of      diplomacy these NGOs provide the only ongoing constant to      strengthen the majority of Israelis and Palestinians who      desire peace. At one time these organizations could apply for      Wye River and Israel Arab Peace Partners Program grants from      the US government. These have been cut from the US Budget so,      for example, organizations of the Alliance for Peace in the      Middle East (ALLMEP) are limited where they can find funds.       When attempts are made by ALLMEP to create a separate fund      for NGOs working to end the Arab-Israeli conflict they are      told by Congress that countries like Israel, Jordan, Egypt,      etc. already get billions in US aid, while other areas of      conflict get much less. The only way to create such a fund      would be to reduce aid, much of it military, to those      countries. One question that was not asked recently of Prime      Minister Olmert when he was in Washington was, ``Would you be      willing to have a few million dollars that Israel receives      shifted to support organizations that work towards      reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians?'' At      present the United States is spending $200 million a day for      the war in Iraq. Give these NGOs in the Palestinian-Israeli      conflict a few hours worth of that spending, and we would see      the Palestinian-Israeli conflict end in less than a year.       One of the key ingredients to reconciliation between      Israelis and Palestinians is the ability to meet each other.      For years now the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies,      the premier teaching and research program in the Middle East      where future Arab and Jewish leaders are prepared to      cooperatively solve the region's environmental challenges,      has been unable to get permits for Palestinian students      outside of East Jerusalem to study on its campus. This      includes students who wish to, ``learn to use the environment      as an approach to peace-building between Palestinians and      Israelis.''       At present the Arava Institute has put together a coalition      that includes the office of U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones,      USAID, Members of the Knesset Orit Noked and Ami Ayalon, the      Middle East Division of the Israel Foreign Ministry, and      Gisha: the Center for the Legal Protection of Freedom of      Movement. This coalition is working to challenge the Israeli      policy of not issuing any new study permits for Palestinians,      who have security clearance, and who wish to study in Israel.      This policy flies in the face of the Agreement on Movement      and Access that was signed last year by the United States,      Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. Another question not      asked of Prime Minister Olmert, ``Are you willing to end this      blanket policy of no new study permits for Palestinians to      study in Israel?''       The author David Grossman, who lost his son Uri during the      war this past summer, poignantly addressed 100,000 Israelis      who gathered on the anniversary of Rabin's murder in Rabin      Square. Turning to Prime Minister Olmert he said, ``We have      no choice and they have no choice. And a peace of no choice      should be approached with the same determination and      creativity as one approaches a war of no choice. And those      who believe we do have a choice, or that time is on our side      do not comprehend the deeply dangerous process already in      motion.''       Prime Minister Olmert reached out to Palestinians a few      days ago when he spoke at the grave of Ben-Gurion and      reiterated his call for the establishment of a Palestinian      State next to Israel. We have had enough of words. What we      need is peaceful action to     back up such words by both Palestinians and Israelis. An      affirmative answer by Prime Minister Olmert to the questions      raised above would signal a tangible seriousness about moving      the peace process forward, and would show a determination and      creativity that is so desperately needed. Similar action will      also need to come from the Palestinian side so that both      Israeli and Palestinians can move the peace process forward      and not backward.       Rabbi Michael M.
