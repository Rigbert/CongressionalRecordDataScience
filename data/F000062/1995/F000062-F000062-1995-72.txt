 President, I would very much like to commend the Senator from Wyoming for his work on immigration.  I am privileged to serve on his subcommittee on immigration on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been very wonderful for me to be able to watch him work out various problems in what has been a most difficult arena in which to legislate.  So I would just like to say to him, I am delighted he has presented his bill. I look forward to reading it. I hope I will be able to cosponsor it. I look forward to work with him in the committee as this bill is moved.  I think, Mr. President, that the Senator from Wyoming understands the need to move a bill in this session of the Congress. So I would like him to know that I am very respectful and grateful for his work in this area.                                 ______      By
