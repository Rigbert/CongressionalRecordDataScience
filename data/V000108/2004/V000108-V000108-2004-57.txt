Speaker, It is with great pride and respect that I pay tribute to Army Reserve Specialist Michael J. Wiesemann for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Wiesemann lost his life Saturday, May 29, 2004, in a non-combat related injury, while bravely serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom for the United States Army. His sacrifice will be remembered at funeral services on Wednesday, June 9, 2004, by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  Specialist Wiesemann, 20, was born in Valparaiso, Indiana. He later moved to North Judson, Indiana, a small town with a population of fifteen hundred, and graduated from North Judson-San Pierre High School in 2002. He was known as a great artist with a witty sense of humor. After high school, Specialist Weisemann decided to join the Army Reserves with the hope that it would assist him financially with college, help him fulfill his dream of becoming an artist, and allow him to find himself through the discipline and order that it provides.  Michael's sacrifice for his country is a tribute to his dedication and willingness to put others before himself. Those who knew Michael best describe him as a kind, fun-loving person, who always wanted to help others. He ultimately gave his life while protecting his fellow Americans. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he fought.  Specialist Wiesemann is survived by his mother, Karen Bubac, his stepfather, Robert Bubac, his father, Duwain Wilson, his brother, Travis Bubac, his half-sister, Tori Bubac, andhis fiancee Abigail Trusty, whom he planned to marry when he returned home from Iraq. These individuals were the heroes to a true patriot, so I rise today to honor them and recognize their sacrifice during these tumultuous times.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Reserve Specialist Michael J. Wiesemann. Specialist Wiesemann is the twenty-third service member from Indiana to sacrifice his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his passing comes as a difficult setback to a community shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Wiesemann will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
