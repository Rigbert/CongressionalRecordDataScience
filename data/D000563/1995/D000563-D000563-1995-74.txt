Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the motion instructs the House conferees to recede to the Senate number for section 502 rural low-income housing direct loans. The House-passed amount is $550 million, while the Senate provided $1 billion. The House-reported amount, however, was $900 million.  Receding to the Senate for this important, necessary and popular program will merely take the activity back to the approximate level originally recommended by the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen], my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, and agreed to by the Committee on Appropriations. Even at the Senate level, the section 502 program will be $200 million below the $1.2 billion provided for fiscal year 1995 and the amount requested for 1996.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1900
