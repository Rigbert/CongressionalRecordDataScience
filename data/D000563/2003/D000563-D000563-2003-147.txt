President, America's burden in Iraq grew heavier over the last 7 days. In that period of time, 27 American servicemen were killed and 35 wounded. We were awakened to newspaper headlines on Monday morning of: ``U.S. Copter Hit, With 16 Dead.''  On Sunday, I received the sad news that the National Guard helicopter which was downed was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division and piloted by 1LT Brian Slavenas from Genoa, IL. It was shot down by a surface-to-air missile near Falluja in Iraq.  Press accounts report that the missile was likely a heat-seeking missile because it hit the engine, but, thankfully, it did not explode. The helicopter went out of control, and First Lieutenant Slavenas clearly did the best he could at crash-landing the crippled aircraft. Quite possibly he saved the lives of those who survived. Sadly, he did not.  This morning, I called the Slavenas family expressing my sympathy for the loss of their son. I have read the press accounts about his short but eventful and full life and the love which his family and so many others had for him.  This morning I heard interviews on National Public Radio of his friends talking about a great young man--this 30-year-old helicopter pilot. He had just graduated from college a few months ago. He enlisted in the Army right after high school and, having completed that stint, he enlisted in the National Guard and went to officer training school and he became a helicopter pilot. He earned a degree in engineering from the University of Illinois. Although Brian stood 6 feet 5 inches tall, he was a gentle giant. He was an accomplished pianist. His brother Marcus said, ``He was very generous, very patient with people. I just loved being with him. He was my favorite person in the whole world.''  I ask unanimous consent that these articles of tribute to Brian Slavenas be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From the Chicago Sun-Times]                           (By Dave McKinney)       His brothers and his father served in the military, but      when 1st Lt. Brian Slavenas was called to active duty earlier      this year, his family tried to discourage him from shipping      out. He could have resigned his commission in the Illinois      Army National Guard and skipped the deployment that carried      his aviation unit to Iraq, Despite his family's concerns, the      30-year-old helicopter pilot who had graduated from college a      few months earlier decided it was his duty to go overseas      with his outfit. On Monday, relatives gathered at the family      home in the tiny farm town of Genoa to mourn his death spoke      with pride--and some regret--about his decision to continue a      family tradition of military service.       Brian Slavenas died Sunday when his CH-47 Chinook      helicopter was shot down by shoulder-fired missiles in a      attack that killed 16 U.S. soldiers. ``We know he didn't have      to be there. But he chose to go and to serve his country,''      said his oldest brother, Eric Slavenas, 39 a U.S. Army      veteran who participated in the invasion of Grenada in 1983.      ``I miss him. I wish he were still here,'' Eric added. ``But      I'm not going to go against his decision. I back him 100      percent.''       Brian wasn't eager to go to Iraq when he left in April,      other family members said. He had completed study at the      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in December with      an engineering degree and was eager to get on with his      career. Still, he felt obligated to go overseas with his      unit. ``He wasn't keen on the idea but he said, `Once you're      in, you can't cop out,' '' said his dad, Ronald Slavenas, a      former Army paratrooper who later served for a time with      Brian in the same Illinois National Guard unit.                      Drawn by history, adventure       During his time overseas, Brian's letters, calls and e-     mails home were usually upbeat and often funny, his family      said. Brian liked the adventure of being overseas in such an      exotic location, Eric said, recalling that in one letter      Brian described how he sipped a glass of Tang as he flew over      the ancient ruins of Babylon. ``He enjoyed the sights he saw,      being in such a historic part of the world,'' Eric said. ``He      knew it was dangerous, but it was more of an adventure for      him.'' At times, Brian talked of possibly staying in the      military as a career, in part because he loved flying. ``I      think during the war, he got gung-ho about what he was      doing,'' said his brother, Marcus Slavenas, a 33-year-old      former U.S. Marine who served in Operation Desert Storm.       Brian had already served a stint in the Army, joining after      he graduated from DeKalb High School, where he played drums      and threw the discus. After finishing active duty, he joined      the National Guard, then went to officer school and became a      helicopter pilot. Along the way, he also obtained a private      pilot's license and earned his degree from the U. of I.      Although he stood a towering 6 foot 5 inches tall, Brian was      a ``gentle giant,'' according to his father. He was an      accomplished pianist and dedicated weight lifter who could      get along with just about anyone, his brother said. ``He was      very generous, very patient with people,'' Marcus said,      adding, ``I just loved being with him. He was my favorite      person in the whole world.''       Besides his two brothers and father, he is survived by his      mother, a stepmother, a stepbrother and stepsister.                          may have saved lives       Brian, a member of the Peoria-based 106th Aviation Unit,      was activated in February and had been serving in Iraq since      April, said Brig. Gen. Randal Thomas, adjutant general of the      Illinois National Guard. He had been certified to fly the CH-     47 Chinook helicopter since 2002 and was flying at 150 mph at      about 200 feet off the ground when it was shot down near      Fallujah, Iraq. Thomas told reporters in Springfield.       ``We're thankful that a number of individuals survived that      crash. It would be speculative to say the pilot did his job      and got that aircraft down and saved lives, but I'd sure like      to believe that,'' Thomas said.       The Slavenas brothers say they're upset the Army wasn't      taking more precautions to protect the slow-moving Chinook      helicopters from missile attacks like the one that killed      Brian. Since the attack, the military has banned Chinook      flights during the day because the choppers are too      vulnerable. ``I support our military. The only thing I      question is the tactics that were used in this situation,''      Eric said. ``Someone should have had enough foresight to see      ahead that a lumbering aircraft that only flies 180 miles an      hour makes a good target.''       Saying he ``just didn't believe this was our war,'' Marcus      isn't sure the conflict was worth his younger brother's life.      ``Personally, I wish these people in Iraq well, but I don't      care about them like I do about my brother,'' he said. ``I      think maybe I would like to see American military used to      defend America and not police the entire world.''       And he regrets not trying harder to keep his brother from      going to Iraq.       ``We all very strongly encouraged him not to go,'' Marcus      said. ``In retrospect, I'm going to kick myself--I wish I      would have tried harder.                                  ____              [From American Morning (CNN), Nov. 4, 2003]            Interview With Family of Downed Helicopter Pilot       Soledad O'Brien, (CNN Anchor). There was more violence in      Iraq this morning. Another soldier was killed, the second in      as many days. The soldier was killed after an improvised      explosive device, or an IED, exploded in Baghdad. Another      U.S. soldier was wounded in that blast.       The attacks followed Sunday's downing of a U.S. helicopter      near Fallujah, the deadliest single attack on U.S. forces      since the invasion. According to eyewitnesses, the second of      two shoulder-launched missiles hit the CH-47 Chinook, as it      flew just a few hundred feet above the ground. The missile      struck the rear engine and started a chain reaction that      caused the helicopter to crash.       Most of the soldiers were heading out to begin a two-week      leave when the chopper was shot down. Sixteen soldiers were      killed, and among them was the pilot, First Lieutenant Brian      Slavenas, a member of the National Guard from Peoria,      Illinois.       A little earlier today, I spoke to his family about their      loss.       Mr. Slavenas, if I can begin with you. Brian actually could      have avoided deployment, but he chose not to. Tell me why.       Ronald Slavenas (Father of Chinook Pilot). Well, that's the      kind of person he is. He's a responsible person, and he took      on something and he brought it to completion. That's the      nature of Brian. He may not like the idea, but he followed it      through, and I've got to do it, and he did it.       O'Brien. I read that he felt obliged to serve his country.      He was a helicopter pilot in the National Guard.       Marcus, why don't you tell me a little bit about your      brother, the person, not necessarily the military man?       Marcus Slavenas, (Brother of Chinook Pilot). Not just      because he was my brother, but he was really one of the best      people I've ever known. Very clean living, very dedicated to      what he did. If he decided to do something he did it. He      focused on it and did it until he was excellent at it. He was      very kind to people. He was a good person. It was not based      on some rules. It wasn't based on religion. It's just the way      he was. He cared about those around him and tried hard always      to do his best.       O'Brien. Tell me--I know that he recently finished school.      He'd gone to school for engineering. Give me a sense of what      his plans were and his dreams were further down the road.       Unidentified Male. Well, we felt that Brian was probably      going to get out of the military and pursue a career in      engineering. He had a very promising career ahead of him. He      did well in his field. I know there were a lot of companies      that wanted to interview him. So, we were hoping and we all      felt that he was going to continue on with the engineering.       O'Brien. Mr. Slavenas, when you first saw the reports--I      have to imagine you saw the reports before you heard the news      that it was Brian who was actually piloting this chopper.      What was your reaction to this? And I've got to ask you,      did you think after a certain amount of time that it was      indeed your son who was among the lost?       R. Slavenas. Well, it crossed my mind. I thought he was      further west of the area of where it happened, but he's been      flying around all over Iraq, I guess, to Kuwait and back and      forth. The Chinook is like a shuttle service for different      units. He was flying support for different outfits. The last      one for the 3rd Armored Calvary, and I thought he was further      west. So, that was my kind of hope that maybe that wasn't      Brian, but then later on we found the news that it was Brian,      actually.       O'Brien. You served in the military, sir, and your three      sons all served in the military as well. What are your      thoughts about the U.S. involvement in Iraq and the      occupation of Iraq right now?       R. Slavenas. Well, now that we're in, we have to stay the      course. We just can't pull out. If we pull out, we'll have      pandemonium. They have so many different factions in Iraq--     the Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds, and what have you. And if      we pull out now without stabilizing the situation, we'll      have, as I said before, pandemonium. It would be a      revolution. That's my feeling.       So, we have to keep a stabilizing cap over it and hopefully      getting more help from other nations and other sources.       O'Brien. Marcus, you served in the military as well, and I      know you have strong opinions on this.       M. Slavens. Yes.       O'Brien. What's your take on U.S. involvement in Iraq right      now?       M. Slavenas. I don't believe we need to be there. I wish      the Iraqis well, and I hope they can figure out their      problems, but I don't want this to happen at the expense of      our boys. I would like to see them come home. And as far as      the troops go, while they're still there, I'm fully behind      them. Fight as hard as you can. Destroy the enemy and keep      yourselves alive and come back home. But as far as the      government is concerned, please try to get out of that      business and bring them back home as soon as possible.                                  ____                [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 4, 2003]                    For Families, Sad News Hits Home                 (By Russell Working and Angela Rozas)       One soldier was going to visit his wife and three children,      the youngest of whom he had never met. Another was on his way      home to attend his mother's funeral. A third wanted to      surprise her family in California with a two-week visit.       On Monday, the Department of Defense began releasing the      names of the 16 soldiers killed when a transport helicopter      was shot down in Iraq, marking the single largest loss of      service members in that country since major combat ended in      the spring. Another 20 soldiers were injured. Many of the      dead had been heading home for vacation or emergency leave.      Around the country, families that had been anticipating happy      reunions instead were stunned by unexpected loss. As of      Monday evening, 377 U.S. service members had died since      military action began in Iraq. In that time, more than 1,836      have been injured as a result of hostile action.       Among those killed Sunday in the crash was 1st Lt. Brian      Slavenas, 30, an Illinois Air National Guard pilot from Genoa      who was one of two pilots on the twin-rotor CH-46 Chinook      that was shot down Sunday. Four crewmembers, also National      Guardsmen, were from Iowa. They were injured, but survived      the crash, said Illinois National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col.      Alicia Tate-Nadeau. One of the Iowans was the senior pilot of      the aircraft, but it was unclear whether he or Slavenas was      flying the Chinook when it crashed, she said. Some 120      members of Slavenas' unit, the Peoria-based F Company of the      106th Aviation Battalion, are now deployed in Central Iraq.      Another 85 Guard soldiers are deployed from an aviation unit      housed in Davenport, Iowa.       Slavenas was a dedicated student who followed his father      and two older brothers into the military. He was so      unassuming it took him a week to tell his family he had      recently been promoted to first lieutenant, said his father,      Ronald Slavenas. His unit arrived in the Persian Gulf in mid-     April, and had been based in Balad, Iraq, since July 22, said      Chief Warrant Officer Ty Simmons, operations officer for the      company. On Monday, they were grieving Slavenas' death and      hoping for the recovery of the helicopter's crew, he said.       The crews spend their days flying over central Iraq, a      dusty desert region better known as the Sunni triangle, where      they move everything from Humvees and generators to drinking      water and soldiers on leave. During missions, they fly fast      and low, seeking to make themselves a more difficult target      as they navigate dust clouds, high-tension electric lines and      tan-colored towers that blend into the background of the      desert, Simmons said.       Brian Salvenas deployed with the unit to the Middle East in      March. Four months earlier, he had received a bachelor's      degree in industrial engineering from the University of      Illinois, said his mother, Rosemarie Dietz Slavenas, who      lives in Rockford. He studied piano in high school and      ``played beautiful, beautiful Chopin nocturnes,'' his mother      said.       On Sunday, Ronald Slavenas thought of his son as he      listened to reports of a helicopter crash in Iraq, and      watched through the front curtain as a uniformed man arrived      on the doorstep of his two-story brick home in Genoa. ``My      heart sank,'' he said. ``I opened the door and said `He's      dead, right?' ''       On Monday, an American flag hung in the rain from the      second floor of his house. ``Brian was just a real      perfectionist,'' said Slavenas' brother Eric, 39. ``He wasn't      a gung-ho, go-to-war kind of guy.''
