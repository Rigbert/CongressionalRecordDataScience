President, I am pleased to join with my friend from California, Senator Feinstein, in sponsoring this joint resolution calling on the administration to sign the Convention on Cluster Munitions when it is open for signature in December.  This treaty is the product of a year of negotiations among many of our closest allies and other nations that came together to prohibit the use of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  I regret that the United States did not participate in the negotiations. The Pentagon continues to insist that cluster munitions are necessary, but the country with the world's most powerful military should not be on the sidelines while others are trying to protect the lives and limbs of civilians in war.  Any weapon, whether cluster munitions, landmines or even poison gas, has some military utility. But anyone who has seen the indiscriminate devastation cluster munitions cause over a wide area understands the unacceptable threat they pose for civilians. These are not the laser guided weapons that were shown destroying their targets during the invasion of Baghdad.  And there is the insidious problem of cluster munitions that do not explode as designed, and remain as active duds, like landmines, until they are triggered by whoever comes into contact with them. Often it is an unsuspecting child, or a farmer.  This resolution follows an amendment I sponsored which prohibits U.S. sales and exports of cluster munitions that do not meet strict criteria, which became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. These criteria are no different from what the Pentagon set for itself 7 years ago for new procurements of cluster munitions, applied also to those in existing U.S. stockpiles. Senator Feinstein and I have also introduced legislation that would apply these same criteria to the use of cluster munitions. That legislation now has 20 cosponsors.  I want to express my appreciation to the Government of Norway for its leadership in initiating the process that led to the agreement on the treaty in Dublin, and to the Cluster Munitions Coalition, a group of some 200 nongovernmental organizations that worked diligently in support of the treaty.  I traveled to Dublin last week to meet with delegates to the negotiations, including the president of the Conference Daithi O'Ceallaigh. He did a masterful job of guiding the discussions to a successful conclusion.  There are some who have dismissed this effort as a ``feel good'' exercise, since it does not have the support of the United States and other major powers such as Russia, China, Pakistan, India and Israel. These are the same critics of the Ottawa treaty banning antipersonnel landmines, which the U.S. and the other countries I named have also refused to sign. But that treaty has dramatically reduced the number of landmines produced, used, sold and stockpiled, and the number of mine victims has fallen sharply. Any government that contemplates using landmines today does so knowing that it will be condemned by the international community. I suspect it is only a matter of time before the same is true for cluster munitions.  The administration insists that the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, known as the CCW, is the right place to negotiate limits on cluster munitions because all countries are represented. I don't doubt their intentions, but it is what they said about landmines, and nothing happened because Russia and China were opposed. The same is likely for cluster munitions. It is a way to make it appear as if you are doing something, when you are not.  It is important to note that the U.S. today has the technological ability to produce cluster munitions that would not be prohibited by the treaty. What is lacking is the political will to expend the necessary resources. There is no other excuse for continuing to use cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  Finally, I want to thank Senator Feinstein who has shown a real passion for this issue and has sought every opportunity to protect civilians from these weapons.                          ____________________
