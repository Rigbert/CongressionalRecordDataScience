Speaker, over the weekend, here in Washington there was a public relations blitz organized by the administration to tell us and the world how United States trade relations with Japan have improved. National Economic Council Chair Laura Tyson went so far as to state we have had a great record of success with the Japanese in the area of trade with our exports increasing by one-third since 1993, and we have seen the trade deficit come down, she said, for the first time in 5 years, so we have a strong record of success.  Well, you know, people can twist numbers in amazing ways. If the administration had such a strong record of success, why has the United States trade deficit with Japan worsened during the Clinton watch and become evenworse than during the Bush years when the United States trade deficit with Japan reached all-time highs? Look at the facts.  During the first 3 years of the Bush administration, the United States trade deficit with Japan reached over $133.5 billion. During the first 3 years of the Clinton administration, our trade deficit with Japan has soared to over $185 billion. That is $50 billion worse, according to my math, and a 39-percent increase. Wishing a problem away certainly will not make it so, and Japan knows it. Our Nation gains nothing by denial.  Facts again: During the Bush years, the 4 years, the total trade deficit with Japan reached over $183 billion, an all-time record. President Clinton has racked up that amount in just his first 3 years. In fact, during the Clinton watch, the trade deficit with Japan has rung in at all time record highs each year, $60 billion in the red in 1993, $65.7 billion in the red in 1994, and $60 billion in the red in 1995. We cannot project what the United States-Japan trade deficit will be this year, but all indicators are that the total for the 4 years of Clinton's time will easily be over $230 billion to the deficit side of the ledger.  Let us take a look at the automotive sector, which still accounts for over half of the deficit with Japan, more exports coming over here, fewer of our imports going into their market.  Remember when President Bush journeyed to Japan late in his Presidency and became ill at the official dinner held during the automotive trade rift? This is not a new problem. I personally have been working on opening Japan's market to United States goods for over a decade. I can tell Members Japan's auto market largely remains closed. They continue to believe we are not really serious.  United States auto manufacturers still have less than 1 measly percent of Japan's auto market, yet Japan holds upwards of one-third of our market. Think about this. With our low interest rates, the value of our dollar against the yen has fallen 40 percent since 1990, which means that our products are 40 percent cheaper in Japan. Yet we gained only one-third of 1 percent additional market penetration in Japan in 1995.  While we were able to sell about 58,000 cars there last year, Japan has sold over 100 times that amount in our country over the last decade. When I ask my local auto people, how are you doing, they smile and they look down.  In a recent survey of United States auto parts suppliers to Japanese customers, two-thirds of our suppliers say they are working hard to crack Japan's market with roughly half of those responding saying they are currently achieving either limited success, sporadic success or no success at all in really opening that market.  Can you imagine, in the second largest marketplace in the world, if we could get trade reciprocity with Japan, the amount of jobs we could create in this country, in shipping, in distribution, in manufacturing, in parts, et cetera? Compare the limited success of United States auto and auto parts manufacturers to crack Japan's market to the administration's exaggerated claims.  Friends, let us stop the denial. You cannot look at these numbers and not know that trade is going one way and not the other. We have scaled an ant hill in our efforts to open Japan's market. Now all that is left is the mountain of red ink to scale.                          ____________________
