President, the victims of gun violence and their families deserve more than a moment of silence; they deserve a moment of sanity.  We have coming before us a proposal by a Republican Senator and a Democratic Senator, Senator Toomey and Senator Manchin, a proposal to close the loopholes so that people who are convicted felons and people who are mentally unstable cannot buy firearms. Unfortunately, in the 100-page amendment being offered by the Senator from Iowa, exactly the opposite occurs. The loopholes are opened. When it comes to background checks, unfortunately, this doesn't do anything.  It does do one thing: It reduces the amount of money available to police departments and COP grants all across the United States if the Senator disagrees with their immigration policy. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police opposes it.  Let's have a moment of sanity. Let's please vote no on the Grassley amendment.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
