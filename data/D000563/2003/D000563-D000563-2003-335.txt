 million private-sector jobs in America, more jobs lost than any President since Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression, and that 75 percent of the jobs lost have been manufacturing jobs and good paying jobs across America? Despite the fact that manufacturing jobs account for less than 14 percent of our private-sector economy, 75 percent of the private-sector job loss has been in manufacturing jobs. These jobs have been lost to Third World countries--China and other nations.  Is it not also true that this proposal to cut overtime and basically defy the sacred 40-hour workweek would result in the importation of Third World wage standards into the United States? It is bad enough that we have lost millions of jobs to the Third World and overseas. Is this proposal by the Bush administration adding insult to injury by bringing those Third World work standards to America's families we honored with that resolution last Friday?
