 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Proctor, VT, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Blair. Recently in December Hawaii ruled that the state      must recognize single-sex marriages. Judge Kevin Chang based      his ruling on the fact that there's no legal reason against      it. He also ruled on the theory that sexual orientation is      fixed at birth and denying them the right to marry is sexual      discrimination. Because of this ruling about 20 states have      passed laws restricting homosexual marriages. We intend to      prove that there is no legal argument against it and that      there are only moral arguments based on prejudice.       Ms. Garner. Some people think of homosexuals as promiscuous      or abnormally sexually active, but that has nothing to do      with sexual preference. Homosexuals are very committed to      their partners. A 1992 study showed that 55.5 percent of all      gay men and 71.2 percent of lesbians are in a steady      relationship. There are between 1 million and 5 million      lesbian mothers and between 1 million and 3 million gay      fathers in the United States today. Although the majority of      children come from previous homosexual marriages, homosexuals      are still acting as active parents. Homosexuals who have not      been in a heterosexual relationship in which to have children      have many options. Adoption, foster parenting or artificial      insemination are also ways of becoming parents.       Some people think that homosexuals will influence their      children to become homosexuals, but 35 different studies have      showed that the children of gay and lesbians are no more      likely to be homosexual than the children of homosexual      parents.       Ms. Ouellette. Homosexuals have good reasons for wanting to      marry. They don't want to marry just to make people mad or      start an argument. Homosexuals want to marry for the same      reasons heterosexuals want to marry: Love, companionship,      shared interests, common goals, emotional and financial      security and to raise a family. If we deny homosexuals the      right to marry, they will not have the automatic right to      medical, legal or financial decisions on behalf of their      partner. They can be denied access to visit their partner in      the intensive care unit or other hospital departments.       Homosexuals want to feel emotionally and financially safe      just like heterosexuals. Homosexuals can attain some benefits      of legal marriage when many homosexuals do not have the time      or money it takes to get legal aid. Until the United States      allows same sex couples to marry, homosexuals will not have      rights and benefits that heterosexuals have. By not letting      homosexuals marry, we are denying them rights every person      should have       Ms. Garner. Prejudice is a common threat that people of      minorities and different opinions face every day. Homosexuals      are a large     target. The way they live is constantly opposed by people      from every direction. The battle homosexuals fight today for      the right to marry is not unlike the battle fought nearly 40      years ago also for the right to marry. This was the case of      Loving versus Virginia, a black woman, Diana Jetter, and a      white man, Harvey Loving, because interracial marriage was      banned in the state of Virginia. They went to Washington,      D.C. and got married. Because of the law, when they returned      to the state they were arrested and sentenced to one year in      prison. This sentence was only suspended because they      promised not to return to the state for 25 years. In today's      society, most people would think this unheard of, two      consenting adults unable to marry because of a petty      difference? Maybe 40 years from now people will look back at      the prejudice we are bestowing on homosexuals and ask how      could we?       It's not fair to sterotype that heterosexuals are immoral      because of their sexual preference, that they should be      denied access to plans or things that heterosexuals get just      because of their sexual preference.                               ____________________
