 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable teacher from my home State of Kentucky, Laura Sanders, who was recognized on August 19 as Kentucky's 2008 No Child Left Behind American Star of Teaching.  Sanders, a kindergarten teacher at Cumberland Trace Elementary School in Bowling Green, KY, has based her teaching career on the belief that all children can achieve and holds high expectations for each and every one of them.  She looks at each child's strengths and weaknesses and works with them individually or in small groups to ensure their success. She is the recipient of numerous awards recognizing her contributions to education.  For the 2006-2007 school year, her students' reading scores went from the 52 percent benchmark in the fall to 91 percent in the spring. For the 2007-2008 school year, her kindergarteners started with a 58 percent benchmark and by mid-year, 85 percent had met the benchmark scores.  However, it is her love of teaching, and the love she has for her students, that defines her effective and creative teaching style that gives students a willingness to learn.  ``Love. Love the children that come in your door every day,'' Sanders advises other educators.  Patrice McCrary, who has been a colleague and friend of Sanders for over a decade, nominated Sanders for this year's award.  ``I've had the honor and privilege of team teaching with her. This is our 11th year together, and I have never seen anybody who puts more into their teaching or loves their students more than Ms. Sanders does,'' McCrary said.  Each year since 2004, teachers across all grade levels and disciplines are honored in the fall as American Stars of Teaching based on their success in improving academic performance and making a difference in their students' lives.  Margaret Spellings, the Secretary of Education, acknowledged the outstanding teaching style that Sanders brings to her students.  ``Teachers like Laura Sanders combine a passion for teaching with high expectations that every child can learn,'' Spellings said. ``We at the U.S. Department of Education are proud to recognize these dedicated, hard-working professionals, who are committed to closing the achievement gap and challenging every child to achieve his or her potential.''  Her former students are walking examples of her success and her passion for teaching. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing Laura Sanders's unwavering dedication to education, her community, and Kentucky.                          ____________________
