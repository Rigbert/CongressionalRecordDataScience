Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Istook-Visclosky amendment. The amendment is a bipartisan solution to a growing national problem which is the inability of our States to collect sales taxes from individuals who purchase retail items on Indian trust property. This amendment will protect State revenue by ending a Federal policy which erodes a number of States tax bases. Rather than contributing to the current problem by granting new lands to tribes that refuse to collect State taxes on sales of non-Indians, our amendment will guarantee that the Federal Government does not take any action to further erode a tax base in a State.  As this Congress continues to shift additional responsibilities onto the States, I feel it is imperative that the Federal Government not actively work to reduce the tax base of individual States.  This amendment will also promote fair competition and a level playing field, as the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] has also pointed out in his remarks. Because these taxes comprise such a large percentage of the product's cost, it is absolutely unfair to ask non-Indian retailers to compete against an Indian retailer that does not collect the sales tax.  I also think it is very important to emphasize, as my colleague on the other side has just done, what we do not do. This amendment does not impose any State or local tax on Indians. This amendment would not impact on the sovereignty of Indian tribes. This amendment would not affect the ability of tribes to operate businesses on any Indian reservation lands, nor any lands currently held in trust status.  In closing, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this well-defined limitation amendment.
