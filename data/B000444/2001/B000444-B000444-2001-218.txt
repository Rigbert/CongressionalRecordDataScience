 President, I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001, S. 131, and I will explain why this legislation is so important.  No one from either side of the aisle questions the importance of education as the steppingstone to success in the 21st century. We all know that the economy of the future is going to require people with specialized training and skills, while the unskilled labor that typified the 18th and 19th centuries is becoming less and less useful. In this regard, it is hardly surprising that Congress is flooded with proposals to enhance access to high-quality elementary education, secondary education, and higher education. I myself have strongly supported expansion of Pell Grants, broadening of student loans, and tax incentives to help families pay for a college education.  As we rightly promote the importance of government help for higher education, it might be useful to recall that one of the first, and most successful, of these higher education initiatives was the GI bill that was enacted back in 1944. Following World War II, millions of veterans were able to obtain college educations through the GI bill, with the result that many were able to attain a standard of living they could not have imagined. Furthermore, all this college-trained talent contributed to the burst of economic advances that improved life for all of us over the ensuing decades.  Fast forward 57 years. We still have a GI bill, and in our highly successful all-volunteer military, it turns out that the single most important factor that attracts many young people to join the military is the availability of educational benefits after discharge. Yet the current GI bill suffers from one big flaw: the educational stipend is no longer sufficient to pay for the cost of a college education.  The current monthly payment in the GI bill has not come close to matching the rate of inflation in educational costs over the past 50 years. Just consider these statistics. At present, the standard GI bill benefit is $650 per month for 36 months. That is it. Moreover, we now ask servicemembers who want educational benefits after discharge to contribute $1200 while they are in the military. By contrast, when it began in 1944, the GI bill benefit included full tuition and fees at any educational institution to which the veteran could gain admittance, PLUS a monthly stipend equivalent to $500 in 2001 dollars, $750 for married veterans.  We thus find ourselves in an anomalous situation: at the same time that the Government is ramping up its support and subsidy for non-veterans seeking college educations, the program that started this whole thing, and which provides key benefits for those who put their lives at risk for the country, is lagging way behind.  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001 goes a long way toward redressing this situation. The key provision of this bill is quite simple: the total VA educational stipend under the Montgomery GI Bill will be increased to a level equal to the average cost of tuition at 4-year public colleges. In other words, the standard 36 months of GI bill benefits will be sufficient to allow a veteran to attend college and complete a degree.  The Veterans Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001 provides the minimal benefit that we should be offering to those who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country free and prosperous, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
