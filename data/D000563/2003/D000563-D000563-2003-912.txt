 I think there has been a very constructive and valuable suggestion by one of your colleagues, Senator Bennett of Utah, who came to the floor last week and suggested, to end this impasse, that we can finally bring this matter to a vote on Mr. Estrada simply by producing the controversial documents to be reviewed by you and Senator Leahy, and if a decision is made by either of you that there is something worth pursuing by way of written questions or further hearing, then we can bring this to closure.  I asked Senator Daschle on the floor yesterday, would this be a good end game for the Estrada issue? He said it was acceptable to him. So I ask the Senator from Utah if he would entertain the suggestion of his colleague, Senator Bennett, to produce these work documents that reflect on Mr. Estrada's philosophy, for you, personally, for Senator Leahy personally, and followup, if necessary, so that we can finally move on to important issues that we should be considering on the Senate floor?
