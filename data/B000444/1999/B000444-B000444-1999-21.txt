 President, when we passed the 1994 crime bill and created the COPS Program, there were some skeptics. There were people who thought community policing was nothing more than social work and that the program would not work.  Do you remember what I said to the skeptics? I told them that either this program was going to work and we would be geniuses or that it would flop and we would be run out of town. There is an old saying that success has a thousand fathers but failure is an orphan. Now, there are a thousand people all claiming to be the parent of this program simply because it has worked so darn well.  In 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 police officers by the year 2000. We met that goal last May--months ahead of schedule. As of today, there have been 103,000 officers funded and 55,000 officers deployed to the streets. The COPS Programs is ahead of schedule and under budget.  Because of COPS, the concept of community policing has become law enforcement's principal weapon fighting crime. Community policing has redefined the relationship between law enforcement and the public. But, more importantly, it has reduced crime. And that is what we attempted to do.  All across the country, from Wilmington to Washington--from Connecticut to California, we are seeing a dramatic decline in crime. Just this week, the FBI released its annual crime statistics which showed that once again, for the seventh year in a row, crime is down. In fact, since 1994, violent crime is down 17.6 percent. And just last year, violent crime was down 6.4 percent nationwide from the year before. But, we can't let that slow us down.  And that's why I'm here today. I am proud of our accomplishments, but we cannot become complacent. We have a unique opportunity here. Some people say if crime down, why put more cops on the streets? Well it's simple math: more cops equals less crime. If we know one thing it is this: if a crime is going to be committed and there is a cop on one street corner and not one the other, guess where the crime is going to be committed? Not where the cop is, I would guess.  Maybe someday we will reach the point where crime is so low that we don't have to take pro-active steps any longer. But, we are not there yet. Our children and our parents are still at great risk out there and it should not be that way. Nor does it have to be that way. And why more cops on the street, it won't be that way.  That is why today, I introduced a bill to continue this program for the next 5 years. It's called ``PROTECTION''--``Providing reliable officers, technology, education, community prosecutors and training in our neighborhoods.'' This bill will put up to 50,000 more officers on the street.  It will also allow police officers to be reimbursed for college or graduate school, because we all know that overcoming crime problems requires something more than just more cops. It requires cops who understand the importance of prevention and community relations. The legislation also provides funding for new technology so that law enforcement can purchase high-tech equipment to put them on equal footing with sophisticated criminals. And it provides for funding for community prosecutors--to expand the community policing concept to engage the whole law enforcement community in fighting crime. It has all the things that law enforcement told me that they needed to do their jobs.  I am proud to say that this legislation has the support of all the major law enforcement organizations and that 49 of my colleagues have told me that they support this legislation. Forty-five of them will join me today in cosponsoring this legislation--including 5 Republicans. I want to recognize my friends on the other side of the aisle and thank them for listening to their constituents, their mayors and their police chiefs who said: We can not do this without your help.  I hope that even more will join us today. I ask the rest of my colleagues--there are 50 more of you--will you be with us on this? Will you listen to everyone who is asking for help? Will you listen to your police chiefs and your mayors? Will you stand up and be counted among those who say enough is enough--and I'm going to do something about crime? I'm going to put more police officers on the street. I'm going to support the most effective law enforcement program of our time.  I hope that we can put politics aside on this one and all join forces to support the folks who do so much for us each and every day. The people who put their safety on the line so that we may be more secure. It is then, that I will know that we have all put our Nation's interest first.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1760       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
