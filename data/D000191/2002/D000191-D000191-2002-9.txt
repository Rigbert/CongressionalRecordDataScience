Speaker, today's press reveals that the Bush administration has decided that they can find no linkage between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, despite some of the offhand remarks of Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney to the contrary. The intelligence agencies, turning all of their resources to this, cannot find existing links.  So that means that the President and his administration will have to make the case against Saddam Hussein to this Congress because the authorization passed by this Congress last fall was for the President to respond to those who were involved in the attacks and those who harbored or sponsored such attacks. That means a straight-up debate on the floor of the House of Representatives, hopefully a free and fair debate, over the wisdom of the first-ever preemptive war by the United States of America against Iraq.  I believe that the burden the administration has to prove that the United States should break from all precedents in more than 200 years of history, should break from all precedents set lawfully under the United Nations conventions since the end of World War II and actually launch a preemptive war, is an extraordinary burden. They have to prove a very real, credible threat by the Saddam Hussein regime.  Now Saddam Hussein is a despicable individual. He has murdered tens of thousands, and all effective opposition. He has murdered people ethnically, religiously. He has used weapons of mass destruction. He has an absolutely horrible record, and obviously we would not trust this gentleman one inch.  But the question in this case becomes what is different today than a year ago or 2 years ago in terms of Saddam Hussein. It seems, when asked honestly and privately, the generals and admirals at the Pentagon feel containment is working, that he did not pose a credible and immediate threat to the United States of America or its allies in that region.  So the question becomes then if he is credibly threatened with a preemptive war, would he become more of a threat? Then there is the issue of our allies. Would any allies support the United States in this endeavor? Then there are the questions from 10 years ago, the same questions that President Bush's father had to confront, and Colin Powell as chairman of the joint chiefs, which is what if they went to Baghdad and took out Hussein, what then? They were confronted with a long and problematic occupation of Iraq and further destabilization in the region. And even with all the allies, including Arab nations at the time, they felt it was not worth the risk of doing that.                              {time}  1330  Well, the same question needs to be asked today. In fact, I witnessed on ``Face the Nation,'' where one Republican Senator said, ``Well, we don't need any allies. We will just go and do this. We will take them out.'' And then he said, ``We will rule Iraq.''  I do not know who he has been talking to or what he is thinking, but the United States being involved intimately in that region and trying to rule a country, a very large country, in an extraordinarily volatile area, is a recipe for disaster. So they need not only a credible plan for what if and how and why; but they need to explain that, both to Congress, some of it can be confidentially, but, for the most part, these should be things that could be laid out.  Prime Minister Chretien said yesterday that the President had nothing new to say. It was just the same rhetorical sort of ``we have got to remove him sooner or later,'' the same thing we have been hearing from Ms. Rice and other advisers to the President.  So I have sent a letter to the President, signed by 17 other Members of Congress, which lays out a series of about 20 questions that I believe are critical that this administration address before they would undertake to ask even for authorization for a preemptive war, the first ever in our history; and I am hopeful that the administration will in good faith answer those questions. Most of them are questions that could be answered in public, could be given to the American people, and could, if they answer them I believe convincingly, as they have not thus far, lead to some sort of authorization from the United States Congress.  But we cannot just sort of have this shadow boxing and discussion in private. This is an extraordinary issue, a constitutional issue, an issue that breaks with all precedent of this country; something that needs to be fully, freely, and fairly debated before the American people before we commit our sons and daughters to lengthy involvement in a war against Iraq and a subsequent occupation and rebuilding of that country. We are not doing such a great job of stabilizing and rebuilding Afghanistan. One has to question what we would do with a much larger nation in a much more volatile region of the world.                          ____________________
