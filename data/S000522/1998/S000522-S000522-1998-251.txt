Mr. Speaker, recently I visited Moscow with my colleagues Mr. Hall of Ohio and Mr. Wolf of Virginia, along with the distinguished Librarian of Congress and specialist on Russia, Dr. James Billington. We were there as part of an international delegation invited to discuss with Russian officials the new Russian law on freedom of conscience and religious organizations. This trip was very fruitful and I believe will have played a role in having some of the most pernicious elements of that regrettable legislation removed or alleviated.  During our stay in Moscow, the U.S. Embassy kindly arranged a meeting for us with Alexander Ogorodnikov, a former Soviet political prisoner whom I first met in 1988. Until recently, he had operated a soup kitchen and shelter for endangered young women in Moscow. I say ``recently'' because just before our arrival, the soup kitchen was closed down by order of city officials. The shelter is still open, although it has been subjected to periodic police raids since its opening.  Mr. Ogorodnikov opened his soup kitchen on Khoroshevskoe Shosse in February 1991, the first such privately funded charitable institution in the former Soviet Union. Among the financial contributors were religious organizations in the United States, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The soup kitchen fed pensioners, homeless persons, former incarcerees, refugees, people from other neighborhoods, basically most anyone who needed a meal. According to Mr. Ogorodnikov, an average of 450 to 550 persons visited the soup kitchen every day as of 1997.  Unfortunately, as the saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished--especially in today's Russia. Neighborhood officials and the Moscow city property authorities have been leveling (in Mr. Ogorodnikov's words) ``unjustified financial claims'' against the soup kitchen. The case has gone to court and has still not been resolved.  Nevertheless, on the night of November 13, 1997, a group of unknown persons showed up when none of the soup kitchen personnel were present and seized the premises. On the next day, when soup kitchen personnel arrived for work, they were not permitted to enter. The new occupants announced that ``repairs had been initiated.'' Mr. Ogorodnikov was not even allowed to retrieve his equipment or the foodstuffs that had been stored at the soup kitchen.  On January 15, I visited the soup kitchen, or rather what was left of it, with Mr. Ogorodnikov. Repair work on the building was being done, but it appeared as if the soup kitchen had never existed. All Mr. Ogorodnikov's kitchen equipment and his foodstuffs had disappeared. We asked for the foreman of the operation and, after a while, he showed up. I don't think he was glad to see us. The foreman informed Mr. Ogorodnikov that his equipment had been removed and stored elsewhere in the city, but he refused to say where.  Mr. Ogorodnikov was shown a back room where someone had stashed two of the icons that had been on the soup kitchen wall, and Mr. Ogorodnikov was required to sign for the icons before he could remove them for safe keeping, ``so there won't be any claims.'' Of course, no one worried about claims when the food, refrigerators, freezers, tables, and other equipment were hauled away.  The foreman did indicate that he would arrange to have the equipment delivered wherever Mr. Ogorodnikov instructed, a rather difficult condition, since Mr. Ogorodnikov has no other place to store his equipment. In the meantime, Mr. Ogorodnikov could win his case against his tormentors, and the court might order his foodstuffs and equipment returned to him. By that time, who knows what will remain?  Mr. Speaker, ironically, the United States Government has spent significant amounts of taxpayers' money to assist Russia with macroeconomic programs, small business assistance, and humanitarian aid. Yet here is a Russian man who, like many of his contemporaries, could have gone into business for his own financial gain. Instead, he has devoted himself to helping the many poor and destitute among his countrymen. In return, local officials harass him, shut down his operation, and deprive many others of the chance to have a decent meal.  It is a sad commentary on human nature, and bespeaks badly on the political leadership of a city with such great potential.                          ____________________
