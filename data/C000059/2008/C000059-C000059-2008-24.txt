Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Borre Winckel is one of these individuals. Borre is retiring as the Executive Director of the Building Industry Association, BIA, for Riverside County.  Born in the Netherlands, Borre arrived in the U.S. in 1977 following his family's acquisition of property in Temecula, CA. Borre was educated at Boston University and received joint degrees in Print Journalism and Public Communication. After graduation, Borre joined Chase Manhattan Bank's New York City Head Office as a Press Spokesman and Speechwriter for the Office of the Chairman. Chase decided Borre was better suited for banking and placed him in their prestigious corporate finance credit training program in Wall Street.  Following Wall Street, Borre's mixed-use land development activities led him to join the Riverside County BIA Chapter, which he has run as its Executive Director since 1996. The County's volume of building permit activity--highest in the State of California--places him center stage on many growth and development related issues. Under his leadership, Riverside County BIA became the region's leading private sector participant in major transportation planning and funding projects; air and water quality issues; endangered species conservation planning and residential green building programs. Borre is frequently quoted in the major media and is a sought after as a conference speaker.  Some of the BIA accomplishments under Borre include: membership at the Riverside Chapter flourished, tripling in size to over 700 members; in coordination with city and county officials, the BIA helped develop the Riverside County Integrated Project, RCIP, a three year planning effort to simultaneously prepare environmental, transportation, housing and development guidelines for future population growth; and worked with officials and outside groups to establish the Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan, MSHCP. In 2007, Borre convinced the County Board of Supervisors to initiate a streamlining strike force to speed up the entitlement and permitting process. As a result, County entitlement and permitting processes are already more fluid and predictable.  Borre is a resident of San Juan Capistrano and is married to Kay Sutton-Nagel. They have three children, Emilie, Sophie and George, Jr. Borre's tireless passion for the community of Riverside County has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire. I am proud to call Borre a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
