 Speaker, I rise today to call World Population Awareness Week 1998 to the attention of my Colleagues. October 24-31 marks the 13th annual celebration of World Population Awareness Week. More than 300 family planning, environmental, educational, community and service organizations in 61 countries are co-sponsoring the week in an effort to raise awareness of the need for universal voluntary family planning.  I call the Governor of Vermont's, the Honorable Howard Dean, proclamation to the attention of my colleagues.           World Population Awareness Week Proclamation--1998       Whereas world population stands today at more than 5.9      billion and increases by more than 80 million per year, with      virtually all of this growth in the least developed      countries;       Whereas the consequences of rapid population growth are not      limited to the developing world but extend to all nations and      to all people, including every citizen of the State of      Vermont concerned for human dignity,     freedom and democracy, as well as for the impact on the      global economy;       Whereas 1.3 billion people--more than the combined      population of Europe and North Africa--live in absolute      poverty on the equivalent of one U.S. dollar or less a day;       Whereas 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world      population--lack an adequate supply of clean drinking water      or sanitation;       Whereas more than 840 million people--one-fifth of the      entire population of the developing world--are hungry or      malnourished;       Whereas demographic studies and surveys indicate that at      least 120 million married women in the developing world--and      a large but undefined number of unmarried women--want more      control over their fertility but lack access to family      planning;       Whereas this unmet demand for family planning is projected      to result in 1.2 billion unintended births;       Whereas the 1994 international Conference on Population and      Development determined that political commitment and      appropriate programs aimed at providing universal access to      voluntary family planning information, education and services      can ensure world population stabilization at 8 billion or      less rather than 12 billion or more.       Now, therefore, I Howard Dean, Governor of the State of      Vermont, do hereby proclaim the week of October 25-31, 1998      as World Population Awareness Week, and urge citizens of the      State to take cognizance of this event and to participate      appropriately in its observance.                               ____________________
