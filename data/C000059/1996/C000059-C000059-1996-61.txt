Speaker, it would seem Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman is on a one-man crusade to destroy California's multibillion-dollar fruit and vegetable industry.  That is exactly what will happen if he allows the importation of Mexican avocados. These avocados will bring fruit flies, seed weevils, stem borers, and other pests that will destroy California's economy.  ``Not to worry,'' says Secretary Glickman, ``we have used good science.''  That is not true.  An independent report by University of California Riverside, Cornell University, Boston University, and Oregon State University states that ``there is no rational basis for USDA's estimate of risk.'' The importation of Mexican avocados could mean catastrophe for California.  The introduction of these pests will destroy our oranges, our avocados, and our grapes. Not for one season, but for a generation. This is bad public policy, based on bad science. Do not ruin California's economy.  Mr. Secretary, institute a credible peer review process, now.                          ____________________
