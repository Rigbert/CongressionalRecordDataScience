 President, this amendment actually came into the bill from the original parts of the bill, Senator Kyl's and my investigations from the Terrorism and Technology Subcommittee. What we found is the student visa program was greatly in disarray. We found that we have about 660,000 students coming in a year, and there is no tracking of any of them. Nobody knows whether they are really at a school.  Up to this point, the schools have had no responsibility to report that a student has arrived, that a student is taking this or that course and, yes, that the student has stayed in school. So I think Senator Byrd's amendment strengthens what is already in the bill. I think it makes it a better bill. We intend to follow up on this. Senator Kennedy and I have discussed it. We intend to see, in fact, that the schools do keep their word and do, in fact, do the reporting they are required to do under this legislation.
