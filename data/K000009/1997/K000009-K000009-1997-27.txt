Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just wanted to mention that for Members who are listening on the floor or maybe listening to these remarks over their televisions in their offices, if you look at the budget issue involved here, and I wanted to place this on the record because it is important, voting for this motion to instruct is a very responsible vote.  Both the House and the Senate have decided within their respective appropriations committees for different marks, different funding levels for agriculture functions. In the Senate, the Agriculture Subcommittee allocations were much higher than in the House. In fact, they have $30 million more in budget authority and over $200 million more in outlays. As we go to conference, we have to conference on that as well.  So I want to assure my colleagues that the flexibility within the budget exists and we are not asking for anything unreasonable in this motion to instruct. We are again asking our House colleagues to agree with what the Senate has done and to instruct our conferees to agree to the $34 million youth tobacco prevention initiative.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. Jackson-Lee].
