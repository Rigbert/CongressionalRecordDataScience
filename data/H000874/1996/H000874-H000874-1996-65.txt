Chairman, I understand what the gentleman has said. I also understand that the gentleman refers to previous rulings. The 1809 ruling I referred to myself in my comments. My point, I tell my friend from New York, and again I reiterate, I am not talking about the substance of this amendment. I am talking about the procedure, which I have always opposed--this is nothing new for the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer]-- is that the gentleman proposes it is a simple limitation and that is in fact what the ruling has been. But it defies logic and good policy which is why I suggest that the ruling be reflected upon by those making the ruling.  The logic that it defies, I tell my friend from New York, is that the official to whom a fact is made know has no responsibility before effecting the limitation to determine the accuracy of the fact being represented. It is my suggestion that therein lies the error of the 1809 precedent and the judgments flowing from that precedent. As a result, Mr. Chairman, I would urge that the chairman find that this amendment is not consistent with rule XXI and that the previous precedents to the contrary should be specifically overruled.
