Speaker, the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act is a good bill that extends the availability of the homebuyer tax credit to our servicemembers serving our country overseas. The homebuyer tax credit has proven to be an effective measure in stimulating our housing market, and I'm hopeful more of our servicemembers will be able to use it now that it is being extended.  In fact, I know that many members, including myself, support extending the homebuyer tax credit for everyone. I have a bill, the Homebuyer Tax Credit Act, H.R. 1245, that would extend and expand the tax credit. My bill has almost fifty cosponsors and I aware of other bills that have been introduced to extend the homebuyer tax credit.   am hopeful that in addition to passing this bill today, the House leadership and the Ways and Means Committee will act on a broader extension of the homebuyer tax credit in the near future.
