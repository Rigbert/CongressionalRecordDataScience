President, for the information of my colleagues, there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 1 p.m. today. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 652, the telecommunications bill. Pending is the Thurmond second-degree amendment to the Dorgan amendment regarding the Department of Justice. Senators should therefore expect rollcall votes. However, there will be none prior to 5 p.m. today.                          ____________________
