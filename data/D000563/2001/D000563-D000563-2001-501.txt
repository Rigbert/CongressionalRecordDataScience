I continue to reserve my right to object. I am going to object to the waiving of the reading of any substitute or any second-degree amendment unless a copy is presented to me in advance. I will afford the same courtesy on any amendment which I offer on the floor. Those of us who would like to be prepared to debate this want to see the language of the amendment so we can be adequately prepared.  Mr. President, I do not object to the unanimous-consent request.
