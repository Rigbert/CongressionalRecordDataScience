This legislation would allow U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to petition for their foreign same-sex partners to come to the United States under our family immigration system. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by Senators Jeffords, Feingold, Kennedy, and Kerry.  Under current law, committed partners of Americans are unable to use the family immigration system, which accounts for about 75 percent of the green cards and immigrant visas granted annually by the United States. As a result, gay Americans who are in this situation must live apart from their partners, or leave the country if they want to live legally and permanently with them.  This bill rectifies that situation, while retaining strong prohibitions against fraud. To qualify as a permanent partner, petitioners must prove that they are at least 18 and in a committed, intimate relationship with another adult in which both parties intend a lifelong commitment, and are financially interdependent with one's partner. They must also prove that they are not married to, or in a permanent partnership with, anyone other than that person, and are unable to contract with that person a marriage cognizable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Proof could include sworn affidavits from friends and family and documentation of financial interdependence. Penalties for fraud would be the same as penalties for marriage fraud--up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for the U.S. citizen partner, and deportation for the alien partner.  There are Vermonters who are involved in permanent partnerships with foreign nationals and who have felt abandoned by our laws in this area. This bill would allow them--and other gay and lesbian Americans throughout our Nation who have come to feel that our immigration laws are discriminatory--to be a fuller part of our society.  The idea that immigration benefits should be extended to same-sex couples has become increasingly prevalent around the world. Indeed, fifteen nations Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom--recognize same-sex couples for immigration purposes.  Our immigration laws treat gays and lesbians in committed relationships as second-class citizens, and that needs to change. It is the right thing to do for the people involved, it is the sensible step to take in the interest of having a fair and consistent policy, and I hope that the Senate will act.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1510       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
