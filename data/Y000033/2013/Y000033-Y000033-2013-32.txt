Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, this bill that has been proposed to us actually took one successful program out, the very successful Hawaiian Natives and Alaskan Natives program. It is destroying a program that works.  This is a different program than the other Indian areas have, but it should have been left in this bill. And as I talked with the chairman, why take out some successful program and try to take and change it when there's other problems with No Child Left Behind?  I'm asking my colleagues to vote for my amendment, which puts it back in. It restores title VI moneys, and it does retain a working program that we should leave. I say this because Alaska Natives and Hawaiian Natives are not under the BIE funding programs, and it would be impossible for them to receive the moneys under the grant program.  All I want to do is keep my Natives on a right plain, which they've been doing very well in actually improving their lives, being better educated, achieving their goals.  I reserve the balance of my time.
