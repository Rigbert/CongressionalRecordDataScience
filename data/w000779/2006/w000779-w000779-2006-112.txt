President, Senator Smith said it very well.  I wanted to wrap up by noting a comment from pitcher Dallas Buck, who was the winning pitcher in the championship game.  When asked about why he stayed at Oregon State instead of going pro out of high school, I quote: ``Best decision I ever made.'' And we happen to think that is the best decision a lot of young people are making in our State, to go to Oregon State University. It is a wonderful university, both for sports and academics.  We are going to salute them, as Senator Smith has indicated, when we get a chance to join them at the White House with the President. That is what makes this so special for us.
