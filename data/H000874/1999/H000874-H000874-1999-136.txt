Chairman, I want to commend the gentlewoman for her statement, which was excellent. She is a pleasure to work with on issues relating not only to our region but particularly to Federal employees. She is always a very strong advocate of our Federal employees and treating them with fairness.  I also want to commend her. She did not mention it, but I wanted to call attention to it earlier; I do not think the gentlewoman was on the floor. I regretted the fact that we deleted the $55 million for the FDA facility which is to be located in Montgomery County.
