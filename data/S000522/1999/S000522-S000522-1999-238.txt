Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my good friend for his kind comments. This is another one of those vitally important human rights issues where we--Democrat, Republican, conservative, moderate and liberal--are speaking with one voice. Our friends in the Duma and other freedom-loving people need to know that, that we speak out boldly and forcefully against anti-Semitism.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) remembers in the last Congress I chaired a hearing in our subcommittee on the alarming rising tide of anti-Semitism in Russia. Even then we saw the disturbing signs that anti-Semitism was bad and getting worse. It has become even worse than that in the last few months. We need to speak out very, very forcefully. I want to thank him for his great comments.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).
