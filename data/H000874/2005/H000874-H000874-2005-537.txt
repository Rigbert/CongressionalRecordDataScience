Speaker, reclaiming my time, I recall that Democrats, when they were in charge, had a slightly different perspective, believing we were a co-equal branch of the government. We would adopt our policies based upon what we believed to be in the best interests of this country, and that the President, as a co-equal branch of the government, would make his determination, and if we disagreed we would override his veto. As a matter of fact, I voted to override a number of vetoes that the previous Democratic President disagreed with us on.  The gentleman is right. We do not seem to do that. We have a 4\1/2\-year unblemished record, as the leader points out, of not doing anything that this President did not want us to do.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
