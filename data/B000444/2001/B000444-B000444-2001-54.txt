 I am honored to have the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, as an original co-sponsor of this legislation. This bill would amend title 18 of the United States Code to, for the first time, make it a Federal crime to knowingly make a hoax report, involving a biological, chemical, nuclear weapon, or other weapon of mass destruction. Likewise, it would make it a criminal offense to knowingly send such a hoax weapon to another.  Since the unspeakable terrorist attacks of September 11, our nation has witnessed a mind-boggling number of anthrax hoax reports. This in turn has triggered an equally large number of reports of suspected biological agents. No part of the Nation has been spared, and my home State of Delaware has had several hundred reports of possible biological agents. Just this week, the FBI reported to Congress the staggering statistic involving these bioterrorism hoaxes and other reports of suspected biological agents. Prior to September 11, the FBI had responded to about 100 cases involving potential use of ``weapons of mass destruction,'' 67 of which involved alleged biological weapons. Since mid-September, however, that number has increased by 3,000 percent! As of today, the FBI reported that they have responded to 7,089 suspicious anthrax letters alone, 950 incidents involving other suspected weapons of mass destruction, and an estimated 29,331 telephonic calls from the public about suspicious packages.  The good news is that most of these reports were hoaxes, or reports made by well-meaning people whose suspicions were raised. The bad news is that any hoax reports were made in the first place, triggering panic on the part of the public, and often forcing the Federal, state, and local governments to waste valuable time and resources responding to them. In one particularly egregious case, it has been reported that an employee of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection falsely reported to security that he had found a yellowish-white powder on his desk with the misspelled label ``ANTHAX.'' The employee, a 48-year-old solid waste management analyst, knew the material was not toxic, it was determined to be coffee creamer, but persisted in the false account. 800 State employees were evacuated from the building for 2 days while law enforcement officials tested the building, at a cost of $1.5 million in lost workers' time, another $40,000 in decontamination costs, and an undisclosed amount of money spent on rescue and law enforcement. The employee is being charged in Federal court, not for the hoax report, but for lying to Federal officials after the fact.  Indeed, the Justice Department reported to Congress this week thatthere is a gap in the existing Federal law regarding the prosecution of bioterrorism hoaxes. That is, while it is a crime to threaten to use, for example, anthrax as a weapon against another person, it is not a crime to make a hoax anthrax report. Accordingly, the Justice Department called upon Congress this week to enact legislation which specifically addresses hoaxes which involve purported biological substances, as well as chemical, nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.  We should answer that call and act now to give the law enforcement the tools they need to combat these despicable crimes. I introduced a bioterrorism bill, S. 3202, in the 106th Congress which contained an anti-hoax provision. Had that bill been enacted into law, Federal prosecutors would have the means to prosecute bioterrorism hoaxes. The need for a Federal anti-hoax provision has never been more clear than in the last several weeks. The Federal interest is indisputable, as States and localities are simply not equipped with the expertise or resources to evaluate and respond to these hoaxes. A comprehensive prohibition on such false reports is necessary to preserve scarce and vital federal resources.  Accordingly, as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I introduce a bill today which contains both criminal provisions and civil penalties for the hoax reporting of bioterrorism incidents. My bill simply says that if you knowingly engage in conduct, such as deliberately sending baking powder through the mail to your Congressman or calling 911 to falsely report the presence of anthrax in a public building, that is likely to create the false impression concerning the presence of anthrax, or other similar things, that you have committed a Federal offense, punishable by up to 5 years in jail. Moreover, such a person may be fined the greater of either $10,000 or the amount of money expended by the government to respond to the false information. Finally, such a person may also be ordered to reimburse the government if costs were incurred in responding to the false hoax. Let me be clear, this bill will not target innocent mistakes or people who make a report concerning a suspected substance; it is aimed, rather, at deliberate hoax reports by those who know they are spreading false information.  I have said many times on the floor of this body that the terrorists win if they succeed in sowing seeds of panic into our daily lives. We cannot and will not let that happen. Similarly, we will not let these hoaxers get away with words and deeds which have the same effect.                                 ______                                       By
