Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and in support of a fair and honest Census count in the year 2000. In 1990, the census missed an estimated 4 million Americans. Four million left out of our democracy, hundreds of thousands of Georgians not counted, silenced, voiceless, left out and left behind.  This amendment supports a fair and honest census through ``sampling''--the best way we know to conduct a fair and accurate census. The experts support it, the Justice Department under the last three Administrations--under Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton support it. In 1990, even the Speaker of the House supported it.  But what we are debating today is not what is the best policy, but instead the best politics, the best Republican politics.  The census is more than just a political football, it is about fairness for every American--whether they live in North Georgia or Northern California. Every American--rich or poor, young or old, black, white, yellow, red or brown--deserves to be counted. No one should be left out or left behind. It is time to stop playing politics with the census.  Support the best census in the history of the Nation. Support the Mollohan amendment.
