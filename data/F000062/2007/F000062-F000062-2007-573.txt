 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will bring to a close 18 years of litigation between the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users Authority and the U.S. Department of the Interior. It is identical to the bill that we introduced in the waning days of the 109th Congress.  This historic bill will enact a settlement that restores California's second longest river, the San Joaquin, while maintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the Valley the richest agricultural area in the world.  Without this consensus resolution to a long-running western water battle the parties will continue the fight, resulting in a court imposed settlement. To my knowledge, every farmer and every environmentalist who has considered the possibility of continued litigation believes that an outcome imposed by a judge is likely to be worse for everyone on all counts: more costly, riskier for the farmers, and less beneficial for the environment.  The Settlement provides a framework that the affected interests can accept. As a result, this legislation has the strong support of the Bush Administration, the Schwarzenegger Administration, the environmental and fishing communities and numerous California farmers and water districts, including all 22 Friant water districts that have been part of the litigation.  In announcing the signing of this San Joaquin River settlement in September, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior praised it as a ``monumental agreement.'' And when the Federal Court then approved the Settlement in late October, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne further praised Settlement for launching ``one of the largest environmental restoration projects in California's history.'' The Secretary further observed that, ``This Settlement closes a long chapter of conflict and uncertainty in California's San Joaquin Valley . . . and open[s] a new chapter of environmental restoration and water supply certainty for the farmers and their communities.''  I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic agreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a bipartisan group of California House Members in introducing legislation to approve and authorize this Settlement.  The legislation indicates how the settlement forged by the parties is going to be implemented. It involves the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and essentially gives the Secretary of the Interior the additional authority to: take the actions to restore the San Joaquin River; reintroduce the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook Salmon; minimize water supply impacts on Friant water districts; and avoid reductions in water supply for third-party water contractors.  One of the major benefits of this settlement is the restoration of a long-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of California's most important salmon runs will create significant benefits for local communities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to restore a beleaguered fishing industry while improving recreation and quality of life.  The legislation provides for improvements to the San Joaquin river channel to allow salmon restoration to begin in 2014. Beginning in that year, the river would see an annual flow regime mandated by the Settlement, with pulses of additional water in the spring and greater flows available in wetter years. There is flexibility to add or subtract up to 10 percent from the annual flows, as the best science dictates.  A visitor to the revitalized river channel in a decade will find an entirely different place providing recreation for residents of small towns like Mendota, and a refuge for residents of larger cities like Fresno.  The legislation I am introducing today includes provisions to benefit the farmers of the San Joaquin Valley as well as the salmon. In wet years, Friant contractors can purchase surplus flows at $10 per acre-foot for use in dry years, far less than the approximately $35 per acre-foot that they would otherwise pay for this water.  The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to recirculate new restoration flows from the Delta via the California aqueduct and the Cross-Valley Canal to provide additional supply for Friant.  Today's legislation also includes substantial protections for other water districts in California who were not party to the original settlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to avoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, except on a voluntary basis.  In addition, the restoration of flows for over 150 miles below Friant Dam, and reconnecting the upper River to the critical San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta, will be a welcome change for the more than 22 million Californians who rely on that crucial source for their drinking water.  Finally, restoring the San Joaquin as a living salmon river may ultimately help struggling fishing communities on California's North Coast--and even into Southern Oregon. The restoration of the San Joaquin and the government's commitment to reintroduce and rebuild historic salmon populations provide a rare bright spot for these communities.  In addition to congratulating the parties for making a settlement that will enable the long-sought restoration of the San Joaquin River, I am mindful of and remain committed to progress in implementing and funding the December 19, 2000, Trinity River restoration record of decision and the Hoopa Valley Tribe's co-management of the decision's important goal of restoring the fishery resources that the United States holds in trust for the Tribe.  Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. This historic agreement would not have been possible without the participation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and legislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department of the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users Authority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other environmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came together and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to ensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those affected could support.  In November of last year, California voters showed their support by approving Propositions 84 and 1E that will help pay for the Settlement by committing at least $100 million and likely $200 million or more toward the restoration costs. Indeed, this Legislation includes a diverse mix of approximately $200 million in direct Water User payments, new State payments, $240 million in dedicated Friant Central Valley Project capital repayments, and future Federal appropriations limited to $250 million. This mix of funding sources is intended to ensure that the river restoration program will be sustainable over time and truly a joint effort of Federal, state and local agencies.  I would like to emphasize that the Federal funding in the bill is for implementation of both the Restoration Goal to reestablish a salmon fishery in the river, and the Water Management Goal to avoid or minimize water supply losses supplied by Friant Water Districts. It is critical to recognize that these efforts are of equal importance.  At the end of the day, I believe that this agreement is something that we can all feel very proud of, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to approve this legislation and provide the Administration the authorization it needs to fully carry out itslegal obligations and the extensive restoration opportunities under the settlement.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 27       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(B) Deadline.--The study under subparagraph (A) shall be      completed prior to restoration of any flows other than      Interim Flows.       (2) Report.--       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall file a report with      Congress not later than 90 days after issuing a      determination, as required by the Settlement, on whether to      expand channel conveyance capacity to 4500 cubic feet per      second in Reach 4B of the San Joaquin River, or use an      alternative route for pulse flows, that--       (i) explains whether the Secretary has decided to expand      Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second; and       (ii) addresses the following matters:       (I) The basis for the Secretary's determination, whether      set out in environmental review documents or otherwise, as to      whether the expansion of Reach 4B would be the preferable      means to achieve the Restoration Goal as provided in the      Settlement, including how different factors were assessed      such as comparative biological and habitat benefits,      comparative costs, relative availability of State cost-     sharing funds, and the comparative benefits and impacts on      water temperature, water supply, private property, and local      and downstream flood control.       (II) The Secretary's final cost estimate for expanding      Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second, or any      alternative route selected, as well as the alternative cost      estimates provided by the State, by the Restoration      Administrator, and by the other parties to the Settlement.       (III) The Secretary's plan for funding the costs of      expanding Reach 4B or any alternative route selected, whether      by existing Federal funds provided under this Act, by non-     Federal funds, by future Federal appropriations, or some      combination of such sources.       (B) Determination required.--The Secretary shall, to the      extent feasible, make the determination in subparagraph (A)      prior to undertaking any substantial construction work to      increase capacity in Reach 4B.       (3) Costs.--If the Secretary's estimated Federal cost for      expanding Reach 4B in paragraph (2), in light of the      Secretary's funding plan set out in paragraph (2), would      exceed the remaining Federal funding authorized by this Act      (including all funds reallocated, all funds dedicated, and      all new funds authorized by this Act and separate from all      commitments of State and other non-Federal funds and in-kind      commitments), then before the Secretary commences actual      construction work in Reach 4B (other than planning, design,      feasibility, or other preliminary measures) to expand      capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second to implement this      Settlement, Congress must have increased the applicable      authorization ceiling provided by this Act in an amount at      least sufficient to cover the higher estimated Federal costs.     SEC. 10. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON.       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the      Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation      regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the      reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance      that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent      regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of      1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the      goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the      successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring      Run Chinook salmon.       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California      Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be      reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam      pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of      1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that      the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the      reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A)      of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1539(a)(1)(A)).       (c) Final Rule.--       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this      subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or      entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable      State and Federal law and shall include Central Valley      Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the      Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a      final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species      Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take      of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook      salmon prior to the reintroduction.       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph      (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose      more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional      storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties      due to such reintroduction.       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections      provided in the Endangered Species Act for any species listed      pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973      (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the reintroduced population of      California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon,      including protections pursuant to existing biological      opinions or new biological opinions issued by the Secretary      or Secretary of Commerce; or       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from      imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973      (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to      section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those      protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced      California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.       (d) Report.--       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the      Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the      progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section      and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this      section.       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall      include--       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to      successful reintroduction;       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the      reintroduction on the existing population of California      Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the      Sacramento River or its tributaries; and       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the      reintroduction.       (e) FERC Projects.--       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley      Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the      Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its      authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16      U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in      proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne,      Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with      subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the      Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the      designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends      first.       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall      preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing      prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act      (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species      because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to      such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run      Chinook salmon.       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended      or shall be construed--       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et      seq.); or       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other      application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.      1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et      seq.).                                 ______                                       By
