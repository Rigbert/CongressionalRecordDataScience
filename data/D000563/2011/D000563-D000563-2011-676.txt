 I have said on the Senate floor many times, because it is a source of pride to me, I am a first generation American. One hundred years ago, my mother was brought to this country as an infant, 2 years of age. My grandmother brought her over from Lithuania, and they landed in Baltimore in 1911--100 years ago. How they made it--the four of them, at that point: my aunt, uncle, grandmother, and mother--how they made it from Baltimore to East St. Louis, IL, I do not have a clue because I am sure they did not speak but a handful of words in English.
