Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his comments.  This budget, although it appears large, is not large enough. The reality is, and I was just sitting here and thinking about it, that the Forest Service budget is $7 billion, and they do not produce anything. They do not save any lives, and they spend $7 billion for what, I do not know. But just to give some comparisons, this really should be more. This is the biggest increase we have ever had, but it should be more for the duties we have given the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard has 27 new challenges and duties we require of them through this Congress, and only 5,000, I believe, more personnel in the deal; and they have never been funded correctly.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my debate time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), and pending that I ask unanimous consent thatthe gentleman be permitted to control this time.
