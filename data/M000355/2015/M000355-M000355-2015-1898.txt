 He is entirely correct. We are open for business. When we finish this tranche, I hope Senators on both sides who have additional amendments to be considered will come and offer them.  After we get an additional tranche of amendments that are pending, then I think we will be in a better position to announce the way forward.  I yield the floor.                            Amendment No. 27
