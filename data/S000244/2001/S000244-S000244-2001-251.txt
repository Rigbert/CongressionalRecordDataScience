 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2215, the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act which authorizes appropriation for the Department of Justice and its components for fiscal year 2002, establishes permanent enabling authorities for the Department, makes several minor and technical improvements to various statutes affecting the Department, requires certain reports be made to Congress, and establishes a permanent Violence Against Women's Office within the Office of Justice Programs at the Department.  This bill was favorably reported by the Committee on the Judiciary on June 20 by voice vote. The legislation is cosponsored by the committee's ranking minority member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and enjoys broad, bipartisan support.  Madam Speaker, the Department of Justice and its various components wields tremendous power and influence. It has an annual budget exceeding $24 billion and has in excess of 125,000 employees. The Department has ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of all Federal criminal laws, including those regarding terrorism. It enforces our Nation's antitrust laws, civil rights laws, immigration and naturalization laws, environmental statutes, tax laws, and numerous other Federal statutes. The lawyers at the Department of Justice represent the government in most types of actions, civil and criminal. And it provides legal advice to the President of the United States and the departments and agencies of the Federal Government. In short, the vast majority of legal questions in litigations addressed by the Federal Government are reviewed and handled by the Department of Justice.                              {time}  1430  This great power and responsibility can be a tremendous force for good throughout the Nation and the world. Also, abuse, misuse, and neglect of this power can have detrimental effects that reverberate throughout this country. The Department of Justice is unlike any other department or agency of the Federal Government because its job is providing justice to all. Thus it must be held to the highest standards. Because of its importance, Congress should be fully engaged in oversight of the Department. Unfortunately, Congress has not done a good job of oversight of the Department in the past and needs to do much better.  Further, Congress has neglected its basic responsibility for the last 20 years by failing to authorize the programs within the Department of Justice. It is shameful that the last billauthorizing appropriations for the Department was signed into law by President Carter on November 30, 1979. The last serious effort to authorize the Department was undertaken by my predecessor, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), during the 105th Congress, but the other body failed to act on that legislation. Congress must do a much better job in overseeing the many departments and agencies that make up the Federal Government, and today this House will take a giant leap forward in that effort by authorizing the DOJ and its components.  One reason the Department needs increased oversight is its size. In 1993, the budget authority for the Department was $11.3 billion. Today, it exceeds $24 billion. In 1993, the Department had 90,600 authorized positions. Today it has 35,000 more. In 1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had over $1.5 billion in budget authority and over 18,000 authorized positions. Today the INS has over $5 billion in budget authority and 33,500 authorized positions.  I doubt that many Members or their constituents would argue that the increased funding and staffing at the INS has improved its operations appreciably. I would feel the opposite. Another area of exponential growth at the Department has been its grant-making authority. In 1993, the Office of Justice Programs distributed almost $1 billion in grants. In fiscal year 2001, the Department will distribute more than $5 billion. This growth of budget authority and responsibility cries out for congressional oversight. This bill takes us in that direction.  Title I of the bill authorizes appropriations for the major components of the Justice Department for fiscal year 2002. While President Bush's budget provides a breather from the hefty increases the Department has seen over the last decade, this budget still includes promising initiatives, such as new funding for the INS to help secure our borders, new funding for the FBI to combat terrorism and cybercrime, and new funding for the DEA to improve its efforts to fight the scourge of drugs and violence. The authorization mirrors the President's request except in two areas. First, the committee increased the President's request for the DOJ Inspector General by $10 million. This is necessary because the committee is concerned about the severe downsizing of that office and the need for oversight, particularly of the FBI, at the Department.  H.R. 2215 does not contain an authorization for appropriations for several unauthorized grant programs. The Committee on the Judiciary will review each of these expired programs and authorize them as needed. The committee has already done this for the Juvenile Justice Block Grants program which I am hopeful that the House will consider in the coming weeks.  Madam Speaker, title III contains an important provision establishing within the office of DOJ Inspector General a deputy IG for FBI oversight whose sole job will be to coordinate and be responsible for overseeing the programs and operations of the Bureau. This position is necessary because of the recent spy scandal, the FBI's failure to comply with the document disclosure agreement in the McVeigh case, and now the revelation about missing firearms and computers at our Nation's number one law enforcement agency. These problems cry out for attention, and I believe there needs to be one person in the IG's office whose sole focus is to review FBI operations.  As I have already mentioned, the bill increases the authorization for the office of Inspector General by $10 million above the President's proposed budget. This office has been severely downsized over the last several years from approximately 460 to 360 full-time equivalents. I believe that Congress has been penny-wise and pound foolish in this regard. We should spend a little bit more time, effort, and money on oversight and a little less on other bloated DOJ programs. I would urge the conferees in the DOJ appropriation bill to adequately fund the new responsibilities that have been given to the IG.  H.R. 2215 requires the IG to submit an oversight plan for the FBI to the Congress and requires the Attorney General to review Attorney General Reno's order numbered 1931-94. Coincidentally, Attorney General Ashcroft overturned this order on July 11, a day after the report to H.R. 2215 was filed in the House. Now the DOJ Inspector General has full authority over both the FBI and DEA. Passage of this bill will help the new Director and the Attorney General make needed improvements to this prestigious agency.  The bill also authorizes a Violence Against Women Office within the Justice Department. This provision was offered in committee by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin). The VAWO would be headed by a director who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  In addition, title IV enumerates duties and responsibilities of the Director and requires the Attorney General to ensure the VAWO is adequately staffed. Since its adoption in committee, this provision has been changed to ensure that it may utilize the existing bureaucracy that already exists at the Office of Justice Programs. As originally drafted, the VAWO would have had to establish its own grant making office and administrative offices. The director of VAWO will report to the Assistant Attorney General but may report to the Deputy Attorney General on such matters as she deems appropriate. I appreciate the work of the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) and her willingness to ensure that this office works properly within the existing bureaucracy at the Department.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight one other provision of this bill. It contains an important provision that directs the Department of Justice to submit all reports it is required to submitted, including reprogramming notices and transfer requests, to the Committee on the Judiciary in addition to any other committee. This will clearly help the Committee on the Judiciary conduct oversight of the Department. This provision is necessary because several years ago, the Committee on Appropriations slipped an amendment into their bill denying the House and Senate Judiciary Committees the ability to receive reprogramming and transfer notices, notices which were routinely sent to the committees from 1979 through 1996. This has diminished our ability to conduct oversight over the Department, and I believe has hurt the Department of Justice. It takes more than just the Committee on Appropriations to conduct oversight over the DOJ. The Committee on the Judiciary has a large role to play, and it should not be denied needed information by another committee.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 2215 is a giant step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. We do not tackle every problem facing the Department by this legislation. However, we do address several, and I am sure we will address more next year during the fiscal year 2003 process. The Committee on the Judiciary will continue to review the programs and operations of the Department of Justice and will hold it to the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. Congress ratifies that process by its action here today.  I particularly want to acknowledge the work of the members of the committee, particularly the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and his staff who have sat through numerous sessions with majority staff and Department of Justice officials. We all should be proud of this comprehensive bill.  I urge all Members to support this legislation.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
