Mr. Speaker, it is time for Republicans to come clean about their tax bill. Republicans want a tax cut for people working on Wall Street, not people living on Main Street.  Let us take an example. Al works 40 hours a work at the factory. Al works hard and supports his wife and two children on his $25,000 salary. He pays thousands of dollars in taxes. What does Al get from the Republican tax bill? Nothing. Zero. Zip.  Democrats want to give Al and millions of other working families a tax cut. These are the people Democrats want to help. What do the Republicans say about Al? They say Al is on welfare.  Billions of dollars in tax breaks for millionaires. Nothing for Al. Nothing for millions of hard-working American families. That is the Republican plan.                          ____________________
