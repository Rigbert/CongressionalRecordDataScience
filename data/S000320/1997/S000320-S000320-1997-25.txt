 President, I have an agreement we have worked on which basically says that on some appropriate vehicle in the future I will work with Chairman Stevens and other members to include a technical correction to this conference report to accomplish the following:  At section 337(c) we will insert, after the words: ``House and Senate Committees on Appropriations,'' ``and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.''  I am doing this at the suggestion of Senator Hutchison from Texas, and we have agreed to this.  Mr. President, at this time I will yield back the remainder of my time if the Senator from New Jersey will.
