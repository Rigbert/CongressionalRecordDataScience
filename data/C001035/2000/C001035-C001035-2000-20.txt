The funds will be made available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (or ``NFWF''), which has made a commitment to me to allocate the monies to worthwhile projects as soon as possible. The conference report provides $5.0 million to NFWF, of which $2.0 million will be made available to the Atlantic Salmon Commission and $500,000 will be made available to the National Academy of Sciences. The remaining $2.5 million will be administered by NFWF to carry out a grant program that will fund on-the-ground projects to further Atlantic salmon conservation or restoration efforts in coordination with the State of Maine and the Maine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan.  The conference report contains language indicating that funds administered by NFWF will be subject to cost sharing. Is it your understanding, Mr. Chairman, that this language means the $2.5 million administered by NFWF to carry out a grant program must be matched, in the aggregate, by at least $2.5 million in non-federal funds?
