 President, I have come to the floor to speak about the Fast and Furious investigation. But I would also like to follow up and have this portion of my remarks follow the Senator from California because I think my side has a legitimate position to take on some job creation things that are in the House bill that has come over here; that if people just hear one side of the story, they might misunderstand we are not interested in creating jobs and we are only interested in putting stumbling blocks in the way of regulations or Presidential decisions that are made. But it is directly related to, in the case of rules by EPA that the Senator spoke about, it is a fact that under this administration there is an explosion of regulations. A lot of those regulations, because of their cost, have led to the elimination of a lot of jobs or a lot of jobs not being created as a result thereof.  So if we hear the President of the United States saying we ought to pass legislation that he is for to create jobs or we hear the President of the United States, one or two times a week, flying all over the country at taxpayers' expense to give political speeches and asking to put the pressure on Congress to pass his jobs bill at the very same time his departments are issuing regulations costing jobs or not creating jobs or the President making a decision that we shouldn't build a pipeline from Canada down to Texas so we can import more oil in a cost-effective way from our friend Canada--a reliable friend--instead of spending $830 million every day--every day--to import oil and paying that to countries that either hate us or want to kill us, we think there is an inconsistency between the President who is going around the country giving speeches on why Congress isn't passing his legislation to create jobs, when his administration is making decisions--in the case of the pipeline, 20,000 jobs could be created right now, union-paying jobs, good jobs, and 110,000 jobs on the side related thereto, plus what it does good for the energy policy of the United States to have that built. The President is standing in the way.  He says it needs another year of study. The State Department has already given two studies over a period of years saying it is OK to go ahead. It is not an environmental problem. The Nebraska legislature held it up for a little while because of the aquifer, but they have reached an agreement that it can go through their State in a little different direction.  We think we ought to create those 20,000 jobs and we ought to do it right now and this legislation that has come over from the House does that. This legislation coming over from the House puts some block of some regulations going into effect that is going to eliminate jobs or stop the creation of jobs.  So we are a little bit irritated about the inconsistency between an administration that wants us to pass legislation to create jobs when, at the very same time, one person is making a decision that we are not going to move ahead with job creation projects. This legislation allows to move ahead for that.                          ____________________
