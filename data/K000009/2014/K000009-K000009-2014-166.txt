Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of a great American, Patricia McNamara Beazley, a magnificent woman and citizen whom we laid to rest today in Toledo, Ohio, after a mass at Gesu Church, a place that she called home.  Pat Beazley was an extraordinary human being. The minute you met her you felt like a member of her family. She was an artist of family, a dedicated wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and an artist in her own right. Her paintings abound not just in her home but throughout our country and, certainly, in her home community.  Her son, Michael--a personal friend--her daughters, her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren, and her wonderful husband, Ben, just know that our entire community stands with you. We know what a builder of family and community Pat was. We celebrate her life--her life of love, her life of contributions to others, her very quiet way of building friendships and, in so doing, building a community that was strong--her church family, her community of artists and, obviously, her own family.  We say ``thank you'' to the Beazley Family for sharing Pat with us these many, many decades. We have been so blessed by her presence, and the beauty of her life and the beauty of her works will remain with us always. May she rest in peace, and may God give comfort to those who remain behind to carry forward her legacy.                          [From: Toledo Blade]       Patricia Beazley, 83, an award-winning artist known for her      skill in portraiture and in depicting family scenes and      children, died Wednesday in her Sylvania Township home.       Mrs. Beazley developed complications after a series of      strokes the last few years, her son, Michael, said. Mrs.      Beazley and her loving, surviving husband, Ben, raised three     gifted children--Michael, Mary Beth and Trish. Their      grandchildren & great grandchildren pay tribute to their      lifetime of love and devotion.       Pat was an artist in every sense of the word. She accepted      commissions and she created formal portraits, such as of      professors and administrators at the University of Toledo and      Ohio State University. Families commissioned her to depict a      mother with a baby or a montage of family scenes. On      occasion, she was asked on short notice to do a portrait that      could be displayed at a wake or funeral service. She created      the familiar picture, ''Daughter Too,'' of the pig-tailed      girl eating an apple on the side of Al Peake & Sons &      Daughter Too produce trucks.       ``Her biggest strength as an artist was she really captured      the likeness,'' her daughter Mary Beth said. ``A friend of      hers stopped by and said, `She captured the spirit.' ''       Mrs. Beazley worked primarily in pastel, though she was      versed in other media.       ``She enjoyed anything from the still lifes to the      flowers,'' her son said. ``Her line of pencil drawings she      used to call `captured moments.' She always took joy in the      craft and a special pride in the reactions of the families      she did work for.''       Her work has been selected for the annual Toledo Area      Artists Exhibition at the Toledo Museum of Art and for a      Pastel Society of America exhibition and has been included in      other shows at the museum and through the Athena Art Society      and other groups. She received a Grumbacher Bronze Medallion,      and at several exhibitions, her works were deemed best-of-     show.       Her mother was an amateur artist, but Mrs. Beazley did not      take an art class until she was 39. She actively resisted      training as a child, she told The Blade in 1981, because ``I      just knew I wasn't good enough.''       She also was active at Gesu Church and volunteered for the      League of Women's Voters--she produced a public television      program featuring debates among local candidates--and on      behalf of civil rights.       She'd painted a mural on the kitchen wall when the family      lived in Chicago. She began sketching.--See more at: http:// www.leg acy.com/obituaries/toledoblade/obituary.aspx      ?n=patriciabeazley&pid=169562150#sthash.VE uVwBOk.dpuf                          ____________________
