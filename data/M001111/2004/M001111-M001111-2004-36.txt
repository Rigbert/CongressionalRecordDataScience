 President, there is no doubt the childcare is an issue that is very difficult for many families, and to provide all this support for every family is something that will be extremely difficult. We all acknowledge that. But there is a specific group of families serving us overseas today in Iraq and Afghanistan who are absolutely excluded from any help whatsoever. My amendment assures that they are not excluded.
