 President, this is getting kind of silly. If the Senator wants to respond, respond. I am delighted to yield to him to respond. There was no intention to in any way affront the Senator.  The Senator from California asked me a question. She did not have the floor; I had the floor; and I yielded to her for a question. You walked on thefloor. As soon as she finished, I yielded to you because your name was mentioned.
