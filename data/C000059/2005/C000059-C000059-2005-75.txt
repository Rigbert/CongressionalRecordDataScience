Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and give thanks to my friend and colleague, Chris Cox. After serving in the House for more than 16 years, Chris is now taking on a new challenge by serving as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I think all of us can agree that our loss is most certainly their gain.  Following the redistricting of 2002, I became the newest member of the Orange County delegation and my newly drawn district shared a border with his. Chris immediately welcomed me to the delegation with open arms and graciously introduced me to a host of local government officials, business owners, and community leaders.  If anyone has spent time in his district and enjoyed its extraordinary coastal setting, they would agree that Chris must be a truly dedicated public servant for agreeing to spend so much time here in Washington. Thankfully, he possessed the will to serve in Congress and to be a leader for his county, State and Nation.  During his time in the House, Chris served with distinction in many different roles. Most recently, Chris made history by serving as the first Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. In this capacity, Chris took on an unprecedented challenge and oversaw the most radical government reform in decades. As those who know Chris would expect, he was up to the task and eager to find out what was working and what needed to be fixed.  Chris came to Congress in 1988 after serving as Senior Associate Counsel to President Reagan. While at the White House, Chris gained tremendous insight and invaluable experience, but I think he would tell you that the best thing he took away from his time there would be his wife, Rebecca.  I know Chris will take on this new challenge with the same tenacity and vigor that he showed so often on so many important issues here in Congress. I understand Chris wisely decided to keep his home in Orange County, and I look forward working with him in Washington and enjoying the warm California sun with him in Orange County.                          ____________________
