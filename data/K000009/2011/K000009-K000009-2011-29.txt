Every small business that I walk into tells me, Marcy, bring me customers. Customers are a function of having spendable income.  There are no more important decisions we could make as a country, right now, as we finish the month of December, than to make sure that middle class families have spendable income by not raising their taxes; middle class families, who've been holding the line here without real additional spending power over the last decade, and to make sure that we extend unemployment benefits to those who've earned those benefits because that has the maximum bang inside the economy when people spend those dollars on basics, on essentials.  Those are two practical decisions from an economic standpoint no rational human being would disagree with. And they contribute to economic growth. They contribute to keeping us on an upward path as we move forward here in our country after coming out of this deep, deep, deep recession.
