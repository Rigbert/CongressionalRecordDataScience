 What we have here suggests that there can be corruption but no one is corrupt.  How can there be corruption unless someone is engaging in corrupt activity? I say to my friend from Washington, as I said earlier in this debate, that is similar to saying the gang is corrupt but none of the gangsters is.  It is shocking to have these allegations when there are no specifics.
