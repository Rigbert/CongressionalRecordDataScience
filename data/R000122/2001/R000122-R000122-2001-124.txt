President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in introducing a resolution commemorating the letter sent by President George Washington to Touro Synagogue in Newport Rhode Island, the oldest Jewish house of worship in the United States.  When Roger Williams came to Rhode Island in the 1630s, an individual's right to worship without government interference was unknown in other colonies or countries of the world. He made religious tolerance the core principle of his new settlement, and it became a beacon of hope for those suffering from persecution.  By the middle of the 17th century, 15 Jewish families, who knew the pain of intolerance firsthand, arrived in Newport to reclaim their faith and rebuild their lives. This group included Jews from Spain and Portugal who had been forced to become Christian converts to escape persecution. Rhode Island's lively experiment promised a new beginning.  The 18th century say many steps toward the realization of this promise, as increasing trade and religious tolerance spurred the growth of Newport and its Jewish community. By 1759, with about 75 families totaling some 300 people, the Congregation turned to the construction of a permanent house of worship. Four years later, this Synagogue was dedicated in a service led by Reverend Isaac Touro, the spiritual leader of the Congregation.  As this country's first President, George Washington was the leader of a nation still crafting its ideals and identity. Although the new Constitution had won ratification, many Americans feared that its concentration of power in a federal government threatened the individual liberties for which they had so recently gone to war. To alleviate these fears, Washington began a nationwide tour in support of a Bill of Rights that would explicitly protect basic freedoms of Americans against government intrusion.  This tour brought Washington to Newport in August 1790. During his visit, Washington received an eloquent letter from Moses Seixas, the warden of Touro Synagogue. Seixas commended the President for his work and leadership in establishing a government that respected the inalienable rights of all citizens.  Washington's response embraced Seixas' simple, elegant phrases to renew his and the nation's commitment to Rhode Island's founding principle. Addressing a Congregation dedicated to religious liberty in a state based on this ideal, Washington reaffirmed religious freedom as essential to the new nation's identity.  When Washington declared that ``the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves asgood citizens,'' he made Rhode Island's history of religious liberty a model for the nation. ``To bigotry no sanction.'' It is for good reason that these words continue to resonate today, as we confront the challenges of an ever more closely linked, yet endlessly diverse community of nations. We all know too well the destruction that bigotry causes, and this plague is still with us. The fight for tolerance is as necessary now as in the days of President Washington or Roger Williams.  This fight for tolerance is the reason the original letter sent by George Washington remains on permanent display at the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. This fight for tolerance is also the reason Americans of all religious faiths gather at the Klutznick Museum each February and at Touro Synagogue each August to hear readings of the letter. It is my hope these commemorations inspire us to follow the examples set by Roger Williams and President Washington and continue to fight for religious and personal liberty for all.                          ____________________
