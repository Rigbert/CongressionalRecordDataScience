 A patent gives the holder the exclusive right to exclude others from using the patented invention. A tax strategy patent makes taxpayers choose between paying more than legally required in taxes or providing a windfall to a tax strategy patentholder by paying a royalty to comply with the tax law.  Tax strategy patents add another layer of complexity to the tax laws by requiring taxpayers or their advisers to conduct patent searches and exposing them to potential patent infringement lawsuits.  If a tax strategy patent is granted for a tax shelter designed to illegally evade taxes, the fact that a patent was granted may mislead unknowing taxpayers into believing the obvious: That the strategy is valid under the tax law when, in fact, it might not be.  Tax strategies are not like other inventions because everyone wants to pay less tax. Tax strategy patents are on the rise, which then means more and more legal tax strategies are unavailable or, obviously, more expensive for more and more taxpayers.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter. This letter, which is from a coalition of 15 consumer groups, including the umbrella group for public accountants, the Tax Justice Center, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, provides more information on why tax strategy patents are bad for taxpayers.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 2, 2011.     Re Tax Strategy Patents.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Gentlemen: On behalf of our 15 national organizations      representing consumer, taxpayer, charitable, financial      planning, and     tax advisor groups, we commend you for including a provision      in S. 23, The Patent Reform Act of 2011, to address the      serious problem of tax strategy patents. Similar to      legislation recently introduced by Senators Baucus and      Grassley, S. 139, we believe that this pro-taxpayer measure      is a critical component of any comprehensive patent reform      effort. The ongoing, serious concerns associated with tax      strategy patents pose a significant threat to American      taxpayers and businesses, and we believe that Congress must      prioritize fixing this problem as soon as possible.       As the Senate Judiciary Committee moves to mark up S. 23,      we ask you specifically to champion this provision, and      aggressively oppose any efforts to weaken or remove it. There      is too much at stake to allow special interests to try to      monopolize methods of Federal tax compliance, leaving      American taxpayers potentially subject to lawsuits.      royalties, and a much more complicated, expensive tax code.       As you know, the problems associated with tax strategy      patents are multiple and quite complex. First, such patents      may limit the ability of taxpayers to utilize fully      interpretations of tax law intended by Congress--effectively      creating a monopoly for the patent holders to determine who      can and cannot utilize parts of the tax code. Furthermore,      tax advisors, who generally are not patent experts, have the      burden to be aware of such patents, and either provide tax      advice that complies with the patent holder's requirements,      risk a lawsuit for themselves and their clients, or      potentially not provide the most advantageous advice to      clients. Not surprisingly, these patents create a highly      burdensome level of cost ultimately borne by taxpayers.       These patents already affect a myriad of tax planning      vehicles, including retirement plans, real estate      transactions, deferred compensation, financial investments,      charitable giving, and estate planning transfers. We are      concerned that the U.S. Patent Office may permit the      expansion of these types of patents into additional areas      broadly affecting average taxpayers. For example, there are      pending patents that would affect taxpayers' ability to      create a financial plan for funding college education,      utilize incentive programs for health care savings account      cards, insure against tax liabilities, and use life insurance      to generate income.       As of now, the numbers of tax strategy patents have grown      to over 130 issued and more than 150 pending. We fear this      trend is likely to continue to grow exponentially without      your leadership. Legislation must be passed quickly if we are      to provide taxpayers with equal access to all available      avenues of federal tax compliance.       As you know, there is broad, bipartisan, and growing      support for this legislation. In the 111th Congress,      Congressmen Rick Boucher and Bob Goodlatte introduced H.R.      2584, a similar initiative which ended the Congress with 45      cosponsors. That legislation built off of the passage of      comprehensive patent reform legislation, passed by the House      in the 110th Congress, which included its own tax strategy      patents provision. In addition, Senators Baucus and Grassley      previously introduced legislation on this topic in the 110th      Congress, garnering 30 cosponsors, including then-Senator      Barack Obama. The National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olsen, has      also publicly stated her support for a legislative solution      to this problem. Clearly, with such overwhelming support and      momentum over the last several years, the time has come to      finally enact this proposal and send it to the President.       Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of American      taxpayers. Please contact any of us if we can assist you as      you move forward on this important matter.
