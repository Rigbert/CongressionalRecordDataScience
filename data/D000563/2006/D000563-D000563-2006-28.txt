President, I join in this chorus of salutations and praise for the retiring majority leader. I listened carefully to Senator Frist's recollection of his public service, and I noted the first item on his agenda was the $15 billion in the fight against global AIDS. It is an issue on which we joined together many times, an issue where President Bush showed extraordinary leadership, and there was extraordinary bipartisan support for what he was trying to achieve.  As one reflects on his life and his background, it was no surprise that led the list. Senator Frist dedicated his time before the Senate to the healing arts, and I think he brought some of that same dedication to this role in the Senate, trying to use his post as the Senator from Tennessee and as a leader in the Senate to heal the world and our Nation. I thank you for all your efforts in that regard.  I know when he came to this job, it was thrust upon him rather quickly. I know he had his critics, and there might even have been a few on this side of the aisle from time to time, but, by and large, I think his leadership has been symbolized by a lack of cunning, a lack of sharp elbows and an effort to try and patch up our differences and get things done. Once again, you were the healer when you had the chance to do it.  I have traveled to Africa, as he has, probably not as often. I have seen some of those dusty villages where there is no one to be seen for miles around. But I cannot imagine your taking your surgical skills to those villages and those huts and operating under a flashlight, hour after hour, day after day, week after week. That defines Bill Frist, in my mind--a person who may not have been recognized by anyone on the road to that village, did some good, and left a legacy that will be remembered.  To you, to Karyn, to your family, let me add my voice in saying you left a great legacy in the Senate, and I wish you all the very best.  (Applause.)
