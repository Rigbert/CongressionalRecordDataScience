President, I would like to recognize Ms. Sandra ``Sandi'' J. Esty, one of our most distinguished civil servants who will retire from Federal service on June 7, 2008, after contributing over 35 years of dedicated service to our country. She serves as the Chief, Air Operations Division, Office of Legislative Liaison, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, the Pentagon, Washington, DC. She is responsible for managing, planning, developing and executing all facets of congressional travel matters for the Department of the Air Force. Ms. Esty also serves as the senior adviser and special assistant to the Director, Legislative Liaison and Air Force leadership with oversight of the Air Force Congressional Travel Program.  Ms. Esty left Syracuse, NY, in 1972 to begin her illustrious civil service career as a clerk-stenographer in the Office of the Air Force Reserve, the Pentagon. After demonstrating remarkable competence in working congressional constituent inquiries, she was selected to work Air Force constituent issues in the Secretary of the Air Force Legislative Liaison Inquiry Division, in 1975. She was promoted and served a short tour as the Administrative Assistant for the Secretary of the Air Force Space Systems, Budget Office before being asked to return to the Air Force Legislative Liaison Branch in 1981, this time as the Administrative Assistant to the Chief of Air Operations Division in Legislative Liaison. She was promoted in 1983 and served as Administrative Assistant to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Electronic Warfare. In 1985, she returned to Legislative Liaison as the Administrative Assistant to the Director of Legislative Liaison and then was assigned as an action officer in the White House Liaison Branch, Legislative Liaison, where she established herself as one of the top leaders of Legislative Liaison. In 1988, she was promoted and selected as the Deputy Chief, Air Operations Division, Legislative Liaison, and then, in 1997, she was promoted as a GS-15 and continued to serve in her current position as Chief, Air Operations Division.  During her tenure in the Air Operations Division, Ms. Esty was responsible for all the travel requirements of Members and staff of Congress arranged by the Air Force. Ms. Esty's calm, logical, thorough method of dealing with unique situations involved some of this country's most important citizens, its legislators. Her true dedication to ``doing it right,'' the absolute insistence on honesty and integrity, and the patience under extreme daily pressure are the standards that Ms. Esty leaves for all those who follow. She coordinated and executed over 10,000 congressional trips worldwide, to include the movement of approximately 70,000 Members and staff of Congress to 193 countries and 7 continents. I personally travelled on many of the trips with the Senate Armed Services delegations that Ms. Esty arranged, coordinated, and flight followed. Each was a complete success.  I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere appreciation to Ms. Esty who has provided many years of dedicated and professional service to the Congress and the U.S. Air Force and wish her well in all her future endeavors.                          ____________________
