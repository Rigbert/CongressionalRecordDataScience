 This bill is fiscally irresponsible. It was irresponsible 2 years ago. It devastated the economy. It added to our deficit. It has created more problems economically than this country has seen in many years.  I ask the Senator from Nevada this: Do we have a Democratic alternative we are going to offer on the floor of the Senate that is smaller in scope but more focused on the issues we are hearing about, for example, that addresses the costs of health insurance for businesses? Has the Senator met any business leader in America today who has not told him that the cost of health insurance is breaking the bank?  I say to the Senator from Nevada, if we are going to have a tax cut to invigorate the economy, tell us what the Democratic alternative would do and the scope of it and whether or not it reaches the level suggested by the Republicans.
