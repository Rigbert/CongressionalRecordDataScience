 When will the hearing on the rule be held so that our Members can know; so that if they have amendments they would like to offer, they can appear at the Rules Committee?  And I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I anticipate the Rules Committee meeting on Monday.
