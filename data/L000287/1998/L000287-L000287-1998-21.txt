Mr. Chairman, I say to my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Riggs), I knew Martin Luther King, Jr., very well. I worked with him for many years. He was my friend, my leader, my hero, my brother. If he was standing here tonight, I tell my colleagues, he would say he believes in a color-blind society, but he would tell us that we are not there yet, and he would not be supporting the Riggs amendment.  So I think that it is not right to use Martin Luther King in this manner.
