Speaker, 50 years ago, when we were beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery, there were officers of the law wearing the Confederate battle flag on their helmet.  When the Klan marched through our neighborhoods in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, countless homes in Birmingham were bombed and burned. When they set fire to Black churches throughout the South, the Confederate battle flag was the symbol of their cruelty and injustice.  There is no way, but no way that the Federal Government should ever display this flag on any Federal site or sell it on Federal property. It is a symbol of division and a symbol of separation. It is a symbol of hate. It is a relic of our dark past.  We must defeat every attempt to return this flag to Federal properties.                          ____________________
