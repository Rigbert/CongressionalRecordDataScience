 President, from November 11 through November 26, 1996, I traveled to the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Nepal for discussions with senior leaders in each of these places. I have today transmitted my report on this trip to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. I hope my colleagues find it of interest.  I ask that the report be printed in the Record.  The report follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 1997.     Hon. Jesse Helms,     Chairman.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Helms and Senator Biden:       Attached please find a report on my travel to China, Hong      Kong, Taiwan, and Nepal from November 11 through 26, 1996.      During the China portion of the trip and parts of the Hong      Kong and Taiwan portions, I joined Senators Daschle, Dorgan,      Glenn, Kempthorne, and Leahy. Travel costs were at my      personal expense.       In China, I discussed with the Chinese leadership the need      to develop a long-term strategic framework for our      relationship based on our many mutual interests, tensions in      the triangular U.S.-China-Taiwan relationship, a variety of      U.S.-China trade issues, nonproliferation and other security      concerns, and human rights and legal development in China.       In Hong Kong, the itinerary included meetings with British,      Chinese, and Hong Kong officials and members of the business      community to assess the prospects for Hong Kong's reversion      to Chinese rule in July 1997.       In meetings with the Taiwanese leadership in Taipei, I      discussed Taiwan's role in the U.S.-China relationship and      how to get dialogue across the Taiwan Strait back on track.       In Nepal, I examined the progress made by this fledgling      democracy in consolidating its democratic institutions, and      looked at ways the United States can be most effective in      helping promote Nepal's economic development. I met with His      Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah, Prime Minister Sher      Bahadur Deuba, and Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani,      as well as members of the various parties in the parliament.       I am grateful to Ambassador James Sasser and his staff in      Beijing, Consul General Richard Boucher and his staff in Hong      Kong, American Institute in Taiwan Director Darryl Johnson      and his staff in Taipei, and Ambassador Sandy Vogelgesang and      her staff in Kathmandu. Their cooperation and assistance      helped make this trip as productive as it was. I would      particularly like to thank Foreign Service Officers Darcy      Zotter, Robert Forden, Michael Meserve, Gina Sullivan, Paul      Daley, and Peter Bodde, and AIT staffer Andrew Wilson, for      their assistance. I am also grateful to the staff of the      Committee on Foreign Relations for their help.       I hope you find this report useful.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     United States Senator.                          ____________________
