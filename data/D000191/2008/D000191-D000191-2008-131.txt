Res. 772, a resolution to congratulate the American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.  Founded in 1932 as the National Highway Users Conference, in 1970 the group merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation and were renamed the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, and in 1995 they took on the current name of American Highway Users Alliance (``the Highway Users'').  The Highway Users has always been an outspoken proponent for adequate funding for our Nation's highway infrastructure and a consistent voice for motorists and those who depend on our highways for commercial purposes.  For the past 75 years, Highway Users have expressed the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation, including strong support for the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System, established the Highway Trust Fund. Since then, it's been an unwavering force for protecting the integrity of the Federal Highway Trust Fund and State Highway Trust Funds.  As we received a report last week on the state of the Nation's infrastructure from a commission that was created by the passage of the SAFETEA-LU bill, we find that we are dramatically in deficit in investing in the Nation's infrastructure. And the current administration is dramatically in denial about the deficit in investing in infrastructure, so there will be a lot of work to be done by the American Highway Users Alliance and other advocates for an improved transportation network in the United States of America.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
