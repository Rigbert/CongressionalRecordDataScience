 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 7, the nomination of Samuel Bodman to be Secretary of Energy, that the nomination be confirmed, that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then resume legislative session. Finally, I ask that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.
