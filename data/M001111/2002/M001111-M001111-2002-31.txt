 Included in the list of projects that could be funded through this project is an infectious disease tracking system.  In my home state of Washington, our military community has an urgent need for such a system, facilitating the quick response to potential life-threatening events. Public health has long been focused on the ability to quickly identify epidemic diseases and intervene to protect public safety rapidly and as efficiently as possible. Preparing for and responding to a biologic crisis requires a clear understanding of such dimensions as geography, time frames, population demographics, resources, severity, and outcomes. The problem, at this point, is that the public health arena lacks the type of information infrastructure in place that is needed to guide an immediate response to a bioterrorism event. Do you agree, that an information system to track infectious diseases is a vital and worthy area of research?
