 President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia. I appreciate his leadership not only on behalf of the coal miners of Kentucky but miners all across America.  The President of the United States came to Hazard, KY, this summer. He bit his lip; he felt our pain. He said he wanted to help us. We said: We need jobs. And when the opportunity came to support the Byrd amendment which would at least keep the jobs we have now, the President would not support him.  This administration is trying to destroy the mining industry in America, make no mistake about it. That is what this amendment is about.  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership, and we hope very much our colleagues will be able to support us.
