President, over the last month, Senate Republicans have failed to refute the facts of what they have done to President Obama's judicial nominations. The Senate's work on judicial nominations should not be about partisan point-scoring; it should be about ensuring the American people have access to justice. I rejected that partisan tit-for-tat approach while moving to confirm 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and 2002.  The question for the Senate is, Are we doing enough to ensure that hard working Americans have access to justice so that they can have their rights protected? At a time when 10 percent of the Federal bench remains vacant, I do not think that we are. The standard we set during the Bush administration for quickly moving to confirm noncontroversial nominees is not being met.  Senate Republicans who take such pride in the number of nominees being confirmed this year ignore how many were needlessly delayed from confirmation last year and what they have done during the last 4 years. That is why after the 14 confirmations this year, we remain more than 20 confirmations behind the pace we set for President Bush's circuit and district nominees, and vacancies remain nearly twice as high as they were at this point during President Bush's second term. For all their self-congratulatory statements, they cannot refute the following: We are not even keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have increased, not decreased, since the start of this year. President Obama's judicial nominees have faced unprecedented delays and obstruction by Senate Republicans. We have yet to finish the work that could and should have been completed last year. There are still a dozen judicial nominees with bipartisan support being denied confirmation.  A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compares the whole of President Obama's first term to the whole of President Bush's first term, and the contrast could not be more clear. The median Senate floor wait time for President Obama's district nominees was five times longer than for President Bush's. President Obama's circuit nominees faced even longer delays, and their median wait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bush's circuit nominees. The comparison is even worse if we look just at nominees who were reported and confirmed unanimously. President Bush's unanimously confirmed circuit nominees had a median wait time of just 14 days. Compare that to the 130.5 days for President Obama's unanimous nominees. That is more than nine times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS calls this a ``notable change.'' There is no good reason for such unprecedented delays, but those are the facts.  The confirmations in the last few months does not change the reality of what has happened over the last 4 years. If a baseball player goes 0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all-star because he is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-for-10 and not a very good hitter.  So while I welcome the confirmations this year, I note both that 10 of the 14 could and should have been confirmed last year and that there are another dozen nominees pending before the Senate, including four who also could have been confirmed last year. We can and must do more for Americans who look to our courts for justice. They deserve better than long delays and empty courtrooms. With 10 percent of our Federal bench vacant and a backlog of nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar, it is clear that the Senate is not working up to its full capacity on nominations.  It is true that some vacancies do not have nominees. I wish Republican home State Senators would work with President Obama to fill these vacancies. Nor do those vacancies excuse their unwillingness to complete action on the consensus judicial nominees who are ready to be confirmed but whose confirmations are being delayed. Mark Barnett, Claire Kelly, Shelly Dick, William Orrick, Nelson Roman, Sheri Chappell, Michael McShane, Nitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, Jeffrey Schmehl, Kenneth Gonzales, and Gregory Phillips are awaiting confirmation and Sri Srinivasan, Ray Chen, and Jennifer Dorsey can be reported to the Senate today, without further delay. So long as there is a backlog of nominees before the Senate, the fault for failing to confirm these nominees lies solely with Senate Republicans.  The Judicial Conference recently released their judgeship recommendations. Based upon the caseloads of our Federal courts, the conference recommended the creation of 91 new judgeships. That is in addition to the 86 judgeships that are currently vacant. This means that the effective vacancy rate on the Federal bench is over 18 percent. A vacancy rate this high is harmful to the individuals and businesses that depend on our courts for speedy justice. The damage is even more acute in the busiest district courts, such as those in border States that have heavy immigration-related caseloads. In a Washington Post article about the CRS report, Jonathan Bernstein wrote: ``Ordinary people who just want to get their legal matters taken care of promptly have suffered because of all the vacancies on federal courts.'' I ask unanimous consent to have the article entitled ``New report confirms GOP obstructionism is unprecedented'' printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  Unneccessarily prolonged vacancies are not the only way that partisanship in Washington is hurting our courts. Sequestration continues to affect our justice system. The chief judge of the Fourth Circuit, William B. Traxler, Jr., has written: ``The impact of sequestration on the Judiciary is particularly harsh because the courts have no control over their workload. They must respond to all cases that are filed . . . .'' He went on to say:       [A] significant problem arises when budget cuts impact our      responsibilities under the Constitution. This happens when we      cannot afford to fulfill the Sixth Amendment right to      representation for indigents charged with crimes. The      predictable result is that criminal prosecutions will slow      and our legal system will not operate as efficiently. This      will cost us all in many different ways.  I share Chief Judge Traxler's concern, and I ask unanimous consent to have his statement printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Our Federal judiciary provides justice to 310 million Americans and gives full effect to the laws that we pass here in the Senate. We have a constitutional responsibility to those 310 million Americans to make sure that they can count on our Federal courts to provide justice. Federal courts should not be held hostage to partisan obstruction, and we need to keep our courts fully funded so that they can continue to meet the promise of timely justice that is embedded in our Constitution.  Shelly Dick is nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. Since 1994, she has been in private practice at the Law Offices of Shelly D. Dick, LLC, in Baton Rouge and was previously an associate with the law firm of Gary Field Landry and Dornier. Additionally, since 2008, she has served as an ad hoc hearing officer for the Louisiana Workforce Commission. Shelly Dick has the bipartisan support of her home State Senators, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Vitter, and was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 2months ago. She is one of the pending nominees who could have been expedited and confirmed last year. When confirmed, Shelly Dick will be the first woman to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.  Nelson Roman is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. He currently serves as an associate justice for the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. He previously served as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, Civil Term, Bronx County, as a judge for the New York City Civil Court, Bronx County, and as a judge of the housing part of the New York City Civil Court, Bronx County. Prior to becoming a judge, he was an assistant district attorney in Kings County, NY, as well as a special narcotics assistant district attorney in New York City. From 1995 to 1998, Justice Roman served as a law clerk to the Honorable Jose A. Padilla, Jr. of the New York County Civil Court. He has the support of his home State Senators, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Gillibrand, and was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 2 months ago.  Senate Republicans have a long way to go to match the record of cooperation on consensus nominees that Senate Democrats established during the Bush administration, but I hope that the confirmations so far this year indicate that they are finally reconsidering their wholesale obstruction of President Obama's nominees. After today's votes, 10 more judicial nominees remain pending, and all were reported with bipartisan support. All Senate Democrats are ready to vote on each of them to allow them to get to work for the American people. We can make real progress if Senate Republicans are willing to join us.  I ask unanimous consent that the article and statement to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 2013]        New Report Confirms GOP Obstructionism is Unprecedented                        (By Jonathan Bernstein)       The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has released      an important new report that details Barack Obama's record on      nominating judges during his first term. It's no surprise:      Republican obstruction against his selections was      unprecedented. For example:       ``President Obama is the only one of the five most recent      Presidents for whom, during his first term, both the average      and median waiting time from nomination to confirmation for      circuit and district court nominees was greater than half a      calendar year (i.e., more than 182 days).''       A quick look at the report's summary confirms that Obama's      nominees have been treated more roughly than those of      Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and the other Bush.       That's only half the story. George H.W. Bush had to deal      with an opposition party Senate for his entire first term,      and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had that during about      half of their first terms. It's at least plausibly legitimate      for opposite party Senators, when they have the majority, to      argue that they should have a larger role in filling judicial      vacancies, and to act accordingly. At the very least, if they      simply oppose some of those nominees, they will defeat them      in ``up or down'' votes.       But Obama, like Ronald Reagan, had a same-party Senate      majority during his first term. He should have had among the      best results over any recent president, all things being      equal.       What changed when Obama took office, however, was the      extension of the filibuster to cover every single nominee.      Republicans didn't always vote against cloture (or even      demand cloture votes), but they did demand 60 votes for every      nominee. That's brand new. It's true that Democrats      filibustered selected judicial nominations during the George      W. Bush presidency, but only at the circuit court level, and      not every single one.       That meant that despite solid Democratic majorities and      solid support from those Democrats, Obama's judicial approval      statistics are basically the worse of any of the recent      presidents. He doesn't show up last on every measure--for      example, George H.W. Bush had a lower percentage of district      court nominees confirmed--but he's fourth or fifth out of      five of these presidents on almost every way that CRS slices      the numbers, and it adds up to by far the most obstruction      faced by any recent president.       And remember: the losers here aren't just the president and      liberals who want to see his judges on the bench. Ordinary      people who just want to get their legal matters taken care of      promptly have suffered because of all the vacancies on      federal courts.       It's really a disgrace. Especially those picks that were      delayed for months, only to wind up getting confirmed by      unanimous votes. Especially the foot-dragging on district      court nominees. Just a disgrace.                                  ____   Statement of Chief Judge William B. Traxler, Jr., Chairman of the  Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States,                              April 19, 2013       1. The Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference is      responsible for developing a spending plan for the federal      Judiciary's annual Congressional appropriation. This process      involves significant input from Conference committees, and      under the best of circumstances, is a difficult and complex      task.       The current fiscal year presents unparalleled challenges.      Budget sequestration has reduced the Judiciary's overall      funding by nearly $350 million from the level provided in      Fiscal Year 2012. The impact of sequestration on the      Judiciary is particularly harsh because the courts have no      control over their workload. They must respond to all cases      that are filed, whether they are by individuals, businesses,      or the government.       In February 2013, the Executive Committee implemented a      series of emergency measures that were intended to mitigate      the impact of sequestration to the best extent possible.      Nevertheless, significant shortfalls remain.       Funds have been reduced for probation and pretrial      staffing, which means less deterrence, detection, and      supervision of released felons from prison. Related funding      for drug testing, drug treatment and mental health treatment      were cut by 20 percent. Money for security systems and      equipment has been cut 25 percent and court security officer      hours have been reduced. Cuts in court staffing and hours      threaten to impact public access and slow case processing.      National information technology upgrades to improve      infrastructure and financial management have been delayed.      Sequestration is impacting federal court operations and      programs throughout the country, including a $51 million      shortfall in the FY 2013 funds in the Defender Services      account.       The Judiciary is committed to doing its part to reduce the      fiscal deficit our country faces. However, a significant      problem arises when budget cuts impact our responsibilities      under the Constitution. This happens when we cannot afford to      fulfill the Sixth Amendment right to representation for      indigents charged with crimes. The predictable result is that      criminal prosecutions will slow and our legal system will not      operate as efficiently. This will cost us all in many      different ways.       With regard to the Defender account shortfall, at its April      16, 2013, meeting the Executive Committee examined all      aspects of this account, scrubbed expenses where possible,      and approved a final spending plan. After lengthy discussion,      the Committee determined to allocate the available funds in a      manner that, without further impacting payments to private      attorneys, will at least limit the number of days that any      defender organization staff must be furloughed. The result is      that some federal defender offices will still be forced to      furlough their employees up to 15 days. The Committee also      approved deferral of payments to private panel attorneys for      the last 15 business days of the fiscal year.       The defender program has no flexibility to absorb cuts of      this magnitude without impacting payments to private counsel      appointed under the Criminal Justice Act and Federal Defender      Organizations, which pay for government lawyers to provide      counsel to eligible defendants. Federal defender offices      already have fired and furloughed staff, as well as      drastically cut essential services. Criminal prosecutions      have been delayed because defender organizations do not have      the staff necessary to continue their representation of the      defendant or the funds to pay for experts or other cases      costs.       The Executive Committee's allocation of funds is not a      solution to the $51 million shortfall. It represents a      conscientious effort to mitigate the adverse impact on both      personnel and services. It also means that millions of      dollars in expenses in this account will be shifted to FY      2014, even though they were not part of the Judicial Branch      budget submission to Congress. This level of funding is      unsustainable without relief from Congress.       The Judiciary will soon ask the Office of Management and      Budget to transmit an FY 2013 emergency supplemental funding      request to Congress to help ameliorate the impact of the      sequestration cuts to defender services, probation and      pretrial services, court staffing, and court security.       In his 2012 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, the      Chief Justice said:       ``A significant and prolonged shortfall in judicial funding      would inevitably result in the delay or denial of justice for      the people the courts serve.''       I share this grave concern.
