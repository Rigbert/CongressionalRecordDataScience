But I can't think of a better way for us to establish a reasonable standard that debit cards, which are now becoming more common and are equivalent to a check, are going to be charged against the merchant that honors the card only in a reasonable and proportional way by the same agency we used under the consumer credit card reform bill of just last year.  I urge my colleagues, if they are listening to small businesses across America, struggling to survive, trying to add new employees, give them a helping hand by voting for the Durbin amendment so they can have reasonable charges for the use of credit cards and debit cards at their establishment. I urge the passage of this amendment and I yield the remainder of my time.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
