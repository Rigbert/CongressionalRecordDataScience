 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaties transmitted to the Senate on October 27, 2005, by the President of the United States: the Tax Convention with Bangladesh, Treaty Document No. 109-5; and the U.N. Convention Against Corruption, Treaty Document No. 109-6. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaties be considered as having been read the first time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's messages be printed in the Record.
