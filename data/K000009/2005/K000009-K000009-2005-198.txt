Speaker, I am pleased to recognize a milestone anniversary in the life of a school in our district. St. Francis de Sales Catholic High School is a college preparatory school operated by the Oblates of St. Francis which has been educating young men since 1955. On Sunday, September 18, 2005, the school, alumni, friends, and our community will celebrate the school's 50th anniversary.  St. Francis was the first college preparatory high school in Toledo and is well known for its academic excellence. Nearly all of its students go on to higher education. The school offers advanced placement courses so that more than half of graduating seniors complete their high school education with college course credit. As a result of this coursework, St. Francis has been named a College Board School.  In addition to academic excellence, the school fosters a spirit of involvement that encourages participation in extra-curricular activities. St. Francis boasts champion athletic teams as well as a wide array of clubs in addition to a fine music department. Religious instruction is required all four years and students can regularly be found volunteering their time and talents in service to our community.  Though the majority of students are Catholic, St. Francis' student body is comprised of students from all Christian faiths, Muslim and Jewish, Hindu, and all socio-economic backgrounds. This is a feature which makes the school uniquely different from others, and truly one of the school's strengths.  St. Francis de Sales, the gentleman saint, taught his flock ``The person who possesses Christian meekness, is affectionate and tender toward everyone; he is disposed to forgive and excuse the frailties of others; the goodness of his heart appears in a sweet affability that influences his words and actions, and presents every object to his view in the most charitable and pleasing light; he never admits in his discourse any harsh expression, much less any term that is haughty or rude. An amiable serenity is always painted on his countenance. . . .''  The school which bears his name in Ohio's Ninth District and which we today celebrate strives to imbue this same teaching in its students. It is echoed in the motto of the school: Suaviter et Fortiter, mildly and firmly.  Today we recognize over a half century of the spiritual, intellectual, and social guidance of thousands of young men, known in our community as the Knights of St. Francis de Sales. Godspeed, Knights! Onward to another 50 years of excellence.                          ____________________
