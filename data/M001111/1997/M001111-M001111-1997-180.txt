 President, I rise today with great sadness to commemorate the life of an outstanding individual from our State of Washington. Leslianne Shedd, a member of the United States Foreign Service Corps and a 1990 graduate of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, was killed when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in the Indian Ocean last November.  A resident of Washington State since the age of two, Leslianne graduated with honor from Puyallup High School in 1986. According to family and friends, Leslianne's lifelong dream was to tour the world. To achieve this goal, she learned four languages, traveled in Europe, Africa, North America, and Thailand, and pursued a career in Foreign Service.  Leslianne was traveling from her post at the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Nairobi, Kenya to celebrate Thanksgiving with friends when her plane was hijacked and then crashed. A commercial officer in the foreign service, she provided assistance to American companies doing business in the region. Before working in Ethiopia, she spent 2 years in the Ivory Coast in West Africa as a United States vice consul there.  It is no surprise that a young woman who touched so many lives around the globe has been described by her junior high English teacher as ``a little ray of light.'' Her life provides inspiration to all of us by serving as an example of a forward-looking, intellectually curious, and selfless individual.  My thoughts are with Leslianne's parents Bob and Mickey Shedd, her brother Darin and sister Corinne, her friends, and all those touched by her warmth and kindness. Her work and accomplishments remind us all of the importance of public service, international awareness, and generosity. Our Nation and our world are better places because of her. I am certain Leslianne Shedd's legacy of service will be remembered for years to come.                          ____________________
