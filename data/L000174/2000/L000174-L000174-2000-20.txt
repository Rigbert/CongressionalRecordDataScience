I like to see him back. I wish we were not still in session, but I suspect the Presiding Officer probably had things he might have planned to be doing during this time, as did my distinguished friend from Iowa.  My distinguished friend from Iowa and I have been here for numerous lame duck sessions. After 26 years here, I have yet to see what good was ever accomplished in one of these lame duck sessions. I think the statement made by my distinguished friend from Minnesota just now emphasizes the kind of mischief that sometimes happens in lame duck sessions, when people want to leave, yet we have, as in this case, abankruptcy bill that none of the Democrats had a chance, really, to do much about. It gets put in--what was it, I ask my friend from Minnesota, a bill on embassies?
