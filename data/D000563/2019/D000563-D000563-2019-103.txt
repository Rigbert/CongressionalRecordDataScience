President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2896       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Pullman National Historical      Park Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) in 1970, the Secretary of the Interior designated the      Pullman Historic District as a National Historic Landmark      District because of--       (A) the significance of the District to the labor history,      social history, architecture, and urban planning of the      United States; and       (B) the pivotal role of events in the District in creating      the first national Labor Day holiday in the world;       (2) between 1880 and 1884, George M. Pullman, owner of the      Pullman Palace Car Company, built the Pullman community,      which was envisioned by Pullman as an industrial town that      would provide employees with--       (A) a model community; and       (B) suitable living conditions;       (3) the town developed by George M. Pullman, which      consisted of over 1,000 buildings and homes, was awarded      ``The World's Most Perfect Town'' at the International      Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Exposition in 1896;       (4) the Pullman factory site is a true symbol of the      historic struggle in the United States to achieve fair labor      practices for the working class, with the original factory      serving as the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in      the United States;       (5) in the midst of economic depression in 1894, to protest      unsafe conditions and reductions in pay, Pullman factory      workers initiated a strike that--       (A) when taken up as a cause by the American Railway Union,      crippled the entire rail industry;       (B) continued even in the face of a Federal injunction and      a showdown between laborers and Federal troops that turned      violent and deadly; and       (C) set a national example for the ability of working      people in the United States to change the existing system in      favor of more just practices for protecting workers rights      and safety;       (6) following the deaths of a number of workers at the      hands of the United States military and United States      Marshals during the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted      to approve rush legislation that created a national Labor Day      holiday, which was signed into law by President Grover      Cleveland 6 days after the end of the strike;       (7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also played an important      role in African-American and early civil rights history      through the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of whom were      ex-slaves and employed in a heavily discriminatory      environment immediately following the Civil War;       (8) the Pullman porters, who served diligently between the      1870s and the 1960s, have been commended for--       (A) their level of service and attention to detail; and       (B) their contributions to the development of the African-     American middle class;       (9) the information, ideas, and commerce the Pullman      porters carried across the country while traveling on trains      helped to bring education and wealth to African-American      communities throughout the United States;       (10) the positive role of the Pullman porters in the      historical image of the first-class service that was made      available on Pullman cars is unmistakable;       (11) the Pullman community was the seminal home to the      Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which--       (A) was founded by civil rights pioneer A. Philip Randolph      in 1925;       (B) was the first African-American labor union with a      collective bargaining agreement;       (C) fought--       (i) against discrimination; and       (ii) in support of just labor practices; and       (D) helped lay the groundwork for what became the great      Civil Rights Movement of the 20th Century;       (12) the Pullman community is--       (A) a paramount illustration of the work of architect Solon      Spencer Beman;       (B) a well-preserved example of 19th Century community      planning, architecture, and landscape design; and       (C) comprised of a number of historic structures, including      the Administration Clock Tower Building, Hotel Florence,      Greenstone Church, Market Square, and hundreds of units of      rowhouses built for Pullman workers;       (13) the preservation of the Pullman site has been      threatened by--       (A) plans for demolition in 1960; and       (B) a fire in 1998, which damaged the iconic clock tower      and the rear erecting shops;       (14) the diligent efforts of community organizations,      foundations, nonprofit organizations, residents, the State,      and units of local government in the restoration and      preservation of the District after the 1998 fire were vital      to the protection of the Pullman site;       (15) due to the historic and architectural significance of      the District, the District is designated as--       (A) a registered National Historic Landmark District;       (B) an Illinois State Landmark; and       (C) a City of Chicago Landmark District; and       (16) the preservation, enhancement, economic, and tourism      potential and management of the important historic and      architectural resources of the Park requires cooperation and      partnerships from among local property owners, the Federal      Government, the State, units of local government, the private      and nonprofit sectors, and the more than 100 civic      organizations that have expressed support for community      preservation through the establishment of the Pullman      National Historical Park.
