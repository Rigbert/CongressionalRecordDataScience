Speaker, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros had a reason to lie to the FBI when he told them that he never gave his former mistress more than $10,000 a year unless he filed gift tax returns reporting higher payments. Federal tax law gives individuals a $10,000 annual exemption from gift taxes to a single donee, or $20,000 if the donor's spouse joins in the gift.  Secretary Cisneros ought to make public copies of all gift tax returns for years he gave his former mistress more than $10,000. If he fails to do so, the Attorney General should broaden her request for an independent counsel to look into possible tax law violations by Cisneros.                          ____________________
