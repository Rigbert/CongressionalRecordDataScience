Speaker, with this estate tax bill, the Republican leadership would light the fuse of a fiscal time bomb that would go off in 2011.  As The Washington Post said this morning, the slow fuse makes the proposal seem affordable; nearly cost-free, in fact, because only the cost of the first 10 years of any legislation is estimated.                              {time}  1400  But we all know the real costs of this bill do not start showing up until 2011. There is no need for us to jeopardize our fiscal future, Mr. Speaker. A great majority of Members on both sides of the aisle support a reduction in the estate tax. Bill Clinton would have signed a compromise estate tax bill covering 99.5 percent of all the estates in America. The tone may have changed but the substance has not. ``Do it my way or no way.''  The Democratic alternative would give us relief now. It immediately would raise the estate tax exclusion to $4 million for couples and would gradually raise that to $5 million. In 1999, that would have exempted more than three-quarters of all the estates that incurred any tax liability. I am not talking about all the estates. Of any estate that incurred a tax liability. And it would cost a fiscally responsible $40 billion. But the Republican leadership has rejected bipartisan compromise once again.  It is at least consistent. Instead, the GOP's great tax gurus have proposed a bill that would cost $193 billion over the next decade while concealing its true cost. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that if complete repeal took effect today, the real cost of this legislation would be $660 billion over the next 10 years. The majority will not admit that, of course. It would be an explicit admission that the President's $1.6 trillion tax plan actually will cost closer to $3 trillion. The real danger to our country and to our people is that the cost of the legislation will be borne at the worst possible time, just as the baby boomers begin to retire and become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. With our uncertain projected budget surpluses, is that fiscally responsible to do? I think not.  Let us provide immediate relief for small business owners, for farmers, and let us defuse the fiscal time bomb before it threatens to blow a hole in our budget.  Mr. Speaker, we can do something real for 99.5 percent of the taxpayers. Yes, their bill will continue the old song, ``The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but in the meantime don't we Congressmen and Congresswomen have fun?''
