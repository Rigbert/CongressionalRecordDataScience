Chairman, I think we should pay our fair share.  My father was born in Copenhagen. I visited Bosnia some years ago. There were 985 Danish troops in Bosnia. That was more troops per capita than any other Nation on Earth. Obviously, they were not the largest contingent that was there, but in terms of the commitment they were making it was, relatively speaking, the largest.  The United States continues, obviously, to make the most significant contribution in many areas of the U.N., relatively speaking, not only to our wealth and our capabilities but also relative to the consequences that will occur if the U.N. peacekeeping efforts are not successful.  In other words, the investment we are making in keeping the peace frankly is not only saving us money, it is also saving us risk at putting additional assets deployed in those areas. So I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and increase to the President's level.
