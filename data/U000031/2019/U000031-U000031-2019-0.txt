 I thank the Democratic leadership for, I think the first time this year, allowing our side to actually have a substitute to a major piece of legislation. And I thank our leadership, because that substitute is not a partisan substitute but, rather, a bipartisan substitute. In fact, every single provision in this bill has got strong bipartisan support, which was packaged together.  Tomorrow will mark the third anniversary of President Obama's signing of 21st Century Cures, a bill that Diana DeGette and I helped shepherd through our committee on a unanimous vote, and we passed here in the House 392-26.  21st Century Cures increased NIH funding by some $45 billion over a 10-year span. It sped up the approval of drugs and devices, and just after 3 years we have seen the number of cell, gene, and nucleoid therapies have more than doubled. In fact, research this last year will actually exceed $13 billion. The FDA is predicted to approve as many as 20 gene therapy drugs by the year 2025. That is wonderful news.  We all want to do something about drug prices, and that is what a vote for our substitute, H.R. 19, will do. The President will sign that bill, but he is not going to sign this bill, H.R. 3, because it is going to slow down the ability to find the cures that we want to find for these awful diseases.  Now, those aren't my words. That is the CBO, a nonpartisan group, it is the CEA, the Council of Economic Advisers.  But in today's ``Wall Street Journal,'' the former director of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, writes, ``This week the House will vote on legislation known as H.R. 3. The price-control approach would increase uncertainty and reduce returns from biotech investment, raising the cost of capital for these invaluable endeavors.'' He is right on. We want to find new cures. We want to find new technologies and to use those. We want precision medicine.  Madam Chair, I include the ``Price Controls Would Stifle Biotech Innovation'' in the Record.             Price Controls Would Stifle Biotech Innovation       A House price-control bill would do the most damage to      transformative and lifesaving medications.                   (By Scott Gottlieb, Dec. 11, 2019)       Victoria Gray of Mississippi recently became the first U.S.      patient with a genetic disorder to be treated using the      Crispr gene-editing technique. Doctors used a novel drug to      overwrite the function of a faulty gene that gave rise to her      sickle-cell disease. Advances in life science can define this      century, but policy makers must resist the urge to adopt      policies that impose price controls and punish drugmakers for      taking risks.       The convergence of information technology and biology      allows scientists to translate the human genome into digital      data that can accelerate diagnoses and cures. Over the next      decade, it is a near certainty that we will have gene-therapy      cures for deadly inherited disorders such as muscular      dystrophy. Cell-based and regenerative medicine can restore      human functions lost to disease, including returning some      sight to the blind. Gene editing will be used to alter DNA to      erase the origins of a range of debilitating inherited      disorders.       These are only some of the opportunities at hand. Yet bad      policies could sap the risk-taking that brings forth the most      important innovations. For instance, the Lower Drug Costs Now      Act would expose the 250 costliest drugs to government price      controls. The high-cost drugs lawmakers target are often the      most innovative and potentially transformative new      medications. This week the House will vote on the      legislation, known as H.R. 3.       The price-control approach would increase uncertainty and      reduce returns from biotech investment, raising the cost of      capital for these invaluable endeavors. It would alter      incentives and shift money from the most speculative but      highest-value science, including regenerative medicine and      gene editing. Money would flow instead to known disease areas      and well-characterized targets, using proven approaches such      as pill-form drugs.       New and high-risk drug platforms like gene therapies are      often targeted first to treat rare and serious conditions;      after they are proven to work safely, they will be used to      treat morecommon maladies, such as heart disease. This is how      medicine advances. But if investors knew their returns would      be capped, they would direct their investments toward safer      projects with lesser payoffs. We would still get new drugs,      but the treatments would be very different.       Fifteen years ago, the standard refrain from drug-industry      critics was that all the big drugmakers did was develop ``me      too'' medicines--the seventh version of a blood-pressure pill      or a cholesterol-lowering statin. In response, the federal      government took steps, some of which shaped Medicare Part D,      to encourage investment in ``specialty'' drugs that were more      novel.       Since then, investment capital has shifted sharply. Cancer      and rare diseases receive substantially more attention and      resources. The number of cell, gene and nucleotide therapies      in development has more than doubled over the past three      years, while total investment in cell and gene therapies      eclipsed $13 billion last year.       The Food and Drug Administration approved four gene      therapies in only the past three years, with 800 similar      kinds of products in various stages of development. An      assessment of the current pipeline and historical rates of      success in clinical trials suggests that by 2025 the FDA will      be approving 10 to 20 gene-therapy drugs a year. Progress     is especially strong in oncology. The number of cancer drugs      in development has quadrupled since 1996.       These specialty drugs often aren't cheap. They target      narrow conditions for which the cost of risk-taking and drug      development is amortized over a smaller number of eligible      patients. Highly novel drug platforms can also cost more      initially to perfect. Based on my informal survey of      companies, enrolling a single patient in a clinical trial for      a gene-altering drug often costs between $500,000 and      $700,000 and can reach as high as $1 million.       To support this innovation, total spending on research and      development by the 15 biggest drugmakers topped $100 billion      in 2018, up 32 percent in the past five years. A cancer cure,      or a gene-therapy remedy, can sharply reduce the lifetime      cost of treating a debilitating disease. It can dramatically      alter the length and productivity of people's lives. But      high-cost treatments are pricing out a growing number of      underinsured patients, keeping them from using medications      that could alter their providence. This is unacceptable.       There are ways to make specialty drugs more affordable      without eroding the incentives that drive capital into the      riskiest but most promising endeavors. One is to help second-     to-market drugs get through the regulatory process.       Once an effective drug is approved to treat a deadly      condition, introducing a second drug to treat the same      disease can be hard. It's tough to recruit patients with a      debilitating disease for a clinical trial when a proven      medicine is already available. Moreover, the smaller pool of      patients who will be newly diagnosed each year with the same      disease isn't always large enough to support the cost of      developing a second drug, reducing competition that can lower      pnces.       We offer first-to-market breakthrough drugs an efficient      route through FDA review. We could give second-to-market      competing medicines the same regulatory benefits. Further,      when the biology of a drug target is very well understood,      and the basis for how it interacts with a disease firmly      established, we can create a new regulatory designation to      streamline development of a competing drug and shift data      collection to real-world, post-approval settings.       Many drugs targeted by H.R. 3 for government price controls      are examples of the innovation we should try to encourage. In      fact, they are the investments that critics who griped about      me-too medicines said they wanted. Now the same crowd is      crafting policies that would shift investment back into the      more mundane endeavors they once lamented.
