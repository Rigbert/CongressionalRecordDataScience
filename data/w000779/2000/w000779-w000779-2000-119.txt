I recall in the campaign with my friend and colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, to succeed former Senator Packwood--we are from a small State as well, a little bigger than Nevada--Senator Smith and I, between us, went through pretty close to $10 million in about 5 months.  Before the minority whip leaves the floor, I want to tell him I so appreciate him speaking out on this issue.  Certainly in Europe, for example, they are doing some of the things the distinguished minority whip is talking about: shortening the election cycle trying to generate interest in the elections because the campaign is over a short period of time. I think we can do that in this country and require, for example, that the campaign funds be disclosed online, which many of our colleagues have proposed on both sides of the aisle.  I want the Senator to know, before he leaves the floor, I very much appreciate his leadership in speaking out on this campaign finance issue, because we saw in Oregon much of what the Senator saw in Nevada.
