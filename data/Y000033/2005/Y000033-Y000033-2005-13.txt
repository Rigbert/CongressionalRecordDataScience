Mr. Speaker, reluctantly I stand here and oppose this legislation, primarily because we did earmark some money last year for programs, and now we are just cutting them off period, no prewarning, no salaries, no billing rent, no heat, nothing, just kicking them out. I do not think that is the right thing to do.  If you had grandfathered those programs in, I believe it would be a lot better. I would like to ask the gentleman from Ohio, do you save any money or does the money just go back into the other programs that your committee decided ought to get funding?
