 It is incomprehensible. Here we have technologies that are incredibly successful. They are producing substantial amounts of energy, without pollution, without greenhouse gases. They are creating jobs. Of course, we should continue these tax credits, these extenders to make sure these industries can flourish.  Some people may think when Senator Udall and I talk about wind and solar, we are talking about some kind of fringe idea. Let's be clear; in the State of Texas today they are producing 10,000 megawatts of electricity through wind. That is the equivalent of 10 average-sized nuclear powerplants. That is not insignificant. In Iowa, as I understand it, about 20 percent of the electricity in that State is generated from wind.  So we are in the beginning, in the first stages of a real revolution to transform our energy system to clean, safe energy which, in the process, can create, over a period of years, millions of good-paying jobs.  So I would certainly agree with the Senator from New Mexico.
