 President, I have been very disturbed by the recent press reports detailing the President's willingness to pardon Susan McDougal and possibly other former business partners and friends who have been convicted of defrauding the government.  The President's public willingness to suggest that a pardon may be forthcoming, at a time when Susan McDougal is facing contempt charges by a lawfully empaneled grand jury for not responding to questions about the role and truthfulness of the President himself, undermines our judicial system and seriously questions his ability to fulfill his obligation to see that ``the laws be faithfully executed.''  As you will recall, Mr. President, Susan McDougal was convicted on several felony counts of defrauding the government. She was tried and convicted by a jury of her peers in Little Rock, Arkansas and sentenced to 2 years in prison for her crimes.  While the President may not be pleased with the results of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's, investigation, including the conviction of many of his friends and former associates, it is outrageous for the President to now allege prosecutorial misconduct on behalf of Mr. Starr. At the request of Attorney General Reno, a three judge panel appointed an Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, to investigate fully any violation of Federal law relating in any way to James B. McDouglal's, President William Jefferson Clinton's or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital Management Services, Inc.  Mr. President, the President's recent statements raise serious questions about his intent to interfere with, and possibly undermine, the Independent Counsel's ongoing investigation into these matters.  Today, Senator Bond and I are submitting a concurrent resolution that would express the Sense of the Congress that the President should disavow any intent of issuing presidential pardons to James and Susan McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker and reaffirm one of the basic tenets of our American system of justice that no one is above the law.                          ____________________
