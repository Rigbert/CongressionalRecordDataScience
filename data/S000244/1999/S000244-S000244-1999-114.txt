We gave them a draft of the bill. Before it was introduced there were 13 separate changes made to the text of the bill at the request of the minority, as has been the policy of this chairman of the Committee on Science, to try and narrow some issues and to be as bipartisan as possible and where there is a disagreement, to be able to fight those out and to debate the issue on the merits.                              {time}  1130  Now we did not call anybody any names during the committee markup or afterwards, and it wrecks the bipartisan nature of dealing with NASA and supporting NASA when I pick up the Washington Post this morning and see the Vice President's spokesman calling the majority party a bunch of dinosaurs because we have a disagreement over the Triana program. Our priority is to put money that my colleagues want to go into Triana into medical research, and that was the amendment that was adopted when the Committee on Science marked this bill up. This may be a legitimate disagreement where we think we should put more money into medical research and less into Triana.  But dealing with the budget, and that is what an authorization bill is, is dealing with priorities. I will lay my priorities against my colleague's priorities, the gentleman from Tennessee, but he ought to tell his former senator and his spokesman that when we have got a disagreement in priorities let us not devolve into name calling.
