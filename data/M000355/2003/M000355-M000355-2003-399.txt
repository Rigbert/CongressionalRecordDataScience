 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 tomorrow morning. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., with the first half of that time controlled by the Democratic leader or his designee, and the second half of the time under the control of Senator Hutchison or her designee. I further ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m., the Senate begin consideration of the conference report to accompany S. 3 as under the earlier consent. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party conferences to meet. I further ask unanimous consent that following the vote on the conference report to accompany S. 3, the Senate resume debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1751.
