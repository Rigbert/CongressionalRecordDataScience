Speaker, we must dedicate our efforts within the first 100 days of the 105th Congress to passing comprehensive campaign finance and foreign lobbying reform legislation.  The events of the last election, with the worsening situation of foreign influence and the continuing flood of campaign contributions and expenditures, compel us to act. Now is the time.  Just as in past Congresses, I am once again introducing legislation calling for a constitutional amendment authorizing Congress and the States to set reasonable expenditure limits for elections to Federal and State office. It is simply wrong to equate campaign money with free speech. The only way to limit the exorbitant levels of money being spent on campaigns is through a constitutional amendment.  In addition, I'm proposing once again legislation to stop foreign contributions and influence, as was witnessed in the closing weeks of the elections. My bill creates a clearinghouse of political activities information within the F.E.C.  Finally, we must end the revolving door between Government service and lobbying for foreign interests. My ``Foreign Agents Compulsory Ethics in Trade Act'' measure will impose a lifetime ban on high-level Government officials from representing, aiding or advising foreign governments and foreign political parties. The act also imposes a 5-year prohibition on representing, aiding or advising foreign interests--including commercial interests--before the Government of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, we should make it our goal to adopt these reforms within the first 100 days of the 105th Congress.                          ____________________
