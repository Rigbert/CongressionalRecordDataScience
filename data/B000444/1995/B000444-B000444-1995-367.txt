 President, I thank the Senator from Maine. The Senator from Maine has a reputation in this [[Page S7840]] body of being one of the most thoughtful, and when he speaks in debates, unlike the Senator from Delaware, a most measured Senator, and one whose career has been marked by observable high points of principle. And this is, I detect, from his speech, a principled issue here. This is an important issue. This is not one where we should, quite frankly, be guided by the legitimate but sometimes not fully articulated concerns of our constituents.  I believe what our constituents want is what the Senator from Maine has outlined. I doubt whether there is a man or woman in America who thinks that Hurricane Carter should not be free today. I doubt whether there are any people in America today who would have been happy had this been the law and had he been denied the opportunity to make that final plea in Federal Court.  Yet, if we amend the law along the lines of the Biden amendment, which Senator Cohen supports, we would have drastically cut down frivolous appeals and drastically cut down successful appeals. As a matter of fact, there is no difference in the time limitation for filing an appeal and the number of successive appeals that are allowed between what Senator Hatch wants and what we want. The big difference in what the Senator from Maine and I are saying is the standard the court is able to apply when the Federal court looks at, as Professor Monaghan states, those mixed questions of fact and law. This would essentially not allow them to look at fact, just theoretically the law.  So what I propose to do is precisely what Professor Monaghan, who is not a fan of habeas corpus, wants done. Let us be real clear right from the start here what we are arguing about and what we are not arguing about. Again, as my old buddy Sid Balick, says, ``keep your eye on the ball.'' What are we arguing about and what are we not arguing about? We are not arguing about whether or not to speed up the process of habeas corpus review, and we are not arguing about reducing the current abuses in the system.  I agree with my Republican colleagues from Utah and Pennsylvania that we have to have a strict statute of limitations and a strict limit on successive petitions. Put another way, how many times after that first one, or under what circumstance, can you file another petition if you are able to at all. Nothing I am trying to do today, nothing in my amendment would change what the Republicans propose for speeding things up or cutting down on abuses. They have a 6-month statute of limitations in their bill. I am not trying to make that 9 months or 1 year or 2 years. I am not proposing to change a single word in the statute of limitations. As this chart up here shows, in the Biden amendment the time limits for filing a petition are the same as in the Specter-Hatch provision. We both set limits on time.  Nothing in my amendment, nothing at all, would change what the Republicans propose for speeding things up or for cutting down on abuses.  The Republicans have a new strict limit on successive petitions in their bill. Many of my liberal friends think these restrictions are excessive. I do not. I have not attempted to change a word. I have not attempted to change a word on their bill relating to successive petitions. Not a period, not a comma of their proposal is changed by my amendment.  Put another way, at the end of the day, or the end of today, even if I were to win everything I am asking for, the statutory right of habeas corpus will be drastically altered from what it is today. No longer will we see a guy filing petition after petition. No longer will my friend from Utah, my distinguished friend from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, my friend from Pennsylvania, my new friend and colleague from Oklahoma, be able to put up on a board or reference cases which are real and exist today where someone has sat, after having been convicted for a capital offense, on death row for 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 16, or 19 years. That will not be possible if we adopt my amendment.  Now, usually, the Senator from Utah has a chart out here listing the number of petitions in several cases. I am not making light of that. When he brings out that chart, if he does in his response, I want everyone to look at it and understand that if the Biden amendment passes, that would be the end of charts like that.  There would no longer be an ability for a convicted prisoner, convicted of a capital offense, to be able to file those successive petitions and delay for the number of years the charts have always shown.  I also point out that we will still have the problem of irresponsible State courts who do not read briefs, who do not take the time to follow through. I cannot affect that, nor can they. At a Federal level, we will have eliminated the ability to have those successive petitions.  So let the Senate be clear on what we are not arguing about. What we are arguing about is whether we should dismantle the habeas corpus process by dramatically restricting the Federal power of the Federal courts to decide whether a State court got it wrong, whether a State court wrongly convicted a person, whether a State court is wrongly sending a person to death. That is what we will be changing.  That is where I part company with my Republican friends. I want to fix the problem. They want to do away with the right. I want to get a habeas corpus petitioner in and out of Federal court quickly. I do not want to make it practically impossible for him to get into Federal court. I want to say you get in, and you must get in quickly, and you can only get in under certain circumstances, and you are out. The Republicans want to slam the door of the Federal courthouse closed.  I know there are a lot of things about Federal overreaching, but one thing I do not think most Americans--whether they are liberal or conservative, whether they are moderate, whether they are Republican or Democrat--I do not think they believe that is a remedy, to slam the Federal courthouse door. They do not want it swinging off its hinges, but they do not want it slammed shut.  What I propose is--to be able to use this silly metaphor--to be able to open the door once, walk through the door, and say, ``Federal judges, experts on the Federal Constitution, listen to my plea. Make a decision. If you decide against me, I'm out, but listen to it.''  As the Senator said, the lawyer for Hurricane Carter, and I suspect everyone else would agree he would be a man in jail the rest of his life were that door slammed shut, had it been slammed shut in the way I believe this present bill does.  So that is what we are arguing about.                           Amendment No. 1224   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to deleting the rule of                       deference for habeas corpus)
