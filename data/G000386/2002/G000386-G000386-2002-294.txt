 President, I want to say a few words about James E. Gritzner, who was approved by the Senate last night to serve as United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. I am pleased that the Senate was able to move swiftly on this judicial nomination. Jim Gritzner has extensive trial experience and is fully qualified to serve on the District Court. His reputation for being fair and evenhanded is something we expect of all judges, and he will be a great addition to the Southern District of Iowa.  By way of background for my colleagues, Mr. Gritzner received a Bachelors of Arts degree from Dakota Wesleyan University, a Masters of Arts degree from the University of Northern Iowa, and a law degree from Drake University Law School. His distinguished legal career includes having practiced with several Iowa law firms, most recently with the Des Moines, Iowa firm of Neymaster, Goode, Voights, West, Hansell & O'Brien.  In addition to being in private practice for over 20 years, Mr. Gritzner has had a long record of public service. He served as a member of the Iowa Board of Parole from 1980 to 1982. From 1985 to 1990, Mr. Gritzner was the primary prosecutor for the Committee on Professional Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association and the Client Security and Attorney Disciplinary Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court.  I am sure everyone would agree that these are excellent qualifications. Jim Gritzner will serve the Federal bench very well, and I am proud to have supported his nomination to the Southern District of Iowa.                          ____________________
