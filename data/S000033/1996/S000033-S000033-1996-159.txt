 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Jackie Frazier, Kate Greanon, Kay Gerson, Drew McNaughton, Kate McQuillen, Jennifer Arner, Lucas D'Amico, and Charley Hart, high school students from Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       For the record, my name is Jackie Frazier, this is Kay      Gerson, Kate McQuillen, and Drew McNaughton. Our discussion      is actually, ``Overcrowding, or Budget [Problems] and      Education.''       (Alternating speakers): We've been asked to directly      discuss problems that arise within our school, and our      students participating in school for seven years--being in a      high school--and the problem that most prominently arises for      us was the overcrowding problem in our school. What all of      you may not know, is that we have 5 districts that come to      our school, and we also have people that are paying tuition      to come here. As most schools are having a problem with      budget now, unless they live--earlier, someone was discussing      how in . . . a resort town, they have more money to put into      a school system. We have 5 towns, and this school was      actually built at one time to support around 750 students; at      this point in time, we have close to 910 people, which is not      that much over, but each year we are increasing. Two years      ago, we had a class of about 80 students, my class is about      130, the upcoming class of 7th grade next year will have      around 170; I think it's a substantial increase each year.       If you were to look at a town in your report, you'll see      that each year we are increasing drastically in the number of      students, but we don't have the budget to increase either      space or more teachers. Sometimes we have to actually hold      classes in this auditorium, over on the side here, and in the      small media room upstairs, which is normally held for just      movies. Each year as the budget stays the same, and the      capacity stays the same, the students go up; and what we'd      like to discuss, and we have a movie to show you, is that      each year when the amount of students do go up, the actual      grade of the school goes down in standard: in the way we      survive, in the air we breathe, and in the rooms that      populate. Sometimes the student ratio is 30 students to one      teacher, when ideally it's 20:1. So, each time that we do      this, we want to show you how it looks, in reality.       Can everyone hear me? (narrating as video is shown): Due to      the reduced janitorial staff over the past few years, and      increased student population we see an overall depreciation      of the physical condition of the school. There is no      classroom space available; this American History class uses a      corner of the auditorium as a makeshift classroom for one      period each day. One of our stairwells . . . This was . . .      one of the Junior High classrooms, and . . . you can see,      there are many classrooms in the school which have a severe      overcrowding problem. A high school classroom, with a ratio      of about 30:1.       All right, so that was a video to show visually what's the      matter with it. Now, I want to talk about what the funds are      directed towards, instead of building maintenance. By 1997,      the future budget is planning on increasing itself by      $617,000, and $409,940 of which is going to Special Ed.      programs. I think if Special Ed. is increasing itself by 85%,      and while all of this is going on, U-32 High School is going      rapidly down. We already mentioned the American History      class, and how it's held over there; but there's also a      Spanish class upstairs that has 30 students in it, and the      rooms about as big as about a third of this stage. We're all      cramped together in it--it decreases individualized . . .      one-on-one help with a teacher, so they fall behind, and they      can't catch up. The ventilation problem in the school, you've      probably already noticed; so when one student gets sick, the      whole student body gets sick. So I think on a national scale,      U-32 is the representation of the problem, in that . . .      we're supposed to be a world power, and I don't think our      schools should be run this way. It's a bad way to represent      our country.                          ____________________
