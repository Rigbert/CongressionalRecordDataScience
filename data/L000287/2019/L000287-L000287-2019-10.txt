Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3151, the Taxpayer First Act. Mr. Speaker, this is not a Republican or a Democratic bill. It is an American one.  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady, the Oversight Subcommittee Ranking Member Kelly, and all the Members who joined us on this bill.  I would also like to recognize Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden and their staff who were our Senate partners on this necessary effort. In particular, I would like to thank our staff for their hard, great, and good work.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the process and the product. The record must be clear: Members of the House and Senate spent many years researching ideas to help taxpayers. The Oversight Subcommittee held 14 hearings and roundtables. We reached out to taxpayers and stakeholders. We have asked questions and listened to the responses. We asked Democratic and Republican Members to provide feedback. We even opened a public comment period on the draft bill. We came together. We studied, we listened, and we respected the taxpayer.  Mr. Speaker, this has not been easy. We worked hard to correct misinformation that this bill would tie the hands of the IRS and hurt taxpayers' options. During a time when there is so much tension and rush to judgment, our coalition remained thoughtful and fair.  After the House passed this legislation earlier this year, new information came out, and I am proud that we came together and requested an investigation and the IRS responded quickly and took action.  Mr. Speaker, despite every single challenge, we remained committed to bipartisanship and to the American taxpayer.  I want to share a few examples of the good this bill does. The Taxpayer First Act authorizes $30 million in matching grants for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program which helps low- and moderate-income taxpayers complete and file their taxes. This bill also protects certain low-income taxpayers from the private debt collection program. In addition, some of the most popular parts of the bill include new initiatives to protect and serve taxpayers who are victims of identity theft.  Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act serves as an example of a good and thoughtful policy that Congress can produce. We took our time. We studied, and we stayed the course. We refused to give up, and we refused to give in. Mr. Speaker, this bill should be an inspiration to us all.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Taxpayer First Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2019.     Hon. Nita M. Lowey,     Chairwoman, Committee on Appropriations,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Lowey: Thank you for consulting with the      Committee on Ways and Means on provisions of H.R. 3151, the      Taxpayer First Act, for which the Committee on Appropriations      has a jurisdictional interest. I appreciate your agreement to      not pursue a sequential referral or assert any point of order      so that the legislation may proceed expeditiously to the      House floor.       The Committee on Ways and Means confirms our mutual      understanding that your Committee does not waive any      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or      similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation      moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues      within your Committee's jurisdiction.       I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the      bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this      legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you      on this measure and future legislation.           Sincerely,                                                  Richard E. Neal,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2019.     Hon. Richard Neal,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of          Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing with respect to H.R. 3151,      the ``Taxpayer First Act of 2019.'' As a result of your      having consulted with us on provisions on which the Committee      on Appropriations has a jurisdictional interest, I will not      request a sequential referral on this measure, an opportunity      to raise a point of order under clause 4 of rule XXI of the      Rules of the House, or further amendment to the bill when it      is considered on the House floor.       The Committee on Appropriations takes this action with the      mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction      over the subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation, we do not agree to future suspension or waivers      of the House rule restricting the carrying of appropriations      in measures and amendments thereto, and the Committee will be      appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or other      legislation carrying appropriations moves forward so that we      may address any issues within our jurisdiction and provisions      giving rise to a point of order--regardless of whether a      measure is similar to legislation passed by the House in a      previous Congress, or represents the product of negotiation      between parties or chambers.       The Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment      of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation, and request      your support for such a request.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 3151.           Sincerely,                                                    Nita M. Lowey,     Chairwoman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2019.     Hon. Maxine Waters,     Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 3151, Taxpayer First Act. As you know, the bill was      referred primarily to the Committee on Ways and Means, with      an additional referral to the Committee on Financial      Services.       I thank you for agreeing to waive consideration of      provisions that fall within your Committee's Rule X      jurisdiction. The Committee on Ways and Means confirms our      mutual understanding that your Committee does not waive any      jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or      similar legislation, and your Committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation      moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues      within your Committee's jurisdiction.       I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in      the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the      bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this      legislation and look forward to continuing to     work with you as this measure moves through the legislative      process.           Sincerely,                                                  Richard E. Neal,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                              Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2019.     Hon. Richard E. Neal,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3151, the      ``Taxpayers First Act of 2019.'' Because you have been      working with the Committee on Financial Services concerning      provisions in the bill that fall within our Rule X      jurisdiction, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the      bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.       The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to      forego formal consideration of H.R. 3151 with our mutual      understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.      3151 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and      that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and      involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our      Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an      appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation and request      your support for any such request.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the      Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 3151.           Sincerely,                                                    Maxine Waters,                                                       Chairwoman.
