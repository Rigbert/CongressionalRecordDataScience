 President, I will respond to what I know firsthand. I can only speak firsthand to the White House. It is my understanding, and it has been asserted to me, that there have been discussions with senior Republicans--I assume that that was shared by everybody, with both the speaker and with Mr. Delay, and that they had signed on to this. But I will respectfully suggest that I yield to Senator Santorum, who may be able to give you a more direct answer. I personally, for the record, have not spoken with anybody in the House of Representatives.
