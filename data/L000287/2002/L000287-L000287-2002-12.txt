Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), for yielding me this time.  This evening, I rise in strong opposition to raising the debt limit.                              {time}  1930  The Republicans are trying to sneak in a provision that increases the debt ceiling without a full, fair, open and honest debate. Apparently the other side, the majority party, are hiding something. What are they hiding? What is the great secret?  The American people deserve to know that the funds for a debt limit increase will come directly from the Social Security trust fund. We need to protect Social Security and ensure that we meet our obligations today. Instead, the majority party, the Republicans, are stealing from the Social Security trust fund and increasing our national debt every chance they get. For the next 10 years, we will increase the debt by more than $300 billion. Something is wrong with that.  This party, the Republicans, are mortgaging the future of our children. They are ripping away the safety for our Nation's seniors. Increasing the debt limit is like increasing the credit limit on your credit card. What does this do? It just puts you in a deeper and deeper hole. That is what the Republicans are doing. So do not be fooled. They are putting us in deeper debt and it is their obligation to get us out of it. We should not spend Social Security on anything other than Social Security. American families work hard to pay into a system that they should be able to count on when they retire. Social Security is a sacred trust, a sacred covenant between the American people and our government. We must never, never, ever take away the security out of Social Security. Let us keep our promise to the American people.
