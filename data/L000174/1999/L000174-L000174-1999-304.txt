 If they take that attitude using this bill as a shield, it only makes Y2K computer problems worse next year instead of fixing them this year. The best defense against any Y2K lawsuit is to be Y2K compliant in 1999, not waiting for a problem to happen and in the year 2000 say: Oh, wait a minute, they took care of us in the Congress; too bad, we're home free.  That is why I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. That is why I taped a Y2K public service announcement in my home state. That is why I cosponsored Senator Bond and Senator Kerry's new law, the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act,'' to create SBA loans for small businesses to eliminate their Y2K computer problems now. That is why I introduced, with Senator Dodd as the lead cosponsor, the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act,'' S. 962, to offer new tax incentives for purchasing Y2K compliant hardware and software.  These real measures will avoid future Y2K lawsuits by encouraging Y2K compliance now.  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to pass into law a consensus bill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator Dodd, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K compliance.  The new law, enacted less than nine months ago, is working to encourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test results. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact balanced and narrow legislation to deter frivolous Y2K litigation while encouraging responsible Y2K compliance.  Unlike last year's Y2K information sharing law, this conference report is not narrow or balanced. Instead it is an justified wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation.  The coming of the millennium should not be an excuse for cutting off the rights of those who will be harmed. It should not be an excuse for turning our States' civil justice system upside down. It should not be an excuse for immunizing those who recklessly disregard the coming problem to the detriment of American consumers.                               Exhibit 1                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                 Office of Policy Development,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1999.     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,     President, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to clarify the Justice      Department's views on the McCain-Wyden bill, S. 96, as      amended by Senator Dodd's April 28 proposal. We appreciate      the efforts of Senator Dodd to improve S. 96. Nevertheless,      Senator Dodd's amendments do not cure many of the defects      that prompted the Department to oppose S. 96, and the      Department continues to oppose the bill, even with Senator      Dodd's amendments. The Department, however, understands that      Senators Kerry and Robb are working on an amendment in the      nature of a substitute that addresses our primary concerns      and which we can support.       The Administration has, all along, advocated Y2K      legislation as long is it serves three important goals: (i)      giving companies every incentive to become Y2K compliant;      (ii) encouraging resolution of Y2K problems without resort to      litigation; and (iii) deterring frivolous Y2K lawsuits      without deterring legitimate Y2K claims. We are convinced,      however, that the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill does not achieve      these goals. In fact, that bill may significantly undermine      two of them. Because the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal modifies      tort and contract law so as to reduce the liability of      potential Y2K defendants, it reduces the incentive for      potential defendants to avert Y2K failures. In a similar      fashion, we do not believe that modifying the rules of      liability that apply to meritorious tort and contract actions      will deter frivolous Y2K claims, which by definition will be      filed regardless of the rules of liability. Instead, the      modifications in this McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill seem more likely      to curtail legitimate Y2K lawsuits.       I will now outline briefly some of the Department's major      concerns with the McCain-Wyden-Dodd version of S. 96.                            coverage issues       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal would apply to Y2K lawsuits      brought by consumers and to private securities actions.      McCain-Wyden-Dodd contains a number of provisions that make      it more difficult for plaintiffs to assert and recover on      their Y2K claims--they must provide more extensive notice to      all defendants, satisfy higher pleading requirements, and may      even then be denied their economic losses and punitive      damages. Although these restrictions may be appropriate as      applied to businesses with greater financial and other      resources, imposing these heavier burdens is likely to erect      insuperable obstacles for plaintiffs who are consumers.       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal also applies to private      securities actions, even though such actions are already      governed by the comprehensive provisions of the Private      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities      Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. Considerable time      and effort was spent in designing those two laws as a means      of barring meritless claims but allowing the filing of      legitimate claims. In the absence of any evidence that this      legislation was ineffective at achieving these purposes,      there would appear to be no need to upset the careful balance      it achieved by applying the sweeping reforms of McCain-Wyden-     Dodd to litigation already covered by that prior legislation.                        class action provisions       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal creates federal jurisdiction      over any Y2K class action where more than one million dollars      is at issue. With this low threshold, this proposal allows      most Y2K class actions brought in state court, even those      based solely on state law, to be moved to federal court,      where they would be analyzed under federal standards. Class      action claims that could have been brought under state law      would have to be dismissed unless they also satisfy those      federal standards. Not only would this result in the      dismissal of claims that might have succeeded under state      law, but it would also usurp the ability of state      legislatures to define the relief available to their      citizens.        provisions modifying state tort law affecting y2k claims       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal substantially rewrites state      tort law as applied to Y2K claims. Section 13, for example,      freezes in time many aspects of the state law governing      resolution of Y2K tort claims as it existed on January 1,      1999, thereby preventing the States from enacting any reforms      to their tort law, even reforms that apply generally to all      tort claims. Other sections of McCain-Wyden-Dodd      significantly curtail the damages Y2K plaintiffs may recover      for their injuries. Most dramatically, section 12 bars      recovery of economic losses in all tort suits not involving      personal injury or property damage, including fraud and      misrepresentation suits where the only damages are economic      losses. This is not simply a codification of existing state      law rules; section 12 establishes a new--and much broader--     restriction for the recovery of these damages. Finally,      section 5 of McCain-Wyden-Dodd usurps state law regarding      recovery of damages with a rule of proportionate liability      for all Y2K defendants, no matter how much they might have      contributed to the plaintiff's injuries.       Because of the concerns I have outlined, the Department      remains opposed to S. 96, even as modified by Senator Dodd's      proposed amendments.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that      from the perspective of the Administration's program, there      is no objection to the submission of this letter.           Sincerely,                                           Eleanor D. Acheson,                                       Assistant Attorney General,                                       U.S. Department of Justice.
