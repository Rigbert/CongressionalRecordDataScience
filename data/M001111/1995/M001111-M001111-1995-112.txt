 The Senate has passed its own balanced budget resolution, and recently passed the conference report. The cuts in this rescissions bill are paltry by comparison. And the timber salvage provisions go too far without adequate safeguards and public participation.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary, harmful bill.

The numbers represent job losses or      gains in the lumber, wood manufacturing, paper and allied      industries.       The net gain in timber jobs since the 1992 elections for      these eight western states is 14,251 jobs. There is no need      for salvage sufficiency language.                                                                    ____            [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 1995]                    Clinton's Veto the Right Action       President Clinton has done the right thing in vetoing a      bill that made the wrong cuts in the budget and left too much      leeway for cheating in salvage timber sales in the Northwest.       The president said it's wrong to cut education programs but      to fund members of Congress' pet pork-barrel projects such as      roads. The bill cut $16.4 billion from previously approved      social programs.       ``We must recognize that the only deficit in this country      is not the budget deficit. There's a deficit in this country      in the number of drug-free children. There's a deficit . . .      in the number of safe schools. There's an education      deficit,'' he said in wielding the pen for his first veto.       It took perhaps even more courage for the president to set      himself up for cheap-shot charges by Northwest Republican      lawmakers that he is anti-job because he insists that the      nation's forests be harvested under rule of law. But there      are sure to be further attempts to circumvent proper      practices, and Clinton should stand tall against them.       The bill, using poorly defined criteria, would have given      the timber industry three penalty-free years to remove      ``damaged'' trees that pose a fire threat. The trees would      have been removed without the benefit of the standard      environmental safeguards that are meant to protect salmon      streams and watersheds, and citizens would have been legally      barred from filing suit to object to any violation of      environmentally sound harvesting no matter how gross.       The salvage program must get under way, and Congress is      perfectly capable of passing legislation that provides for      responsible removal of trees that pose a fire hazard without      abandong environmental safeguards.       But by sending the White House an irresponsible proposal      for timber salvage, Congress has thrown away valuable time      and risked further fire losses in the Northwest woods.       Members of this state's delegation should have insisted on      using their time to prepare an acceptable plan for this      summer's fire season rather than in devising a political      booby-trap for the president.                                                                    ____                          Logging Bill Flawed       A case can be made for salvage logging of some federal      forest lands that have a dangerous accumulation of dead or      diseased trees that pose a fire hazard.       But a case cannot be made for the sweeping salvage-logging      proposal now under consideration in Congress that sets aside      environmental safeguards and promises to raid the treasury      for the benefit of private timber companies.       The overly broad language of the bill renders it      unacceptable; more important, existing law makes it      unnecessary.       The bill arbitrarily mandates a doubling of the amount of      timber to be felled over the next two years from federal      lands, whether or not that much timber needs to be salvaged,      and thus opens the door for a giveaway of public property.       That's because it cleverly stipulates that no so-called      ``health management activities'' directed by the legislation      shall be precluded simply because they cost more than the      revenues derived from sale of the salvaged timber.       And the bill says that any environmental review, however      cursory it may be, ``shall be deemed to have satisfied the      law.''       Sponsors wrongly imply that the bill is needed to permit      the Forest Service to conduct salvage logging. But Sierra      Club attorney Todd True notes, ``Existing law already gives      the agency authority'' for whatever salvage logging it deems      necessary due to threat of fire and insect infestations.       Last summer's huge, costly fires in Eastern Washington      forests provided clear evidence of the folly of the Forest      Service's past policy of suppressing natural wildfires. It      bears noting that the agency followed that practice partly to protect      adjoining commercial timberlands.       If Congress doesn't gut the Forest Service's budget for      environmental impact studies, those important reviews can be      done in a timely manner and permit defensible salvage-logging      operations.                                                                    ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 22, 1995]   The Logger's Ax: No Wild Swings--Clinton Should Hold Firm Against                     Amendment That Threatens Forests       In the early days of his presidency, Bill Clinton      productively approached the volatile issue of forest      management by breaking with the tired ``jobs versus owls''      rhetoric of past years. Through his 1993 Forest Summit he      showed he understood both the need to preserve dwindling      federal forests and the painful dislocations that new limits      on logging would cause. He led by talking with all sides and      instituting programs to retrain displaced workers. But now,      locked in battle with congressional Republicans, Clinton      seems to be in danger of abandoning that principled approach.       Last month he rightly vetoed a congressional recisions bill      that was loaded with special-interest riders. One of them,      the deceptive ``Emergency Two-Year Salvage Timber Sale      Program,'' in essence would have ordered the U.S. Forest      Service to sell as much as 3.2 billion board feet of      ``salvage'' timber from national forests. It would have      allowed logging of trees killed by windstorms, fire, insects      or disease and permitted selective thinning of forests to      control forest fires. The legislation, pushed hard by timber      companies, also would have forced the Forest Service to sell      twice as many trees as it felt appropriate. Further, these      sales would have been exempt from environmental review and      public comment. Worst of all, the language was so vague that      virtually any tree, living or dead, standing or fallen, could      have been defined as ``salvage,'' even the dwindling stands      of old-growth redwoods in California's national forests. For      these reasons Clinton should stick to his guns as Republicans      seek to include this nasty amendment in a compromise      recisions package. The President reportedly is considering      accepting it.       Even the staid Sunset Magazine highlights a special report      entitled ``The Crisis in Our Forests'' in its current issue.      Sunset doubts that stepped-up salvage operations would      markedly improve forest health or prevent the spread of      wildfires.       The salvage amendment has nothing to do with cutting      wasteful government spending but everything to do with      wasteful cutting. The President must hold firm--the amendment      must go.                                                                    ____                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 1995]                             Chopping Block       It isn't just spending that would be cut by the bills the      House and Senate passed a month ago rescinding appropriations      for the current fiscal year. A fair amount of timber would      likely be cut, too--cut down, that is. Each version of the      bill includes a rider aimed at sharply increasing the timber      harvest this year and next in the federal forests.       If the riders did no more than urge an increase in the      harvest or order that the harvest be as large as possible      under the law, that would be fair enough. There's always a      great dispute about the amount of timber that can best be      taken from the national forests and other public lands. The      total the past few years has been well below the level to      which the industry became accustomed in the 1970s and 1980s.      The timber lobby says the cut should be increased--it argues      among much else that there is currently an enormous amount of      dead and dying timber in the forest that will otherwise go to      waste--and the new majority in Congress agrees.       But the riders don't stop there. To make sure that no      obstacles in the form of conservation laws, environmental      groups and courts can stand in the way, they also take the      extraordinary step of suspending for the purpose of this      ``salvage timber sale'' the entire array of federal forest      management and environmental statutes that might otherwise      apply. Timbering undertaken under terms of the riders ``shall      be deemed to satisfy'' such laws no matter what their      requirements, the riders say. The House version also seeks to      overcome any existing court orders that might interfere with      the sale; it says the sale can be conducted despite them.       The industry says the reason for all this is not just that      it wants to increase the cut and has a receptive Congress but      that an emergency exists in the forests. Because they are so      overgrown, there's a greatly increased danger of fire, and      their health has declined in other ways that a stepped-up      salvage operation will help to cure--so say the supporters.      They add that without suspension of the laws, environmental      groups will go to court and block the necessary actions.       Opponents of the riders, including the administration, say      the necessary salvage cutting can go on without suspension of      the laws--a lot of salvage cutting occurs every year      already--and that suspension would only be a license to log      where otherwise the companies could not, in ways that would      leave the forests less healthy, not more.       The opponents make the more plausible case. This is grabby      legislation. If there is a genuine need to increase salvage      and other such operations in the forests, even to increase      them rapidly, surely that can be done without abandoning the      entire framework of supporting law. Likewise, if Congress      wants to change the law with regard to management of the      forests, it ought to do so in the normal way, not tack a      decision of such importance on the back of a supplemental      appropriations bill. The measure is shortly to go to      conference; the conferees should cut the budget, not the      trees.                                                                    ____                  [From the Denver Post, May 8, 1995]                    Clinton Should Veto Timber Bill       President Bill Clinton should veto a timber measure because      the proposal is bad environmental policy and a shoddy way to      make federal law.       The timber proposal is buried in a larger measure that      deals with trimming federal spending. Clinton compromised      with Senate Republicans to make the rescissions bill, as the      main measure is called, less draconian than the first version      adopted by the U.S. House.       However, the larger bill has been burdened with a bunch of      special-interests, anti-environmental provisions. The worst      would let logging companies cut an enormous amount of extra      timber from the national forests. Gluing such harvesting      proposals onto an already complex and controversial measure      is a deceitful way to mold federal law, so they all should be      removed from the bill.       Actually, the Senate would have stripped the timbering      portions from the measure weeks ago, except Ben Nighthorse      Campbell, Colorado's junior U.S. senator, deserted his      moderate environmental leanings and voted to keep the logging      provisions in the main bill. Coloradans who had hoped      Campbell would remain an independent voice even after he      changed from a Democrat into a Republican were sorely      disappointed by his partisan performance on this matter.       There are ways to cut timber, including methods to salvage      lumber from dead or dying trees, without severely damaging      the forests. But this measure is especially troubling because      it tosses aside most environmental considerations the Forest      Service usually weighs before deciding how much logging to      allow.       When the rescissions bill lands on Clinton's desk, the      President should veto it because of the timber and other      environmental provisions. When Congress votes whether to      override the veto, Campbell this time should side with common      sense instead of letting his new partisan allies dictate his      behavior.                                                                    ____ Shift in U.S. Timber Policy Puts Forests, Fish and Wildlife at Risk--            Congress moves too fast, with too little thought       The pendulum in the nation's timber policy is swinging too      fast and too wide.       The public has become accustomed--dazed may be the correct      term--to the daily headlines of sharply revised public policy      on welfare, immigration, food programs and more.       But the sudden shift in federal timber policy is more than      even the most blase citizen may be able to accept.       The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee has followed the      House's lead in opening big areas of our national forests to      harvesting without the normal regulations to protect fish,      wildlife and the environment and without allowing the public      to bring legal challenges.       The committee-passed proposal directs the forest service to      set aside existing environmental laws. Although the original      intent of the legislation was to speed up the salvage of dead      and dying timber, this measure may go beyond that. It gives      sole discretion to the Forest Service to harvest wherever it      wants. Only designated wilderness areas are off-limits.       No one can be sure what forests and what areas might be      subject to harvesting--or how carefully it would be done.       The public will not stand by and watch the years of      protecting our forests against environmental damage be wiped      out in a spurt of action by a Congress that has so many pro-     harvest allies in its midst.       Our forests can be harvested without damage to our      environment. But doing so requires more scientific and      technical thought than Congress appears willing to devote.      The final protection against abuse is the legal system. If      that access also is prohibited, then all of us should worry.       Citizens should demand that Congress slow down and remember      its stewardship duties to the public land.       Narrowly focused salvage harvesting is acceptable.      Abandoning our traditions of environmental protection and      legal accountability is not.
