 As our country prepares to go to war against terrorism, this is not the time to be taking urgently needed national defense legislation hostage.  Protecting our Nation's energy infrastructure from attacks may well need to be part of our national defense strategy. But there is not one single provision in the energy legislation that some want to graft onto the defense bill that will in any way help protect our energy facilities from attack.  In fact, one of the bills that some are claiming is urgently needed for our energy security would actually undermine the security of our oil supply--by allowing Alaskan oil to be exported overseas.  While the House energy bill would restrict exporting of oil from the Arctic refuge, a Senate version of that bill would allow that same oil--that some are claiming we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--to be exported overseas. Those who claim we need to address energy policy as part of the defense bill can't even seem to agree whether we need to restrict Alaskan oil exports in order to increase our energy security.
