I wish to offer the theory--not exactly a radical one, in my view--that if we can't pass bills with respect to mass surveillance or have hearings, we at least ought to have a vote so that the American people can actually determine if their Senators support authorizing unprecedented, sweeping government hacking without a single hearing. There is a lot more debate in this body over the tax treatment of race horses than massive expansion of surveillance authority.  In a moment, I will ask unanimous consent that the body move to an immediate rollcall vote on the Stalling Mass Damaging Hacking Act which would delay rule 41 changes until March 31. I don't condone Congress kicking cans down the road. This is one example of where, with a short delay, it would be possible to have at least one hearing in both bodies so that Congress would have a chance to debate a very significant change in our hacking policy.  Congress has not weighed, considered, amended, or acted like anything resembling an elected legislature on this issue. There have been some who have looked into the issue, but--I call it Senate 101--we should at least have a hearing on a topic with enormous potential consequences for millions of Americans. That had not been done, despite a bipartisan bill being introduced in the House and the Senate, days after the changes were approved. Lawmakers and the public ought to know more about a novel, complicated, and controversial topic, and they would be in a position to have that information if there was a hearing and Members of both sides of the aisle could ask important questions.  Since the Senate has not had a hearing on this issue, lawmakers have still been trying to get answers to important questions. Twenty-three elected representatives from the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans spanning the philosophical spectrum, have asked substantive questions that the Department of Justice has failed to answer, and they barely went through the motions. They spectacularly failed to respond to both concerns of Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and in the House.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter that was sent to the DOJ, signed by myself and 22 bipartisan colleagues from the House and Senate, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2016.     Hon. Loretta Lynch,     U.S. Attorney General,     Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Lynch: We write to request      information regarding the Department of Justice's proposed      amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal      Procedure. These amendments were approved by the Supreme      Court and transmitted to Congress pursuant to the Rules      Enabling Act on April 30, 2016. Absent congressional action      the amendments will take effect on December 1, 2016.       The proposed amendments to Rule 41 have the potential to      significantly expand the Department's ability to obtain a      warrant to engage in ``remote access,'' or hacking of      computers and other electronic devices. We are concerned      about the full scope of the new authority that would be      provided to the Department of Justice. We believe that      Congress--and the American public--must better understand the      Department's need for the proposed amendments, how the      Department intends to use its proposed new powers, and the      potential consequences to our digital security before these      rules go into effect. In light of the limited time for      congressional consideration of the proposed amendments, we      request that you provide us with the following information      two weeks after your receipt of this letter.       1. How would the government prevent ``forum shopping''      under the proposed amendments? The proposed amendments would      allow prosecutors to seek a warrant in any district ``where      activities related to a crime may have occurred.'' Will the      Department issue guidance to prosecutors on how this should      be interpreted?       2. We are concerned that the deployment of software to      search for and possibly disable a botnet may have unintended      consequences on internet-connected devices, from smartphones      to medical devices. Please describe the testing that is      conducted on the viability of `network investigative      techniques' (``NITs'') to safely search devices such as      phones, tablets, hospital information systems, and internet-     connected video monitoring systems.       3. Will law enforcement use authority under the proposed      amendments to disable or otherwise render inoperable software      that is damaging or has damaged a protected device? In other      words, will network investigative techniques be used to      ``clean'' infected devices, including devices that belong to      innocent Americans? Has the Department ever attempted to      ``clean'' infected computers in the past? If so, under what      legal authority?       4. What methods will the Department use to notify users and      owners of devices that have been searched, particularly in      potential cases where tens of thousands of devices are      searched?       5. How will the Department maintain proper chain of custody      when analyzing or removing evidence from a suspect's device?      Please describe how the Department intends to address      technical issues such as fluctuations of internet speed and      limitations on the ability to securely transfer data.       6. Please describe any differences in legal requirements      between obtaining a warrant for a physical search versus      obtaining a warrant for a remote electronic search. In      particular, and if applicable, please describe how the      principle of probable cause may be used to justify the remote      search of tens of thousands of devices. Is it sufficient      probable cause for a search that a device merely be      ``damaged'' and connected to a crime?       7. If the Department were to search devices belonging to      innocent Americans to combat a complicated computer crime,      please describe what procedures the Department would use to      protect the private information of victims and prevent      further damage to accessed devices.           Sincerely,         Ron Wyden; Patrick Leahy; Tammy Baldwin; Christopher A.            Coons; Ted Poe; John Conyers, Jr.; Justin Amash; Jason            Chaffetz; Steve Daines; Al Franken; Mazie K. Hirono;            Mike Lee; Jon Tester; Elizabeth Warren; Martin            Heinrich; Judy Chu; Steve Cohen; Suzan DelBene; Louie            Gohmert; Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson; Ted W. Lieu; Zoe            Lofgren; Jerrold Nadler.
