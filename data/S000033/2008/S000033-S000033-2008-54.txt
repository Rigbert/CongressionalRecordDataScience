 President, I would just concur, if I might, with the fine words of Senator Reid. I have not known Senator Warner all that long, but clearly he is what a Senator should be. He is thoughtful, intelligent, and respectful of other points of view. While he and I may not agree on every issue, I have appreciated working with him, and I applaud him for his service to this country.
