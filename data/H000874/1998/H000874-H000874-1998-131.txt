Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman and I have discussed this. I am pleased that the chairman is going to accept this amendment.  I want to congratulate the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) who has talked to both the chairman and myself, worked very closely with us. This obviously is a problem. We need to ensure that the records of veterans which are critical for health care purposes, retirement purposes, all sorts of other purposes, are in fact retrieved in a timely fashion. That is not now happening.  The good news is not only that the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) has brought this to our attention, obviously communicated with the veterans' organizations throughout this country and energized them and focused them on how we can solve this problem, but also that Governor Carlin, who is the administrator, relatively new, recognizes that the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is absolutely correct. This is a problem that needs to be solved, and they are initiating and pursuing that objective.  So I want to congratulate the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) for this initiative. It is a positive one, and I am pleased to join the chairman in supporting it.
