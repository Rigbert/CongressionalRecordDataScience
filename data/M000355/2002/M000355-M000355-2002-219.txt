 President, the vote was not a good sign. It was almost totally a partisan vote on a bill we had been advancing on a bipartisan basis. We had long and difficult negotiations across party lines to achieve the core agreement that was represented by the bill that was brought up by the majority leader.  The vote that was just taken, should that amendment ultimately be successful, strips out one of the core principles of the bill.  So I am not terribly optimistic, I must say, about the future of this bill. Maybe something can be worked out, but this was certainly a dramatic step in the wrong direction.  I know the Senator from Missouri seeks recognition. I yield the floor.
