 The memo was passed up his chain in response to investigators on my staff talking to him about Operation Fast and Furious. He accurately described the problems with Fast and Furious. What he said was consistent with the claims I had already heard from other whistleblowers. Information such as this is why I was skeptical days later when the Department sent its February 4 letter to me, denying the allegations. In other words, I had proof they were lying to us.  The agent wrote in the memo about being ordered by a Fast and Furiouscase agent to hold back in their surveillance, so that they did not ``burn the operation.''  While watching straw purchasers hand off weapons to traffickers--violating the laws of this country but encouraged to do it by their own Justice Department--the case agent ``told all the agents to leave the immediate area.''  While a crime was being committed the agent said to the agents to leave the area immediately. The memo explicitly says:       The transaction between the suspects took place and the      vehicle that took possession of the firearms eventually left      the area without agents following it.  A crime is committed, U.S. agents there let them move on.  After the phone call to my staff, the ATF agent's supervisor requested that he write this memo documenting what he had told my investigators. This passed up the chain all the way to the ATF leadership. We know that because there are e-mails attaching the memo sent to senior headquarter officials. However, the Justice Department has refused to provide copies of those e-mails and will only allow them to be reviewed at Justice Department headquarters.  The Department has also refused to provide a copy of this memo. My staff had to obtain it from confidential sources.  One of the questions yet to be answered is who in the Justice Department saw the memo and when. Either way, once the Justice Department got hold of it they tried to keep it under wraps by refusing to give me a copy. They made my staff go to the Justice Department to view it, even though the entire memo simply recounts information that was already provided to my staff. It is embarrassing to the Department because it shows that the truth was easily knowable before the false denial was sent to Congress on February 4. If they had asked for firsthand documentation such as this memo when they first got my letter in January, we would not be where we are today.  The second point these documents establish is that main Justice had problems of its own. It was not all the fault of the ATF or the U.S. attorney. Mr. Breuer's deputy, Deputy Attorney General Jason Weinstein, participated in drafting a false statement. The Justice Department's February 4 letter read:       ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been      purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to      Mexico.  Documents show that line originated in a phone conversation, February 1, 2011, between Justice Department legislative affairs assistant director Billy Hoover from ATF and Jason Weinstein from main Justice's criminal division.  Like Assistant Attorney General Breuer, Mr. Weinstein knew that ATF had let hundreds of weapons walk in Operation Wide Receiver, which was an earlier, smaller scale case than Fast and Furious. In fact, in April 2010, he brought that fact to the attention of Mr. Breuer, his boss. April 2010 is 8 months before I got involved in this investigation. His e-mail to Mr. Breuer about Wide Receiver said:       As you'll recall from Jim's briefing, ATF let a bunch of      guns walk in efforts to get upstream conspirators but only      got straws, and didn't recover many guns. Some were recovered      in [Mexico] after being used in crimes.  It is ironic that is how Mr. Weinstein described Wide Receiver. He was one of the officials who authorized wiretaps in Fast and Furious. Therefore, he was in a position to know that exact same description applied to Fast and Furious. Yet he allowed the myth to be perpetrated that ATF would never do such a thing. Mr. Weinstein saw the Justice Department's very first draft of the letter to Congress. In fact, as one of his Justice Department colleagues in the Deputy Attorney General's office said, ``CRM,'' which happens to be the criminal division, and OLA, which is the Office of Legislative Affairs--``CRM and OLA basically drafted it.''  Mr. Weinstein knew the letter contained a blatantly false line. Yet he did nothing to correct it and that line thus remained in every successive draft of the letter.  On December 2 this year, the Justice Department's latest spin was that its statement that ``ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons'' was ``aspirational.'' Nevertheless, that did not stop them from withdrawing the letter for inaccuracies. Perhaps the ``aspirational'' language should be saved for mission statements. Responses to specific and serious allegations ought to, in a commonsense way, stick to the facts, right? This was an oversight letter. I was not asking for some ``feel good'' fuzzy message about what ATF aspired to. I was asking for simple facts.  A U.S. Border Patrol agent had died, and at the scene of his death were two guns from Fast and Furious. So his death was connected to the ATF operation. Whistleblowers were reaching outside of the chain of command because supervisors would not listen. Instead of treating these allegations with the kind of seriousness they deserved, the Justice Department resorted to damage control.  I do not know what else my investigation is going to uncover, but we are going to pursue it until we get to the end of it because my goal is to find out who at the highest level of government, in Justice or the White House, approved this, and get them fired; make sure that the Terry family gets all of the information about the death of their son--to this point they have had hardly anything--and, No. 3, to make sure a stupid program like walking guns, Fast and Furious, et cetera, never happens again.  This week the investigation revealed that shortly after the February 4 letter, Lanny Breuer asked Mr. Weinstein to write up an analytical memo of Fast and Furious. This suggests that Mr. Breuer and his deputy Mr. Weinstein were down in the weeds on Operation Fast and Furious a lot earlier than previously admitted. Mr. Weinstein was in an excellent position to write such a memo, since Mr. Breuer has acknowledged that Mr. Weinstein was one of the individuals who approved wiretaps in the summer of 2010 as part of Operation Fast and Furious. However, we had to learn of this memo from sources not from the Justice Department but from outside of the Justice Department. The Justice Department has not provided it to us, even though it is clearly responsive to a House Oversight Government Reform Committee October 25 subpoena.  This type of maneuvering is what got the Justice Department in trouble to begin with. The Justice Department should produce this document immediately, along with all the other responsive documents.  This investigation will continue. People must be held accountable. The Justice Department must stop stonewalling today.                               Exhibit 1         U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,            Firearms and Explosives,                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2011.     Memorandum To: Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Field Division     Thru: Resident Agent in Charge, Lubbock Field Office     From: Gary M. Styers, Special Agent, Lubbock Field Office     Subject: Contact with Congressional Investigators       On February 2, 2011, at approximately 1500 hours, ATF      Special Agent Gary Styers was contacted telephonically by      Robert Donovan and Brian Downey, representing United States      Senator Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee.      Downey and Donovan after identifying themselves asked Special      Agent Styers if he would be willing to answer some questions      regarding the time Special Agent Styers spent on a detail to      the Phoenix Field Division, Phoenix Group VII Office. Special      Agent Styers said he would be willing to answer questions to      the best of his knowledge.       Special Agent Styers was asked if he was familiar with the      large firearms trafficking case in Phoenix Group VII and      Special Agent Styers said he was. Downey and Donovan asked if      Special Agent Styers knew the name of the case and he      responded that it was ``Fast and Furious.'' Downey and      Donovan then asked if Special Agent Styers knew who the case      agent was and Special Agent Styers said it was Special Agent      Hope McAllister. Special Agent Styers was also asked who the      supervisor of the group was and Special Agent Styers said it      was Group Supervisor David Voth. Downey and Donovan also      asked who helped Special Agent McAllister, Special Agent      Styers said that Special Agent McAllister had a Co-Case Agent      from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as an      agent from Group VII. Downey and Donovan asked who was the      Agent from ICE and Special Agent Styers told them it was Lane      France.       Downey and Donovan asked Special Agent Styers if he knew      what the agents were assigned to do on the investigation.      Special Agent Styers explained that a group of agents were      assigned to the case and that since the case was in the stage      of an active     wiretap, some agents were working within the group and      Special Agent Styers was then asked about his general      impression of the Fast and Furious case. Special Agent Styers      stated that the case had systematically divided and isolated      agents from the group. The case agent had solicited the      advice of numerous experienced agents, including Special      Agent Styers, regarding how to conduct and end the wiretap      operations and case overall. Special Agent Styers gave the      case agent his honest opinion and advice since Special Agent      Styers had worked two wiretap investigations in his career.      Special Agent Styers felt that his advice and opinions, as      well as other agents' advice and opinions were widely      disregarded. Along with other agents within the group,      Special Agent Styers explained that he was no longer asked to      assist with Fast and Furious and concentrated on his assigned      cases and provided necessary assistance to fellow agents      within the detail and group.       Downey and Donovan asked Special Agent Styers what he felt      was incorrect about the way the Fast and Furious case was      conducted. Special Agent Styers explained that first and      foremost, it is unheard of to have an active wiretap      investigation without full time dedicated surveillance units      on the ground. Special Agent Styers relayed that no agents in      the group were assigned to surveillance on the Fast and      Furious case. Special Agent Styers said that other agencies      or task force officers may have been used to conduct      surveillance and respond to calls of FFLs, but it seemed that      either the case agent or Group Supervisor would poll the      office for agents who were available to respond at short      notice.       Secondly, Special Agent Styers said that it appeared odd to      have a majority of ATF Agents working on a wiretap      investigation, who had never worked such a case. Especially,      when numerous, permanent Group VII agents and detailers had      previous wiretap experience.       Special Agent Styers was provided with contact information      for Downey and Donovan and the conversation was ended.      Special Agent Styers contacted the Lubbock Resident Agent in      Charge, Jim Luera at 1545 hours after the conversation with      Downey and Donovan ended, to inform him of the contact.      Special Agent Styers was later asked to document the      conversation herein and attempted to do so to the fullest      extent possible.           Respectfully,                                                   Gary M. Styers.
