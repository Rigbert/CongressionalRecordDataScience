President, I will start by reading a paragraph, but it is not from an environmental magazine or a political magazine or from a liberal magazine. It is from BusinessWeek, published in their most recent online edition of June 20, entitled ``Energy; Ignoring the Obvious Fix.'' I will read this paragraph because it describes where we are at this moment in time:       As Congress puts the final touches on a massive new energy      bill, lawmakers are about to blow it. That's because the      bill, which they hope to pass by the end of July, almost      certainly won't include the one policy initiative that could      seriously reduce America's dependence on foreign oil: A      government-mandated increase in the average fuel economy of      new cars, SUVs, light trucks and vans.  That is BusinessWeek.
