President, I bring to the attention of Senators the troubling reality in Iraq that is described in two recent Government reports, one by the Government Accountability Office and the other by the Office of the SpecialInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.  Documented in these reports are assessments of the precarious and deteriorating security situation on the ground, which has dramatically slowed the pace of reconstruction and resulted in significant additional costs. This picture is in stark contrast to the rhetoric coming from the administration that we are in the last throes of the insurgency and that reconstruction is moving forward at a rapid pace.  The reality is that because of the security problems in Iraq, the results of reconstruction are falling far short of what the administration optimistically predicted and what we were told to expect. While there has been important progress in building schools and hospitals and providing clean drinking water in some areas, exorbitant security costs are forcing the scale back or cancellation of reconstruction projects. Unfortunately, there is little reason to be optimistic that the situation will improve in the short term.  According to today's Washington Post, the GAO reported that ``in March, the U.S. Agency for International Development canceled two electric power generation programs to provide $15 million in additional security elsewhere. On another project to rehabilitate electric substations, the Army Corps of Engineers decided that securing 14 of the 23 facilities would be too expensive and limited the entire project to nine stations. And in February, USAID added $33 million to cover higher security costs on one project, which left it short of money to pay for construction oversight, quality assurance and administrative costs.''  Furthermore, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reported that after reviewing several reconstruction contracts, it determined that more money was going to Government contractors involved in the rebuilding process than was necessary. The formula used for disbursing special monetary awards, which are above and beyond basic fees, was producing excessively high awards. In some instances, contractors were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars despite not winning a contract or delivering a single service. Once again, these reports shed light on the lack of oversight and accountability given to contracts in Iraq.  Given the enormous amount of money the United States is spending in Iraq, the many reports of waste and profiteering by unscrupulous contractors, and the President's request for additional hundreds of millions of dollars for Iraq reconstruction in the fiscal year 2006 budget, it is incumbent on the administration to respond to these reports in a forthright manner so that Congress can make informed decisions about the use of these funds.                          ____________________
