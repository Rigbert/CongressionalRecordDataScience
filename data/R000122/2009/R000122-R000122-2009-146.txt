President, very briefly, this amendment would enhance and increase funding for the LIHEAP program. It is a program that is absolutely essential as we see energy prices begin to creep up again. When it hits again next winter, we will need these funds. When heating costs increase this summer in the Southwest and Southeast, we will need these funds.  I am proud to join Senator Snowe in supporting this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it when it comes up for a vote.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
