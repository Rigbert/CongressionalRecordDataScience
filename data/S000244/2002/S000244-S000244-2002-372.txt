 Madam Speaker, since September 11, we have learned how deeply vulnerable our immigration system is to exploitation by aliens who wish to harm Americans. H.R. 3525 makes needed changes to our immigration laws to fight terrorism and to prevent such exploitation. I wish to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Gekas), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, for his invaluable assistance in crafting this legislation.  This is the third time that the House has considered the main provisions of this bill. We first passed H.R. 3525 last December, and then we incorporated the provisions of the bill into H.R. 1885, which passed in March. Now that we have the other body's cooperation, I can safely say that the third time is a charm and that President Bush will sign this bill into law shortly after we vote on it today.  I will briefly mention two of the bill's most significant provisions. Most importantly, it requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to issue machine readable, tamper proof visas that use standardized biometric identifiers. H.R. 3525 extends the same biometric identifier requirements to passports from visa waiver program countries.                              {time}  1800  While I preferred the House language requiring such enhanced visas to be issued as of October 2003, the amended Senate date of October 2004 is acceptable.  Second, building upon the enhanced data-sharing requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the bill directs our law enforcement agencies and intelligence community to share information with the State Department and the INS relevant to the admissibility and deportability of aliens. This information will be made available in an electronic database.  Madam Speaker, this is important and long overdue legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
