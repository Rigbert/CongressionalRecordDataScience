 We can do both. The presumption in this bill is that we can and we are going to be able to do that in the conference committee.  Since the amendment reflects the position of what we in the Senate previously had anticipated doing anyway, Members ought to vote for the amendment. I will vote for it.  Yesterday afternoon, I took time to respond to Senator Harkin's statement that we have an AMT problem to a significant degree because of what the Finance Committee did in the 2001 tax bill. Importantly, he fails to recognize that we have addressed the problem for 2001 to 2005. And, now, we are trying to do the same thing for 2006--to make sure that the AMT problem is not worsened.  To the extent that Senator Harkin suggests, like others who have looked at this issue, that the Bush tax cuts are responsible for the AMT problem, I respond in this way. Most who have reached that conclusion have done so by misusing data provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, to distort the record on this issue. Additional analysis will demonstrate that conclusion to be erroneous. To the contrary, the analysis suggests an alternative explanation for the AMT problem--Congress's failure to index the AMT for inflation over the past 35 years.  Senator Harkin suggests that the Bush tax cuts are responsible for the AMT problem. The conclusion is reached in error because it is based on faulty logic. Those who have done similar analyses have based their conclusions on the mistaken assumption that a reduction in Federal receipts should be interpreted as percentage causation of the AMT problem. JCT was asked to project Federal AMT revenue if the Bush tax cuts were extended, but the current-law hold-harmless provision was not extended--$1.139 trillion--and Federal AMT revenue if neither the Bush tax cuts nor the hold-harmless provision is extended--$400 billion. From that data, some erroneously concluded and publicly represented that the Bush tax cuts are responsible for 65 percent of the AMT problem--$1.139 trillion minus $400 billion divided by $1.139 trillion--and conversely, that the Bush tax cuts tripled the size of the AMT problem--$1.139 trillion divided by $400 billion.  The logic used to reach that conclusion is flawed. That is because the many variables affecting the AMT have overlapping results, and the order in which one analyzes those overlapping variables will directly impact the outcome of the analysis.  In that way, we can use the same JCT data in the analysis above to suggest that failure to index is actually the dominant cause of the AMT problem. If one were to first index the current tax system for inflation by permanently extending an indexed version of the current hold-harmless provision, Federal AMT revenue would be reduced from $1.139 trillion to $472 billion over the 10-year period. Thus, extending and indexing the current hold-harmless provision for future inflation would reduce AMT revenues by 59 percent over the same period, referred to in a JCT letter dated October 3, 2005, as ``percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure to extend and index hold-harmless provision''. A copy of the entire letter is attached. If we then assume that the Bush tax cuts are repealed, AMT revenue falls by an additional $302.3 billion, from $472 billion to $169.7 billion. That second drop, attributable to the repeal of the Bush tax cuts, reduces Federal revenues by only 27 percent. Thus, one could argue that failure to index is the greater cause of the AMT problem--59 percent vs. 27 percent. Using logic similar to that undertaken above would also cause us to conclude that failure to index is responsible for 59 percent of the AMT problem--$1.139 trillion minus $472 billion divided by $1.139 trillion--or alternatively, that failure to index also nearly tripled the size of the AMT problem, $1.139 trillion divided by $472 billion.  But simple logic suggests that the Bush tax cuts cannot be responsible for 65 percent of the AMT problem and failure to index responsible for 59 percent of the problem. The anomaly arises because there is overlap between the variables being analyzed. Although the analysis fairly demonstrates the amount of AMT revenue saved by making a particular change to the Federal tax system, it is inappropriate to represent that such analysis accurately isolates causation of the AMT. Because there is overlap in the variables being analyzed--in these examples, indexing and the Bush tax cuts--the order of analysis of those variables is crucial to the outcome. JCT acknowledges this point to us in a letter dated October 3, stating: ``There is, however, interaction between these two contributing factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total effect remains constant.''  To this point in time, I have not seen anything that accurately suggests that the 2001 tax cuts have worsened the AMT problem to date. It is my intention to ensure that we continue to honor that commitment and that is an important part of this tax reconciliation legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr     From: George Yin     Subject: AMT Effects       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29,      2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT      liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be      attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount      to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and      JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently      extended or repealed. We also explain how this information      compares to information previously provided to you on August      31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.       For the purpose of this analysis, we have first assumed      that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in      Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if,      alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless      provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is      extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended      permanently and indexed after 2005, The second set of figures      presents the same comparison under the assumption that the      tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information      provided in this table was previously provided to you in our      September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.                                  ____     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr     Subject: AMT Effects                                TABLE 1.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             AMT effect                           Item                             (billions of                                                              dollars)------------------------------------------------------------------------Tax Cuts Repealed:    (1) Hold-harmless provision not extended..............         399.9    (2) Hold-harmless provision extended permanently......         212.0    (3) Percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure             47%     to extend hold-harmless provision (((1)-(2))/(1))....

In the analysis described      above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable      to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation.      There is, however, interaction between these two contributing      factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting      of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The      apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will      vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total      effect remains constant.       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The      first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT      effect attributable to the tax cuts, consistent with the      information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16,      2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of      the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and      index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the      information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two      contributing factors were completely independent of one      another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the      two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of      the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors      together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect.      Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.
