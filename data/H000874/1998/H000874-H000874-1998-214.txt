Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just to briefly comment on the last speaker's observations, I think he is absolutely correct. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and I have participated in a brief ceremony earlier today in which we honored the police officers here on Capitol Hill who responded to the fire in Longworth and who also responded to the fire in the O'Neill Building.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) made the observation that we lost 28 people in the Persian Gulf War when that Scud attack occurred and they were in their barracks; and we lamented that loss, properly so. It was a grievous loss for our country.  As I mentioned just a little while ago, over 150 lost their lives last year as police officers on the streets of America. It is right and proper that we honor them, as we honor those who we ask to defend us abroad, that we equally honor those who we ask to defend us here at home.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.
