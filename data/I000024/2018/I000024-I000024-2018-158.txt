President, I begin by wishing everyone a happy new year, and hopefully everyone had a great Christmas. We did.  I have three observations I wish to make about 2018. First, here in Washington, we are experiencing some really frigid temperatures this week. Let me tell my colleagues that in Oklahoma, it was even colder there than it was here. That is unusual, but it was. So we experienced recordbreaking, bitter, cold weather, and it was pretty miserable, but the great, warm people of Oklahoma had a great Christmas, New Year's, and everything is good. Many parts of the country saw 2017 with the recordbreaking cold weather, and meteorologists are predicting more recordbreaking cold for the rest of the week and the beginning of next week.  I bring this up to highlight the fact that President Trump joked last week on Twitter. He said: ``We could use a little bit of that good old global warming.'' I say it a little bit differently. I say: Where is global warming when we need it because we sure needed it this last week. Well, the alarmists went crazy over this. Let me explain what an alarmist is.  Alarmists believe global warming is coming due to anthropogenic gases, and the world is coming to an end. They are the ones who jumped on that, and they actually went crazy for not understanding the difference between weather and climate.  We keep saying the same thing. Every time we go through one of these periods where we experience an event again, we have the same thing that comes up, and we talk about it. Climate is always changing. We understand that. We actually had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate, saying, yes, climate changes; it has always changed. Historically, scripturally, there has always been change. We understand that. Anyway, I remember I have been criticized for the same thing.  My colleagues might remember, I brought a snowball here a couple of Februaries ago to show we are not experiencing climate change when it snows in February, after we have been told for decades that soon we wouldn't have any snow again.  That was really kind of a fun thing. I had some of the pages lined up, and I asked: Which one of you guys is the most athletic? It happened that the guy who raised his hand--they all pointed to him and said: He is the guy who is most athletic, and he was from Oklahoma. So I said: I will tell you what I will do. I will take the snowball, throw it up there at the Presiding Officer, and you intercept it. If you don't intercept it, it will be a mess. He intercepted it. It was beautiful.  Sometimes people have to quit being so serious about all of this stuff and realize there are things that are happening that people need to talk about, that are for real, on point. Some might remember Al Gore made some pretty outrageous claims. Enough years have gone by, but he said that by the deadlines he pointed out, global warming was going to cause all the snow to melt on Mount Kilimanjaro. I was not far from Kilimanjaro just a few weeks ago, and the snow is still there.  He said that by 2016 the Arctic would be completely melted and all the polar bears would be extinct. None of that happened. The only thing that has happened, according to an article in the New York Times, is that Al Gore has now become the first environmental billionaire. Critics were quick to jump on my case when he did that, and I had to remind them that there is a difference between weather and climate.  Those same critics are also quick to jump on weather events when it supports their cause. Whenever there is a particularly bad tornado in Oklahoma--and we have bad tornadoes in Oklahoma; I have never seen a good tornado--there are people who have witnessed them, and I am immediately asked if this will cause me to change my mind about global warming or climate change. I said: Why? Alarmists have been insisting for a long period of time that the world is coming to an end, and it is coming to an end because of global warming.  After this past hurricane season, I was repeatedly ask if I thought climate change was to blame for the tragic natural disasters. Again, I responded: You alarmists have been insisting that weather isn't climate; so why do you change your position now?  I am not surprised that we have hurricanes during hurricane season, we have tornadoes during tornado season, and we have cold and snow during the winter. That is not unique to just my State of Oklahoma. That is all over the country and all over the world.  We hear constantly that natural disasters are getting worse. Yet, when we look at the data, there is no support for the conclusion. When category 4 Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and other Gulf States, it was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the continental United States for 12 years. The next largest gap between major hurricanes actually lasted only 8 years, and that was in the 1860s. Tornado activity has also been down in recent years, with the latest data of 2016 showing a continued low number of tornadoes across the United States. I might say that this is also true for my State of Oklahoma. Since we are experiencing recordbreaking cold last week and this week in much of the country, we are once again reminded that weather is not climate.  So what is happening on the climate front? Now, keep in mind that the alarmists are the ones saying that the world is coming to an end because of global warming. They say that we all will be burned to death and temperatures are skyrocketing. Over the last couple of years, we have been told that it was the hottest year on record. We have been scolded by the jet-setting Hollywood celebrities about our carbon footprint, but, again, if we actually look at the data, there isn't support for all of this hysteria.  The Obama administration touted 2014, 2015, and 2016 as the hottest years on record. But the increases are well within the margin of error. In 2016, NOAA said the Earth warmed by 0.04 degrees Celsius, and the British Government pegged it at 0.01 Celsius. However, the margin of error is 0.1 degree, not 0.01. So it is all statistically meaningless and below the doom-and-gloom temperature predictions from all the various models from consensus scientists.  Now, this is interesting. Steven Koonin was appointed Under Secretary for Science at the Department of Energy by President Obama. That was during the Obama administration. He said: ``The Obama administration relentlessly politicized science and aggressively pushed a campaign about that politicized science.'' In other words, he used that to make a case that is not true, and this comes out of his own administration.  In September 2017, University of Alabama in Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider published a study showing no acceleration in global warming for the last 23 years.  Their research shows that if you remove the climate effects of two volcanic eruptions and the El Nino and La Nina systems that occurred over the last 38 years, there has been no change since the early 1990s to the rate of warming and that model predictions from the IPCC are overstated by about double.  Keep in mind that the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations. They started this about 40 years ago, and their scientists have been completely discredited.  I remember when that took place in Copenhagen. They had one of the big annual United Nations parties. At that time, Lisa Jackson was Obama's Administrator of the EPA. She knew I was going to go there and tell the truth to all these people.  I asked her this question on the public record. In the event that I leave town and you are going to start regulating global warming, you have to first declare that there is an urgency to this and you have to use a scientific declaration. What science will you use?  She said: We are going to use the IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  As luck would have it, just a matter of days after, the IPCC was totally rejected. Everyone remembers how they had been caught rigging the information in terms of weather, and it was really quite a mess.  Going back to Christy's explanation, which just came out the other day, the volcanic eruptions cooled the Earth when ash, soot, and debris entered the atmosphere and sunlight was reflected away. ``Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend.''  So we have two respected climate scientists using sound science to discredit the so-called consensus scientists. By the way, there are hundreds of other scientists out there. One of the best known is a guy from MIT named Richard Lindzen. He has been very outspoken on this.  So every time we hear people talking that ``there is a consensus of science,'' I think we know better. Remember that the media does not share the studies. So quite often they do not say anything about some of the failed practices being used to draw us to these conclusions. I am thankful we have a President and an administration that refuses to handcuff our economy with policies based on overblown headlines.  So while we continue to have tornadoes in May, hurricanes in the fall, and bitterly cold temperatures in the winter, we must remember that the climate has been stable over the last few decades, and we shouldn't give in to the fearmongers out there. Rather, we should focus on actual threats to American families, like the regime which calls for ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.''                          ____________________
