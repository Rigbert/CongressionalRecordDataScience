Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 405) commemorating the independence of East Timor and expressing the sense of Congress that the President should establish diplomatic relations with East Timor, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 405       Whereas on May 20, 2002, East Timor became the first new      country of the millennium;       Whereas the perseverance and strength of the East Timorese      people in the face of daunting challenges has inspired the      people of the United States and around the world;       Whereas in 1974 Portugal acknowledged the right of its      colonies, including East Timor, to self-determination,      including independence;       Whereas East Timor has been under United Nations      administration since October 1999 during which time      international peacekeeping forces, supplemented by forces of      the United States Group for East Timor (USGET), have worked      to stabilize East Timor and provide for its national      security;       Whereas the people of East Timor exercised their long-     sought right of self-determination on August 30, 1999, when      98.6 percent of the eligible population voted, and 78.5      percent chose independence in a United Nations-administered      popular consultation despite systematic terror and      intimidation by the Indonesian military and its militia;       Whereas the East Timorese people again demonstrated their      strong commitment to democracy when 91.3 percent of eligible      voters peacefully participated in East Timor's first      democratic, multiparty election for a Constituent Assembly on      August 30, 2001, and when 86.3 percent of those eligible      participated in the first presidential election on April 14,      2002;       Whereas East Timor adopted a constitution in March 2002;       Whereas East Timor is emerging from over 400 years of      colonial domination and a 24-year period of occupation by the      Indonesian military;       Whereas, as the people of East Timor move proudly toward      independence, many still struggle to recover from the scars      of the military occupation and the 1999 scorched-earth      campaign that resulted in displacement which, according to      the United Nations and other independent reports, exceeded      500,000 in number and widespread death, rape, and other      mistreatment of women, family separation, and large refugee      populations and the destruction of 70 percent of the      country's infrastructure;       Whereas efforts are ongoing by East Timorese officials and      others to seek justice for the crimes against humanity and      war crimes that have been perpetrated in recent years,      efforts which include the work of the United Nations Serious      Crimes Investigation Unit and the East Timorese Commission      for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation to document and      assess responsibility for these crimes;       Whereas recommendations by the Indonesian National Human      Rights Commission and the United Nations Security Council to      investigate and prosecute senior Indonesian military and      civilian officials for their roles in promoting the 1999      anti-independence violence in East Timor have not yet been      fully implemented;       Whereas, although the people of East Timor are working      toward a plan for vigorous economic growth and development,      the Government of East Timor faces a substantial shortfall in      its recurrent and development budgets over the first 3 years      of independence, and is seeking to fill the gap in full with      grants from donor countries;       Whereas a large percentage of the population of East Timor      lives below the poverty line with inadequate access to health      care and education, the unemployment rate in East Timor is      estimated at 80 percent, and the life expectancy in East      Timor is only 57 years; and       Whereas Nobel Peace Laureate Carlos Ximenes Belo, Roman      Catholic Bishop of Dili, East Timor, has appealed to the      international community and the United States for increased      economic and development assistance for the fledgling nation:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) Congress--       (A) congratulates and honors the courageous people of East      Timor and their leaders;       (B) welcomes East Timor into the community of nations as a      sovereign state and looks forward to working with East Timor      as an equal partner;       (C) supports United Nations and international efforts to      support reconstruction and development in East Timor, and      United Nations and international peacekeeping forces to      safeguard East Timor's security;       (D) remains committed to working toward a debt-free start      to East Timor and just, sustainable, and secure development      programs as well as adequate resources for the judicial      system for East Timor for the foreseeable future beyond      independence;       (E) expresses continued concern over deplorable      humanitarian conditions and an environment of intimidation      among the East Timorese refugees living in West Timor;       (F) strongly supports prompt, safe, voluntary repatriation      and reintegration of East Timorese refugees, in particular      those East Timorese still held in militia-controlled refugee      camps in West Timor, especially reunification of East      Timorese children separated from their parents through      coercion or force;       (G) expresses a commitment to maintaining appropriate      restrictions and prohibitions in law on military assistance,      training relations, and technical support to the Indonesian      Armed Forces;       (H) acknowledges that a United Nations International      Commission of Inquiry found in January 2000 that justice is      ``fundamental for the future social and political stability      of East Timor'', and remains deeply concerned about the lack      of justice in the region; and       (I) commends the President for immediately extending to      East Timor diplomatic relations afforded to other sovereign      nations, including the establishment of an embassy in East      Timor; and       (2) it is the sense of Congress that the President and the      Secretary of State should--       (A) maintain a level of United States assistance for East      Timor commensurate with the challenges this new nation faces      after independence;       (B) work to fund in a generous and responsible way East      Timor's financing gap in its recurrent and development      budgets, and coordinate with other donors to ensure the      budget gap is addressed;       (C) focus bilateral assistance for East Timor on the areas      of employment creation, job training, rural reconstruction,      microenterprise, environmental protection, health care,      education, refugee resettlement, reconciliation and conflict      resolution, and strengthening the role of women in society;       (D) strongly urge the Indonesian Government to step up      efforts to disarm and disband all militia, hold them      accountable to the rule of law, ensure stability along the      border, and promptly reunite East Timorese children separated      from their parents through coercion or force; and       (E) review thoroughly information from the East Timorese      Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation and use      all diplomatic resources at their disposal to ensure that      those officials responsible for crimes against humanity and      war crimes against the East Timorese people are held      accountable and that the Indonesian Government fully      cooperates with the East Timorese judicial system.
