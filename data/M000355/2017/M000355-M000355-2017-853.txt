 With a little bit of cooperation, we will then set two votes after lunch to get to passage of the bill this afternoon so it can be sent over to the House today. Senators should expect additional votes right after lunch.                            Motion to Refer  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sasse, I move to refer the House message on H.R. 601 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report back.
