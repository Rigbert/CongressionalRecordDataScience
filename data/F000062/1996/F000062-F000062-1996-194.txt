 President, let me speak for just a moment on the subject of the pertinence of this amendment at this time. This amendment filed by the distinguished Senator from Montana is really not a relevant amendment, to which, if the subject of the amendment were known, there would clearly have been objection. The amendment carries an appropriation for the Judiciary, which has been funded for the entire fiscal year through a previous continuing resolution. That is the vehicle for this kind of appropriation. It is not relevant to this bill before us.  So, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Reid and myself, I raise this point of order.
