Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the floor today in support of H. Res. 578, which asks the House to endorse the Science Committee's National Science Policy Study, produced by our friend and colleague from Michigan the Committee Vice Chairman (Mr. Ehlers). The study ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science Policy'' is the result of over a year's work by the committee and reflects an approach to science policy that has earned the support of both sides of the aisle.  We have all heard the expression ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' Well, the clear message of this report is that, while not exactly broke, America's science policy is nonetheless in need of some pretty significant maintenance.                              {time}  2015  Mr. Speaker, this then is not a visionary document, but it is, I think, a document for visionaries. After all, that is what is scientists are, and it is important that we find ways to support them for the contributions they make to our national security, our health and our welfare, and this study succeeds in doing just that.  In my view what makes this report different from other science policy reports published by various groups over the years, some of them very good, is the Committee on Science's intention to act on its recommendations in future oversight hearings in legislation. Indeed this report should not be seen as the end, but rather the beginning of a long process that will involve Congress, the Executive Branch, the States, universities and industry all working together.  Mr. Speaker, this report has generated a great deal of excitement within the scientific community, and before concluding my remarks I would like to share with the House some statements in support of this document from our colleagues and in the Executive Branch.  Dr. Neal Lane, the President's Science Adviser, said he found the report to be harmonious with the President's established science policy goals, and he commended it for underscoring the importance of sustaining and nurturing America's world-leading science and technology enterprise.  Dr. Rita Colwell, Director of the National Science Foundation also praised the report noting its emphasis on the critical role of Federal support for fundamental research and especially merit based investments in university research. Doctor Colwell was also gratified that the report highlights the singular role that math, science and technology education play in any discussions of national science policy.  Mr. Speaker, I insert the full text of these statements in the Record:                       Statement of Dr. Neal Lane       In general, I find the Committee's report to be harmonious      with the President's established science policy goals. I      commend Representative Ehlers for underscoring the importance      of sustaining and nurturing America's world-leading science      and technology enterprise. Half of our economic productivity      in the last half-century is attributable to technological      innovation and the science that supports it.       The report's recommendations on the importance of education      concur with the President's views that the degree to which      our nation flourishes in the 21st century will rest upon our      success in developing a well-educated workforce able to      embrace the rapid pace of technological change.       I hope this report will serve as a catalyst for broad-based      bipartisan Congressional support of the Administration's      thoughtful investments across the entire science and      technology portfolio. Such a partnership to stimulate      scientific discovery and new technologies will take America      into the new century well equipped for the challenges and      opportunities that lie ahead.       I look forward to working with House Science Committee Vice      Chairman Ehlers and other members of Congress to ensure that      our national science policy keeps in step with a changing      world.                                  ____                     Statement by Dr. Rita Colwell       I want to commend Rep. Vern Ehlers of his diligent work in      preparing this report on national science policy. I am      particularly pleased that the report emphasizes the critical      role of federal support for fundamental research, and      especially for merit based investments in university      research. The technological developments that are key to      economic growth, public health, and national prosperity all      rely on discoveries occurring at and across the frontiers of      science and engineering.       I am also gratified that Rep. Ehlers has highlighted the      singular role that math, science and technology education      play in any discussion of national science policy. We cannot      expect to maintain a system of world class research unless we      have broad support from an informed public, and we cannot      have an informed public unless we commit ourselves to      improving public science literacy. I look forward to working      closely with Rep. Ehlers in fostering widespread awareness      and discussion of the issues raised in this report.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Nation's scientific enterprise is too important to our future to be left on auto pilot. In adopting House Resolution 578 and endorsing the National Science Policy Study the House will be sending an unmistakable signal that America's scientific enterprise will no longer be taken for granted in the Halls of Congress, and the real work will begin of turning the ideas in this report into sound policy that is good for science and good for the Nation.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
