In my presentation--and the Senator was in our caucus when we had a meeting--I had one chart that showed the United States. It showed how much it would cost an average household. My State, Oklahoma, and Texas were the largest hit. The increase for each family would be $3,300. Missouri was in the next tier down, which I think was around $2,800. That is something I think is very significant.
