Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my amendment in saving rural hospitals, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
