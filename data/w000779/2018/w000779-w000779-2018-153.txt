President, I believe the American people should be deeply concerned about the vote the Senate took yesterday to invoke cloture; in effect, ending real debate and preventing the Senate from considering any amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization.  This isn't what is called regular order. This isn't how the Senate ought to operate. In fact, it is not even how the Senate has handled surveillance bills in the past. Even in the weeks after the horrendous attacks of 9/11, the Senate considered amendments to the PATRIOT Act. In 2008, when the Senate first considered section 702, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there were, in fact, amendments.  Now debate has been cut off, and no Senator--neither a Democrat nor a Republican--is going to be allowed to offer an amendment. What the country is going to be left with is a deeply flawed bill that, in a number of ways, is actually worse than current law.  I want to talk first about whose rights are at stake. We are talking primarily, at this part of my address, about Americans who talk to foreigners overseas--law-abiding Americans whose communications can get swept up under this law. They could be, for example, American businesspeople--perhaps somebody working for a tech company in Colorado or Oregon or perhaps somebody working for a steel company in the Midwest. These are American businesspeople--law-abiding people--talking to a foreign contact. They could be swept up under this law or we could be talking about first-, second-, or third-generation Americans talking to family and friends still overseas. Maybe they are catching up. Maybe they are talking about kids and grandkids. Maybe they are just talking about their hopes and aspirations, but they are still law-abiding Americans who could get swept up in this bill. We could be talking about American journalists covering foreign stories. We could be talking about U.S. servicemembers talking to foreign friends they made while deployed. Try to get your arms around that one.  I think it is particularly unfortunate because one of the things I am proudest of is I was able to ensure that Americans overseas--servicemembers--would have their privacy rights protected. We have a law passed to do that.  I remember George W. Bush had reservations about that proposal I made to protect the privacy rights of our law-abiding servicemembers overseas. He originally said he might veto the bill. In the end, it was in his press release saying how great it was, and I think it was because nobody had really talked about the rights of these wonderful men and women who wear the uniform in the United States.  We did it right back when George W. Bush was President. We protected the privacy rights of our servicemembers overseas. Now we are talking about walking back the rights of those U.S. servicemembers if they are talking to foreign friends they made while deployed, and we could be talking about American teachers and researchers seeking information from foreigners.  Now this body isn't going to have a chance to even consider reforms that might protect the constitutional rights of these Americans--the businessperson, the servicemember, the first-, second-, or third-generation American immigrant--because what has happened is the Senate is being forced to vote on a reauthorization bill without any public discussion about any kind of alternatives. The one committee consideration--what is called a markup--occurred entirely in secret. That is public law being debated in secret.  Yesterday, the Senate discussed whether to cut off debate on a bill that authorizes vast, unchecked surveillance powers in less time than it takes to shop for the week's groceries. So now, with no amendments possible, there is not going to be a single opportunity for the public to see its representatives explain why they are supporting or why they are rejecting these key reforms.  You can only conclude from this that opponents of reforms were just scared. They were frightened. They just didn't want to have them debated in the open. They must be worried that the more Americans understand about the program--and the more they hear about commonsense, bipartisan proposals to fix it--the more the public is going to say we can do better. We can do better than the status quo because the public, once they have the benefit of a little transparency and a little open debate, what I have seen--and I just finished my 865th open-to-all town meeting at home in Oregon. Once you talk to folks at home about these issues, they understand that security and liberty aren't mutually exclusive; that sensible policies get you both and not-so-sensible policies and failure to look at the issues really get less of both.  My view is the Senate let down the American people yesterday. In my view, we have a solemn obligation to deliberate, to consider amendments, and to vote up or down. I think that is really what the Senate is all about.  One of the worst arguments for jamming this bill through without amendments was that somehow this law was going away. It just wouldn't be around. It was expiring.  First, Members who wanted to debate reforms were prepared to go to this floor many months ago. Nothing stood in the way of a floor debate last year. Even today, there is no reason to rush all this through. Absolutely nothing prevents the Congress from extending 702 authorities for a week or two to allow us to carry out our constitutional responsibilities. By the way, the Director of National Intelligence has said publicly and on the record that its authorities continue until April. I was stunned.  I had Senators on both sides of the aisle whom I like very much--good, dedicated Senators--saying: Oh, my goodness, we have to act. If we don't act in the next few days, oh, my goodness, powerful tools we need to stop the terrorists--and I will not take a backseat to anybody in terms of stopping the terrorists--they are going to be gone. That is just not true.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article with the statement from the Office of National Intelligence, where the Director said on the record that its authorities would continue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The New York Times, Dec. 6, 2017] Warrantless Surveillance Can Continue Even if Law Expires, Officials                                   Say                          (By Charlie Savage)       Washington.--The Trump administration has decided that the      National Security Agency and the F.B.I. can lawfully keep      operating their warrantless surveillance program even if      Congress fails to extend the law authorizing it before an      expiration date of New Year's Eve, according to American      officials.       National security officials have implored Congress for the      past year and a half to extend the legal basis for the      program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, before it      lapses at the end of the month. They portrayed such a bill as      the ``top legislative priority'' for keeping the country      safe.       But with Congress focused on passing a major tax cut and      divided over what changes, if any, to make to the      surveillance program, lawmakers may miss that deadline.      Hedging against that risk, executive branch lawyers have now      concluded that the government could lawfully continue to spy      under the program through late April without new legislation.       Intelligence officials nonetheless remain intent on getting      lawmakers to pass a durable extension of Section 702 by the      end of the month--warning that even a stopgap short-term      extension of several months, as some lawmakers have proposed,      would risk throwing the program into a crisis in the spring.       ``We fully expect Congress to reauthorize this critical      statute by the end of the year,'' said Brian Hale, a      spokesman for the Office of the Director of National      Intelligence. ``Not doing so would be unthinkable in light of      the considerable value Section 702 provides in protecting the      nation.''       The expiring law grew out of the Bush administration's      once-secret Stellarwind warrantless surveillance program      after the Sept. 11 attacks. After it came to light, Congress      enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a form of      the program.       Under Section 702, the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. may collect      from domestic companies like AT&T and Google the phone calls,      emails, texts and other electronic messages of foreigners      abroad without a warrant--even when they talk with Americans.      The program has expanded to a broad array of foreign      intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism.       If Congress fails to reauthorize the law this month, Mr.      Hale acknowledged that the government believes it can keep      the program going for months. Its reasoning centers on a      legal complexity in how the program works: Under the law,      about once a year, the secretive Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court     sets rules for the program and authorizes it to operate for      12 months.       The court last issued a one-year certification on April 26.      That matters because a little-noticed section of the FISA      Amendments Act says that orders issued under Section 702      ``shall continue in effect until the date of the      expiration.''       Mr. Hale said the provision, which is recorded in federal      statute books as a ``transition procedures'' note      accompanying the main text of the law, makes it ``very      clear'' that ``any existing order will continue in effect for      a short time even if Congress doesn't act to reauthorize the      law in a timely fashion.''       Given that conclusion, the government is making no plans to      immediately turn off the program on New Year's Day, no matter      what happens in Congress, according to a United States      official familiar with the Section 702 program who spoke on      the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.       The disclosure has significant ramifications for the debate      over the program.       Congressional leaders have discussed including an extension      of the program in other must-pass legislation, like a      spending bill to keep the government from shutting down. But      lawmakers will face less pressure to jam through such a move,      short-circuiting a full and open debate over reform      proposals, if the alternative is not an immediate termination      of the collecting of intelligence authorized by the law.       Little consensus exists in Congress about what, if any,      changes to make to the law as part of extending it. Lawmakers      have submitted legislation spanning the gamut from making the      law permanent without changes to imposing significant new      limits to safeguard the privacy rights of Americans whose      communications get swept up in the program, as well as a      range of intermediary proposals.       One key disagreement centers on what limits, if any, to      impose on how government officials may search for, gain      access to or use in court information about Americans that      gets swept into the warrantless surveillance program. Some      lawmakers want to impose a broad provision forcing officials      to get a warrant before they may query the repository about      an American. Some want a more limited requirement that      officials get a court's permission to gain access to the      results of such a query if it is for a criminal investigation      but not a national security one. Some want to impose no new      constraints.       Another major issue confronting lawmakers is what to say,      if anything, about the N.S.A.'s old practice of collecting,      from network switches on the internet's backbone,      international emails and other such messages that mention a      foreigner who is a target of surveillance but are neither to      nor from that person. The N.S.A. recently halted that      practice but wants to retain the flexibility to turn it back      on; some bills would codify a ban on it, and some would not.       The question of a Section 702 overhaul, and trade-offs      between national security powers and privacy protections, has      scrambled the usual party lines. Representative Robert W.      Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the      Judiciary Committee, has warned that legislation whose      changes fall short of a compromise bill that he worked out      with Democrats on his committee is unlikely to pass the      House.       In an interview, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat,      declined to comment on the government's theory, but said he      was open to making it possible to have a full and open debate      over the proposed changes to the surveillance law early next      year if time runs out this month.       ``We've seen this movie before: wait until the last minute,      and then say, 'crowded congressional calendar, dangerous      world, we've just got to go along with it,'' Mr. Wyden said.      ``Anything now that creates an opportunity for several months      of real debate, I'll listen to.''       Either way, the United States official said the executive      branch and the courts would still need a durable new version      of the law well before the late-April deadline. The problem,      the official said, is that it will take a significant amount      of time to develop new procedures based on the new law,      submit them to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,      make changes the court wants and then work with      communications companies to implement the new certifications.       Mr. Hale declined to comment on those specifics, but said      that a gap in the surveillance program's legal authorization      would generate uncertainty.       ``So while the orders would be in effect for a short time      after the end of the year, the fact is that we would need to      be planning for the end of the program,'' Mr. Hale said,      ``and that cannot be done in a matter of days--to effect that      takes some time, and is not like turning on or off a light      switch.''       Planning to turn off the Section 702 program, the other      official said, would include steps to mitigate that change as      much as possible, including by systematically going through      the list of more than 100,000 foreigners abroad who are being      targeted under the program and triaging which are the most      critical, then developing lengthy packages of information to      submit to the surveillance court to seek individualized      orders to wiretap them.       But because of the resources such an effort would require      and the higher legal standard the government would need to be      able to meet, surveillance would ultimately cease on most of      the Section 702 targets, the official added.
