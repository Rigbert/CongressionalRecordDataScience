Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Arapaho National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 2014 would adjust the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest in the State of Colorado to incorporate 92 additional acres. This land, if it is acquired by the Secretary of Agriculture, will become part of the Bowen Gulch Protection Area that was established by Congress in 1993.  At markup, the Natural Resources Committee amended the bill to require the written permission of the landowner before a parcel of private land could be included within the expanded boundary. The amendment also requires that any land acquisition in the added area would be achieved only by donation or exchange, and the motorized use provision was clarified to ensure that the bill does not open privately owned land to trespass. With these added property rights and fiscal responsibility provisions, the committee was able to report the bill by unanimous consent, and I support this legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
