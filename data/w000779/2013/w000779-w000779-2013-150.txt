President, the nomination of Dr. Ernest Moniz to head the Department of Energy is now the pending business in the Senate. I would like to discuss the nomination. I note my friend and colleague Senator Murkowski is here. Both of us will take a short amount of time to discuss Dr. Moniz's qualifications.  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the nomination of Dr. Ernest Moniz to serve as the Secretary of Energy. Dr. Moniz is smart about energy policy, he is savvy about how the Department of Energy operates, and he is solution-oriented, which is what Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee saw when he was before our committee to consider his nomination.  I am going to talk about why I believe Dr. Moniz is well qualified to spearhead our efforts to evolve our country's energy system, to increase domestic sources, emit less carbon, and to bolster our economy. First, though, I would like to talk for a few minutes about the job Dr. Moniz will be stepping into once he is confirmed.  Right now the Energy Department is at the center of issues that are hugely consequential to our economy and the environment.
