Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I am hopeful that we will not be back a year from today with the committee attempting to prevent promulgation of regulation, and at that point I will have to go forward with a vote and would have to go ahead, if I succeed, and implement the problematic regulations now pending.  So I am happy to work with the gentleman and try and prod the administration into action on this.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The amendment of the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] is withdrawn.
