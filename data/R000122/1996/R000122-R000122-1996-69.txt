Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rhode Island's Western Cranston Little League team, winners of the Little League National Championship.  Western Cranston was comprised of 14 players: Lucas Ashton, Jacob Bazirgan, Brett Bell, Lewis Colby, Evan DiZoglio, Christopher Gallo, Matt Lovejoy, Michael Luke, Tom Michael, Jonathan Sparling, Peter Spinelli, Craig Stinson, Ricky Stoddard, and Paul Tavarozzi. Under the guidance of coaches Mike Varrato, Nick DiNezza, Larry Lapore, and Benny Marandola, these 14 young men quickly transformed into a championship team.  On July 24, the Western Cranston Little Leaguers were among 7,000 teams playing in 83 countries on 6 continents, beginning a quest for the Little League World Series. On August 25, 3 cities, 16 games, and 1 Little League National Championship later, Western Cranston returned home to a hero's welcome, when over 7,000 Rhode Islanders packed Cranston Stadium to congratulate them.  That this Nation's smallest State could produce its best Little League team is a tribute to the spirit of Rhode Islanders, as well as the teamwork and never-say-die attitude of these 14 young men. With the help of their families and coaches and the support of Rhode Island, Western Cranston traveled to Williamsport, PA and achieved what was unthinkable just a month before. They inspired a nation and brought immeasurable pride and joy to their State.  Today, I am indeed proud to say that my home town of Cranston is the home of the Little League National Champions. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the Western Cranston Little League team.                          ____________________
