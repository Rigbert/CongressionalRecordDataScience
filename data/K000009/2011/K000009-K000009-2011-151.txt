Speaker. I rise today to recognize the life of Mary E. Gerken, who passed from this life at age 90 years. She was an indefatigable educator, brilliant student, source of inspiration, enduring mother for her family and our community, and woman of deep, abiding faith. Her life truly can be described as a woman for others. We offer our condolences to her family, especially her children Cathy, Fran, George and Pete.  Born August 29, 1920 to Nettie Mosher, a World War I Army nurse, Mary Gerken grewup in Northwest Ohio and was the Valedictorian of her Perrysburg High School graduating class. She went on to obtain a Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry from Mary Manse College and her Master's Degree in Science Education and Microbiology from the University of Toledo. Married following World War II, Mary then was widowed with four young children.  Long before women were welcomed in the sciences, she was blazing a path for those that would follow. Even as she raised her family and cared for her mother and mother-in-law, Mary taught at the high school and college levels. A conscientious parent, she instilled in her children a core of social justice, exposure to the liberal arts, and insisted on a college education for each of them.  After her retirement--in her seventies--Mary traveled a new path. She taught Native Americans in Minnesota and worked with a community of religious sisters. When she came home several years later, she began a tenure of public service as an industrial hygienist with OSHA. She served as a Eucharistic Minister in her church and was a member of Zonta International.  Mary E. Gerken is an example of a life well-lived. She leaves a legacy of service, compassion and industry to her family and our community. Our community expresses its gratitude for her many decades of exceptional teaching, good humor, humility, and encouraging nature. We shall miss her spirited presence but remain grateful always for the lasting legacies her life's work generously gave to us.                          ____________________
