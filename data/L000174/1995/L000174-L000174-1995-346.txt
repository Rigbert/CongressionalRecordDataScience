President, the matter of a performance right for sound recordings is an issue that has been in dispute for over 20 years. I believe that Congress will finally enact a law establishing that right.  I believe that musicians, singers and featured performers on recordings ought to be compensated like other creative artists for the public performances of works that they create and that we all enjoy. I want companies that export American music not to be disadvantaged internationally by the lack of U.S. recognition of such a performance right. Most of all, I have wanted to be sure that the new law is fair to all parties--to performers, musicians, songwriters, music publishers, performing rights societies, emerging companies expanding new technologies, and, in particular, consumers and the public.  I am glad to have been able to play a role in redesigning the bill to meet these objectives. The substitute seeks to preserve existing rights, to encourage the development of new technologies, and to promote competition as the best protection for consumers. I was pleased to join as a cosponsor of the substitute and to urge support for S. 227 as amended when the Judiciary Committee considered the bill on June 29.  Working with Senator Thurmond, the Chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, and with the help of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, we have been able to strengthen the bill in significant regard.  At our March hearing on S. 227, I raised antitrust concerns about certain provisions in the bill. In particular, I was concerned about subsections (h) and (e), which were proposed to be added to section 114 of the Copyright Act. The language of both subsections has been revised and strengthened to protect against anticompetitive activity.  As originally drafted, the bill might have created a virtually unlimited antitrust exemption for major record companies to combine to set prices for licensing music. While I want to work to find ways to keep transaction costs as low as possible for clearing rights in order to make music in the future more accessible to the public at lower prices, I do not support such an exemption to our antitrust laws.  On June 20, I received a letter from the Department of Justice responding to a letter I had sent following our hearing. The Department noted that subsection (e) of the original bill could be read to provide statutory authority to record companies to form a licensing cartel. In light of the concentration of the record industry in which 6 major companies account for 80 to 85 percent of the U.S. market, this could, in the words of the Justice Department ``cause great mischief by allowing the formation of a cartel immune from antitrust scrutiny.'' I know that is not what the original sponsors of this legislation intended.  I was pleased to work with Senator Thurmond and others to resolve these problems. The Department provided technical assistance to us as we worked out another approach that authorizes only a clearinghouse to cut down transaction costs without authorizing price fixing by combinations of companies. This is an approach with which we are all more comfortable. In this regard, we received a follow-up letter from the Department of Justice on these provisions.  I commend the industry groups that took seriously our suggestion that they talk through their differences and see whether they could recommend a consensus solution to Congress. The cooperation and good faith contributed greatly to the process. My experience has been that in these areas of copyright law, legislation moves best and most easily by consensus. I think that is what we have strived to attain and what we have achieved.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of the June 20 and July 21 letters from the Department of Justice on this measure.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights          and Competition, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your March 13, 1995,      letter to Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman asking for      views on S. 227, the ``Digital Performance Right in Sound      Recordings Act of 1995.'' The Administration supports the      establishment of a performance right in digital recordings.      However, based on our review of S. 227, we believe: (1) that      proposed subsection (e) may inadvertently authorize cartel      activity in the licensing of performance rights, and (2) that      proposed subsection (h) does not fully address the potential      competition issues associated with licensing to affiliated      entities.      Minor modifications to S. 227 would remedy these deficiencies without      undermining the bill's underlying goals.       Performance rights in sound recordings, common in Europe      and other regions, are not currently granted by the 1976      Copyright Act or any other federal statute. Thus, under      current law, producers of sound recordings are not entitled      to license or receive royalties for the public performance      and broadcast of their recordings in the U.S. for example,      digital subscription transmission services \1\ currently may      buy a compact disc on the retail market and simply play the      music from it on their channels without obtaining the      permission of or compensating the artists or record companies      that produced the recording.     Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Senate Bill 227 would amend the Copyright Act to create a      performance right in digital transmissions. Under the bill,      right holders would have the authority to receive royalty      fees from, and in some cases, negotiate the terms of, the      performance of their sound recordings by digital delivery      services such as pay-per-listen and subscription transmission      services.       Generally, we believe that S. 227 would advance competition      by allowing producers of sound recordings control over      certain transmissions of their recordings by some digital      transmission services, this potentially allowing them to      limit the threat of uncompensated home copying by subscribers      to those services. Nevertheless, given the concentrated      nature of the affected industries, the danger exists that      this remedial legislation could be subverted to monopolistic      aims.       1. Licensing Cartel.--We are concerned that proposed      subsection (e), by allowing license negotiations by a common      agent, would authorize formation of a cartel by performance      rights holders. Our understanding is that a ``performance      right'' would, at least with respect to the major record      companies and their affiliates (the ``majors'') \2\ be held      by the record company, either by virtue of its producer      status or by contract with the artist.\3\       As part of its ongoing inquiry into licensing practices in      U.S. and in foreign commerce, the Department is currently      investigating whether certain record companies have      unlawfully colluded on license fees by, inter alia, forming      ``performance rights societies'' in Europe and elsewhere that      operate as the exclusive negotiating agency for all of the      record companies. Unlike licensing societies that act as      nonexclusive agents for owners and composers of copyrighted      compositions, the foreign performance rights societies are      the exclusive assignees of performance rights and arguably      are highly concentrated. Exploiting the combined market power      associated with the pooling of intellectual property rights,      these exclusive licensing societies typically charge a      percentage-of-revenue fee in return for a blanket license.      The European Commission has issued a Statement of Objections      against these practices as they relate to music video      licenses, and the Division is likewise seeking to determine      whether the activities of these foreign rights societies have      an adverse impact on U.S. exports of music video and digital      radio programming. See United States v. Time Warner      Inc., et at., No. Misc. 94-338 HHG (filed Nov. 3, 1994)      (Petition to enforce civil investigative demands).       Arguably, S. 227 would statutorily authorize performance      right holders, and record companies in particular, to form      the same kind of anticompetitive performance rights society      here in the United States. According to proposed subsection      (e):       ``Any copyright owners of sound recordings and any entities      performing sound recordings affected by this section may      negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty      payments for the performance of such sound recordings and the      proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners,      and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay,      or receive such royalty payments.''       (Emphasis added). This subsection could cause great      mischief by allowing the formation of a cartel immune from      antitrust scrutiny. Although the arbitration royalty panel      created by the statute would set some limit on fees charged      for compulsory licenses, this provision would authorize      collective negotiations by right holders for unregulated      voluntary licenses as well. Moreover, even in the compulsory      license context, a small programmer would almost certainly      pay hefty premium in order to avoid the costs of a challenge      before the royalty panel against a cartel whose costs and      legal fees are spread over a multi-billion dollar industry.      Ultimately, U.S. consumers would pay this premium.       We therefore strongly recommend that proposed subsection      (e) be deleted. To do so would in no way affect the salutary      goals of the bill. Artists could transfer rights to the      record companies. Record companies could unilaterally hire      agents. They could even form a performance right society so      long as it conformed to the antitrust laws. What they could      not do is form a federally authorized cartel to set higher-     than-competitive prices.       2. Licensing to Affiliates.--Proposed subsection (h)      provides that, where a right holder licenses a sound      recording to a digital programmer it directly or indirectly      controls, the right holder must license to similarly situated      programmers on similar terms and conditions. As written, this      provision is unlikely to be an effective deterrent to      discrimination in favor of affiliates and may have the      unintended effect of mandating higher-than-competitive      license fees.       In the first place, the trigger language of the bill is too      narrow. As far as we know, no individual right holder,      including the record companies, has a large enough individual      stake in a      digital programmer to have positive ``control''. Together,      however, several majors potentially may exercise      substantial collective influence. Taking the cable audio      services industry as an example, Sony, Warner, and EMI      each hold a 33% interest in SWE Cable Radio Company (SWE),      which in turn holds a 35% interest--enough for negative      control over any major decision--in Digital Cable Radio      Associates L.P. (DCR). Presumably, these partners could      favor their collectively controlled programmer at the      expense of Digital Music Express (DMX), the only other      digital radio programmer. S. 227 would not prevent      discrimination of this type.       Second, it is by no means clear that programmers such as      DMX would be protected by subsection (h) even if it were      triggered. As written, the subsection mandates ``similar      terms'' as those provided to the affiliated programmer. This      raises the possibility that right holder(s) could set a high      price to the affiliated programmer and then claim a statutory      requirement to apply the artificially high rate to the non-     affiliated programmer.       Third, to be an effective deterrent to discrimination,      subsection (h)(2), allowing the right holder to set different      terms and conditions for essentially any reason, should be      tightened.       We suggest, therefore, the following modifications to      proposed subsection (h) (changes in italics):       ``Where a copyright owner of sound recordings, indvidually      or collectively with other copyright owners of sound      recordings, owns a controlling interest in, or otherwise      possesses the power directly or indirectly to control or      block important management decisions of, an entity engaging      in digital transmissions covered by section 106(6) and      licenses to such entity the right to publicly perform a sound      recording by means of digital transmission, the copyright      owner shall make the licensed sound recording available under      section 106(6) on terms and conditions no less favorable to      all similarly-situated entities offering similar types of      digital transmission services, except that the copyright      owner may--       ``(1) impose reasonable requirements for creditworthiness;      and       ``(2) make reasonable adjustments to the prices, terms, and      conditions to take into account the types of services      offered, the duration of the license, the geographic region,      the numbers of subscribers served, and any other relevant      factors.''     We believe this modified language would address the concerns      set forth above by (1) expanding the coverage of the      subsection to include situations where right holders      collectively control a programmer or have a stake in a      programmer that does not rise to the level of positive      control; (2) restricting the ability of a right holder to      discriminate based on pretextual dissimilarities among      affiliated and non-affiliated programmers; (3) preserving the      ability of rights holders to take substantial differences      among programmers into account; and (4) ensuring that a      programmer is not bound by statute to accept an artificially      high license fee.       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on S. 227. In our      view, the bill would be measurably improved if Congress were      to adopt the suggested modifications or take other steps to      address the concerns we have raised. Please do not hesitate      to contact me at any time for further elaboration of the      views expressed.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's      program to the submission of this report to the Congress.           Sincerely,                                                      Kent Markus,     Acting Assistant Attorney General.                                                                    ____                               FOOTNOTES     \1\ Digital subscription transmission services currently      provide approximately 60 CD-quality channels of audio      programming to cable and satellite television subscribers.     \2\ Six major record companies and their affiliates (the      ``majors'') collectively account for approximately eighty to      eighty-five percent of the U.S. and worldwide markets for      prerecorded records, taps, and compact discs.     \3\ When a recording artist signs with a major record label,      he or she typically transfers all copyrights, including any      performance right, to the record company in perpetuity      throughout the world.                                                                    ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1995.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: This letter responds to your June 29,      1995, letter to Anne K. Bingaman in which you, joined by      Senators Thurmand, Kyl and Brown, asked for the Department of      Justice's views on whether the most recent changes made to S.      227 adequately address the antitrust concerns raised in the      Department's June 20, 1995, letter to you on this subject.       S. 227 would amend the Copyright Act to create a      performance right in digital transmissions. Under the bill,      right holders would have the authority to receive royalty      fees      from, and, in some cases, negotiate the terms of the performance of      their sound recordings by digital delivery services such as      pay-per-listen and subscriptions transmission services.       The Administration supports the establishment of a      performance right for sound recordings. Generally, we believe      that S. 227 would advance competition by allowing producers      of sound recordings control over certain transmissions of      their recordings by some digital services, thus potentially      allowing them to limit the threat of uncompensated home      copying by subscribers of those services.       As set forth more fully in our earlier letter, the original      language of S. 227 could have been read to statutorily      authorize activities that might otherwise violate the      antitrust laws. Specifically, proposed subsection (e)      arguably would have authorized rights holders--typically      record companies--to designate ``common agents'' without      appropriate safeguards to ensure against cartel behavior.      Similarly, proposed subsection (h) could have been read to      require an unaffiliated programmer to      pay the same artificially high license as paid by an      affiliated programmer.       As we read the Chairman's Final Mark Substitute Draft of S.      227, the revised bill can no longer be read to exempt      activity that would otherwise clearly violate the antitrust      laws.       With respect to proposed subsection (e), ``Authority for      Negotiations,'' we were concerned that the original language      of the bill would have the unintended effect of making cartel      conduct immune from antitrust scrutiny. In the revised bill,      the role of the common agent has been substantially      curtailed, thus addressing our concern. Specifically, in the      context of ``voluntary negotiations'' for a statutory      license, the common agent is now ``non-exclusive''--meaning      that a programmer may not be required to negotiate through      the common agent. In addition, any impasse on license fees,      terms and conditions can be resolved by the rate panel, if      necessary. Where a statutory license has not been created      (e.g., for interactive transmissions or transmissions that      exceed the performance complement), the common agent's role      is limited to a ``clearing house'' function. In other words,      under those circumstances a common agent may not be the      instrument of collective negotiation of rates and material      terms. These changes address our primary concerns with the      original language of subsection (e).\1\     \1\ Proposed subsection (e)(1) contains the clause      ``[n]otwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws * * *      .'' We would prefer such language be deleted, although we      understand that Congress has used that language in other      parts of the Copyright Act dealing with statutory licenses.      Even with that language, we note that the substance of      proposed subsection (e)(1) does not appear to authorize      conduct facially at odds with the antitrust laws.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       With respect to proposed subsection (h), ``Licensing to      Affiliates,'' our primary concerns were whether the language      of the bill: (1) adequately defined situations in which right      holders might individually or collectively control an      affiliate, and (2) would have permitted right holders to      impose artificially high license fees on non-affiliates. With      the addition of a definition of an ``affiliated entity'' in      (j)(1) and the replacement of ``similar terms and      conditions'' in subsection (h) with ``no less favorable terms      and conditions,'' we believe that control of affiliates is      adequately defined and that our competitive concern that the      bill would create a likelihood of competitive disadvantage      for non-affiliates has been addressed.       We believe that S. 227, as modified, adequately addresses      the competition concerns of the Department of Justice.       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is      no objection to the submission of this report from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                      Andrew Fois,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
