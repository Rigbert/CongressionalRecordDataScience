Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that there are 225,000 homeless veterans living on the streets on any given night. Other organizations, VSOs, believe that the number is higher, closer to 300,000. Either number is far, far too high and a national travesty.  For these veterans, access to VA benefits, specialized services and effective outreach are vital components to any hope of individual stability and improvement in their prospects. The legislation before the House today, H.R. 2716, is designed to provide assistance to these men and women, with a national goal of ending chronic homelessness among veterans within 10 years.  Mr. Speaker, legislation is about more than programs and regulations; it is about real people. Let me spend just a moment describing to the House the remarkable life of one, just one, but a very, very important guy, who had his life changed because of the VA. It made a major difference in his life.  Stuart Alan Collick is a 39-year-old veteran from my State of New Jersey. Last month he appeared before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to tell his story. Stuart joined the all-volunteer army at the age of 23 and told us he could not think of any higher calling than to serve his country, and he did it with distinction. Stuart had combat service in Grenada, and later distinguished himself as an infantryman in the Persian Gulf War. He holds the Army Service Ribbon with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Southwest Asia Service Ribbon, three Bronze Stars, and three Good Conduct Medals, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge, among other official recognition. He served, as I said, with distinction; and he did his duty.  But, as you know, combat is an extremely unpleasant and a very terrible experience for many and leaves scars that sometimes do not heal. Mr. Collick left the Army in 1992 a disillusioned man and he began drinking, and then he turned to hard drug use. Within 5 years of discharge, he had lost his job, his family and his home, and was on the streets. His life, like that of many other homeless addicted veterans, was in chaos.  Last year, Mr. Collick found the VA Homeless Assistance Program of New Jersey. With the VA's help and with his faith, he turned his life around, finding new ways to cope. He found a job and his own apartment. He developed new friendships and reestablished relationships with his family, which had been severed.  Today Mr. Collick is working as a carpenter and a foreman on the VA's veterans construction team at Lyons, New Jersey, helping to build a commercial greenhouse and teaching other veterans how to build something positive, showing them by his own personal example that there is hope. Today Mr. Collick is a role model. He is an inspiration to his fellow veterans in early recovery and drawing strength from hisown experiences in the Army and in his life.  This is what this bill is all about. The VA's construction project is a plan of the innovative leader of New Jersey's Homeless Assistance Program for Veterans, John Kuhn, who also testified at our hearing and is doing a magnificent job; and he testified with a few other veterans who, likewise, told their stories of being down at the bottom, but finding hope and finding that lifesaver from the VA.  Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to pinpoint any one cause of homelessness among our veterans. Readjustment problems are often associated with direct exposure to combat, such as Mr. Collick's case, and that of thousands, tens of thousands, of others like him, who returned to a seemingly uncaring society.  Also we know that the majority of homeless veterans suffer from mental illness, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Illegal substance abuse often complicates their situations. Some have even served time in jail.  A veteran with an impaired mental state often loses the ability to maintain stable employment. Absent employment, it eventually becomes difficult to maintain any type of permanent housing. The vicious cycle can only accelerate once employment and housing are lost. The absence of these two important anchors, employment and housing, is a precursor for increased utilization of medical resources and emergency rooms, VA and other public hospitals, and, unfortunately, the resources of America's courtrooms, jails and prisons as well.  That is why our legislation takes a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to addressing chronic homelessness among veterans, concentrating the resources of Federal agencies in this campaign. For example, H.R. 2716 authorizes 2,000 additional HUD section 8 low-income housing vouchers phased in over 4 years for homeless veterans in need of permanent housing. These veterans must be enrolled in the VA health care, and priority will be given to veterans under care for mental illnesses or substance abuse disorders. This is a modest proposal that, if successful, I hope will be increased substantially going forward into the future.  H.R. 2617 also authorizes $10 million over 2 years for 10 new Domiciliary for Homeless Veterans programs. These programs, like the one at Lyons, New Jersey, helped Stuart Collick. Again, it was his lifeline; and they have proven to be highly effective, and we need to have more.  The bill improves and expands the VA's homeless grant and per diem program. Currently, recipients of these funds are already contributing substantially to the fulfillment of this bill's objective, to reduce homelessness and provide for the special needs of homeless veterans. This bill authorizes $285 million over 4 years for that program. It also provides a new mechanism for setting per diem payment so it will be adjusted on a regular basis.  Working, as we all know, is an important key to helping homeless veterans rejoin American society, but employment is not possible unless a veteran has access to quality medical care and other supportive services. Safe and drug-free housing is equally important.  The Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program was designed to put homeless veterans back into the labor force. H.R. 2716 extends and increases the authorization level to $250 million over 5 years for this very effective program.  As I indicated, prevention of homelessness among veterans is an important objective of our bill. H.R. 2716 authorizes a demonstration program to learn whether earlier intervention can prevent homelessness among formerly institutionalized veterans. The program would be carried out at six demonstration sites, one of which would be with the Bureau of Prisons facilities. The purpose of this program is to provide incarcerated veterans with referral and counseling about job training, housing, health care and other needs determined necessary to assist the veteran in transition from institutionalized living to civil life.  Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the highlights of our comprehensive bill, the Stuart Collick-Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans' Assistance Act. I believe the bill accomplishes several very important and interrelated goals. It will provide needed assistance to homeless veterans, lift them to a sustainable level that will prevent them from returning to a state of homelessness, and help them to become self-sufficient individuals who are accountable for their own actions.  This bill will also hold all grant and contract recipients accountable for performing their promised services in exchange for government investments and promote a greater opportunity to work across Departments to provide the best possible service for our Nation's homeless veterans. It also sponsors innovative approaches at prevention of homelessness in high-risk groups within the veterans population.  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank my very good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the committee's ranking member, for a bill he introduced earlier, H.R. 936, to improve Homeless Veterans Assistance Programs. The gentleman and his staff have worked in good faith with me and my staff in fashioning a bill that is truly a bipartisan bill that has taken many elements that are out there, made those that are already working hopefully more responsive, hopefully, and, as this bill would do, provide additional resources for them. I do hope that this will move through the House and obviously to the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I add the following for the Record.                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 2001.     Hon. Michael G.

I will include a copy of your letter and this      response in the Committee's report on the bill and the      Congressional Record when the legislation is considered by      the House.       Thank you again for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                             Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                              Committee on Financial Services,                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 2001.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Cannon House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: I understand that the Committee on      Veterans' Affairs recently ordered H.R. 2716, the Stuart      Collick-Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance      Act, reported to the House. As you know, the Committee on      Financial Services was granted an additional referral upon      the bill's introduction pursuant to the Committee's      jurisdiction over housing under rule X of the Rules of the      House of Representatives.       Because of the importance of this matter, I recognize your      desire to bring this legislation before the House in an      expeditious manner and will waive consideration of the bill      by the Financial Services Committee. By agreeing to waive its      consideration of the bill, the Financial Services Committee      does not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 2716. In addition,      the Committee on Financial Services reserves its authority to      seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within      the Financial Services Committee's jurisdiction during any      House-Senate conference that may be convened on this      legislation. I ask your commitment to support any request by      the Committee on Financial Services for conferees on H.R.      2716 or related legislation.       I request that you include this letter and your response as      part of the Congressional Record during consideration of the      legislation on the House floor.       Thank you for your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                 Michael G. Oxley,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
