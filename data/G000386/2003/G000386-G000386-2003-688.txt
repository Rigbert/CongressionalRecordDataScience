 President, today I am reintroducing legislation intended to help states address the educational needs of gifted and talented students. There are approximately 3 million children in the United States who are considered gifted and talented. It is important to note that gifted and talented children are not simply the kids who do well in school and get good grades. In fact, not all gifted students get good grades and not all students who get straight A's are necessarily gifted learners. What makes a child gifted and talented is how he or she learns. Gifted and talented children actually look at the world differently and often have a different way of interacting socially. As a result, gifted and talented students have different educational needs than other students.  I am reminded of an example from my home state of Iowa. I have learned of a third grade student from Iowa City named Jose. Jose was having trouble in school. He didn't always complete his assignments and he had trouble paying attention in class. He was also a bit of a loner and didn't interact much with his classmates. As a result, his teacher saw him as a problem student and struggled to get him to behave like the other children. Still, it was clear to Jose's parents that he had a hunger to learn. He loved to go to the library and was very inquisitive. Over the summer, Jose's parents had his IQ tested and he was found to have a high level of intelligence. As a result, when he started school again in the fall, his parents asked that he be identified as gifted and receive services. Jose now leaves his regular classroom a couple of times a week for what Iowa City schools call the ``extended learning program.'' As a result, he is finally receiving the stimulation he was lacking at school. Jose now enjoys school more, has made new friends, and is doing great with his regular school work.  Gifted and talented children have enormous potential. Today's gifted and talented child may grow up to become a leader in the field of science or a world-renowned performer. However, this will not happen automatically. Gifted and talented children need to be challenged and their unique skills must be nurtured. Currently, many gifted and talented children do not receive the educational programs and services they need to live up to their potential. In fact, many gifted and talented children lose interest in school; they learn how to expend minimum effort for top grades, have low motivation, and develop poor work habits. Some may abandon their education altogether and drop out of school. This is a tragedy not only for the students, but also for our society.  We hear a lot about how the United States has a shortage of individuals with the skills in math and science that are necessary for our Nation to continue to be competitive in today's global economy. Our security agencies are scrambling to find linguists who know or can quickly learn foreign languages. In fact, one of the findings included in my bill states, ``To meet the future economic and national security needs of the United States, it is important that more students achieve to higher levels, and that highly capable students receive an education that prepares them to perform the most highly innovative and creative work that is necessary to secure our Nation's position in the world.''  In times of national crisis or uncertainty, the United States has always turned to its best and brightest to solve whatever problems face us. The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union brought to national attention for the first time the need to develop the special gifts and talents of young Americans. Once again, we find ourselves in a time of uncertainty, facing new threats and challenges that we are struggling to understand. In order to ensure that our country is prepared to face whatever unforeseen problems will come our way in the future, we must invest now in this vital national resource, gifted students.  My legislation is not intended to make the education of gifted and talented students primarily a Federal responsibility. Education is, and should be, chiefly a State and local responsibility. Nevertheless, the Federal Government does have a role to play. The availability and quality of gifted and talented educational services currently varies widely from State to State. This situation has an especially adverse effect on disadvantaged gifted students whose parents cannot afford to pay for private programs or summer camps. Untimately, gifted and talented students in every public school should have access to specialized educational services that are designed to address their learning needs. Still, my bill would simply provide the seed money to help States begin to expand the availability of gifted education services.  My gifted and talented initiative would distribute grants, based on a State's student population, to each State education agency. States will then provide grants to local school districts on a competitive basis to be used to identify and provide educational services to gifted and talented students from all economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, including students with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities. Rather than providing a steady Federal funding stream directly to the local level, on which schools might become dependent, the competitive subgrants will allow States to target school districts that need to jump-start their gifted and talented program. At the same time, the local competitive grant process will encourage State education agencies to more closely examine the needs of gifted children in their respective States.  At least 90 percent of the funds provided to a State must be subgranted to school districts and the funds must supplement, not supplant, funds currently being spent. Additionally, States must make their own commitment to gifted and talented students by matching 10 percent of the Federal funds, either in cash or in kind. All of this is intended to help gifted and talents programs and services take root in each State and in local school districts so that they can grow and develop to fully address the unique educational needs of this special group of students.  I have intentionally included a broad range of authorized uses for the grants in my bill in order to allow States and local school districts the flexibility to address their specific needs. School districts can use these funds to provide professional development for personnel involved in the education of gifted and talented students, including gifted education teachers, general education teachers, and other school personnel like administrators and school counselors. The funds can also be used to provide direct educational services and materials. Or, school districts could use the funds to support items like innovative strategies for teaching gifted students, making materials available through regional centers, or providing high-level course work through distance learning technology.  The Federal involvement in gifted and talented education is not new. The Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act has provided valuable information on strategies to meet the needs of gifted students since 1988 through the funding of demonstration grants and the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented. In the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Congress expanded the Javits Act to authorize competitive grants to States to expand the capacity of States to meet the needs of gifted students. These new grants represent some potential to improve the ability of select States to address the needs of gifted and talented children, and I am pleased with the progress we have been able to make thus far. My legislation would build on the existing Javits Act to create a comprehensive approach to expanding the ability of States and school districts nationwide to meet the needs of gifted and talented students.  Congress has rightly placed a renewed emphasis on making sure all children are successful learners. In our efforts to leave no child behind, we must not forget gifted and talented students. I would remind my colleagues of the example I cited earlier. Jose is a success story because his parents saw his potential and pointed it out to school officials, and because he attended a school where quality gifted education services are available. There are many more students like Jose across the country who have either not been identified as gifted or who attend a school where gifted education services are not provided. I would urge my colleagues to join me in seeing that these exceptional young people across our great Nation have the support and services they need to be successful. I ask for your support for the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 501       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. GRANT PROGRAM FOR GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Gifted and      Talented Students Education Act of 2003''.       (b) Amendment.--Subpart 6 of part D of title V of the      Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.      7253 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:      ``Chapter B--Grant Program For Gifted and Talented Students     ``SEC. 5467. FINDINGS; ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM; AUTHORIZED                    ACTIVITIES.       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       ``(1) Gifted and talented students give evidence of high      performance capability in specific academic fields, or in      areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership      capacity, and require services or activities not ordinarily      provided by a school in order to fully develop such      capabilities. Gifted and talented students are from all      cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic      groups. Some such students have disabilities and for some,      English is not their first language. Many students from such      diverse backgrounds have been historically underrepresented      in gifted education programs.       ``(2) Elementary school students who are gifted and      talented have already mastered 35 to 50 percent of the      material covered in a school year in several subject areas      before the school year begins.       ``(3) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have      students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits,      characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some      training to meet the needs of these students, such as      students with limited English proficiency, students with      disabilities, and students from diverse cultural and racial      backgrounds. However, most teachers do not receive training      on meeting the needs of students who are gifted and talented.       ``(4) While the families or communities of some gifted      students can provide private programs with appropriately      trained staff to supplement public educational offerings,      most high-ability students, especially those from inner      cities, rural communities, or low-income families, must rely      on the services and personnel provided by public schools.      Therefore, gifted education programs, provided by qualified      professionals in the public schools, are needed to provide      equal educational opportunities.       ``(5) Parents and families are essential partners to      schools in developing appropriate educational services for      gifted and talented students. They need access to      information, research, and support regarding the      characteristics of gifted children and their educational, and      social and emotional needs, as well as information on      available strategies and resources for education in State and      local communities.       ``(6) There currently is no Federal requirement to identify      or serve the Nation's approximately 3,000,000 gifted and      talented students.       ``(7) While some States and local educational agencies      allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students,      others do not. Additionally, State laws, and State and local      funding, identification, and accountability mechanisms vary      widely, resulting in a vast disparity of services for this      special-needs population.       ``(8) To meet the future economic and national security      needs of the United States, it is important that more      students achieve to higher levels, and that highly capable      students receive an education that prepares them to perform      the most highly innovative and creative work that is      necessary to secure our Nation's position in the world.       ``(9) The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in      the United States on the Third International Mathematics and      Science Study (TIMSS) was among the lowest in the world. In      each of 5 physics content areas in the study and in each of 3      mathematics content areas in the study, the performance of      physics and advanced mathematics students in the United      States was among the lowest of the participating countries.       ``(10) In 1990, fewer than 2 cents out of every $100 spent      on elementary and secondary education in the United States      was     devoted to providing challenging programming for the Nation's      gifted and talented students.       ``(b) Program Authorized.--       ``(1) Competitive grants to states.--If the amount      appropriated under section 5468 for a fiscal year is greater      than $7,500,000 but less than $57,500,000, then the Secretary      may use such amount to award grants, on a competitive basis,      to State educational agencies to enable the State educational      agencies to award grants to local educational agencies under      section 5467C for developing or expanding gifted and talented      education programs, and providing direct educational services      and materials.       ``(2) Formula grants to states.--If the amount appropriated      under section 5468 for a fiscal year equals or exceeds      $57,500,000, then the Secretary may use such amount to award      grants to State educational agencies, from allotments under      section 5467B, to enable the State educational agencies to      award grants to local educational agencies under section      5467C for developing or expanding gifted and talented      education programs, and providing direct educational services      and materials.       ``(c) Authorized Activities.--Grant funds provided under      this chapter shall be used to carry out 1 or more of the      following activities:       ``(1) Any activity described in paragraph (2), (4), (6), or      (7) of section 5464(b).       ``(2) Providing direct educational services and materials      to gifted and talented students, which may include curriculum      compacting, modified or adapted curriculum, acceleration,      independent study, and dual enrollment.       ``(d) Limitations on Use of Funds.--       ``(1) Course work provided through emerging technologies.--     Grant funds provided under this chapter that are used for      activities described in section 5464(b)(7) may include      development of curriculum packages, compensation of distance-     learning educators, or other relevant activities, but grant      funds provided under this chapter may not be used for the      purchase or upgrading of technological hardware.       ``(2) State use of funds.--       ``(A) In general.--A State educational agency receiving a      grant under this chapter may not use more than 10 percent of      the grant funds for--       ``(i) dissemination of general program information;       ``(ii) providing technical assistance under this chapter;       ``(iii) monitoring and evaluation of programs and      activities assisted under this chapter;       ``(iv) providing support for parental education; or       ``(v) creating a State gifted education advisory board.       ``(B) Administrative costs.--A State educational agency may      use not more than 50 percent of the funds made available to      the State educational agency under subparagraph (A) for      administrative costs.     ``SEC. 5467A.
