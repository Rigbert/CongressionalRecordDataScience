 President, I rise today to express my serious concerns about the President's nominee to Chair the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Mary Sheila Gall.  The Consumer Product Safety Commission was created nearly 30 years ago with the mission of protecting our families from consumer products that pose serious health or safety risks. The Commission serves as the consumer advocate for our Nation's children, protecting them from potentially dangerous, and in some cases deadly, products. In short, the Commission is charged with saving lives, and it has done so with great success over the past several years. This success is based primarily on the advocacy role that the Commission has assumed in fulfilling its duties for America's families and children. And it is Ms. Gall's apparent opposition to this advocacy role that has given me serious concerns about her nomination.  As a Commissioner for the past ten years, Ms. Gall has opposed reasonable attempts to review questionable products and implement common sense protections for consumers. Perhaps the most troubling example of this trend has been Ms. Gall's record on fire safety issues. Ms. Gall opposed a review of upholstered furniture flammability and small open flame ignition sources, such as matches, lighters, and candles. In opposing the review, she stated that ``. . . the benefits from imposing a small open flame ignition standard on upholstered furniture are overestimated.''  With all sincerity, I doubt that the brave men and women who risk their lives every day fighting house fires in Delaware and throughout the Nation would agree with that assessment. Nor would they agree with Ms. Gall's decision to walk away from fire safety standards for children's sleepwear. In 1996, Ms. Gall voted to weaken fire safety standards that required children's sleepwear to be made from flame-resistant fabrics. Ms. Gall joined another commissioner in exempting from this standard any sleepwear for children less than nine months old, and any sleepwear that is tight-fitting for children sizes 7-14. I support the original standard, which worked for more than two decades before it was weakened by the Commission. And I have cosponsored legislation with my former colleague from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth, that called on the Commission to restore the original standard that all children's sleepwear be flame-resistant.  But it's not just her record on children's sleepwear and fire safety issues that concerns me about Ms. Gall. She has turned her back on children and families on a number of occasions, rejecting moderate, common-sense warnings and improvements dealing with choking hazards, bunk bed slats, and crib slats. In some of these cases, Ms. Gall has even opposed efforts to merely review questionable products, to mention nothing about imposing regulatory standards to correct any potentially dangerous problems. For instance, Ms. Gall opposed a safety review of baby walkers that, according to the Commission, were associated with 11 child deaths between 1989 and 1994, and as many as 28,000 child injuries in 1994, alone.  This safety review brought to light ways to produce walkers that were safer for children, which were then used by manufacturers to develop a voluntary standard for producing a safer product. This voluntary standard was applied within the industry, and a media campaign followed to educate parents about the new, safer walkers that were entering the marketplace. The Commission has estimated that since the review process took place in 1995, injuries related to baby walkers dropped nearly 60 percent for children under 15 months of age, from an estimated 20,100 injuries in 1995 to 8,800 in 1999.  These statistics are proof that the Commission's role as child advocate produces results. But if Ms. Gall had her way, we would not have had a review of baby walkers at all. And without this review, it is unlikely we would have had the important voluntary standards that have protected thousands of children. If Ms. Gall is unwilling to even take the first step in reviewing potentially dangerous products, I question whether we can expect her to fulfill the Commission's responsibility as the Nation's child advocate.  I do not make this decision to oppose Mary Sheila Gall's nomination lightly. I have long recognized that the President should generally be entitled to have an administration comprised of people of his choosing. While his selections should be given considerable deference, that power is nonetheless limited by the duty of the United States Senate to provide ``advice and consent'' to such appointments.  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have supported countless nominees for Cabinet and other high-level positions, including many with whom I have disagreed on certain policies. But I have also cast my vote against confirmation when I have become convinced that the nominee is not suitable to fill the role to which the person was nominated. I have reluctantly reached the conclusion that this is one such case. It is one thing to serve as a commissioner, as Ms. Gall has done these past ten years. But serving as chair of this important Commission is a very different role. As such, I strongly urge my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to oppose Ms. Gall's nomination as Chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. To put it simply, there is nothing less than children's lives at stake.                          ____________________
