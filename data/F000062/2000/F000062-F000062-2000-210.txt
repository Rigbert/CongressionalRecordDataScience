 President, I think it has been pretty clear, at least to me and certainly to the State of California, the city of Chicago, the city of Los Angeles, the city of San Diego, and other cities around this country, that either an implicit or explicit policy or practice of promoting children when they are failing or when they don't even show up in school is probably the leading cause for many of us for the decline of quality public education across this great country.  It isn't politically correct to say we will no longer permit social promotion, but it can make a huge difference in where this Nation goes. This amendment is very carefully crafted to say that Federal education dollars will not be available to a jurisdiction if the State does not have a policy to prohibit the practice of social promotion. If we leave the details to the State and local communities, it does not tell them how, when, or where to do it. It simply says that Federal moneys are contingent upon the abolition of that practice. The fact is that the States are moving in this direction. The fact is that there is still no accountable standards.  I wish to stress that it does allow for remedial education; it does allow for Federal dollars to be used for remedial education.  I thank the Chair.
