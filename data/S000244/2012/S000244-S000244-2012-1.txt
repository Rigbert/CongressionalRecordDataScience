Speaker, I rise today to join the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rivera) in mourning the passing of Steve Vermillion. I gave Steve Vermillion one of his first jobs on Capitol Hill and taught him about the legislative process. He was a man of unquestioned ability, a man of deep integrity, and a man of great commitment to his principles and love of this country and the democracy that we have built and nurtured over the last 230-plus years.  His service to other Members of Congress, as well as in the private sector, was marked by making a difference. No one who worked with Steve Vermillion or who was touched by his life came away a poorer person from it. He enriched all of our lives. He made a great contribution, and I join with the gentleman from Florida in expressing our sympathies to his wife, Jennifer, and to his two children on his passage.  May his soul rest in peace.                          ____________________
