President, I rise today to shed some light on a subject that is very important to me in my oversight duties as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Earlier this year, the Environment and Public Works Committee held an oversight hearing where the committee heard testimony from the General Accounting Office and the EPA inspector general regarding a 10-year history of numerous problems with the management of grant dollars at the Environmental Protection Agency.  Some of the problems included EPA not requiring grant recipients to demonstrate real environmental benefits for grants, EPA not requiring competition in its grants awards, and a general lack of oversight of EPA grant officers and recipients. The EPA inspector general released an audit only 2 days before the hearing, finding that a particular nonprofit guaranty had violated the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and with nearly $5 million of EPA grant funding.  Members may recall, because I talked about it at that time, that it was the Consumer Federation of America, which is a 501(c)(4), that had been a recipient of discretionary grants from the EPA. That is a 501(c)(4) as in lobbying organization. They support candidates. It is strictly against the law.  Over the last few months, my staff has done considerable research into the EPA grant and confirmed many of the problems and also found the EPA has a long history of awarding grant dollars without competition to some well-known nonprofit environmental groups that regularly engage in political activity. My staff has compiled some of these findings in this 30-page report to the chairman.  In examining how the environmental groups receive and spend their Federal dollars, it became apparent they receive funding from numerous sources, including large foundations. Within these organizations, political and grassroots efforts quickly became difficult to differentiate the sources of their funding and how they spend them. Therefore, I instructed my staff to examine the funding and expenditure records of the organizations. That has resulted in a second report which is the focus of my remarks today.  My staff has compiled this information into a 15-page report for the chairman to provide some preliminary examples describing five of the most widely politically active environmental groups, the description of their activity, the foundations that provide the financial support for these groups, and the interconnected web among all those organizations.  Interestingly, these environmental groups are all tax-exempt, IRS-registered 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, meaning contributions to these groups are tax deductible. These groups profess to be the greatest stewards of the environment and solicit contributions from a variety of sources by that claim. But they demonstrate more interest in giving apocalyptic environmental scenarios to raise money for raw political purposes rather than working together to improve the environment for America.  We have money from foundations, individuals, and government grants going into environmental groups, and then they turn around and put these out to the 501(c)(3), 527 organizations and 501(c)(4), these are political organizations. All these nonprofit groups are also closely associated and fund their affiliated 501(c)(4) lobbying organizations and the 527 political organizations.  This report could not be more timely as the Washington Post, as recently as September 27 of this year, published an article demonstrating that IRS 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), and 527 organizations are all engaged in political activity this election cycle with expenditures designed to circumvent the prohibitions in the bipartisan campaign Reform Act of 2002, otherwise known as McCain-Feingold.  This article quoted a Federal Election Commission official stating:       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, evidence      is mounting that money is slithering through on other      routes as organizations maintain various accounts,      tripping over each other, shifting money between      501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and 527's. . . . It's big money.  Why is this important? Because the environment is important to all Americans. Despite what we hear from the groups in their attack advertisements against President Bush and the Republican candidates across the Nation, our air is cleaner, water more drinkable, and our forests are becoming healthier.  Keep in mind this is over a period of time when we have almost doubled the amount of miles that are driven, and our population is dramatically increasing. Yet things are cleaner than they were before.  For instance, over the last 30 years we have cut air pollution in half. Why, then, are some extremists spending millions upon millions to hijack the conservation movement? It seems to me that it is more important to the leadership of these groups to turn their once laudable movement into a political machine by sending out their bipartisan snake oil, salesmen, and misleading the American public regarding their purely politically partisan agenda under the guise of environmental protection.  Our Nation's father of conservation, Teddy Roosevelt, said:       To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and      exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its      usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our      children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand      down to them amplified and developed.  These words ring true today, but unfortunately it is clear that the environmentalist movement is deaf to them. What we find now is the fleecing of the American public's pocketbooks by the environmental movement for their political use. What we find now is exhausting litigation, instigation of false claims, misleading science, and scare tactics to fool Americans into believing disastrous environmental scenarios that are untrue.  Pay close attention to the webs of this incestuous activity of these environmentalists groups and their financial benefactors. Environmental organizations have become experts at duplicitous activity, skirting laws up to the edge of illegality, and burying their political activities under the guise of nonprofit environmental improvement.  Chart No. 2 demonstrates the interconnection environmental family affair with nonprofits and their benefactors. As we can see, six organizations at the bottom of the chart are all either 527 groups or 501(c)(4)s. These are political organizations. Money that comes up here--for example, the Heinz Foundation, goes to the various organizations and ultimately gets to the Environmental Accounting Fund, the Save the Environment Organization, Action Fund, Sierra Club Votes, Defenders of Wildlife, Environment 2004. These are all either 501(c)(4)s or 527 organizations.  The LCV calls itself the political voice of the national environmental movement, and much of its grants from even its 501(c)(3) organizations go to fund voter mobilization and education drives. In each election cycle, LCV endorses congressional candidates and since 1996 has published a ``dirty dozen'' list. They brag about the dirty dozen list that has been very effective, but the LCV mostly singles out only Republican candidates.  What we are talking about is the money that is channeled from 501(c)(3) organizations is going to defeat Republican candidates.  Mr. President, let me provide some examples. So far this year, the LCV has released a ``Dirty Dozen'' list of eight congressional candidates--seven Republicans and one Democrat. For the first time ever, it includes the President and Vice President. I cannot forget that LCV has, of course, endorsed the junior Senator from Massachusetts for President, the earliest endorsement of a Presidential contender in its 34-year history.  The LCV's 527 organization last reported to have raised over $3.3 million in the 2004 election cycle. This is chart No. 3: $3.3 million. It has also joined with Environment2004, another 527 political organization directed by former Clinton administration EPA staffers purchasing air time to run ads against the President.  Interestingly, not all candidates appreciate LCV's help.  I recently read where the senior Senator from South Dakota requested the LCV not air advertisements in the South Dakota Senate contest this year and even characterized outside organization advertisements as ``often too negative, too personal, and lack any real substance.''  However, LCV has a long history of political involvement. This is chart No. 4. In 1996, LCV spent a total of $1.5 million in ads trying to defeat its ``Dirty Dozen'' list of targets of 11 Republicans and 1 Democrat.  In 1998, LCV spent $2.3 million targeting its ``Dirty Dozen'' list of 12 Republican candidates and 1 Democratic candidate.  In 2000, the LCV spent a total of $4 million, again targeting 11 Republicans and 1 Democrat on its ``Dirty Dozen'' list. And I cannot forget, in 2000 the LCV also endorsed Al Gore for President.  In 2002, the LCV once again targeted 11 Republican congressional candidates and 1 Democrat.  I see a partisan pattern that is well developed here. LCV spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in congressional contests against Republican candidates. However, the strongest effort seems to have been focused on Senator Allard. The LCV claims to have budgeted a total of $700,000 for that race alone and hired a campaign staff of 12 to coordinate phone banks and precinct walks in addition to running television and radio advertisements. Altogether, LCV is reported to have spent $1.5 million in independent expenditures during the 2002 election cycle. Of that total amount, LCV spent $1.313 million benefiting Democratic candidates while only spending $136,000 for Republican candidates.  Another example is the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club describes itself as ``America's oldest, largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization.'' Sierra Club is also an IRS-registered, tax-exempt, nonprofit 501(c)(3) foundation. Here we go again. The Sierra Club Foundation is closely affiliated with its Sierra Club 501(c)(4) and section 527 political organizations. In fact, the Washington Post detailed the interconnected organizations of the Sierra Club in an article it featured last Monday. This is what the Post printed:       Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of interlocking      roles than Carl Pope, one of the most influential operatives      on the Democratic side in the 2004 election. As executive      director of the Sierra Club, a major 501(c)(4) environmental      lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra Club Voter Education      Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund 527 has raised $3.4      million this election cycle, with $2.4 million of that amount      coming from the Sierra Club. A third group, the Sierra Club      PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million to Democratic      candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.  The Sierra Club is consistently critical of the Bush environmental record and sometimes others as well. The Sierra Club even accused me of trying toraise the levels of mercury pollution. The Sierra Club's 527 political organization reports to have raised over $6.8 million for the 2004 election cycle alone, with a goal of over $8 million by the end of the month.  Like the LCV, the Sierra Club has a history of involvement in politics. In the year 2000 Presidential contest, the Sierra Club spent several hundred thousand dollars in advertisements attacking President Bush. And in the 2002 election cycle, the Sierra Club endorsed 184 Democratic incumbents and challengers and endorsed 10 Republican candidates--184 Democrats and 10 Republicans. Not surprisingly, the Sierra Club is heavily involved in the 2004 political cycle. The Sierra Club began spending early in the 2004 Presidential contest and has made a series of endorsements this year. Of course, the Sierra Club has endorsed the junior Senator from Massachusetts for President, and it has endorsed 16 Democratic Senate incumbents and challengers and no Republican candidates--16 Democrats, no Republicans. In races for the House of Representatives, the Sierra Club has endorsed 114 Democratic incumbents and challengers and has endorsed 7 Republican candidates.  Let me use one more example briefly--the Natural Resources Defense Council. The NRDC is also an IRS-registered, tax-exempt, nonprofit 501(c)(3) receiving $55 million in tax-deductible contributions--these are tax-deductible contributions; no money going into the Treasury--in just the last year running bogus ads like this one on this chart claiming President Bush is rolling back a mercury regulation that never existed. This is an outrageous lie. I do not remember how much this ad cost, but if you look, this was a full-page ad run in the New York Times. Down here it says:       Yes, I want to join the Natural Resources Defense Council      and help thwart President Bush's plan to weaken controls on      toxic mercury.  There are already controls on toxic mercury. This is an outrageous lie. How can you lower something that does not exist? The truth is, President Bush's Clear Skies legislative proposal, which I support, is the biggest emissions reduction plan ever proposed by any American President. Over 14 years, it would reduce emissions from powerplants of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and mercury emissions from powerplants by 70 percent. Let's be sure and understand that the NRDC deliberately lied in this ad because you cannot roll back standards that do not exist.  The NRDC is affiliated with the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization--here we go again--and the Environmental Accountability Fund, its section 527 political organization. The NRDC describes itself as ``the nation's most effective environmental action organization,'' and has a long history of political activity.  The NRDC has joined this year with LCV and the Sierra Club to air television and radio ads and hire campaign staffs to work against President Bush in several States, including New Mexico, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada. Overall, the Environmental Accountability Fund, NRDC's 527 organization, last reported to have raised nearly $1 million in the 2004 election cycle.  Well, that is three of the culprits. The report outlines two others in depth--Greenpeace and Environmental Defense--and shows similar patterns of partisan fundraising and spending, such as this Greenpeace ad that equates President Bush's conservation policies to the Texas chainsaw massacre--a disgusting comparison, especially considering that historic healthy forest legislation was proposed and passed by this administration. It is sad that many of these groups would rather watch our forests burn and our watersheds become destroyed rather than employ 21st century forest management technology to improve forest health.  But misleading and scaring the American people during a Presidential election year, I guess, is more important to them than true forest health.  501(c)(3)s, 501(c)(4)s, political action committees, and 527 political organizations--it is all tangled up in a web. Back to that chart we used, chart No. 2, you can see how convoluted it is.  But the money all ends up down here being used for political purposes, millions upon millions of dollars going for partisan political activity while these groups attempt to maintain a nonpartisan cloak and justification that they are helping our environment. But these funds do not just come from scared mothers and others furiously writing checks because these groups have lied to them and told them that eating fish will kill their children. Our research has found that much of the funding these groups receive comes from independent foundations and trusts which also claim to be nonpartisan.  Let's take a look now at some of these nonpartisan institutions and how their money finds its way to this intricately growing web. The Heinz foundations are a few of the largest contributors to these nonprofit environmental organizations. And, of course, Mrs. Teresa Heinz Kerry is either a chairperson of the board of trustees or a member of the board of trustees of each one of these foundations.  In fact, Mrs. Heinz Kerry is the head of the $1.2 billion Heinz Foundation Endowment.  Since 1998, these foundations have contributed nearly $3 million to the Sierra Club, LCV, the NRDC, and Environmental Defense. Each foundation is also a large contributor to the Tides Center and the Tides Foundation, contributing over $6 million since 1998. The Tides organization has in turn also contributed over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and the NRDC over the same period of time.  Another major supporter is the Turner Foundation, founded in 1990 by Ted Turner, who is chairman of the foundation board of trustees. The Turner Foundation sponsors the work of its special projects which include the Partnership Project, comprised of 20 national environmental groups. Since 1998, the Turner Foundation has contributed over $6.4 million to the Partnership Project. Individually, the Turner Foundation has contributed more than $20 million to the LCV since 1998; over $2.6 million to the NRDC; over $1 million to the Sierra Club; and nearly $2 million to Environmental Defense, Earth Justice, and Greenpeace.  Finally, another large supporter is the Pew Charitable Trust. You can follow the lines of the money there. It claims it is an independent nonprofit serving to inform the public on key issues. Two of the Pew's environmental priorities include global warming and wilderness protection. Pew has contributed $17.4 million to Clear the Air Campaign since 1999, with which it publishes materials such as this claiming that the Bush plan means more pollution. Again, another impossible lie because you can't roll back mercury standards that don't exist.  Perhaps wilderness protection is where the Pew shows its true colors. It has joined with the Heritage Force Campaign, the Natural Resource Defense Council, Environmental Defense, and the Sierra Club in a campaign characterizing the President's conservation policies as ``Crazy George's National Forest Give-a-Way.'' Once again, it is silly scare ads like this. For them, it is only about politics, not about true forest management.  We should be more scared of this tangled web of political financing and the fact that there is no way to tell where taxpayer funded grants and private dollars cross. These are the grants we started out talking about. It is also convoluted where advocacy funding and political funding intermingle and even if environmental groups really spend any money actually improving the environment.  Since 1998, Pew Foundation has contributed several million dollars to various environmental organizations. These contributions have included nearly $18 million to Earth Justice; over $3 million to NRDC; over $3.7 million to Environmental Defense. Pew has also contributed $32.6 million to the Tides Center and Foundation over the same period. The Tides organization has contributed over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, NRDC, among others, since 1998.  This does not even represent all of the political involvement of environmental extremists. These groups have established an unquestionable record of partisanship and demonstrated a slithering flow of money among themselves and from their financial benefactors.  Today's environmental groups are simply Democratic political machinesraising millions of dollars in contributions and spending millions in expenditures each year for the purpose of raising more money to pursue their agenda. Especially in this election year, the American voters should see these groups and their many affiliated organizations as they are--the newest insidious conspiracy of political action committees and perhaps the newest multimillion dollar manipulation of Federal election laws.  I ask unanimous consent that the reports be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Political Activity of Environmental Groups and Their Supporting                               Foundations                       questionably non-partisan       Following the League of Conservation Voters' endorsement of      Senator John Kerry for President, The Hill, a Capitol Hill      publication, published an article featuring the financial      connection between the League of Conservation Voters and      Heinz family foundations. The article further featured the      connections between the League of Conservation Voters and      other well-known environmental groups such as the Natural      Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense and their      financial links to Heinz family foundations as well. The Hill      article cited specific contributions such as a $56,000      contribution in 2003 to the Natural Resources Defense Council      from a Heinz family foundation and three $200,000      contributions from two Heinz family foundations from 2001 to      2003 to Environmental Defense. The article revealed that Ms.      Teresa Heinz Kerry is the chairperson or board member on each      Heinz family foundation, and since 2000, the Heinz      foundations have given nearly $1 million to the League of      Conservation Voters, members of its board, and the groups      those board members represent.       Groups such as the League of Conservation Voters, the      Natural Resources Defense Council, and Environmental Defense      represent themselves as organizations concerned about the      protection of the environment. They are all tax exempt      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered 501(c)(3)      organizations often associated with 501(c)(4), 527 political      organizations, or other affiliated organizations. However, as      recently as September 27, 2004, the Washington Post published      an article demonstrating that IRS designated 501(c)(3),      501(c)(4), and 527 organizations are all engaged in political      activity this election year with expenditures potentially      designed to circumvent the prohibitions in the Bipartisan      Campaign Reform Act of 2002, otherwise known as McCain-     Feingold. The article quoted a former Federal Election      Commission official stating.       ``In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money,      evidence is mounting that money is slithering through on      other routes as organizations maintain various accounts,      tripping over each other, shifting money between 501(c)(3)'s,      (c)(4)'s, and 527's. . . . It's big money, and the pendulum      has swung too far in their direction.''       This report for the Chairman provides preliminary examples      describing five of the most widely politically active      environmental groups with a description of their activity and      the foundations that provide the financial support for those      groups.                      environmental organizations                     League of conservation voters       Beginning with the League of Conservation Voters (LCV)      provides an appropriate beginning because the LCV board of      directors is comprised of various representatives from a      number of other environmental groups. Among those sitting on      either the LCV board of directors, LCV political advisory      committee, or the LCV political committee are leaders in the      following organizations:       --Natural Resources Defense Council       --Environmental Defense       --Sierra Club       --Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund       --The Wilderness Society       --Trust for Public Lands       --Defenders of Wildlife       --U.S. Public Interest Research Group       --National Wildlife Federation       --Environmental Working Group       The LCV is an IRS registered 501(c)(4) organization      affiliated with the LCV Education Fund, a 501(c)(3)      organization. The LCV is also affiliated with a LCV political      action committee, a section 527 organization, and another      501(c)(4) organization, the LCV Accountability Project. The      LCV describes its affiliates as the ``LCV family of      organizations'' and describes its work as ``the political      voice of the national environmental movement and the only      organization devoted full-time to shaping a pro-     environment Congress and White House.'' Since 1996, a      symbol of the political activity of the LCV has been the      Dirty Dozen list it publishes each election year. The LCV      represents that it has defeated 28 of 49 candidates      targeted by its Dirty Dozen campaigns since 1996. Citing      two examples from the 2000 election year, the LCV contends      on its Web site,       ``How much impact can LCV campaigns make on national      policy? In 2000, two of the most dangerous anti-     environmentalists in the U.S. Senate--Spencer Abraham of      Michigan and Slade Gorton of Washington--were defeated by      less than 1% following major LCV campaigns. In a Congress      closely divided on the environment, these LCV victories can      make all the difference.''       Senators Abraham of Michigan and Slade Gorton of Washington      were both Republicans running for reelection in 2000. In      fact, in 1996, the LCV spent a total of $1.5 million dollars      sending 254,000 direct mail pieces and airing 9,000      television and radio advertisements attempting to defeat its      Dirty Dozen list of eleven Republican congressional      candidates and one Democrat congressional candidate.       In 1998, the LCV Dirty Dozen list targeted twelve      Republican congressional candidates and one Democrat      congressional candidate for defeat--spending a total of $2.3      million. The LCV spent in many cases over $200,000 per      congressional race--airing television and radio      advertisements and sending direct mail pieces. In the Nevada      Senate race, LCV aired a total of 661 individual television      airings against the Republican candidate. LCV spent up to      $420,000 in the Wisconsin Senate race against the Republican      candidate.       In 2000, the LCV spent a total of $4 million--again      targeting eleven Republican congressional candidates and one      Democrat congressional candidate on its Dirty Dozen list. The      LCV spent up to $444,000 in the Washington Senate race,      $520,000 in the Virginia Senate race, and $705,000 in the      Michigan Senate race, all in an effort to defeat Republican      candidates. However, the LCV also reported spending $52,000      to attempt to defeat Congressman Traficant of Ohio for re-     election, the only Democrat on the LCV Dirty Dozen for 2000.      Additionally, in May of 2000, the LCV endorsed Al Gore for      President.       In 2002, the LCV again targeted eleven Republican      congressional candidates and one Democrat congressional      candidate with television and radio advertisements including      a television advertisement in the South Dakota Senate race      implying that the Republican candidate's environmental      positions were bought by campaign contributions. The LCV sent      thousands of direct mail pieces including 100,000 pieces      mailed in the Georgia Senate race and 75,000 pieces sent in      the New Hampshire Senate race--both against Republican      candidates. The LCV also joined other organizations and spent      a total of $570,000 against the New Hampshire Republican      Senate candidate. However, the strongest effort seems to have      been focused on the Colorado Senate contest. The LCV budgeted      a total of $700,000 for this race against incumbent      Republican Senator Wayne Allard. The LCV hired a campaign      staff of twelve against Senator Allard to coordinate phone      banks and precinct walks in addition to running television      and radio advertisements that LCV claims reached sixty-seven      percent of the state. altogether, the LCV is reported to have      spent $1,449,951 in independent expenditures during the 2002      election cycle. Of that total amount, LCV spent $1,313,041      benefitting Democrat candidates while only spending $136,910      for Republican candidates.       Although the LCV has yet to release its completed Dirty      Dozen list for the 2004 campaign year at the time of this      report, it has released a Dirty Dozen list of eight      Congressional candidates, seven Republicans and one Democrat.      For the first time it has included the President and Vice      President on its Dirty Dozen list. The LCV has endorsed      forty-two candidates in Congressional elections in addition      to endorsing Senator John Kerry for President. In fact, the      LCV's endorsement of Senator Kerry is the earliest      endorsement of a Presidential contender in the thirty-four      year history of the LCV. Of the forty-two candidates endorsed      by the LCV at the time of this report, thirty-one are      Democrat candidates, and ten Republicans are candidates.       As in previous election cycles, the LCV is active this year      airing political advertisements--already spending $100,000 to      elect a Democrat candidate in a Kentucky congressional      special election this year. The LCV is also reported to have      already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Senator      John Kerry's Presidential campaign including joining with      Environment2004, a 527 political organization, purchasing air      time in Florida and Washington, D.C. At the time of this      report, Environment2004 last reported to have raised over      $600,000 in the 2004 election cycle. The LCV's 527      organization last reported to have raised over $3.3      million in the 2004 election cycle.       However not all candidates appreciate LCV's help. The      senior senator from South Dakota is reported to have      specifically written LCV characterizing outside organization      advertisements, like those aired by LCV, as ``often too      negative, too personal, and lack any real substance.'' He      further requested that the LCV not air advertisements in the      South Dakota Senate contest this year.                   Natural Resources Defense Council       The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is an IRS      registered 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization affiliated with      the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization. The NRDC is      also affiliated with the Environmental Accountability Fund, a      section 527 political organization. The NRDC's mission      statement is to ``safeguard the Earth: its people, its plants      and animals and the natural systems on which all life      depends;'' additionally, the NRDC describes itself as ``the      nation's most effective environmental action organization.       Since the beginning of the Bush Administration, the NRDC      has compiled a ``Bush Record'' on its Web site characterizing      the Bush Administration as, ``in catering to industries that      put America's health and natural heritage at risk, threatens      to do more     damage to our environmental protections than any other in      U.S. history.       The NRDC has a long history of political activity. As early      as 1982, NRDC spent a record $2.5 million with other      environmental organizations on congressional and      gubernatorial races to ``oust Reagan supporters. The NRDC is      also involved in this year's Presidential race joining with      LCV and the Sierra Club to work against President Bush in the      state of New Mexico which has been characterized as a      ``battleground state'' this year. The Albuquerque Journal      reports that NRDC has already aired television and radio      advertisements against the Bush Administration's      environmental record joining the LCV and Sierra Club working      to hire their own campaign staffs against the Bush candidacy.      The NRDC's Environmental Accountability Fund, a 527 political      organization, is sponsoring political advertisements against      President Bush throughout New Mexico and other ``battle      ground states'' including Florida, Arizona, and Nevada.      Overall, at the time of this report, this 527 organization      has raised nearly $1 million in the 2004 election cycle.       The NRDC 501(c)(3) organization, however, is also      nationally politically involved joining earlier this year      with Moveon.org, another section 527 political organization,      purchasing advertisements in the New York Times accusing the      Bush Administration of weakening regulations on drinking      water and air quality while soliciting contributions for the      NRDC 501(c)(3) affiliate.                              Sierra Club       The Sierra Club describes itself as ``America's oldest,      largest and most influential grassroots environmental      organization.'' With a reported membership of 700,000, the      Sierra Club is represented by a 501(c)(4) organization, a      section 527 political organization, and the 501(c)(3) Sierra      Club Foundation. In a September 27, 2004 article on the      interconnectedness of IRS designated 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4),      and 527 organizations this election year, the Washington Post      featured the Sierra Club as the prime example of this web      writing the following:       ``Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of      interlocking roles than Carl Pope, one of the most      influential operatives on the Democratic side in the 2004      election. As executive direct of the Sierra Club, a major      501c(4) environmental lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra      Club Voter Education Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund      527 has raised $3.4 million this election cycle, with $2.4      million of that amount coming from the Sierra Club. A third      group, the Sierra Club PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million      to Democratic candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.       ``These activities just touch the surface of Pope's      political involvement. In 2002-03, Pope helped found two      major 527 groups: America Votes, which was raised $1.9      million to coordinate the election activities of 32 liberal      groups, and America Coming Together (ACT), which has a goal      of raising more than $100 million to mobilize voters to cast      ballots against Bush. Finally, Pope is treasurer of a new      501c(3) foundation, America's Families United, which      reportedly has $15 million to distribute to voter      mobilization groups.       `` `I am in this as deeply as I am,' Pope said, `because I      think this country is in real peril.' ''       The Sierra Club is consistently critical of the Bush      Administration and it compiles a ``Sierra Club RAW      newsletter'' featuring ``The Uncooked Facts of the Bush      Assault on the Environment'' with regular criticisms of the      Bush Administration evironmental record and sometimes      expanding its criticisms to other officials as well. For      instance in its June 23, 2004 edition, the Sierra Club      accused Senator Inhofe of attempting to raise ``levels of      mercury pollution'' claiming the following: ``But wait--     there's more. The Bush administration's weak air proposals      were not weak enough, it seems, for Senator James Inhofe, the      chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.      Inhofe tried to raise the `acceptable' levels of mercury      pollution. . . .''       Like NRDC's ``Bush Record,'' the Sierra Club has its own      ``W Watch'' where it features articles critical of the Bush      Administration on environmental issues to judicial      nominations. Sierra Club affiliated organizations such as      Earthjustice, which began as the Sierra Club Legal Defense      Fund, is also highly critical of the Bush Administration and      is regularly engaged in legal actions against the federal      government. In fact, in its most recent IRS filings,      Earthjustice describes eighty-six legal actions on a variety      of environmental related issues. Earthjustice also publishes      its own political information. It issued its ``Paybacks''      report shortly before the 2002 elections that made such      explicit claims as, ``the Bush Administration is weakening      environmental laws in particular to help those industries      that paid to put it in office.''       Like other environmental groups, the Sierra Club has a      history of involvement in political campaigns. In the 2000      Presidential contest, the Sierra Club spent several hundred      thousand dollars in advertisements attacking Candidate George      W. Bush's campaign throughout the country including what is      reported as the largest expenditure of a third party on      Spanish language advertisements. In the 2002 election cycle,      the Sierra Club is reported to have spent $265,772 in      independent expenditures all for Democratic candidates and      making no independent expenditures for Republican candidates.      Additionally, in the 2002 Senate races, the Sierra Club      endorsed nineteen Democrat incumbents and challengers and      endorsed no Republican candidates. In the 2002 races for the      U.S. House of Representatives, the Sierra Club endorsed one      hundred sixty-five Democrat incumbents and challengers and      endorsed ten Republican candidates.       Like previous election years, the Sierra Club is heavily      involved in the 2004 political cycle. The Sierra Club began      spending early in the 2004 Presidential contest and is      reported to have spent at least $350,000 as early as late      2003 in advertisements against President Bush throughout the      country including in New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin,      Pennsylvania, Florida, Nevada, and Nebraska. The Sierra Club      has made a series of endorsements in this year's political      contests, and like LCV, the Sierra Club has endorsed Senator      John Kerry for President. In Senate races, the Sierra Club      has endorsed sixteen Democrat Senate incumbents and      challengers and no Republican candidates. In races for the      U.S. House of Representatives, the Sierra Club has endorsed      one hundred fourteen Democrat incumbents and challengers      and has endorsed seven Republican candidates. At the time      of this report, the Sierra Club's 527 political      organization claims to have raised over $6.8 million for      the 2004 election cycle alone.                               Greenpeace       Greenpeace USA describes itself as ``the leading      independent campaigning organization that uses non-violent      direct action and creative communication to expose global      environmental problems and to promote solutions that are      essential to a green and peaceful future.'' It claims 250,000      members in the United States and 2.5 million members around      the world. Greenpeace USA is represented by Greenpeace, Inc.,      a section 501(c)(4) organization and the Greenpeace Fund      Inc., a section 501(c)(3) organization.       Greenpeace USA and its affiliate organizations through      Greenpeace International have received attention for many      years more through demonstrations than through political      endorsements. Press reports that have described some of      Greenpeace USA's demonstrations have included activists      rapelling down skyscrapers, occupying abandoned oil rigs,      intervening in whale hunts with inflatable rafts, and      illegally boarding ships while at sea, among other      demonstrations that often result in arrests and criminal      convictions for Greenpeace activists. In fact, on Earth Day      2001, Greenpeace USA founder John Passacantado was arrested      with the founder of the Rainforest Action Network for locking      themselves to a gate during a protest blockading the entrance      to the Environmental Protection Agency.       Although, Greenpeace may be better known for its      demonstrations, its political views may be clear as it has      characterized President Bush as the ``toxic Texan,'' and hung      a banner from a water tower near the President's ranch in      Texas that read the same. Greenpeace has devoted much of its      Web site toward criticism of the Bush Administration equating      the Administration's environmental and conservation policies      to the ``Texas chainsaw massacre.''                         Environmental Defense       Environmental Defense describes itself as ``fighting to      protect human health, restore the oceans and ecosystems, and      curb global warming.'' Environmental Defense is represented      by two organizations: Environmental Defense, Inc., a      501(c)(3) organization and the Environmental Defense Action      Fund, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.       Environmental Defense represents its work in a number of      issue campaigns for instance, increased air regulations,      increased regulation of ocean industries, strengthening      Endangered Species Act and adding additional listings, and      reversing global warming. Environmental Defense is involved      with various other environmental organizations such as the      Sierra Club on many other ``campaigns'' as well. All      ``campaigns'' are featured on its Web site or its      Action!Network Web site.       Environmental Defense is regularly associated with other      politically involved environmental organizations as well such      as NRDC, Greenpeace, and LCV, among others, and its board of      directors not only includes the wife of the Democratic      Presidential nominee but also includes former Clinton      Administration officials involved in their own environmental      organizations regularly critical of the Bush Administration.                              foundations       The following are three of the foundations that regularly      contribute to the five environmental organizations referenced      in this report, among others.                         Pew Charitable Trusts       The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew) are comprised of seven      separate trusts and reports it is an ``independent non-     profit'' serving to ``inform the public on key issues and      trends, as a highly credible source of independent, non-     partisan research and polling information and that its      environmental priorities include global warming, protecting      ocean life, and wilderness protection.'' In two of those      priorities in particular, global warming and wilderness      protection, Pew has joined and supported other      organizations and campaigns.       In 1998, Pew created the Pew Center on Global Climate      Change. The Pew Center reports, ``the growing scientific      consensus is that this warming is largely the result of      emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from      human activities including industrial processes, fossil fuel      combustion,     and changes in land use, such as deforestation.'' Pew also      sponsors the work of the Clear the air Campaign with a $3.4      million grant in 1999, $4.3 million grant in 2000, nearly $5      million grant in 2001, and $4.7 million grant in 2003 with      which it published its Dirty Air, Dirty Power report in June      2004 claiming, on the first page of the publication, that      coal burning power plants ``make people sick and shorten the      lives of thousands each year'' and further claiming that      ``President Bush has allowed polluters to re-write clean air      rules.''       Concerning wilderness protection, Pew endorses the Heritage      Forests Campaign also highly critical of the Bush      Administration conservation policies, and, joining with the      Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense, the      Sierra Club, characterize the President's conservation      policies as ``Crazy George's National Forest Give-a-way,      Every Tree Must Go.''       Since 1998, Pew has contributed several million dollars to      various environmental organizations. These contributions have      included nearly $18 million to Earthjustice, over $3 million      to NRDC, and over $3.7 million to Environmental Defense. Pew      has also contributed $32.6 million to the Tides Center and      foundation over the same period. The Tides organization has      contributed over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club and      affiliates, Greenpeace and affiliates, the NRDC, and the      Environmental Working Group since 1998.                           Turner Foundation       The Turner Foundation describes itself as ``a private,      independent family foundation committed to preventing damage      to the natural systems--water, air, and land--on which all      life depends.'' It was founded in 1990 by Ted Turner who is      Chairman of the Foundation Board of Trustees. The Turner      Foundation makes grants ``in the areas of the environment and      population.'' The Foundation is especially involved in the      issues of global warming and overpopulation, and supports the      work of its ``special projects'' which include the      Partnership Project which is comprised of twenty national      environmental groups. The Turner Foundation's other special      projects include the League of Conservation Voters Education      Fund, the NARAL Foundation, and Planned Parenthood Federation      of America.       Since 1998, the Turner Foundation has contributed over $6.4      million to the Partnership Project that is comprised of the      League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club, Earthjustice,      Environmental Defense, Natural Resources Defense council, and      Greenpeace among others. Individually, the Turner Foundation      has contributed more than $20 million to the LCV since 1998,      over $2.6 million to the NRDC, over $1 million to the Sierra      Club, nearly $2 million to the National Wildlife Federation,      and nearly $2 million to Environmental Defense, Earthjustice,      Greenpeace, and the Environmental Working Group.                           Heinz foundations       The Heinz foundations are comprised of several different      foundations, some established for specific purposes. Of the      Heinz family affiliated foundations, the largest contributors      to environmental organizations are the Howard Heinz      Endowment, Vira I. Heinz Endowment, and Heinz Family      Foundation.       Ms. Teresa Heinz Kerry is either chairperson of the board      of trustees or member of the board of trustees on each      foundation. Ms. Heinz Kerry is the head of the $1.2 billion      Heinz Foundation endowment. Since 1998, these foundations      have contributed nearly $3 million to Environmental Defense,      the Sierra Club, the LCV, and the NRDC. Each foundation is      also a large contributor to the Tides Center and Tides      Foundation and affiliates contributing over $6 million since      1998. The Tides organization has in turn also contributed      over $1.4 million to the Sierra Club and affiliates,      Greenpeace and affiliates, the NRDC, and the Environment      Working Group over that same period.                               conclusion       This report does not represent the totality of      environmental groups engaged in political activity in this      election year or prior election years. It does not even      represent all the actions taken by the environmental groups      that are highlighted in this report each election year.      However, this report provides examples of some of the actions      taken by these groups and clearly questions any claims these      groups make concerning being ``non-partisan.'' These group      shave clearly established a record of partisanship and      clearly demonstrated each election cycle that they simply      have an agenda to work together against Republican candidates      and work to elect Democrat candidates. Additionally, these      groups are, in large part, annually financed by foundations      consistently supporting those groups' partisan efforts and in      some cases directly involved in partisan criticisms of the      Bush Administration. Moreover, these groups' activities      demonstrate the concern expressed in the Washington Post      article regarding political money this election year--money      ``slithering through on other routes as organizations      maintain various accounts, tripping over each other, shifting      money between 501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and 527's.''       Today's environmental groups are simply political machines      reporting millions in contributions and expenditures each      year for the purpose of raising more money to pursue their      agenda. Especially in this election year, the American voter      should see these groups and their many affiliate      organizations as they are--the newest insidious conspiracy of      political action committees and perhaps the newest multi-     million dollar manipulation of federal election laws.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
