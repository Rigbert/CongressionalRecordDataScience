If the underlying bill doesn't pass or gets vetoed, the Canadians will sell their product someplace else. That is what the choice is.  The Canadians want to sell their product to us and to use this pipeline to connect the product with the refineries along the gulf coast. If they can't do that because the pipeline isn't built because of political arguments--not economic arguments--then what will happen is the Canadians will build their own pipeline across the mountains to a port in Canada on the Pacific Ocean.  Where will that oil go? That oil will go straight to China, so that they can use that oil to compete against us, to undersell us, and to take American jobs away.  The XL pipeline is a job-creator both for American workers in building the pipeline, as well as American workers who will be utilizing the oil that comes through the pipeline. We should not listen to what we hear on the other side of the aisle, which will end up being a huge job-outsourcing bill to China. We have done enough of that in the past. We shouldn't do any more of that in the future.  I urge the passage of the rule and passage of the bill.
