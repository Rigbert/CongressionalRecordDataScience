President, it might be easier to read the two sentences in the law that were there before:       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available      under any title of this Act may be made available to make any      assessed contribution or voluntary payment of the United      States to the United Nations if the United Nations implements      or imposes any taxation on any United States persons.  It has been there since 1996. It had broad support. Nobody knows why it was taken out, but in this law that language was taken out that has been there for 13 years. So I encourage us to support this amendment to put that language back.
