Speaker, as cochair of the new Democratic Caucus working group on Central Asia and the Middle East, please let me warmly welcome Imam Yahya Hendi to the people's House.  His prayer ascends to the God of us all, who ``shows us the straight way, the way of those on whom grace is bestowed, and whose portion is not wrath, so we will not go astray.''  Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to represent a region of our Nation where Muslims for generations along with faith-filled people from all denominations and those of secular persuasion have joined together in an interfaith mission to promote tolerance, understanding, and to advance social justice.  We have built homes for the poor through Habitat for Humanity. We work together in the campaign to erase hatred. Ours is a peaceful community and a patriotic community. Indeed, in my district, Muslims have made history. They have become prominent citizens in all walks of life: medicine, engineering, law, business, education, and entertainment.  Our citizens built the first mosque in Ohio and the third in our Nation. And just after September 11, people of faith joined hands around our Perrysburg mosque in a strong show of unity with our common bond to the Creator of us all.  During the upcoming Ramadan, Christmas, and Hanukkah seasons, may our national mosaic shaped by people who have come here willingly from throughout the world shine beautifully as an example of how people can live together with respect for one another and without fear.                          ____________________
