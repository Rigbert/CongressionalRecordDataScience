Speaker, The United Steelworkers of America (USWA) Local 1010, a union that has represented the Inland Steel labor force since early this century, has worked tirelessly over the years to better the living conditions and increase the living standards of Inland steelworkers and the communities in which they live. It is my distinct pleasure to announce that Local 1010 will be celebrating the retirement of two of its devoted members, Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Aristeo ``Art'' Torres, who retired from Inland Steel in January of this year. The celebration in honor of James and Art will feature an evening of dinner and music, and will be held today, March 27, 1998, at the American Legion Post #369, in East Chicago, Indiana.  James Alexander, a life-long resident of Gary, Indiana, began his dedicated career with Inland Steel in 1957. Over the years, he has held several positions within the company, including those within the coke plant, open hearth, cold strip, and 80-inch rolling operator. Perhaps James' most noteworthy achievement, however, was his devoted service to Local 1010, where he served as a respected union voice for his fellow steelworkers for 35 years. As a union representative, James held a variety of offices, ranging from safety steward to financial secretary, and he was elected union representative under six different administrators. Through his work with the union, James had the opportunity to meet several United States presidents, including Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, and Richard Nixon. In addition to his service to the union, James devoted much of his time to community initiatives. He spent 21 years on the Gary Public Transportation Board, held the office of 1st Vice-President of the Gary Housing Commission, and is currently a precinct committeeman. James has also been an active member of his parish, St. Monica and Luke Roman Catholic Church, for 50 years.  A native of East Chicago, Indiana, Art Torres worked at Inland Steel as a craneman for 46 years. Throughout his career, he remained active within Local 1010, serving as assistant griever, trustee, chairman of education, and board member. Realizing the importance of a unified membership, the focal point of Art's efforts with Local 1010 was educating steelworkers about the union and their rights as laborers. In addition, he participated in numerous pickets, including the Bridgestone/Firestone strike in the 1950s. Art has also been politically active over the years, serving as state delegate, working on various political campaigns, and carrying out the vital function of mobilizing voters within his community. In addition, he has been a long-time member of the Union Benifica Mexicana (UBM), an organization for Mexican-Americans, where he has served as an officer and chairman of various activities. In working for the betterment of Local 1010 and his community, Art takes great pride in his strides to be a good role model for young people, stressing the importance of earning a good education.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating James Alexander and Art Torres on their retirement from Inland Steel. James' family, consisting of his wife, Terry, and their eight children, Melanie, James Jr., Robert, Michael, Marcus, Barbara, Terese and Terrell, should be proud of his efforts. Art's wife, Cecelia, their children, Elizabeth and Angelina, and their grandchildren, Kathy and Jason, should also be very proud of his many achievements. Indeed, James' and Art's work for the labor movement and their communities has served as a beacon of hope and pride for all greatAmericans who continue to pursue the American dream.                          ____________________
