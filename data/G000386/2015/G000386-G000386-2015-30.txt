 President, on this side, we yield back all of our time.  Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2908 contains matter that is not within the jurisdiction of the Finance or HELP Committees and is extraneous to H.R. 3762, a reconciliation bill. Therefore, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
