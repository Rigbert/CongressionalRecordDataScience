President, I will be brief. I know my friend from North Carolina wants to speak as well.  First, as one who strongly supports Senator Kennedy on this matter of raising the minimum wage, I think he knows that I have worked since my days as codirector of the Gray Panthers to make sure that senior citizens would get prescription drug coverage.  I want him to know that I look forward to working closely with him on these issues. I will, before the Senator leaves the floor, talk about why this Y2K issue is so important to those low-income seniors, and on a point that the Senator from Massachusetts has led the fight on. I want to do this briefly.
