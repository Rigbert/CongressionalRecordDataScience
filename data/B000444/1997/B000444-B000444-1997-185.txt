 President, Zaire must seize the current moment to avoid further bloodshed and negotiate a peaceful resolution to its current crisis. A tentative agreement for a meeting on Friday between President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila has been reached. This meeting is critical to avoid further loss of human life in Zaire. I applaud Ambassador Richardson's presence in Zaire and fully support his important and courageous efforts to facilitate a peaceful settlement to the current political turmoil.  The current crisis in Zaire has reached a critical fork in the road. In one direction lies the peaceful path of democracy and economic reform. In the other, the well-worn road of violence, bloodshed, and political instability. President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Alliance leader Laurent Kabila at this moment hold the fate of their country in their hands.  I strongly encourage President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to earnestly engage in a critical dialog on the future of Zaire. I urge them to put the interests of Zaire and their countrymen first, and resolve the current political crisis without further unnecessary loss of life.  I have been deeply troubled by recent reports of wide-spread human rights abuses and mass killings of refugees and displaced persons in rebel-controlled Zaire. There are numerous accounts of desperately ill and malnourished women and children being indiscriminately slaughtered and maimed.  Recently 55,000 refugees have inexplicably disappeared from a refugee camp outside Kisangani. Of these refugees, some 9,000, including 2,500 severely malnourished children, had only days earlier been deemed medically unfit to travel by visiting relief workers.  After a week of repeatedly denying the United Nations to care for and repatriate refugees in rebel-controlled territory, today's news reports indicate the rebel Alliance is once again allowing the United Nations to care for the sick and the dying. Refusal to have given access to the United Nations over the past week, resulting in the maltreatment of refugees and displaced persons has been nothing short of deplorable.  I call upon Mr. Kabila to put a permanent end to the bloodletting of innocents in Eastern Zaire. All impediments to humanitarian relief efforts in Zaire must be permanently removed.  The United Nations must be permitted continued full access to these refugees and allowed to repatriate them to Rwanda without interference. Furthermore, the slaughter of those refugees suspected of responsibility for the 1994 Rwandan genocide must cease, as it is neither justifiable nor defensible. These people must be returned to Rwanda where they can stand trial in an appropriate court of law and rightly be held accountable for their crimes.  It is time for President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to signal their willingness to set Zaire on the path to peace and democracy. Zaire is a country of enormous potential that has suffered untold tragedies. Failure to seize this critical opportunity to negotiate peace in Zaire will only set that country woefully back.  The fighting in Zaire must stop. The crisis in the country cannot be resolved by force. Replacement of the Mobutu regime with yet another authoritarian regime is a recipe of further political instability. I strongly urge both President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila to seize the current opportunity to avoid further bloodshed and choose the constructive path of peace and democracy in Zaire.                          ____________________
