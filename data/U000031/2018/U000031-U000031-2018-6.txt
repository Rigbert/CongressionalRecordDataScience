Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte). I would note that he was the sponsor of the House companion bill. This is a Senate bill that we are taking up, but, obviously, he has great interest in it.  I would note that we passed it with strong bipartisan support through the Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
