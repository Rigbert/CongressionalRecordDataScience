Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would like to make two points in terms of flexibility here. First, I am a very strong supporter of the drug courts. In my district we have two drug courts acting very properly and very well organized, and I was delighted that the subcommittee under the gentleman from Florida's initiative has allowed drug courts in fact to be an eligible activity for the funds that are used.  Second, I must say I have a community, Benton Harbor, MI, which has been designated as a weed-and-seed community, yet they did not receive any funds from the Department of Justice when they applied with other communities across the country. It is my understanding in fact the procedure they have undergone over the last couple of years, that this would in fact be an eligible community function with a board that has been established with members from both the law enforcement community as well as those very active in terms of prevention and community activists, that even though they were denied by the Justice Department to receive funding, in fact that this would be an eligible activity under the $10 billion fund.  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
