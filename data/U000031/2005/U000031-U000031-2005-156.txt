Speaker, my colleague Mr. Schwartz of Michigan and I rise today to honor the life of Thurl Arthur Ravenscroft, the voice of Tony the Tiger, the orange-and-black-striped spokesman for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes. We would like to express our heartfelt condolences as all of us in Southern Michigan lost a friend and neighbor on May 22, 2005.  Thurl had a long, distinguished career, most notably as the voice of Tony the Tiger for over 53 years. However, his contributions to the entertainment industry didn't stop there. While a celebrity in his own right, he sang backup with other celebrities such as Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and Rosemary Clooney. Thurl also provided voiceovers for the Grinch in Dr. Seuss' ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' ``The Cat in the Hat,'' in ``Horton Hears a Who,'' and ``The Lorax.''  With his contributions to Kellogg and Dr. Seuss novels, the world of Walt Disney wouldn't be the same without Thurl's voice. His vocal works played important roles in the themes of ``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' ``Davy Crockett,'' and ``Zorro,'' while contributing to the making of ``Cinderella,'' ``Dumbo,'' and ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Thurl's voice was also used in both song and narration for two of Walt Disney's most popular theme rides, ``Pirates of the Caribbean'' and ``The Haunted Mansion.''  While most of his career was spent entertaining both the young and old, Thurl courageously served in the U.S. Military for 5 years. In 1942, he enlisted in the Air Transport Command, where he flew numerous special missions over the North Atlantic as an expert navigator. In addition to his work outside the entertainment business, Thurl devoted time to activities in the Christian field that included recording the Book of Psalms for the visually impaired.  All of us in Southern Michigan are deeply saddened with the passing of Thurl Ravenscroft and appreciate all of his service as an entertainer, soldier and Christian. We will forever be able to enjoy his wonderful works whether we are watching great Kellogg commercials, a Disney movie, or attending an amusement park.  Southern Michigan will not be the same without Thurl Ravenscroft. He was GRRRRREEEEAT!                          ____________________
