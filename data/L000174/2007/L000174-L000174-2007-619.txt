President, today it is my honor to salute a longtime Vermont athletic coach, Bill O'Neil, of Essex High School. Bill has been named the 2006 Hockey Coach of the Year by the National Federation of State High School Associations. While he has amassed an impressive record in his 35 years of coaching hockey, softball and girls soccer, winning over 900 games and 16 State championships, Bill has always instilled in his players the simple attitude that the game is more than just the win. Learning to play the game, positive sportsmanship, community involvement and academics are even more important to Coach O'Neil. To his players, Bill is a coach, mentor, teacher and lifelong friend.  I am delighted that a Vermonter has been recognized with such a prestigious honor. The Burlington Free Press recent published an article about Coach O'Neil's recognition. I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``O'Neil Tops in the Nation,'' by Ted Ryan, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Burlington Free Press,                              Feb. 8, 2007]                       O'Neil Tops in the Nation                             (By Ted Ryan)       In 35 years of coaching at Essex High School, Bill O'Neil      has won over 900 games and 16 state championships in three      sports.       He's been a Vermont coach of the year twice in girls'      soccer, twice in boys' hockey and three times in softball.       In 2006, his Hornets won the girls' soccer and boys hockey      state titles and finished second in softball.       Now, O'Neil is the national high school boys' hockey coach      of the year for 2006. ``It blew me away,'' O'Neil said after      Essex athletic director Ed Hockenbury informed him of the      honor.       ``I'm very surprised, very flattered,'' O'Neil said. ``It's      a very humbling experience. How can you describe how you      feel?''       He said he was staggered at thinking of the many coaches      for such hockey beds as Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts,      Colorado, ``even California'' who were deserving of such an      honor, awarded by the National Federation of State High      School Associations.       O'Neil had been named the Section 1 boys hockey coach for      2006, making him eligible for the national award. Two other      Vermont coaches, Northfield High School baseball coach Frank      Pecora and Woodstock Union High School football coach Jim      McLaughlin, were also Section 1 winners.       ``Bill is extraordinarily dedicated and hard-working,''      said Essex athletic director Ed Hockenbury. ``He loves      spending his time with kids. Win or lose, he is a role model      who exemplifies class and dignity in the coaching profession.      He is very deserving of this award.''       O'Neil will be honored by the Vermont Principals      Association at its annual VPA Hall of Fame dinner in May.       O'Neil's boys' hockey teams have reached the finals 15      times, winning the title 11 times. His 2005-06 team went 19-4      and defeated BFA-St. Albans in the championship game.       Whatever the sport, O'Neil said, he has been fortunate to      work for athletic directors--Paul Henry, Bruce Wheeler, Melba      Masse and Hockenbury--who ``emphasize the importance of      involvement with kids, that it's more than winning.''       ``They've never been just about winning. When I'd go in and      say we're down, they'd say, `You're doing a good job with the      kids. They've learned the game, they're coming along and      they're doing stuff in the community.' ''       ``All of these mentors of mine have made these programs,      not just my programs but all in Essex athletics. All the      coaches here are esteemed,'' O'Neil said. ``You don't see      anybody that only wants to win and that's what matters.''       O'Neil acknowledged that he is not often on the same page      as the youth hockey coaches, but said, ``They do a huge job      of teaching kids the game, getting them involved and making      them have some pride in the game and, I'd like to think,      respect for the game and all that goes with it.''       However, he said, he is concerned that the heavy game      schedules for youth teams tend to take something away from      appreciation for the sport.       At 35 years of coaching and counting, O'Neil said he can no      longer demonstrate everything on the ice or field, but he's      still invigorated by young assistants.       ``I think more and more about that time being over,'' said      O'Neil of his coaching tenure. ``That bothers me. Sometimes      I'm so old-school about stuff . . . but I like what I'm doing      and I enjoy the kids.''       With his children growing and leaving home, O'Neil said,      ``The coaching thing is my reward at the end of the day.''       ``As much as I like teaching, I love coaching,'' said the      English teacher.       And as long as he feels that way, Bill O'Neil will continue      adding to one of the most impressive coaching careers in      Vermont high school history.                          ____________________
