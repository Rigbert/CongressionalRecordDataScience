 President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. We are hoping we can get a number of amendments handled in the course of today's business. This is a measure that--even though it is at the moment flawed--has a chance of getting better in conference and preventing a Presidential veto. It certainly is not the view of this side that we want to prevent passage of this bill, once we have gotten an adequate number of amendments disposed of that have been offered on this side. I think we can work out some way to wrap up this bill sometime in the near future.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
