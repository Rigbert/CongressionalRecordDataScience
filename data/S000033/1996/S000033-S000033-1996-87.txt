 Chairman, I appreciate the difficulty of the gentleman's job as chairman of the committee, but let me ask the gentleman this:  To put $4 billion into perspective that the National Reconnaissance Office, quote unquote, lost track of, I would mention to my friend I know he is from Texas and it is a little bit bigger State than Vermont; our entire annual budget for the State of Vermont for 1 year is $1.5 billion. In other words, they lost track of an amount of money equivalent to 3 years of the budget of the State of Vermont.  Last year, I was on the floor of the House, the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] was on the floor of the House, other Members, and we opposed an increase in the intelligence budget. We were concerned about exactly what we are talking about today, and we were told, ``No problem. They need every dime.''  Somehow or other they lost $4 billion, and I would suggest that the problem that I have with my friend's argument is that I fear next year we are going to be in the same position again.  When some agency is so irresponsible, I think we have got to say enough is enough.
