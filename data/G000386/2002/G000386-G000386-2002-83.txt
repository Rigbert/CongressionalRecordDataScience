 It seems that everything that ails us as a nation is laid at the feet of the tax cut. I'm sure that the next attack will be that tax relief causes the Decline of Western Civilization. Or, perhaps, the Democratic Leadership would twist a phrase from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and claim that ``record high taxes are the price we must pay for a civilized society.''  Many in the media agree with this concept and rarely, if ever, challenge the factual basis for these attacks on last year's tax cut bill. Well, let me tell my friends in the Democratic Leadership, I'm going to correct the record every time. It's fine to attack tax relief, if you must, on ideological grounds. If the Democratic Leadership thinks we need to maintain record levels of taxation and keep growing government. That's something on which we can disagree.  On facts, however. I'm going to correct the use of incorrect data. I'm also going to compare the record of the Democratic Leadership against the specific attack on the tax cut.  A couple days ago, I corrected the record on incorrect data used with respect to the scoring of permanent death tax relief. Today, I'm going to take the latest attack and compare it with the record of the Democratic Leadership.  The Roll Call Daily article is entitled ``Daschle blames Bush Tax Cut for Failure on Prescription Drug Reform.'' According to the article, the Distinguished Majority Leader said and I quote:       We don't have the resources, because, in large measure, the      tax cut precludes it. Because of the tax cut and the deficits      we are now facing, we've got to be concerned about the      overall cost.  Now, I noticed this same point being made by others in the Democratic Leadership. I must say the Democratic Leadership spends a lot of time coordinating messages. They are very good at it. Perhaps, though, if less time were spent on perfecting partisan attacks on the President and Congressional Republicans, we might resolve more problems. After all, isn't that what we're paid to do? That is, do the People's business.  So, the charge is the tax cut ate the surplus and there's not enough money left for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It's all the President's fault. It's the fault of the bipartisan budget resolution, Boy, do I get tired of hearing this stuff. It gets very old.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        COMPARISON OF BUSH, DEMOCRATIC, AND SENATE PASSED BUDGETS                     (Fiscal year 2002 through 2011)------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Democratic     Senate                                   Bush budget  alternative     passed------------------------------------------------------------------------Project Surplus..................        5.6 T        5.6 T        5.6 T   Social Security Trust         2.0 T        2.5 T        2.5 T   Fund (for debt paydown)*......
