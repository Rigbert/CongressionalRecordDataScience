Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3198, a bill to reauthorize and amend the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 which established a cooperative program between the U.S. Geological Survey, the various State geological surveys, and academia. After 4 years, it is time to reauthorize this program for another 4 years and to modify its terms slightly based upon the experience the cooperators have gained.  First, let me say that our colleague from West Virginia, Nick Rahall, joined by a large bipartisan group of Members, was the lead sponsor of the bill which became law in 1992 first authorizing the cooperative geologic mapping program. That action was taken, Mr. Speaker, in the wake of a study by the National Academy of Sciences which expressed alarm at the decline of detailed geologic mapping efforts nationwide over the last decade.  The National Geologic Mapping Act then, as now, was a codification of ``cooperative federalism'' in that it expressly authorized the practice of the USGS using a small but significant portion of its geologic mapping budget to fund mapping projects of priority to the State geologic surveys on a 50/50 matching share basis. Furthermore, a component of the program was designed to set aside a smaller portion of the budget for universities to compete for funds to support student training in geologic mapping skills and field studies.  Mr. Speaker, the basic scientific endeavor of mapping the bedrock geology and surficial deposits of this country is the foundation upon which society's needs for identification and abatement of geologic hazards such as seismic zones, volcanic activity, and landslides. Such mapping is also key to delineation and protection of sources of safe drinking water, sound land-use planning, and initial mineral resources assessments as well.  Since its passage of the 1992 Act, staffing at the USGS, particularly for this type of work, has declined dramatically. A significant reduction-in-force in the Geologic Division begun by the fiscal year 1995 budget and continued last year has made it all the more necessary to full involve the State surveys in the priorization of national geologic mapping needs and cooperative use of their staffs to get the job done.  H.R. 3198 reauthorizes this cooperative program for 4 more years and establishes thresholds for the sharing of funds between the Federal, State, and academic components. In general, the administration has agreed to dedicate not less than 20 percent of the budget line for geologic mapping to the cooperative State map component, and not less than 2 percent to the educational component.  Mr. Speaker, by way of reference, the fiscal year 1996 appropriation for this subactivity of the USGS was approximately $22 million, meaning that $4 million is in the grant pool for matching with State moneys on geologic mapping projects upon approval by a peer review panel. The administration's fiscal year 1997 budget requested level funding for this program and the full House voted in agreement earlier this month on H.R. 3662, the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill.  H.R. 3198 will reauthorize this valuable program for 4 more years and ratify some very minor changes negotiated between the three participant groups--Feds, States, and academia. Specifically, these are definitional name changes, a slight modification of the congressional findings, and a paring down of the size of the Advisory Committee to the USGS Director. The current act has an unwieldly 16 member board. This reauthorization calls for downsized 10-member advisoryboard, made up of Federal representatives as well as State geologists and university members.  Mr. Speaker, let me finish by thanking the ranking member of the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee, Mr. Abercrombie of Hawaii, for his cooperation on this reauthorization. H.R. 3198 has the full support of the administration and I urge its passage.                              {time}  1045  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
