Mr. Speaker, the leadership of the 104th Congress is seeking to establish more equitable relationships between the Federal Government and the public lands States of the West. Before last November, Washington saw a resurgence of the misguided idea that central government control over the public domain must be expanded. The new congressional majority believes it is time to downsize the Federal bureaucracy, shift public lands to governments closer to the people, and recognize the role that the public lands in the West play in putting people back to work.  Many Western States have also been told that the national interest demands that State and local concerns be accorded second-class status. In my State of Alaska, over half of our public lands were designated parks, wilderness areas, and refuges in the name of the national interest without any form of consideration in return. There are indeed times when the interests of the country compel action, but the interests and concerns of States and local governments must be recognized and addressed in such cases. Our public policy will be that there can be no unilateral action by the Federal Government without special consideration being afforded by the affected State and local governments.  The controversial matter of nuclear waste storage offers an opportunity to implement this principle. A series of administrations and Congresses has deliberated and decided to proceed with waste storage facilities on public lands in Nevada. Unfortunately this Federal action has not been matched by the special consideration that the governments and people of Nevada, or any other similarly situated public lands State, deserve. I am considering an amendment to pending nuclear waste legislation to provide appropriate special consideration to Nevada and affected county governments.  This amendment would provide to the State and the affected counties a combination of specific parcels of valuable land as well as an entitlement to select from a pool of public lands. These lands would be provided to offset the withdrawal of multiple use public lands for waste storage and related purposes and to afford special consideration. Some lands would be immediately available and others would be eligible for selection and transfer as the waste storage project proceeds.  We welcome comments on this general proposal and are open to specific suggestions on how to make it address the needs in Nevada.  It is time to redress the balance in public lands policy between the Federal Government and affected States and local governments. I look forward to working with the elected representatives in Nevada in applying this important principle to the waste storage issue.                          ____________________
