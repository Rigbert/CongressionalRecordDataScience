 President, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Gorton in introducing legislation to improve access to health insurance for low income children in Washington State. This bill would amend the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to allow our State access to their allotment of federal funds to provide health coverage to an additional 90,000 eligible children.  This is not an effort to supplant state funds. This does not take funds from other states. It simply allows Washington to access their allotment of SCHIP funds to cover those children who currently lack any health security. Because of their lack of access to health insurance, these children have little or no access to health care and no access to preventive services.  These are children whose parents work hard but do not have access to health insurance or cannot afford the cost of premiums. These parents work hard and pay taxes, unfortunately they have little discretionary income to provide important health security for their children.  Last year, this Congress made a commitment to cover the 10 million uninsured children in this country. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included an expansion in children's health insurance benefits as a down payment on meeting the needs of these 10 million vulnerable children. This Congress took the right step in working to achieve the goal of guaranteeing every child in this country a healthy childhood. What we are attempting to do in this legislation that we are introducing today, is to honor this commitment to the children in Washington State.  In 1994 Washington State stood up for our vulnerable children. We implemented an expansion in our Medicaid program to cover children up to 200% of poverty. We knew at the time that it was a huge undertaking, but we recognized that investing in our children's health was a wise investment. Because of the final language adopted in the Balanced Budget Act, Washington could not access their SCHIP funds to cover newly enrolled children below the 200% of poverty threshold and above the federal Medicaid requirement.  As a result, Washington State was penalized for being a leader in children's health. We are here today proposing a technical fix that rewards Washington State and allows them to cover an additional 60,000 to 90,000 children. This is not done at the expense of other States, but rather by using Washington's existing allotment.  I can assure my colleagues that Washington State will honor our commitment to our children. But without access to these funds, enrolling these children will be almost impossible. If we all share the same goal of insuring these 10 million children, we must enact this legislation. The health care needs of low income children in Washington are just as great and just as important as they are for low income children in other states.  I am hopeful that we can act on this legislation. This technical remedy will go a long way in meeting our shared goal of guaranteeing access to quality, and affordable health care for all children.                                 ______                                       By
