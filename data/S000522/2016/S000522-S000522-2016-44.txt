Mr. Chair, I rise today to encourage all members to support the Rooney amendment (Number 7) to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2017, H.R. 5293, to reverse DOD's reimbursement rate cuts for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy for children of service members with autism.  Military life presents unique challenges for children with autism and their families, given the frequent changes of residence and schools, and the prolonged absences of a parent. In this context, coverage of ABA therapy is even more necessary to help military children adjust day-to-day, while also improving outcomes over the long term.  The Administration's reduction in the reimbursement rates for ABA for military children with autism could jeopardize access to this critical therapy. ABA is proven to bring about positive behavior change and assist in a child's long term development, especially for children with autism, and the program must be protected.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
