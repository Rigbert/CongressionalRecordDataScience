 President, based on recent remarks by the President, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. If the story as reported is true, it is an unfortunate commentary. In a recent meeting with religious leaders, Mr. Clinton asked them to withdraw their support for a legislative effort to hold countries to account that engage in religious persecution. Mr. Clinton, it seems, does not like legislation that imposes sanctions. Well, that's not precisely right. What he does not like is sanctions that he didn't think of. When he wants sanctions on Iraq, for example, he is all for sanctions. But when it comes to other issues he cares less about, well, suddenly he finds them unwelcome.  What are some of these? Well, he doesn't like mandatory sanctions for violations of human rights. He objects to sanctions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. He is not partial to sanctions on countries that persecute people for their religious beliefs. And he finds the idea of sanctions on countries that do not do enough to stop the traffic of illegal drugs to the United States burdensome. In a flight of candor with the religious leaders, he allows as how it is difficult to be honest in assessing another country's behavior if sanctions might be involved. ``What always happens,'' he says, ``if you have automatic sanctions legislation is it puts pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on.''  That is refreshingly frank. It is also disturbing. When I look up ``fudge'' in the dictionary, this is what it tells me the word means: to fake; to falsify; to exceed the proper bounds or limits of something; to fail to perform as expected; to avoid commitment.  If I am to believe these remarks, what the President is saying is that his Administration finds it necessary to falsify the facts; to avoid commitment; to fake information. His Administration finds it difficult to be honest when it comes to telling the Congress and the public what other countries are doing on critical issues. I guess the question we need to ask now is, what is the fudge factor in the various reports this Administration has submitted on these issues? We need to know this for past reports. And we need to know what this factor is in order to properly evaluate future assessments.  The reason we need to know this is for what the President's comments suggest. If we believe this report, the President is telling us that his Administration finds it necessary to be less than candid when it comes to enforcing the law. Now, I know that many Administrations do not like the idea that Congress also has foreign policy responsibilities. Many Administrations have fought against sanctions for this or that issue they did not think of.  They have also fought for sanctions when it was their idea. What is of concern here is the admission that this Administration fights shy of telling the truth in situations where it does not approve of the sanctions. It fudges the facts, presumably, even though the President has the discretion, in law, to waive any sanctions for national security reasons. This then is a candid admission that it enforces the laws it likes and fudges those it does not. I find this disturbing.  Perhaps the Administration could explain just why it needs to fudge the facts on drug certification, for example. What drug certification requires is that the President assess what other countries are doing to help stop the production and traffic of illegal drugs. This means assessing what they are doing to comply with international law. To make a judgment about what they are doing to live up to bilateral agreements with the United States.  And to account for what these countries are doing to comply with their own laws. The certification law gives the President considerable flexibility in determining whether these activities meet some minimally acceptable standards. He is not required to impose sanctions unless he determines, based on the facts, that a country is not living up to reasonable standards. And he can waive any sanctions. This gives the Administration a great deal of latitude. I have defended this flexibility. I have argued that just because the Congress and the Administration disagree, honestly, over an assessment, it does not mean that the facts are not honest. Or that the judgment is dishonest. But these recent remarks open up another concern. If the facts are fudged, however, just how are we to determine what to make of the judgment that follows?  And what is the occasion for employing the fudge factor? What is it being avoided or dodged? What the certification law and many of these others that require sanctions ask for is not terribly complicated or outlandish. They express the expectation of the Congress and of the American public that countries live up to certain responsibilities. And more, that failure to do so involves consequences. This is, after all, the expectation of law and of behavior in a community of civilized nations. The want of such standards or the lack of consequences reduces the chances for serious compliance with international law or the rules of common decency. Are we really to believe that respect for these standards and consequences are to be discarded because their application is inconvenient? Because they reduce some notion of flexibility? That we only have to enforce or observe the laws we like? What a principle.  I for one do not intend to live by such a notion. I will also from now on be far more interested in knowing just what the fudge factor is in assessments from the Administration. I hope my colleagues will also be more demanding.                          ____________________
