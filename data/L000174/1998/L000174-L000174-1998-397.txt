President, last week, faced with five continuing vacancies on a 13-member Court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified the judicial emergency caused by these continuing vacancies, began canceling hearings and took the unprecedented step in the Second Circuit of authorizing 3-judge panels to be composed of two visiting judges and only one Second Circuit Judge.  The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but her nomination continues to sit on the Senate calendar. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She was favorably reported by a Committee vote of 16 to 2, once the Committee finally considered her nomination. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, yet the nomination continues to languish without consideration.  Three additional outstanding Second Circuit nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee and await their confirmation hearings. Judge Rosemary Pooler was nominated back on November 6, 1997, as was Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. The final pending nomination to the Second Circuit was received two months ago, back on February 11, when the President nominated Chester J. Straub, a partner in the law firm of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher.  I have been urging action on the nominees to the Second Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit, to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action.  Last Friday I urged consideration of the nomination of Judge Sotomayor without further delay and requested that the Judiciary Committee proceed to hold the necessary hearings on the three other Second Circuit nominees this week so that they, too, might be confirmed before the upcoming recess.  I do not believe that the Senate should be leaving for two weeks' recess and leaving the Second Circuit with vacancies for which it has qualified nominations pending. This is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of years ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican congressional leadership has recessed without completing work on emergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation.  In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court warned that persisting vacancies would harm the administration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit need additional federal judges confirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the 5 vacancies, the SecondCircuit be allocated an additional 2 judgeships to handle its workload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from Senate inaction. That is why the Chief Judge of the Second Circuit had to declare the Circuit in a state of emergency.  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the nominees pending before it? I hope not.  As part of my efforts to encourage the Senate to do its job, I am today introducing the Judicial Emergency Responsibility Act. The purpose of this bill is to supplement the law by which Chief Justice Winter certified the emergency and to require the Senate to do its duty and to act on judicial nominations before it recesses for significant stretches of time when a Circuit Court is suffering from a vacancy emergency.  I urge prompt action on the bill and immediate action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit.                                 ______                                       By
