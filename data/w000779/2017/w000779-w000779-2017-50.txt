President, here we are now at 4:15. We still have not seen this bill--a $10 trillion bill, the biggest tax bill in more than three decades, with changes involving billions and billions of dollars made, apparently, overnight.  I have made it clear that when the leader, Senator McConnell, comes back down, we expect to see this bill. We were told essentially an hour ago that we would see this in a matter of minutes.
