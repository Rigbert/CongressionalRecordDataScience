 President, I rise today to submit a resolution to establish the second annual ``Endangered Species Day'' on May 18, 2007. I am submitting this resolution with Senators Collins, Feingold, Levin, Snowe, Kerry, Biden, Cantwell, Lieberman, Wyden, Clinton, Crapo, and Sanders whose co-sponsorship I appreciate.  I want to commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson, who first suggested the establishment of an ``Endangered Species Day.'' Individuals like Mr. Robinson do make a difference.  The designation of an ``Endangered Species Day'' provides a multitude of opportunities for young people, students, and the general public to learn more about endangered species both in our country and abroad.  Last year, thirty-six events were held across the country to highlight endangered species success stories. The Governor of Maine, the Rhode Island State legislature, and the cities and counties of Santa Barbara, San Diego, and San Francisco also declared State and local Endangered Species Days. Zoos and aquariums across the country, such as the Roger Williams Zoo and the San Diego Zoo, also held educational events.  Endangered Species Day 2006 provided an opportunity for schools, libraries, museums, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, agencies, businesses, community groups, and conservation organizations to educate the public about the importance of protecting endangered species and to highlight everyday actions that individuals and groups can take to help protect our nation's wildlife, fish, and plants.  Based on the success of last year, I believe that ``Endangered Species Day'' fosters increased communication and awareness about many of the most endangered species by encouraging such activities as school field trips to thezoo or attending a lecture at the local library.  In my home State of California, I am especially proud of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore populations of California condor, winter run chinook salmon, the least Bell's vireo songbird, and the California gray whale.  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more can be done. At this time, we have more than 1,800 species in the U.S. and abroad, which are designated as ``at risk'' for extinction. One small step is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the circumstances facing many of these endangered species and educating the public about these species.  I am submitting this resolution with the hope that ``Endangered Species Day'' can spark the wonder and interest in our youth to continue the conservation efforts we have begun, but still are far from finishing.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.                          ____________________
