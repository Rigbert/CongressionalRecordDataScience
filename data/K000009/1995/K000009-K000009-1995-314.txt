 Now the new ``leadership,'' I put leadership in quotes, of this institution is turning cartwheels over one another trying to push this through real fast, real fast. I just love it.  Where is the new Committee on the Budget? Where are the new Members who said that they were going to finally balance the budget of our country? What a joke. Instead of a Contract With America, this Congress is falling over itself to pass a new contract with Mexico. Who is kidding who?  Members like myself understand the power of Wall Street, and megabanks, and multinational corporations. We understand the power of the media to keep this crisis under wraps at their bidding and hope the taxpayers miss this one.  Last week in Washington over a dozen Members of Congress held a major press conference here in the Press Gallery. There had to be over 100 press people. The rooms were overflowing. I asked my friends around the country, ``How much did you read about that in your newspapers?'' Who was it that made the telephone calls from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, that suppressed the press releases and the messages that we tried to get out to the people of the United States? I have a hunch who it was.  We understand the power of the White House. We understand the power of the leadership here in this Congress. We do not like it, but we understand it. We know they want to slip this baby through with as little public scrutiny as possible. There is a lot of money at stake for their friends.  After all, it would be embarrassing to them, all those high-flying speculators that gambled with mutual funds in this country, the ones who are always complaining about how they want Uncle Sam off their back, until they need to put their hands into our taxpayers' pockets to get them out of another one of their expensive binds.  To them I say, look out, because once the American people figure out the magnitude of what you are trying to do, they are going to be outraged.  Mr. Speaker, I ask, please do not tell us this will be good to the people of Mexico. That autocratic state will not be one whit more democratic when this is all over. Its citizenry will not have any greater standing in that legal system, nor will our businesses, who do business down there.  All that will happen is that the vise around the necks of Mexico's people will continue to grow tighter. Mexican wages will decrease even more. Life that is already tough for the majority of Mexico's citizens will become even more unbearable. Inflation will be even tougher to manage than it is now.  But get this, Mexico's super-rich families took their money out of that country before the peso meltdown. How convenient.                              {time}  1740  Why are they not being held accountable? Why should United States taxpayers put their money on the line when Mexico's 3 dozen ruling families have their billions safely tucked away offshore?  If we remember back to 1984 and Mexico owed commercial banks in those [[Page H289]] days, Mexican funds by these families in United States banks exceeded the amount that Mexico owed to our banks by somewhere between $40 billion and $60 billion. Very interesting. Not small potatoes.  They got themselves into this mess. Let them bail out their homeland by repatriating and bringing home their own money and let the big business interests in our country in cahoots with them eat their own losses.  That is free enterprise. That is what free enterprise is supposed to be all about, taking a risk and then being willing to meet the piper.  Just last week when most of America was not looking, the House Banking Committee here on this side of Congress renamed itself and passed new rules under its so-called new leadership mandated by what I call the ``Contract on America'' that will permit this bill to subvert normal committee procedures. No hearings will be held in the subcommittee of jurisdiction. Don't have to under the new rules they passed.  This will be a real railroad job. Only the full committee will have some sort of lightning speed session, because if you ask too many questions and the public begins to understand what is going on here, somebody in America might actually object. I bet you a dime to a doughnut when that bill gets to this floor, it will be the fastest ball you ever saw come down the pike.  So, what is so new about this Congress? The idea is to hide the truth from the American people once again. Hold as few hearings as possible, limit floor debate, don't let the public know any of the grimy details. So let me ask again, what is so new about this so-called new Congress, anyway?  And let me say to the real gamblers in all of this--you know who you are: The megabanks, the multinational corporations, and the speculators who pushed through NAFTA, there are a few of us who understand. You put our taxpayers now at the helm for your mistakes and for your greed. We are angry. We resent what you have done.  My own feeling is that when you gamble, you should eat your own losses and not come whining to the American people to foot the bill. You are all big boys. You love this kind of free enterprise gamble. So practice some of it. Don't come running home to Mama in the Government.  Let me just say even gamblers have rules. If you go to Las Vegas and consistently lose money, the casinos won't let you play at their tables anymore. It is a good rule. Mexico has consistently lost money and never paid back the principal on its loans from us. Why should we let them play again?  Remember the Brady bonds? They keep flipping around like fish on a deck. If you go to Las Vegas, there are also table limits. In other words, there is a certain ceiling on how much you can lose. Even gamblers have a code. But with this Mexico deal, there is no limit.  A week ago, the administration first said it needed $6 billion. Then it raised it to $9 billion, then to $18 billion, then to $25 billion. Then by the end of the week, it became $40 billion, and that is on top of the $18 billion line of credit already in place. How's that for 1 week's work?  I have an idea and I thought about this all weekend. Since American taxpayers are being asked to bail the gamblers out on the faulty assumption that Mexico will pay back theses new loans, which would be an historical first, let me humbly suggest to the Secretary of Treasury and Chairman of the Federal Reserve, that what is fair is fair. If the American people have to pay, give them something in return. Let them earn the money off your gambling with their money. How about creating a new short-term bond for American taxpayers backed up by Mexican oil? Call it the oil bond. Its benefits will flow to each family in America bankrolling you, not just to a dozen well-connected bond houses and investment banks on Wall Street. Ask Mexico to pay us back in goods, not promises. Then let those oil barrels start rolling north. Call it cash on the barrelhead, using the current price at delivery.  Since this bailout is putting citizens at a $49 billion risk to start off with, I figure with over 100 million households in America, for each family in our country we are talking about a minimum of one $600 oil bond per family, not counting the interest due them over the life of the debt instrument.  So let me challenge those creative geniuses over   at the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve who have gotten us into this mess--you know who I am talking about--the ones who as a result of GATT just stopped guaranteeing average Americans a decent return on their U.S. savings bonds. We used to have a 6-percent floor which said you cannot earn less than 6 percent. Then they lowered it to 4 percent for our people. Now they have even taken out the 4-percent floor. I am asking those same folks over at Treasury to go back to the drawing board. If U.S. taxpayers are going to bankroll you and your speculative buddies, let our people share in the wealth.  Imagine, the oil bonds could be sold through every Federal Reserve regional bank. The Federal Reserve could establish an 800 toll-free number that citizens could call, 1-800-O-I-L-B-O-N-D. How simple and straightforward it would be. Each American would immediately be an owner of 40 barrels of Mexican oil. For the first time in our history, it would democratize the gambling done by our Treasury Department and Federal Reserve at the expense of our taxpayers.  The more I think about it, the more I really like it. Citizens with credit cards could call right in. The IRS could mail special envelopes back to each taxpaying family after April 15 of this year containing the family's oil bond. All taxpayers would benefit directly, again with goods, not promises. Is this not one of those ideas, the more you mull it over, the more it really grows on you?  In conclusion, I would just like to say, let's stop this clever taxpaying bailout of Mexico. Let's stop this new budget-buster that will completely abrogate any work we do on a balanced-budget amendment here this month. Let's get rid of the biggest unfunded mandate in the history of our country. Let's put our taxpayers back in the driver's seat and let them earn the money for a change.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
