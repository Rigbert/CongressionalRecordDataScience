Speaker, our American opportunity society is based on education. But if you don't have the education to compete in today's job market, the words ``Opportunity Society'' are meaningless. And that's why Federal support for education is so critical.  For example, in Prince George's County, Carrollton Elementary School is working hard to give all of its students that American opportunity. In order to reach higher education standards, the school needs updated reading and writing materials. The school board has approved the purchase and the contract has been signed--but Federal budget cuts mean that the contract will be canceled.  More than 100 third and fourth grade students at Carrollton are struggling to learn to read. Using Federal funds, the school has provided a teacher to give these children the extra attention they need to catch up with their classmates. The education bill passed by the House, which I opposed, will cause this teacher to loose her job, because the school can't afford to pay her. And in the State of Maryland, 21,000 teachers will lose training in enriched math and science curricula.  Across the fifth district and across the country, parents are worried that their children aren't safe in school. Violence in our schools is rising, and surveys show that one-third of high school seniors use marijuana. Three-quarters of high shool seniors drink alcohol. The Federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides antidrug education and counseling to 39 million children across the country. It also provides for guards and other security measures to make our schools safe. But funding for that program has been cut in half by the Republican education proposals, eliminating anti-drug and violence programs in 1,200 Maryland schools.  These cuts will make themselves felt from preschool to graduate school. The Republican plan will cut 48,000 young children from the Head Start rolls in 1996. We know that Head Start is a cost-effective way to provide academic enrichment, nutrition, and basic health care to children who will otherwise start school at a disadvantage and lag behind their peers. Despite a bipartisan commitment to improve Head Start quality and give a Head Start opportunity to as many children as possible, the Republicans have cut Head Start for the first time in the program's history. In Maryland, these cuts mean that more than 1,000 children will be denied the help they need to start school ready to learn. This is unfair, and compromises our children's future.  Also, in Maryland universities, almost 54,000 students who rely on Stafford loans to go to college will see their costs go up. The average Maryland student graduates from college $13,500 in debt. And under Republican budget proposals, that debt will rise by more than $3,000 in additional interest payments. The average graduate student in Maryland will see his or her interest rise by more than $9,000.  America is proud of its opportunity society. We are proud that we send more students to college than any other country. But cuts in Federal education funding jeopardize this proud history.  We all know that simply throwing money at education won't solve the problems our students and schools face. But we also know that cutting education funding when our education system is struggling will only make the problem worse. Cutting support for students is bad educational policy, and bad economic policy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting National Education Funding Day.                          ____________________
