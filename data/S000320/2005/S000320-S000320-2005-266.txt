 President, I appreciate the time.  I rise in opposition to the upcoming amendment submitted by Senator Akaka. The amendment would amend the Truth in Lending Act and impose significant new compliance mandates and disclosure requirements on lenders.  This amendment makes considerable changes to an area of law squarely within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee which I chair, and I hope it will not be included in the bankruptcy bill. This is simply not a dispute about asserting the Banking Committee's jurisdiction which we have here. The Akaka amendment, if it were agreed to, would be a significant change to the Truth in Lending Act.  This is a highly complex law, and amendments to it, must be considered carefully, and should be considered in the committee first.  I will be glad and happy to work with the distinguished Senator from Hawaii in that regard. But we have not had an opportunity to look at this, nor to conduct an appropriate examination of the substance involved in the amendment, and, therefore, there is no record upon which to base a judgment here with respect to the soundness of the provision. I don't believe this is either the time or the place for this amendment.  I will oppose the amendment.                        VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 17
