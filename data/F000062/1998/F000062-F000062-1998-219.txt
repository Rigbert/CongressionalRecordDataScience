 President, together with my California colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to introduce legislation to eliminate tariffs for twenty-one chemical compounds. These compounds are components of certain AIDS and cancer drugs. For the benefit of my colleagues who may be called upon to consider the legislation, I want to describe our concerns and urge their support.  The AIDS and cancer drug chemical compounds will be entitled to receive a zero tariff when a revised international agreement eliminating tariffs for pharmaceutical products goes into effect in January 2000.  Until then, however, the compounds could face a tariff of between six and twelve percent, raising costs for patients and their families and discouraging the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical products in this country. The legislation we introduce today would eliminate the tariff, providing the same zero tariff provided by the WTO agreement.  The list of specific pharmaceutical products which are entitled to receive the zero tariff is only updated every three years through the WTO negotiations. Drugs which are not approved by an agency of a federal government, like the FDA in the United States, cannot be included in the negotiations. Without formal federal approval by one of the governments, the drug cannot be included in the negotiations until the next round of negotiations, perhaps as much as three years later. This is unfair for those pharmaceutical products experiencing delays in the FDA approval process or whose approval does not match up with the negotiating timeline.  The international community, through the World Trade Organization, committed to eliminate tariffs for pharmaceutical products. This agreement will help ensure that individuals around the world get the medicine they need, reducing drug costs by eliminating the tariff. Otherwise, the pharmaceutical products would be subject to a 6-12% tariff before they could be brought into the United States.  In 1996, the administration agreed to treat certain chemical compounds as if they were an approved pharmaceutical product, in order to provide the zero tariff for an AIDS drug produced by a San Diego pharmaceutical company which was awaiting FDA ``fast track'' approval. This drug later received its formal FDA approval, becoming the first AIDS drug approved for children's use. However, as a result of changes to the manufacturing process, a different set of chemical compounds are now used, which are not eligible for the zero tariff. This tariff legislation would extend the zero tariff for these replacement chemical compounds as well.  Last year, the administration completed negotiations for the update round, revising the list of drugs eligible to claim the zero tariff. The administration agreed to incorporate twenty-one chemical compounds, which are constituents of an AIDS or cancer drugs, into agreement. As a result, these chemical compounds will receive a zero tariff when the WTO agreement goes into effect in January 2000. Until then, however, the AIDS and cancer chemicals remain subject to US tariffs.  The legislation we introduce would suspend the tariff until the international agreement goes into effect in 2000. These chemical compounds have been added to the zero tariff international agreement, but we should take off the tariff now to speed up the development of the AIDS and cancer drugs.  These chemicals are not available in the United States from domestic manufacturers and are not used for other products. Consequently, the zero tariff does not undermine domestic chemical manufacturers. In fact, these chemicalseligibility for the zero tariff has been reviewed and approved by the chemical industry advisory committee, which advises the administration on trade policy.  This legislation only reduces the tariff for these chemical compounds that will receive a zero tariff under the international agreement. The zero tariff for these chemical compounds has, literally, been approved by both the United States and the international negotiators.  In 1996, the administration completed negotiations to confer eligibility for the zero tariff adopt a zero tariff for pharmaceutical products. At the time, the administration agreed to add certain chemicals, used to prepare an AIDS drug which was awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The administration's decision treats the chemicals as if they were a fully approved product.  We must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS and cancer. However, until we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need to find effective treatments and put them in the hands of people with needs. By eliminating the tariff, we eliminate one more hurdle in getting the product to the patients and their families. These provisions will help accelerate the manufacturing and final testing for new drugs and deserves the full support of Congress.  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are entitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero tariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their chemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff.  The administration indicate the chemicals present no risk for law enforcement or anti-narcotics enforcement. The chemical industry advisory committee, an industry group which advises the US Trade Representative on trade issues, has also reviewed and supported the zero tariff.  Ambassador Barshefsky and the Administration deserve tremendous credit for extending the zero tariff for these chemical components through international negotiations. As a matter of public policy, we should do everything in our power to develop effective AIDS and cancer drugs and treatments and ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a cost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing drugs, treatments or materials needed to fight these diseases. This tariff legislation represents a modest, but important, step.  The Senate Finance Committee is currently developing miscellaneous tariff legislation, a bill which will include a variety of non-controversial tariff measures introduced by Finance Committee members. I would like to have this legislation incorporated by the Finance Committee, which would permit the acceleration of drug production, providing more timely relief for the public. The legislation is expected to have only a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. However, for AIDS and cancer patients, their families and those at risk, the impact may be profound. Congress should take this opportunity to reduce tariffs for these chemical compounds.  Without this legislation to remove the tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, rather than expediting relief. Patients and their families do not have time to wait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to the zero-tariff list. By importing the chemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug development process.  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation introduced today be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1936         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
