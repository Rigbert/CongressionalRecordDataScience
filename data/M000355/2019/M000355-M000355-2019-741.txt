 Here is what that work will need to include:  Right off the bat this week, the Senate will begin working through a slate of nominations to important Federal offices. The American people deserve to be governed by the government they voted for, and every time we confirm another one of the uncontroversial, amply qualified public servants whom President Trump has selected for these executive branch posts, we fulfill a constitutional responsibility and make manifest the people's decision.  Of course, in the days and weeks ahead, another major duty before us will be the appropriations process. Just like last year, under the leadership of Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy, I am confident we can make significant progress on regular appropriations this month and then pass an interim continuing resolution to prevent any funding lapse while that work continues.  Let me say that again. A major focus of the Senate this month will be moving forward as many of the regular appropriations bills as possible and then passing a temporary continuing resolution for the outstanding parts of the government before the end of September.  We have the parameters in place, thanks to the bipartisan funding agreement President Trump signed last month. Now it is time for the rubber to meet the road and for the Senate to pass appropriations bills this month.                          ____________________
