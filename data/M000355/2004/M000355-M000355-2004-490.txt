 We made good progress on the bill today, disposing of five amendments. The chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee will be here tomorrow morning to continue working through the remaining amendments. Senators should expect rollcall votes on amendments throughout the afternoon. However, I would announce there will be no votes prior to 2 p.m.
