I am happy to work with you and all of our other co-sponsors to continue to make improvements to the bill. While there are challenges on the specifics, as Senator Gregg has said, there's a lot to work with. Senator Gregg and I agree on fiscal responsibility, prevention, wellness, chronic care management, modernizing the tax code, improving the quality of care, containing costs, personal responsibility, and the importance of covering everyone.
