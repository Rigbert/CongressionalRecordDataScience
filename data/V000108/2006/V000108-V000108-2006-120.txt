Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to honor Mr. Calvin Bellamy on the occasion of his retirement as chief executive officer of Bank Calumet, where he has served the people of Northwest Indiana over the past 24 years. Throughout his time leading Bank Calumet, Mr. Bellamy has done much to improve the quality of life for everyone in Northwest Indiana. He has been an exemplary community leader as well as a successful business man, and I am proud to call him a friend.  Under Mr. Bellamy, Bank Calumet has become a crucial component for economic development in the region, with branches serving both Indiana and Illinois. Today, Bank Calumet operates in 29 locations with over 400 employees. Bank Calumet has become one of the largest locally owned bank and holding companies in Northwest Indiana with over $1 billion in total assets. Bank Calumet has been named ``one of America's best banks'' by all three national rating services under Mr. Bellamy's leadership. These incredible accomplishments reflect the drive, passion, and commitment Cal Bellamy has shown to creating a world-class financial institution that invests in the communities it serves.  Cal Bellamy's contributions to the economy of Northwest Indiana are only eclipsed by his personal dedication to our community. Cal has been called on to lend his expertise and leadership to several important organizations in Northwest Indiana. Mr. Bellamy serves as chairman of the Purdue Technology Center Advisory Board, where he is involved with the center's activities to attract high-tech jobs to Northwest Indiana. He is also chairman of the Northwest Indiana Forum, the Education Committee of the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce, the Ethics In Government Taskforce of the Lake County Community Development Committee, and cochair of Meals on Wheels of Northwest Indiana Capital Campaign.  Mr. Bellamy also serves on the Board of Directors of many organizations committed to improving the quality of life in Northwest Indiana, including the First District Pro Bono Committee, which provides legal services for low-income individuals, the Urban League of Northwest Indiana, Lake County Workforce Development, the Calumet Council Boy Scouts of America, the Northwest Indiana Minority Business Opportunity Committee, and the Northwest Indiana World Trade Council. Cal Bellamy also commits his time to educational causes throughout the area, serving as the founding director of the Hammond Education Foundation, on the Board of Advisors for Indiana University Northwest, and on the Chancellor's Council for Purdue University Calumet. Without a doubt, Mr. Bellamy has given his time and energy graciously to make Northwest Indiana a better place for future generations.  Mr. Bellamy received his B.A. with highest distinction from Indiana University, his law degree from the University of Michigan, and is a graduate of the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at the University of Delaware. I wish him and his wife, Cathy, the best of luck as they approach the exciting next steps of their life.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Cal Bellamy for his outstanding contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana. His commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of the First Congressional District of Indiana is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended. Over the years, I have sought out Cal to seek his assistance on matters affecting Northwest Indiana. I have always found him to be trustworthy and deliberate in our conversations. As John Quincy Adams said, ``If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.'' Cal Bellamy has been a great leader for Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
