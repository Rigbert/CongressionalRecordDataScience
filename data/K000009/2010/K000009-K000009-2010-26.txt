Speaker, I will place the other remarks in the Record tonight. And I might say that it's not a question of if the system will fail again, but only when it will fail again.  This used to not be allowed under the Glass-Steagall, which prohibited commercial banks from doing investment activities and investment firms from taking deposits. The two were kept separate.  However, in 1999, the Graham-Leach-Bliley bill repealed Glass-Steagall and the walls came down between commercial banking and speculating.  Gambling and prudent lending need to be separate again. I have introduced H.R. 4377, the Return to Prudent Lending Banking Act which strengthens the Glass-Steagall separations and repeals some of what Graham-Leach-Bliley did.  We know instinctually that we need to break up the big banks and increase competition across our financial system.  Instead, the megabanks stay too big to fail, and the American taxpayers will pick up the tab when they implode the economy at some date in the future. That is their pattern. That is their history.  This bill took far too many passes.  Regulating derivatives is an excellent example of Congress knowing what we need to do but not doing it.  Regulating all derivatives openly and clearly should be expected with no exceptions. Nothing less is acceptable.  In this bill, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and their colleagues can continue to trade derivatives that are used to specifically hedge the risk that they are undertaking, as well as still being able to trade interest-rate and foreign-exchange swaps.  Last week Bloomberg Businessweek stated the following: ``U.S. commercial banks held derivatives with the notional value of $216.5 trillion in the first quarter, of which 92 percent were interest-rate or foreign-exchange derivatives, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.''  So, they can keep the vast majority of business in house.  Bloomberg Businessweek also reported that ``The [same] five U.S. banks with the biggest holdings of derivatives--JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo--hold $209 trillion, or 97 percent of the total, the OCC said.''  So, let's review: 5 megabanks, all ``too big to fail'', highly interconnected, hold \2/3\ of the assets of people in our country. They have concentrated vast amounts of financial power amongst themselves and also control 97 percent of the derivatives in the country. Now that's a recipe for more abuse. And that set of facts is a window on future abuse.  Perhaps worst of all, according to such experts as William Isaac, former Chair of the FDIC and Henry Blodget, editor-in-chief of The Business Insider, concur that ``reform'' bill would not have prevented the crisis of 2008. So, why didn't Congress assure that it did?  Now, some might say we can't predict what the next financial crisis will look like. But we should be able to put reforms into place that would have prevented the crisis we just went through. But Congress did not. The wine glasses and cigars are surely full and lit tonight.  Sadly, this House repeated its history in weak financial regulation. We did not make the hard choices. It left the American people vulnerable again. It is not a question of ``if,'' but only ``when.''                          ____________________
