 I think it is really time for us to go on record. Senator Kerry and I participated, as did the distinguished Senator from Idaho sitting in the back of the room, in a special effort where we tried to negotiate something and were not able to do so.  I think what we hope to do is lay out the case, and I am sure the case in opposition to studying black and smokeless powder will be laid out. We wouldreally appreciate an up-or-down vote, I say to my colleague.
