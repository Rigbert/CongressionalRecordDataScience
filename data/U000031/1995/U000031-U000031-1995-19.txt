Chairman, I speak today not really as a Member of Congress in the well; I speak as a parent of a 3-year-old and of a 7-year-old. You bet I want to control what they watch. One of my colleagues earlier today said well, just use the off button.  Mr. Chairman, because of this family-friendly schedule, I have be getting home most nights around midnight for the last month, and that will be again the case tonight when I return to Michigan.  Tomorrow morning is Saturday, and like most parents of little kids, my 3-year-old and my 7-year-old are going to wake each other up about 7, maybe 6:30, and they are going to go down those stairs and they are going to have that TV on when I wake up a little bit later. I have a feeling that I will not be up and I will not be able to block out what they may or may not watch.  The argument that the Markey amendment is going to set up thousands of bureaucrats is wrong. It is false.  Mr. Chairman, I have a story that ran in my local paper last week that I am going to read excerpts of and I will include the entire article in the Record, but it is headlined this way, ``Violence, Sex Fill The Airways.''       I am a 14-year-old junior high Afro-American female from      Benton Harbor. I cannot help noticing the endless amount of      times people blame the media for boisterous behavior in teens      and young adults. I feel that everyone plays a role in      influencing children.       As a teenager I can tell you a lot, that the TV is      responsible for much of this. But I have good parents and I      am a good kid. You see there are no bad kids, just misguided.      Parents needs to band together, stop talking about the      problem, and do something about it.  That is what the Markey-Burton amendment does. Let us stop talking about this and oppose a simple study. We know studies are not going to solve this. The evidence is in.  Do what the kids tell us as well as the parents, support the Markey-Burton substitute.  The article referred to follows:               [From the Herald-Palladium, July 30, 1995]                      Violence, Sex Fill Airwaves                           (By Debbie Allen)       I am a 14-year-old junior high Afro-American female from      Benton Harbor. I cannot help noticing the endless amount of      times people blame the media for boisterous behavior in teens      and young adults. I feel that everyone plays a role in      influencing children.       As a teen-ager, I can tell you a lot of influences and      causes, including the media. For example, gangsta rap. Now      here you have so-called music that calls women ``bitches''      and ``hoes,'' and that not being the worse part. It also      tells young boys that it's OK to kill someone.       A prime example is Snoop Doggy Dogg. But you have to think      where did it get him? In prison. Need I say more?       But it's only one factor. It's not the only factor. Any      video that calls a woman a bitch, especially the black queen,      then I don't want to watch it and I definitely don't buy it.      They give black people a bad name making it seem like all      black people do is sit up smoke blunts (marijuana) and drink      beer. Well, my family doesn't.       Like Da Brat says, ``I love to get high, I mean way.'' I      bet her parents are proud. Movies also depict sex and      violence. They have young kids on there having sexual      intercourse, making it seem like everybody's doing it and      everybody's not.       All through these movies the women are having sex, most of      the time with a different man each time, and you never see      them use contraceptives.       Then you have violence on the other hand. If you like      violence just watch any movie with Arnold Swarzenegger,      Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme or Bruce Willis. For      profanity, watch movies or turn to HBO for Deff Comedy Jam or      just pop in a Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre tape.       But television is also to blame. You turn on the soap      operas you see teens having sex, or shall I say rolling      around the bed? You see adults doing the same thing. I like      soap operas, but I also have to turn because that sickens me.      Another example: Beavis and Butthead.       Even talk shows. Just two weeks ago I was watching Charles      Perez and the topic was strippers who can't get a date. I saw      all these male and female strippers on there dancing and      stripping for the audience and the audience putting money in      their underwear and their putting their butts in their faces.      I mean, come on. My 4-year-old nephew and 3-year-old niece      were getting a kick out of this.       But worst of all, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The whole      half hour they're fighting. They're kids' idols.       ``Cosby,'' ``Family Matters,'' ``Different World,'' ``Under      One Roof'' and ``On Our Own'' are all fabulous shows. They      teach morals.``Family Matters'' is still hanging strong,      thank God, but I'm sorry I cannot say the same for the      others. Those were all taken off. Why? Only God knows.       Don't get me wrong, there are also good white shows, like      ``Full House'' and ``My So-Called Life.'' But you see rock      videos also promote constant violence and sex, not to mention      if you listen to them too long you get a headache.       But those are just a few causes. Kids need more role models      like Martin Lawrence, Usher Raymond, Michael Jackson, Brandy      and Willie Norwood and Monica Arnold. Parents need to take      control of their children and be good role models, but they      need the help of other parents, police officers and      especially the media, rappers and stars.       But I have good parents and I'm a good kid. You see there      are no bad kids, just misguided.       Parnets need to band together. Stop talking about the      problem and do something about it.       Debbie will be a ninth-grade student this fall at Coloma      Junior High School. She lives in Benton Harbor with her      parents, Albert and Labralla Allen.
