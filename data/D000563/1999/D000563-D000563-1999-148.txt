President, I rise today to take note of an upcoming milestone in the career of a man from Illinois whose musicianship, warmth and exuberance have brought joy to all who have heard him play and sing over the past 52 years.  On Saturday, October 9th, Mr. Buddy Charles will play the final night of his most recent engagement--a 9-year stand at the Drake Hotel in Chicago. Buddy Charles is no less than a living encyclopedia of what critics call the ``Golden Age'' of American popular music. During the period from about 1920 to 1950, the Gershwins, Arlens, Berlins and Carmichaels of the world produced a rich legacy of songs. Although recorded versions of these songs are numerous, they are kept alive in a special way by entertainers such as Buddy Charles.  Buddy is a lifelong Chicagoan, born there 72 years ago, raised on the North Side, and a graduate of Loyola University. The roster of clubs in which he has performed since 1946 reads like a history of night life and entertainment in Chicago: London House, Spaghetti Bowl, Dubonnet, Casino, Drum Lounge. . . .  Perhaps his most memorable stand--chronicled frequently by the Chicago news media--was his 18-year engagement, from 1972 to 1990, at the Acorn on Oak. There he could be found, as the Chicago Tribune wrote, ``shouting and singing when most sensible people are sleeping and dreaming, the most devilishly delightful creature of the city night.''  And it was there that Buddy became the favorite entertainer of two of Chicago's most famous personalities--Mike Royko and Harry Caray. When Mike's memorial service was held two years ago in Wrigley Field, there was Buddy at home plate, playing and singing Royko's favorite song.  Buddy's music and personality have provided refuge, relief and delight to four generations of music lovers. And through all those years, he has also been a loving husband to his wife of 45 years, Pat, a caring father to their now-grown children Teresa, Christopher, Tabitha and Amanda, and a daily churchgoer and teacher of catechism.  He has given himself to thousands of people through his music. Although it is a little sad that he won't be dispensing his brand of joy on a nightly basis any more, it is reassuring to know he is available to play when someone asks.  My sincerest good wishes to Buddy Charles and his family on this important occasion.                          ____________________
