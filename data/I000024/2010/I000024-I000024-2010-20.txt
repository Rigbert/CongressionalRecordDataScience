These are my 20 kids and grandkids. While maybe he has his name they have given him, my name is PopI. The I is for Inhofe, so it is MomI and PopI. Is that OK? That is what all these kids call me.  As I was listening to the great words my colleague was sharing for his grandchildren and their lives, I would like to ask unanimous consent those same words go to each one of these little grandkids up here. As you mentioned one after another of your experiences, I remember this little girl here, she was one of them for me. She was only 4 pounds and you could hold her with one hand. The same thing was true with this one over here.  So when I look at this, I get very excited. It is what is important. We talk about a lot of things around here, but this is what is important. One of the criticisms I have had in considering this thing is hearing: I want to get back during this Christmas season--and I think most of the others do too--and want to be with them.  This little girl right here, she is my wife. Today is our 51st wedding anniversary. So I just want to say that some things are important, and I want to deliver my message to my wife who is back in Oklahoma--where she should be with all the rest of these kids--but, Kay, I love you as much today as I did 51 years ago.                          ____________________
