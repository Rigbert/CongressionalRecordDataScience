Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record at this point a letter from the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, to myself regarding H.R. 3087.                                         House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Budget,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2003.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure,     Rayburn HOB, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: I understand that the House is      expected to consider a five-month extension of TEA21 and      concerns have arisen as to whether this would have adverse      budgetary implications for highway, highway safety, and mass      transit programs when a long-term extension is considered      next year.       In particular, concerns have been raised that the Committee      on Transportation and Infrastructure would be penalized      should the short-term extension expire before the      Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases it baseline      projections early next year. As you know, CBO is generally      prohibited from assuming the continuation of any expired      mandatory program.       I am confident your committee will not be penalized for any      temporary lapse in its spending authorities. For purposes of      enforcing either the 2004 or 2005 budget resolution, the      appropriate baseline would be the baseline underlying the      budget resolution. The 2004 budget resolution assumes a      multi-year extension of TEA21, and I can assure you that the      House budget resolution for 2005 will also assume such an      extension and I will work to maintain that position in      conference.       Further, it would be my intent, if necessary, to request      that CBO produce an alternative baseline that assumes a full      year extension and I would use this baseline to develop the      FY 2005 budget resolution. Accordingly, it will make little      difference as to whether the House ultimately adopts a five-      or six month extension. Either way, I will make every attempt      to ensure that the operative baseline reflects the      continuation of these critical highway, highway safety, and      mass transit programs.       If I may be of any assistance as you move this important      bill, please do not hesitate to contact me or Rich Meade,      Chief of Staff of the Budget Committee, at 6-7270.           Sincerely,                                                       Jim Nussle,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
