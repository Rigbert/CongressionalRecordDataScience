President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his gracious intervention on my behalf. Weare debating today homeland security. We are also engaged in another significant debate about international security in the context of Iraq and the war on terror. But as Senator Daschle reminded us, we also have to be concerned about economic security in the United States.  Frankly, the economic numbers we have been seeing lately do not give much confidence to the American people that their economic security is being protected. As the vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, I have the opportunity to review, along with the staff, the reports that are coming in about our economy. It is clear that GDP is growing, but too slowly to make much of a dent in the unemployment rate. People who have lost their jobs face a much more difficult job market, and many are beginning to exhaust their unemployment benefits.  Everyone is facing increased premiums for health care. Employers are cutting back their contributions to health programs. They are being stressed in terms of adequately funding pension programs. These are the real concerns of Americans today all across this country.  When we look at the numbers, when we look at the reports, the conclusion is, obviously, we are still in an economic slump. Indicative of this are the figures I have on this chart. This is the record of job growth, but it is not growth at all, it is job loss during the Bush administration. In January 2001, there were 112 million jobs, today, August 2002, 110 million jobs--a loss of over 2 million jobs that have not yet been replaced in this economy.  The unemployment rate in August was 5.7 percent. That is one and a half percentage points higher than it was when President Bush took office. The number of unemployed Americans was more than 2 million higher in August than it was when President Bush took office, as indicated by this chart.  There is also another telling statistic that is within these unemployment numbers. The number of long-term unemployed Americans--those who have been unemployed more than 26 weeks--has increased significantly. This chart reflects that increase. In January of 2001, 648,000 Americans had been unemployed more than 26 weeks; in August 2002, 1,474,000 Americans were unemployed more than 26 weeks--a significant jump. It is significant not just in terms of numbers but in terms of something else: Americans exhaust their basic unemployment benefits after 26 weeks. Unless we have an extended benefit program in place, after 26 weeks American workers have no support as they look for jobs, as they try to support their families, as they try to make ends meet. This problem is not going away.  Although as part of the stimulus package we have passed extended benefits, they are scheduled to expire at the end of this year, so we have a real obligation in these remaining days to protect a basic tenet of economic security in this country, and that is to provide extended unemployment benefits.  The 1,474,000 will increase, and these individuals will not have the support they need to provide for their families. The little bit of growth we have seen so far is not going to head off a jobless recovery.  It should be noted that when President George Herbert Walker Bush was President and we were in a recessionary period in 1991, the unemployment rate rose another full percentage point in the 15 months after the GDP started to grow again. So we can likely see increased unemployment.  There are forecasters who have suggested our economic growth will be about 2.8 percent for the rest of the year--that is the Blue Chip consensus forecast--but the economy has to grow at more than 3 percent to generate the kind of new jobs that will reverse this unemployment situation. No consensus forecaster fully expects that type of growth going forth. As a result, most economists suggest and predict that unemployment rates will rise to 6 percent. Again, this is a real challenge to the safety and security of the American family, just as real as the threats we are debating in terms of homeland security and international security.  The conclusion, as one looks at these numbers and the economic performance from the time the President took over, is that President Bush's economy looks a lot like his father's economy. It is in recession, unemployment is growing, it will continue to grow, and yet there has not been an adequate response to this problem by the White House. He seems to have one proposal with respect to every economic question, and that is cutting the taxes of the wealthiest Americans.  As this chart indicates, this is the effect of the proposed tax cuts of President Bush, tax cuts that were enacted last year. At year 10, when they are fully realized, the average benefits, based on income level, will be as portrayed in this chart. The lowest 20th percentile of Americans will receive about $66 a year in benefits. It goes up to about $375 for individuals making around $20,000, $600 for those making about $39,000 a year. The real gain, the real benefit, goes to the very wealthiest Americans--$55,000 roughly, on average, for the top 1 percent. That is their annual savings for the tax benefits generated by the Bush tax proposal. This is not fair, and it is not smart. Unless we get all Americans participating fully in our economy, having the disposable income to go to the store to keep consumption up, to keep demand up, we are not going to have an economy that works for any American. Indeed, this is a glaring example of what some criticized Democrats for--class warfare. What is more unfair, inequitable, and slanted toward a class than this tax cut which favors the wealthiest Americans?  In addition to these tax numbers, we have to understand that these tax cuts have put enormous pressure on other programs that are decisive for every American, but particularly important for low-income Americans: Medicaid Programs, Medicare Programs, a host of other programs that need Federal support. That support has been strained dramatically because of the pressure of the tax cut.  We are at a point now where we have to act. We have to act in the very short run to restore extended unemployment benefits for the growing number of long-term unemployed Americans. We have to act, also, to resist the temptation to make all of these tax benefits permanent. However unfair this situation is, it will be compounded, and it will be compounded dramatically, if we make the tax cuts of the last year permanent.  We have to go ahead and focus on those issues that are critical to the welfare of the American family today, for their economic security today. We have to be concerned about pensions, their strength. We have to protect, I believe, Social Security, which is the bedrock of America.  I wonder how many employees of Enron and WorldCom and other companies 2 years ago would have considered their Social Security as just a trivial benefit compared to their expanded and ever-growing 401(k) plans. Today, I suspect, they see their Social Security benefit, their defined benefit, as a lifeline, allowing them to make ends meet, or at least giving them a little extra to get through.  We have to be strong in terms of protecting the bedrock program, Social Security. We have to be concerned about rising health care premiums and prescriptions drug costs. None of these problems can be addressed unless we provide the leadership, the resources, and the attention the American people demand.  Let me conclude by saying, again, there is at least one thing we must do in the next several weeks: Extend long-term unemployment benefits. Unemployment, long term, is growing. It will continue to grow for many months. American workers deserve the opportunity for some support as they look for new jobs. They deserve the opportunity to help their families as they get through a very difficult period of time.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
