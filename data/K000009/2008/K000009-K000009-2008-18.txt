Speaker, my message to the American people: Don't let Congress seal this Wall Street deal.  High financial crimes have been committed. Now Congress is being asked to bail out the culprits and to do so at the expense of those who elected us to guard their interests--the people of our country.  The normal legislative process that should accompany the review of a monumental proposal to bail out Wall Street has been shelved--yes, shelved. Only a few insiders are doing the dealing. It sounds like insider trading to me.  These criminals have so much political power that they can shut down the normal legislative process of the highest law-making body in this land. All of the committees that should be scanning every word of what is being negotiated are benched, and that means the American people are benched, too.  We are constitutionally sworn to protect and to defend this Republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic. My friends, there are enemies. We are told we will have a bill, a $1 trillion bill, to review soon, and will have less than 24 hours with no regular hearings to try to vote on this bramblebush.  The people pushing this deal are the very same ones who were responsible for the implosion on Wall Street. They were fraudulent then and they're fraudulent now. We should say ``no'' to this deal. I ask my colleagues to join us at 2 o'clock in HC-8 of the Capitol to meet with some real experts who have done financial resolutions without putting the burden on the taxpayer.  Please join us in HC-8 at 2 p.m.                          ____________________
