President, we are in difficult times. The administration has informed us that the financial markets stand on the brink of collapse and that Congress must act quickly to allow the Treasury to intervene in the markets. We must not simply bail out the companies whose subprime mortgage practices put us in this situation in the first place. Many of us are working to include help for homeowners in any stabilization we consider.  But we must also look beyond the immediate crisis and take steps to prevent similar abuses and errors in the future. This crisis started when lenders sold too many faulty mortgages to families who had too little protection against such practices. Once this immediate crisis passes, Congress must act to ensure that this never happens again.  Our financial system requires a fundamental overhaul, so that the needs of American families stand above the interests of Wall Street.  To start that discussion, today I am introducing the Consumer Credit Safety Commission Act. This bill would put a single government agency in charge of ensuring that the offering of financial products to consumers is responsible, accountable, and transparent.  This new agency would look out for consumers first, so that the Fed, the FDIC, and the rest of the alphabet soup of financial regulators can focus more effectively on the safety and soundness of our financial system while not letting consumer protection fall by the wayside.  This agency would be able to move quickly to protect consumers from new predatory practices, much faster than Congress ever could. It would provide continuous oversight of the financial services market, and hold companies accountable when they abuse, deceive, or take advantage of the consumers they claim to be helping.  Let me put it this way, as Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren has done: why is it that 1 in 10 toasters do not catch fire in our homes, but 1 in 10 home mortgages are failing? The answer is that toasters are properly regulated and financial products are not.  I do not believe that the Government should regulate the freedom out of our markets, and I do not believe that we should eliminate prudent risk taking.  On the contrary: moderate, sensible, and targeted regulation creates an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit of America can thrive, but without the unnecessary booms and busts of the Wild West.  The Consumer Credit Safety Commission will add consumer protection to the factors lenders must consider in creating and offering financial products. It will identify the practices that undermine sound markets and put a stop to them before they bring the entire financial market to its knees.  Starting early next year, Congress will try to establish the oversight and accountability mechanisms that will foster a dynamic and more responsible environment for financial products. This bill provides us with a good place to start. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation and working to create an agency that truly puts consumers first.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3629       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The Congress finds that--       (1) the Nation's multi-agency financial services regulatory      structure has created a dispersion of regulatory      responsibility, which in turn has led to an inadequate focus      on protecting consumers from inappropriate consumer credit      practices;       (2) the absence of appropriate oversight has allowed      excessively costly or predatory consumer credit products to      flourish; and       (3) the creation of a regulator whose sole focus is the      safety of consumer credit products would help address this      lack of consumer protection.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       For purposes of this Act--       (1) the term ``consumer credit'' includes--       (A) any payment compensating a creditor or prospective      creditor, or an agent or affiliate thereof, for an extension      of credit or making available a line of credit;       (B) any fees connected with credit extension or      availability, such as numerical periodic rates, late fees,      creditor-imposed not sufficient funds fees charged when a      borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on      insufficient funds, over limit fees, annual fees, cash      advance fees, or membership fees;       (C) any fees which constitute a finance charge;       (D) credit insurance premiums;       (E) all charges and costs for ancillary products sold in      connection with or incidental to the credit transaction; and       (F) any direct or indirect fee, cost, or charge incurred      in, in connection with, or ancillary to a consumer payment      system, including but not exclusive to merchant discount      fees, interchange fees, debit card fees, check-writing fees,      automated clearinghouse fees, payment-by-phone fees, internet      payment intermediary fees, and remote deposit capture fees;       (2) the term ``relevant congressional committees'' means      the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the      Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government of      the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, and the      Committee on Financial Services and the Subcommittee on      Financial Services and General Government of the Committee on      Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and any      successor committees as may be constituted;       (3) the term ``creditor'' has the same meaning as in      section 103 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602);       (4) the term ``finance charge'' has the same meaning as in      section 106 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1605); and       (5) the term ``consumer'' means any natural person and any      small business concern, as defined in section 3 of the Small      Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

(b) Transmittal to Congress.--The Commission shall transmit      such notice within 10 calendar days to the relevant      congressional committees.       (c) Voluntary Standard; Publication as Proposed Rule;      Notice of Reliance of Commission on Standard.--If the      Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in      response to an invitation in a notice published under      subsection (a)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in      combination with any other standard submitted to the      Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer      credit safety rule, would achieve the objective or objectives      identified in paragraph (1), the Commission may publish such      standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with      nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer credit      safety rule.       (d) Publication of Proposed Rule; Preliminary Regulatory      Analysis; Contents.--No consumer credit safety rule may be      proposed by the Commission unless, not later than 60 days      after the date of publication of the notice required in      subsection (a), the Commission publishes in the Federal      Register the text of the proposed rule, including any      alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate,      together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing--       (1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and      potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits      or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an      identification of those likely to receive the benefits and      bear the costs;       (2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of      a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection      (a)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed      rule or part of the proposed rule; and       (3) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the      proposed rule, together with a summary description of their      potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why      such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.       (e) Transmittal of Notice.--The Commission shall transmit      such notice not later than 10 calendar days after the date of      publication of the notice to the relevant congressional      committees.       (f) Final Issuance.--Any proposed consumer credit safety      rule shall be issued within 12 months after the date of      publication of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under      subsection (a) relating to the consumer credit involved,      unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is      not a reasonable means of achieving the objective or      objectives identified in subsection (a)(1) with respect to      such proposed rule or an objective specified in section 6(a),      or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend      that 12-month period for good cause. If the Commission      extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of      such extension to the relevant congressional committees. Such      notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such      extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the      Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The      Commission shall publish a notice of such extension and the      information submitted to the Congress in the Federal      Register.       (g) Promulgation of Rule.--       (1) Timing.--Not later than 60 days after the date of      publication under subsection (c) of a proposed consumer      credit safety rule, the Commission shall--       (A) promulgate a consumer credit safety rule, if it makes      the findings required under subsection (h); or       (B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking      if it determines that such rule is not--       (i) a reasonable means of achieving the objective or      objectives identified in subsection (a)(1) with respect to      such proposed rule or an objective specified in section 6(a);      or       (ii) in the public interest.       (2) Extension.--The Commission may extend such 60-day      period in paragraph (1) for good cause shown (if it publishes      its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).       (3) Title 5.--Consumer credit safety rules shall be      promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United      States Code, except that the Commission shall give interested      persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data,      views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make      written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral      presentation.       (h) Expression of Objective; Consideration of Available      Product Data; Needs of Elderly and Handicapped.--       (1) Objectives.--A consumer credit safety rule shall      express in the rule itself the objectives identified in      subsection (a)(1) with respect to such rule.       (2) Considerations.--In promulgating such a rule, the      Commission shall--       (A) consider relevant available data, including the results      of investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant      to this Act; and       (B) consider and take into account the special needs of      elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities to      determine the extent to which such persons may be affected by      such rule.       (i) Findings; Final Regulatory Analysis; Judicial Review of      Rule.--       (1) Findings.--Prior to promulgating a consumer credit      safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make      appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect      to--       (A) the degree and nature of the benefit to consumer      protection that the rule is designed to achieve or promote;       (B) the approximate number of consumer credit products, or      types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;       (C) the need of the public for the consumer credit product      subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule      upon the utility, cost, or availability of such services to      meet such need; and       (D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while      minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or      dislocation of the provision of consumer credit.       (2) Regulatory analysis.--The Commission shall not      promulgate a consumer credit safety rule, unless it--       (A) has prepared, on the basis of the findings of the      Commission under paragraph (1) and on other information      before the Commission, a final regulatory analysis of the      rule containing--       (i) a description of the potential benefits and potential      costs of the rule, including costs and benefits that cannot      be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of      those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;       (ii) a description of any alternatives to the final rule      which were considered by the Commission, together with a      brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were      not chosen; and       (iii) a summary of any significant issues raised by the      comments submitted during the public comment period in      response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a      summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues;       (B) finds (and includes such finding in the rule)--       (i) that the rule (including its effective date) is      reasonably appropriate to achieve an objective identified in      subsection (a)(1) with respect to such proposed rule or      specified in section 6(a);       (ii) that the promulgation of the rule is in the public      interest; and       (iii) that the benefits expected from the rule bear a      reasonable relationship to its costs.       (3) Publication.--The Commission shall publish its final      regulatory analysis with the rule.       (4) Limit on judicial review.--Any preliminary or final      regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (i)(2)      shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except      that when an action for judicial review of a rule is      instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis      shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of      agency action in connection with such review. The provisions      of this paragraph shall not be construed to alter the      substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to      judicial review of any action by the Commission.       (j) Effective Date.--Each consumer credit safety rule shall      specify the date on which such rule is to take effect, not to      exceed 180 days from the date on which it is issued in final      form, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that      a later effective date is in the public interest and      publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of      a consumer credit safety rule under this Act shall be set at      a date that is at least 30 days after the date of issuance in      final form, unless the Commission for good cause shown      determines that an earlier effective date is in the public      interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date      which is earlier than the date of issuance in final form.       (k) Amendment or Revocation of Rule.--The Commission may,      by rule, amend or revoke any consumer credit safety rule.      Such amendment or revocation shall specify the     date on which it is to take effect, which shall not exceed      180 days from the date on which the amendment or revocation      is published, unless the Commission finds for good cause      shown that a later effective date is in the public interest      and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an      amendment involves a material change in a consumer credit      safety rule, subsections (a) through (h) shall apply. In      order to revoke a consumer credit safety rule, the Commission      shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal      Register, and allow oral and written presentations in      accordance with subsection (d)(2). The Commission may revoke      such rule only if it determines that the rule is not a      reasonable means of achieving an objective identified in      subsection (a)(1) with respect to such proposed rule or an      objective specified in subsection 6(a).       (l) Petition to Initiate Rulemaking.--The Commission shall      grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under      section 553 (e) of title 5, United States Code, requesting      the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable      time after the date on which such petition is filed. The      Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying      such petition.     SEC. 11. PROHIBITED ACTS.       It shall be unlawful for any person--       (1) to advertise for or offer for sale any consumer credit      which is not in conformity with an applicable consumer credit      safety rule under this Act;       (2) to advertise for or offer for sale any consumer      credit--       (A) which has been declared a banned product by a rule      under this Act;       (B) in a manner that does not comply with any requirements      for the provision of any warnings or other information      regarding such credit; or       (3) to fail or refuse to permit access to or copying of      records, or fail or refuse to establish or maintain records,      or fail or refuse to make reports or provide information to      the Commission as required under this Act or any rule      thereunder, other than section 9.     SEC. 12. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.       (a) Criminal Penalties.--       (1) Knowing and willful violations.--Any person who      knowingly and willfully violates section 11 after having      received notice of noncompliance from the Commission shall be      fined not more than $500,000 or be imprisoned not more than      one year, or both.       (2) Executives and agents.--Any individual director,      officer, or agent of a corporation who knowingly and      willfully authorizes, orders, or performs any of the acts or      practices constituting in whole or in part a violation of      section 11, and who has knowledge of notice of noncompliance      received by the corporation from the Commission, shall be      subject to penalties under this section, without regard to      any penalties to which that corporation may be otherwise      subject.       (b) Civil Penalties.--       (1) In general.--Any person who violates section 11 shall      be subject to a civil penalty to be established at the      discretion of the Commission. A violation of section 11 shall      constitute a separate civil offense with respect to each      consumer credit transaction involved.       (2) Publication of schedule of penalties.--Not later than      December 1, 2009, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year      thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe and publish in the      Federal Register a schedule of maximum authorized penalties      that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of      the year immediately following such publication.       (3) Relevant factors in determining amount of penalty.--In      determining the amount of any penalty to be sought upon      commencing an action seeking to assess a penalty for a      violation of section 11, the Commission shall consider the      nature of the consumer credit product or service, the      severity of the unreasonable risk to the consumer, the number      of products or services sold or distributed, and the      appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of      the business of the person charged.       (4) Compromise of penalty; deductions from penalty.--Any      civil penalty under this section may be compromised by the      Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty or      whether it should be remitted or mitigated and in what      amount, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of      such penalty to the size of the business of the person      charged, the nature of the consumer credit, the severity of      the unreasonable risk to the consumer, the occurrence or      absence of consumer injury, and the number of offending      products or services sold. The amount of such penalty when      finally determined, or the amount agreed on compromise, may      be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the      person charged.       (c) Collection and Use of Penalties.--The Commission shall      retain ownership over criminal and civil fees collected and      shall apply these fees to defray the costs of the      Commission's operation or, where appropriate, provide      restitution for harmed consumers.     SEC. 13. REPORTS.       (a) Reports to the Public.--The Commission shall determine      what reports should be produced and distributed to the public      on a recurring and ad hoc basis, and shall prepare and      publish such reports on a web site that provides free access      to the general public.       (b) Report to President and Congress.--The Commission shall      prepare and submit to the President and the relevant      congressional committees at the beginning of each regular      session of Congress a comprehensive report on the      administration of this Act for the preceding fiscal year.      Such report shall include--       (1) a thorough appraisal, including statistical analyses,      estimates, and long-term projections, of the incidence and      effects of practices associated with the provision of      consumer credit that are inconsistent with the objectives      specified in section 6(a), with a breakdown, insofar as      practicable, among the various sources of injury as the      Commission finds appropriate;       (2) a list of consumer credit safety rules prescribed or in      effect during such year;       (3) an evaluation of the degree of observance of consumer      credit safety rules, including a list of enforcement actions,      court decisions, and compromises of civil penalties, by      location and company name;       (4) a summary of outstanding problems confronting the      administration of this Act in order of priority;       (5) an analysis and evaluation of public and private      consumer credit safety research activities;       (6) a list, with a brief statement of the issues, of      completed or pending judicial actions under this Act;       (7) the extent to which technical information was      disseminated to the scientific and consumer credit      communities and consumer information was made available to      the public;       (8) the extent of cooperation between Commission officials      and representatives of industry and other interested parties      in the implementation of this Act, including a log or summary      of meetings held between Commission officials and      representatives of industry and other interested parties;       (9) an appraisal of significant actions of State and local      governments relating to the responsibilities of the      Commission;       (10) with respect to voluntary consumer credit safety      standards promulgated as consumer safety rules under section      10(c), a description of--       (A) the number of such standards adopted as rules; and       (B) the nature and number of the consumer credit products      and services which are the subject of such adopted rules and      the approximate number of consumers affected;       (11) such recommendations for additional legislation as the      Commission deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this      Act; and       (12) the extent of cooperation with and the joint efforts      undertaken by the Commission in conjunction with other      regulators with whom the Commission shares responsibilities      for consumer credit safety.     SEC. 14. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall be effective 120 days after the date of      enactment of this Act.                                 ______                                       By
