 President, I don't want to be redundant, but I would like to continue the statement I began to make earlier this morning. Let me quickly put it in perspective.  The statement further explains an amendment that I have at the desk, which essentially says that a group health plan or an insurance issuer may not arbitrarily interfere with, or alter, the decision of the treating physician with respect to the manner or the setting in which particular services are delivered if those services are medically necessary or appropriate.  It then goes on to define ``medically necessary'' as ``that which is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice.'' The amendment, of course, means that the doctor can determine what is a medically necessary length for a hospital stay, and the doctor can determine the kind of treatment or drug the patient can be best treated with.  I know some people wonder why am I so vociferous about physicians making medical decisions. California has the largest number of individuals in managed care. We have around 20 million people in managed care plans in California.  I have heard of many different cases. Let me just give you one other case--I just talked about the person with the brain illness. I can also give you the case of the Central Valley man, 27 years old who had a heart transplant and was forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not pay for more days. That constituent of mine died. That is the reason I feel so strongly.  Additionally, I know--and the Washington Post this morning documents--that doctors are increasingly frustrated, demoralized, and hamstrung by insurance plans' definitions of medical necessity. An American Medical Association survey reported in the March 2, 1999, Washington Post, quoted an AMA spokeswoman who said that some managed care companies have begun to define explicitly what treatments are ``medically necessary,'' and they have chosen to define them in terms of lowest cost.  She says:       Doctors used to make that decision solely on the basis of      what was best for the patient.  She stressed that doctors are unhappy that managed care organizations are ``controlling or influencing medical treatment before the treatment is provided.'' She said, ``Denials and delays in providing care directly harm the health and well-being of the patients.''  A fall 1998 report found that ``patients and physicians can expect to see more barriers to prescriptions being filled as written,'' according to the Scott-Levin consultant firm, because HMOs are requiring more ``prior authorizations'' by the plans before doctors can prescribe them.  Then, as I spoke of a little earlier, there is the issue of financial incentives, another form of interference in medical necessity decisions. In November, the New England Journal of Medicine pointed out:       Many managed care organizations include financial      incentives for primary care physicians that are indexed to      various measures of performance. Incentives that depend on      limiting referrals or on greater productivity applies      selective pressure to physicians in ways that are believed to      compromise care.  That is what we are trying to stop.       Incentives that depend on the quality of care and patients'      satisfaction are associated with greater job      satisfaction among physicians.  Let me describe how Charles Krauthammer put it in writing in the January 9, 1998 Washington Post under the headline, ``Driving the Best Doctors Away'':       The second cause of [doctors leaving the profession] is the      loss of independence. More than money, this is what is      driving these senior doctors crazy: some 24-year-old      functionary who knows as much about medicine as he does about      cartography demanding to know why Mr. Jones, a diabetic in      renal failure, has not been discharged from the hospital yet.      Dictated to by medically ignorant administrators, questioned      about every prescription and procedure, reduced in status      from physician to ``provider,'' these doctors want out.  Mr. President, that is a sorry commentary, and it is the truth.       One of my deepest interests is cancer. I cochair the Senate      Cancer Coalition with the distinguished Senator from Florida,      Senator Connie Mack. Let me quote from a report of the      President's Cancer Panel:       Under the evolving managed care system, participating      physicians are increasingly being asked to do more with      less--to see a greater volume of patients and provide      significantly more documentation of care with less assistance      or staff. In addition, managed care has dictated a major      shift to primary care gatekeepers who are under pressure to      limit referrals to specialists and care provided in tertiary      care facilities, and may be financially rewarded for their      success in doing so.  Nancy Ledbetter, an oncology nurse and clinical research nurse coordinator for Kaiser Permanente said, ``. . . necessary care is being withheld in order to contain costs.'' This is from the June 16, 1999 Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  A breast cancer surgeon wrote me:       Severe limitations are being placed upon surgeons in giving      these women [with breast cancer] total care . . . Patients      feel that their care is reduced to the mechanics of surgery      alone, ignoring the whole patient's medical, emotional, and      psychological needs.  Surely, one of the oldest axioms of medicine, and the way my father used to practice medicine, is that you can't just treat the wound, you have to treat the whole patient as an individual, as a human being.  In my State, again, over 80 percent of people who have insurance are in managed care. Forty percent of California's Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care. Some say Californians have been pioneers for managed care. Some even say Californians have been the Nation's ``guinea pigs.''  The complaints don't abate: delaying diagnoses and treatments as tumors grow; trying the cheapest therapies first, instead of the most effective; refusing needed hospital admissions; refusing to refer patients to specialists who can accurately diagnose conditions and provide effective treatments; we hear complaints about shoving patients out of the hospitals prematurely, against doctor's wishes. We hear complaints about misclassifying medically necessary treatments as ``cosmetic.''  We hear about plans demanding that doctors justify their care and second-guessing doctors' medical judgments.  We have had heard about doctors exaggerating the patient's condition to be able to give them a certain drug, or keep them in a hospital beyond a certain length of time, to get plans to pay for care.  I hope this amendment can restore some balance to the system by empowering patients and the medical profession to provide the kind of quality medical care that people not only pay for but that they deserve.  That is why I feel so strongly about this amendment.  Again, I harken back to the day when I had the first example in 1997 of a woman in a major managed care plan undergoing an outpatient radical mastectomy--7:30 in the morning, surgery; 4:30, out on the street with drains hanging from her chest, and unable to know where she was going.  That is not good medicine.  I can only end my comments on this amendment by saying that the amendment is sincerely presented.  The amendment is the heart of a Patients' Bill of Rights.  The amendment should not increase premium costs.  The amendment is what the American people expect.  And the amendment simply says that an insurance company cannot arbitrarily interfere with the doctor's decision with respect to treatment or hospitalization.  I don't think that is too much to ask this body to legislate and to state unequivocally, and I think every single person in my State, as well as every State, will be much better off once this is accomplished.  Let me end by saying that I believe that Senator Daschle is willing to work out an agreement which allows a number of amendments to come to the floor and be debated, provided that these amendments can be voted up or down.  I suspect that what we are going to really end up with is a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights. I suspect that if we can get this unanimous consent agreement, we will find that there will be many on the other side of the aisle who will vote for this amendment, and there will be some of us who will vote for some of the amendments on the other side as well.  It seems to me that when you have a situation whereby the physicians in America have reached the point where they have decided to unionize and collectively bargain that this should be a very loud call that all is not well with the practice of medicine in the United States of America.  It should be a very loud call for a unanimous consent agreement which will allow us, on the floor of the Senate, to work out a series of amendments which can provide the kind of quality care that the people of the United States are entitled to, and that certainly 20 million Californians in managed care are.  I thank the Chair.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
