Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3671, which reforms the administration of the Pittman-Robertson and the Dingell-Johnson Acts. These acts established trust funds, paid for by sportsmen and women through taxes on guns, ammunition, archery equipment and fishing equipment for State fish and game departments to use for wildlife and sport fish restoration projects. Administration of these acts is the responsibility of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Oversight conducted by the committee, which I chair, the Committee on Resources, uncovered waste, fraud, and abuse of the administration funds by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 3671 on April 5 by a vote of 423-2.  H.R. 3671 puts in place reforms that will prevent abuse and misuse of administration funds in the future. It caps the amount of funds for administration, provides clear direction as to how these funds will be spent, establishes audits, reporting and certification requirements, and establishesan assistant director to oversee the administration of these programs.  The legislation also establishes a grant program for firearm and bow hunter safety and a grant program for multiple-state conservation projects that will enable States to work collectively on wildlife and sport fish restoration projects that cross State lines.  The Senate has suggested some modifications to H.R. 3671, and I have agreed to those changes. The Senate slightly increased funding for the administration. They also increased funding for the Firearm and Bow Hunter Educational Grant Program and a Multi-State Conservation Grant Program.  By stopping waste, fraud, and abuse and by cutting bureaucracy, the reforms in H.R. 3671 provide more dollars to State fishing and game departments on on-the-ground projects. They will ensure that the money paid into the trust fund by the sportsmen and the sportswomen in their district goes where it belongs, to State wildlife and sport fish restoration. Let us pass H.R. 3671 and safeguard the taxes paid by the hunters and anglers and guarantee continued wildlife and sports fish restoration as intended under the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Act.  H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Improvement Act overwhelmingly passed the House 423 to 2 on April 5th. This reform bill amends the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts. It provides clear direction to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on how to administer the wildlife and sport fish programs established under the Acts. Our oversight found that administration funds from the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson programs were being used in ways not consistent with either Act. For example we found that administration funds were used to pay for expenses for the rest of the Fish and Wildlife Service and they were used to create grant programs that were not statutorily authorized under the Acts. This is clearly not how the administration funds are to be spent. We did not want to leave any ambiguity as to how the funds can or cannot be spent. When there is ambiguity, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ``interprets'' what the law says, and the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson programs suffer the consequences.                            management study  On April 5th, Representative Dingell and I engaged in a colloquy about the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and how they should undertake an independent, outside, top-to-bottom review to determine how many people are needed to administer the programs and what mixture of skills they should have. My only concern at the time was that any review be truly independent of undue influence. For that reason, I agreed with Representative Dingell that the study should be conducted provided the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the reviewer consult with the House Committee on Resources prior to and during the review, the Committee must agree with the parameters of the review and the Committee must be advised of the process of the review.  I am disappointed to report that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service did not listen to what Representative Dingell and I said on April 5th. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service initiated and completed the management study without ever consulting with the Committee. In addition, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service instructed the consultant, The Center for Organizational Excellence (COE), to complete the project so that it could be used to impact this legislation. This sounds to me like lobbying legislation pending before Congress with Federal funds. It was not my intent, nor the intent of Representative Dingell,  that the Fish and Wildlife Service use administration funds to lobby Congress on the reform legislation. The management study was not to be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to preserve the status quo, it was to be used to assist the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in deciding how best to restructure the staffing with individuals with the necessary skills to meet the true administration needs of the programs and the letter of the law.  I am further disappointed to report that the conclusions reached by COE on funding needs were not based on correct information. Information provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service to COE was inaccurate. Based on inaccurate information, COE reached the following conclusion regarding funding for administration:       Although H.R. 3671 states that Federal Aid should continue      conducting many of its current activities (such as training      of States, travel to projects in-progress, consultation to      States, etc.), the budget granted to Federal Aid under H.R.      3671 will not allow Federal Aid to continue all of these      activities. This assessment is based on the data collected      and analyzed by COE to date, including current workload and      staffing levels and assessments provided by both Federal Aid      and the IAFWA. (Federal Aid Division Resource Requirements      Analysis, The Center for Organizational Excellence, September      29, 2000, page 5-2)  COE reported to Committee staff that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service did not provide them with the spending levels that were in H.R. 3671 when it passed the House. In addition, it seems that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service did not explain to COE that the current workload includes tasks that are not considered administration under H.R. 3671. COE was unable to accurately assess the funding needs since the data they were given does not reflect the new parameters for administration established in H.R. 3671.  COE was able to reach conclusions regarding how the programs were being administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the conclusions they reached about the current administration of the programs is troubling. The management report confirms what we found during our oversight--the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is not properly administering the programs. Regarding the issue of how administration funds are used, the report stated:       Resources are not allocated the Regions and functions based      on any systematic framework. This relates to the lack of      strategic planning described earlier. It is not apparent that      Federal Aid currently deploys resources to a particular area      on any basis other than that is where resources were deployed      last year. There is no evidence that customer requirements,      organizational priorities, or other issues are taken into      account. (Federal Aid Division Resource Requirements      Analysis, The Center for Organizational Excellence, September      29, 2000, page 4-9)  Regarding the grade of employees who are currently employed in the Regional Offices, the report stated:  ``Our investigation of work processes revealed variations in how the core processes are performed and by whom, driven at least in part, by the different types of staff present in each Regional Office. For example, Region 2 and 6 have no staff in the grade range of GS 2-6. This raises the possibility that as all Regional Offices are performing the same core processes, Region 2 and 6 have core tasks performed by staff at too high a grade level (which leads to excessive payroll costs).'' (Federal Aid Division Resource Requirements Analysis, The Center for Organizational Excellence, September 29, 2000, page 3-1)  Regarding how the Regional Offices have decided what types of positions need to be in each Region:  ``Over the years, Regional Offices have added staff in an ad-hoc fashion, based on their interpretation of how best to meet their States' requirements and interests. There was no centralized methodology for determining what types of jobs or at what level are required to perform the workload of the Regional Offices. This may have been the best approach at the time, as the Regional Offices sought to provide the desired level and type of systematic staffing patterns among Regions, with little clear relationship to the workload of the Regional Office. Most importantly, staffing per Region has not been examined strategically and systematically, to ensure that Regional Offices are staffed to meet the mission of Federal Aid.'' (Federal Aid Division Resource Requirements Analysis, The Center for Organizational Excellence, September 29, 2000, page 3-1)  The report shows us once again how much these reforms are needed. We suggest that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service provide accurate information to the COE and that the management study be continued and completed. In addition, that the management study be prepared for and issued to the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Prior to continuation of the management study, and regularly thereafter, COE shall consult with the Committees on the information used for, the parameters of, and progress made in the study and management analysis.                  funds for administration of the acts  It was very important to set out in this legislation exactly how the United States Fish and Wildlife Service can spend administration funds. For an expense to be considered an administration expense available for funding under this Act, the expense will have to directly support the implementation of the Act and also consist of one of the twelve categories outlined in the Act. This will ensure the sportsmen that the administration dollars are being spent only on administration of the Acts.  When we wrote this legislation we carefully thought out how administration funds should be spent and established twelve categories of allowable expenses. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service came back to us concerned that there could be another category that we had not thought of. Even though theycould not come up with that ``other category'' or any additional expense, they expressed a need for spending flexibility for unforeseen expenses. We granted this flexibility up to a point. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service will be allowed to spend up to $25,000 of administration funds under each Act a year for an unforeseen expense, provided that they first inform the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works with an explanation of how much of the $25,000 they are going to spend and on what they are going to spend it. The House and the Senate Committees will have 30 days to get back to the Fish and Wildlife Service with their concurrence of the expenditures. It is not the intention of this Act that the funds for unforeseen expenses become a source of income for the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The amount of funds available for administration of each Act will allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to maintain their current level of 120 employees and to ramp-down to 110 employees in FY 2003. It is apparent that the programs have not used a systematic or logical approach to meet the staffing needs of the programs. It is important that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has the ability to change staffing and skills to meet the needs of the programs. This will allow the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to determine how many individuals are needed in the Washington Office and each Region to efficiently and successfully implement the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program. Starting in 2004, the funds available for administration will increase according to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, allowing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to keep pace with inflation and cost of living increases.       firearm and bow hunter education and safety program grants  H.R. 3671 establishes Firearm and Bow Hunter Education and Safety Program Grants for the States. These funds are meant to be an enhancement of the Pittman-Robertson funds the States already spend on hunter education. For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, $7,500,000 will be available and in 2003 and every year thereafter, $8,000,000 will be available. This will enable states who can demonstrate that they have used the maximum amount of funds for hunter education under the formula in the law to have access to additional funds for hunter education and safety or for other uses authorized under the Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service shall continue to track how much States are spending for Hunter Education purposes. States who use the maximum amount of funds available under Section 4(c) of the law will have access to these funds. At the end of the year, any unexpected funds will be apportioned to the States who have used all of the funds available to them under Section 4(c) of the law. This program is meant to encourage States to fund hunter education and safety programs, construct or update shooting ranges and archery ranges and to enhance interstate coordination and development of hunter education and shooting range programs. The future of the shooting sports depends on the States taking a more active roll in hunter safety and education, providing shooting and archery ranges for the public and working with each other to accomplish these initiatives.                 multi-State conservation grant program  H.R. 3671 also establishes a Multi-State Conservation Grant Program that will allow States to work collectively on projects that cross state boundaries. These grants will be available to States, groups of States and Non-Governmental Organizations. The grants are only allowed to be used to fund projects that do not oppose the regulated hunting or trapping of wildlife or the regulated taking of fish. It is important that a ``firewall'' be kept between the grant fund awarded under the Multi-State Conservation Grant Program and all other funds of the organization. The grant funds are not meant to supplement any other activity of the organization. They are only to be used for the explicit purpose of the grant. Organizations who apply for the grants may not use the grant funds to support activities that in any way oppose the regulated hunting or trapping of wildlife or the regulated taking of fish. If an organization is found to use the grant funds inappropriately, the funds will have to be returned and the organization will be subject to any applicable penalties under law.  Under the Multi-State Conservation Grant Program, The United States Fish and Wildlife Service will be allowed to compete for the grants awarded to conduct the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. This is the only project the United States Fish and Wildlife Service can compete for. By allowing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to compete for this grant, we do not intend that the Fish and Wildlife Service will automatically be awarded this grant. They will have to compete with others for this grant. We heard from many in the hunting, trapping and fishing community and the States that this survey wasn't the ``best product,'' but it was all they had. This bill will allow the States to have the opportunity to explore if another organization will be able to conduct the survey more efficiently and according to the parameters of the stakeholders. It is our intent that this legislation will put into the State's hands the control for this and all other Multi-State Conservation Grant Projects. And that when evaluating the merits of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's proposal, as with all other proposals for this project and other projects, the Non-governmental organizations that represent conservation organizations, sportsmen organizations and industries that fund the Federal Assistance Program for State Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs will be consulted.     administration costs for Dingell-Johnson Small Grant Programs  H.R. 3671 establishes that the administration costs of the Dingell-Johnson small grant programs (Clean Vessel Act pumpouts, Coastal Program Conservation Grants, Boating Infrastructure and the National Outreach and Communications Program) will be paid out of the funds for those programs. The administration costs of the small grant programs will not be funded through the administration funds for the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act. A total of $900,000 is available for the administration of these programs.  assistant director for wildlife and sport fish restoration programs  H.R. 3671 establishes within the Department of the Interior the position of Assistant Director for Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs. The funds collected from the excise taxes paid by sportsmen account for more than one-third of the whole budget of the Fish and Wildlife Service--in FY 2001 the amount to be collected is $528.7 million. Yet, these programs have had no presence at the Directorate level. In their Fiscal Year 2001 budget, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service budget requests for the following programs were:  Migratory Birds & State Programs--$22.8 million.  Fisheries & Habitat Conservation--$82.6 million.  Endangered Species & Marine Mammals--$199.1 million.  All of these programs have Assistant Directors and they each have responsibility for much smaller budgets than the Federal Assistance Program for State Wildlife and Sport Fish Programs. It is time that the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs are elevated in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and represented by an Assistant Director.  We also found that the managers of the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration programs lacked control over their own resources. Decisions on how to use personnel and administration funds were being made by individuals who did not have the best interests of the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs in mind. The creation of the Assistant Director position will alleviate this problem. The Assistant Director is very important to the success of these programs. The Assistant Director will be necessary to guide the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs under the new direction of this legislation. There will be important changes to how administration will be handled in the future. It will be crucial for this program, in order to establish a level of trust with the sportsmen who are paying the taxes, to show that the Fish and Wildlife Service truly wants the program to be run efficiently and according to the law.  We need to assure the sportsmen and women, who pay the excise taxes that provide the millions of dollars for State wildlife and sport fish restoration programs, that their money will be used as it is intended under the law. The trust needs to be restored between the sportsmen and women who fund the programs and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. I urge you to pass H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act, and put into place these much needed reforms of the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts.  The bill incorporates the text of H.R. 4442, the National Wildlife Refuge Centennial Act that overwhelmingly passed the House on July 11th. This legislation recognizes a great achievement in conservation--100 years of the National Wildlife Refuge System. While this is an important milestone, this measure recognizes that we still have work ahead of us to reduce the maintenance and operations backlog within the Refuge System.  It establishes a Commission to plan activities to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the System. The bill also requires the Secretary to submit a comprehensive plan for addressing the maintenance and operations backlog within the Refuge System. The American people deserve the finest Refuge System in the world.  The bill also reauthorizes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Since the Foundation was enacted into law in 1984, more than 3,850 conservation grants worth more than$490 million have been funded. These grants have been awarded to some 36 Federal agencies, 125 State and local municipalities, 92 colleges and institutions, and 852 different conservation groups.  I have received letters in support of reauthorizing the Foundation from the California Cattlemen's Association, Ducks Unlimited, the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the National Rifle Association, the National Trappers Association, Quail Unlimited, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America.  While there was no specific testimony on S. 1653, the Resources Committee did conduct several comprehensive oversight hearings on the operation of the Foundation.  Under the terms of this bill, the Foundation's Board of Directors would increase from 15 to 25 members; every dollar of Federal funding would be matched with a corresponding amount of non-Federal money; $20 million would be authorized for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and $5 million for NOAA; an annual report would be required detailing each conservation grant; affected Members of Congress would be given a 30-day notice when a project is proposed within their district; and statutory language has been included stipulating that no grant money can be used by the Foundation or its grantees for lobbying or litigation activities.  This is a good bill that will allow the Foundation to continue to undertake a variety of valuable conservation projects throughout the United States.  It is important to reiterate that lands acquired with Pittman Robertson funds are used for an array of wildlife dependent recreation activities such as fishing, trapping, and hunting. This use properly includes field trials with dogs. We expect that these activities will continue on acquired lands subject to reasonable restrictions supported by evidence to conserve wildlife and related habitat. Any guidelines issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service regarding such uses must be reasonable, recognize the value of these activities, and be developed cooperatively with the states as well as affected user groups. Some elements within the Service appear to believe that intensive on-the-ground management actions are inconsistent with the purpose of Pittman Robertson Act conservation programs. The Committee strongly disagrees with any such conclusion. We remind the agency that intensive management is often the key to assuring that multiplicity of wildlife dependent recreation activities can coexist on wildlife lands and can occur with conservation objectives and purposes. This is the case with field trials. So I want no one to mistake that field trials are quite compatible on lands acquired using Pittman Robertson funds. The lands are for hunting and field trials facilitate hunting.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
