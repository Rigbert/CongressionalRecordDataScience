Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's position. Of course, as the leader knows, the problem that we have on this side of the aisle with that position and your concern about having the tax credit expire shortly after the election next year, we have not given relief to the 200,000 service personnel who are covered and the 12 million children and 6.5 million families that would have been covered by the Senate amendment that was dropped in conference. So I understand your concern, and I share that concern. On this side of the aisle we do not want the tax credit to expire either.  Having said that, however, we would hope that the 6.5 million families and 12 million children and 200,000 Armed Forces personnel would not be held hostage to our concern about making sure that it does not expire in an untimely way.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, I share the gentleman's concern; but I do not think that that 6.5 million families would want to see a tax increase right after the election, having enjoyed getting a tax credit and then seeing their taxes go up $300 per child almost immediately. So I totally agree with the gentleman. But this bill, as the gentleman may recall, has very important provisions for the military in it.  I would just urge the gentleman to make his concerns known to those over in the other body that could move this bill within nanoseconds if they had real concerns for those 6.5 million families and the military families in this country.
