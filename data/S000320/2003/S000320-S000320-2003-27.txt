 I think it ought to be in other legislation. I am going to work with Senator Feingold. We all want to promote jobs in America. We believe the American worker can produce anything as well as, if not better than, any worker in the world. If we promote Buy America, I think we are saying something to our workers and our industry and our economy down the road, notwithstanding what others will argue.  So I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for bringing this up tonight. We are going to continue to work on this and try to put it in the proper legislation, where it is going to go somewhere.
