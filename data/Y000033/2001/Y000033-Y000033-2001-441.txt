Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support for H.R. 1831, The Small Business Liability Protection Act.  Like most Members of Congress, I know small businessmen in my district who have been caught up in Superfund litigation. It is terrible to see the toll it takes on the lives of these individuals. They don't know if they will lose their businesses, or even their homes.  If there is one thing all of us should be able to agree on, it is liability relief for small businesses that sent only 2 drums of waste or only ordinary garbage to a Superfund site.  Congress never intended that these parties be subject to Superfund liability.  To those of you who are concerned about ``Cherry-Picking'' Superfund reforms--let me assure you I am very interested in addressing additional Superfund legislation in this Congress.  We still need to address natural resource damages, liability relief for innocent parties, finality for state cleanup programs and Brownfields generally, and Superfund's joint and several liability scheme.  I urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1831.
