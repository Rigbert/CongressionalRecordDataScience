Res. 377, which honors and recognizes Armed Forces Day on May 16. Over the course of our Nation's history, generations of Americans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect the freedoms we hold dear. And we honor these courageous Americans on Armed Forces Day and throughout the month of May.  Armed Forces Day is an opportunity to recognize our troops and their families, as well as rededicate ourselves to the promises our Nation has made to repay their service and sacrifice. When we make our promises to our troops, we must keep them, for they most certainly have kept their commitment to the American people.  Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 377 and to declare to all U.S. servicemembers that we stand with them. When the call of duty sounded, they did not hesitate to answer. Let us not hesitate in our support of all those brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces.                              {time}  1615
