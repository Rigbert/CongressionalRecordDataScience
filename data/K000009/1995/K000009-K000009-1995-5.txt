HOKE. No. I will not yield, but I will yield at the end if I have time.  Clearly what disturbs me is that there would be a question as to why we would be here this evening to prioritize the needs of the Nation's veterans. It seems to me absolutely and utterly appropriate that we would do that, and it is only a very mean-spirited, very extreme liberal agenda that would not put that first.
