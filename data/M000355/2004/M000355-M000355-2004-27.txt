 President, most Americans probably do not know the Senate is a continuous body. From the day the Founding Fathers established this marvelous institution up until today, it has never had a termination point. It goes on and on. Senator Byrd can tell us exactly how many Members of the Senate there have been. The last figure I heard was something over 1,500.  Candidly, a significant number of those probably did not make much difference. They filled the seats. They made sure the continuous body continued. But very few left any footprints on the sands of time. We have honored a handful out here off the Senate floor, people such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and just a couple of others.  I have been here now a couple of decades, a little bit less than my friend from Oklahoma. I can say without fear of contradiction, from the moment I got here until today, the Senator from Oklahoma has been a leader in this body. He has been involved in virtually every issue of consequence in the 20 years I have been here in some kind of leadership capacity or providing his inspiration or, as the majority leader indicated, his enthusiasm for getting a solution to the problems confronting America at that particular moment.  So I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he has left footprints in this body.  He is one of the great Senators in the history of our country. We will alwaysremember his service, and we wish him Godspeed in the coming years and look forward to seeing him again in his new capacity whatever it may be.  I yield the floor.
