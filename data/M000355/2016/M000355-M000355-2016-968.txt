 President, Americans continue to see the difference a Republican-led Senate can make on behalf of our country. We have passed legislation to combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, to provide a long-term highway funding solution, and to advance many other important issues.  Today I am hopeful we will be able to add to that record of achievement with the FAA reauthorization and airport security bill, which aims to keep Americans safe in our airports and in the skies. Recent terror attacks across the world emphasize the importance of ensuring our airports are secure, and I am pleased the bill includes a number of provisions that will help to do so. From increasing security in prescreening areas to securing international flights arriving in the United States, to ramping up measures aimed at deterring cyber security attacks, this legislation contains the most comprehensive aviation security reforms in years.  It also includes a number of passenger-friendly provisions such as refunds for lost or delayed bags and efforts to improve travel for those with disabilities. The bill accomplishes all this without raising fees or taxes on passengers and without imposing heavy-handed regulations that threaten consumer choice.  The FAA reauthorization bill is the product of hard work and deliberation from Members on both sides of the aisle. It wouldn't have been possible without the leadership of Senator Thune, our Commerce Committee chair, and Senator Ayotte, the Aviation Subcommittee chair. They worked to consider amendments from both Republicans and Democrats that Members thought would make this good bill an even better one. I also thank their ranking member counterparts, Senator Nelson and Senator Cantwell, for their efforts to advance this legislation.  Let's continue that bipartisan progress today and move the FAA reauthorization and airport security bill across the finish line. It is a win for passengers. It is a win for national security. It is another example of commonsense legislating under Republican leadership that is getting the Senate back to work.                          ____________________
