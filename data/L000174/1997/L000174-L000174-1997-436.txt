President, I want to acknowledge the distinguished manager of the resolution and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Utah is a tough opponent and one who I know is committed to and sincerely believes in this proposed amendment to the Constitution. He has certainly done everything that he could and spared no effort to persuade the Senate to pass this proposal.  As the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to working with him on important legislation and nominations through the remainder of this Congress.  I want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle for his leadership on this issue. He helped set the tone of the debate early on, when he articulated the standard that we should apply when considering a proposal to amend the Constitution.  I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Byrd. I said in my opening statement at our first Judiciary Committee hearing on January 17 that we would be privileged to have Senator Robert C. Byrd with us during this floor debate to instruct all of us on these historic matters. Senator Byrd did not disappoint. Indeed, his challenge to the proponents to explicate their proposal and their failure to do so provided the fulcrum on which this debate has turned.  I want to commend those Members who had the courage to look behind the title of the proposal and help us focus on its dangers and vagaries. In particular, I thank all those who came forward with such thoughtful amendments. Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, Feingold, Durbin, and Torricelli from the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Boxer, Wellstone, Reid, Bumpers, and Dorgan each offered amendments that raised important issues and added greatly to the debate.  I want to thank Senators Lautenberg, Sarbanes, Conrad, and Glenn for their contributions and their full participation in this historic debate.  I commend those cosponsors of the resolution who nonetheless offeredamendments, spoke in favor of various amendments, or voted not to table the amendments that were offered. I hope that they will continue to think about the problems that have been raised with the proposed constitutional amendment.  I want to thank the organizations that have provided invaluable information and insights into this debate. In particular, I would like to thank Charles Loveless and Edwin S. Jayne, of the legislation department at AFSCME, who spearheaded the Coalition on Budget Integrity, and Robert Greenstein and Ellen Nissenbaum, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who spearheaded the Center's research on this proposed constitutional amendment. I also thank Eugene Lehrmann for his important testimony on behalf of the American Association for Retired Persons. I commend the 150 organizations that made up the Coalition on Budget Priorities for the hard work of each of their representatives and all of their volunteers.  I also commend Professors Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, Robert M. Solow of MIT, and James Tobin of Yale University and the 1,060 economists from around the country who came forward with a joint statement to condemn the proposed constitutional amendment.  Finally, I thank the Senate staff for its dedication and professionalism during the debate on this proposed constitutional amendment: Larry Sein and Jonathan Adelstein from Senator Daschle's staff; James English and Peter Kiefhaber from Senator Byrd's staff; Caroline Chambers and Jeremy Bates from Senator Dorgan's staff; Michael Myers and Melody Barnes from Senator Kennedy's staff; Kevin Cronin from Senator Feinstein's staff; Sumner Slichter and Michael O'Leary from Senator Feingold's staff; Tom Faletti from Senator Durbin's staff; Eric Shuffler from Senator Torricelli's staff; Jim Ryan from Senator Reid's staff; Bill Dauster and Jodi Grant from Senator Lautenberg's staff; and Julie Kehrli and Carlos Angulo from Senator Sarbanes' staff. From Senator Hatch's staff, I would like to thank Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, Shawn Bentley, Paul Larkin, Larry Block, Steve Tepp, and Troy Dow. I was assisted, in particular, by Ed Pagano and Michael Carrasco.  As in so much that I do, my counsel Bruce Cohen was indispensable.  This effort would not have been successful, however, without the attention and efforts of hundreds and thousands of concerned Americans who want to balance the budget while preserving the Constitution and the guarantees that it provides. Their calls and letters made the difference. This is their victory.                          ____________________
