The question is whether we are going to hold the Department of Defense accountable. I ask the Senator from California this question: The sense-of-the-Senate resolution which she offers not only raises a question of whether this is evidence of profiteering, evidence of a sweetheart arrangement, evidence of the kind of sole-source agreement that frankly is not in the best interest of either American taxpayers or America's national defense, is she specific in the accountability she is holding the Department of Defense to in terms of when they will report as opposed to as soon as practicable?
