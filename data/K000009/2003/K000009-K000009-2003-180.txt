Speaker, I submit the following article to be included in the Record:                [From The New York Times, Jan. 30, 2003]                            Bait and Switch                            (By Bob Herbert)       President Bush has learned how to deliver a moving speech.      But Tuesday night's State of the Union Message did not      address the most important question facing the American      people: What kind of nation are we becoming?       The president spoke passionately about bringing ``food and      medicines and supplies and freedom'' to the Iraqi people. But      he is leading a hard-right administration here at home that      is seriously eroding the economic security, the access to      health care, the civil rights and civil liberties and the      environmental protections of the American people. The first      part of the president's speech was crafted to create exactly      the opposite impression. He promised an economy ``that grows      fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.''      He proposed a prescription drug benefit for some retirees.      And he said he was ready to commit $1.2 billion to research      into environmentally friendly hydrogen-powered automobiles.       But those were largely bait-and-switch proposals. Despite      rising unemployment, the president's plan for the economy was      simply a continuation of his tax-cut mania. There was nothing      in the way of a job-creation program or a real economic      stimulus. And there was absolutely zero help offered to the      states and local governments whose budgetary knees are      buckling under the weight of their worst fiscal crisis since      World War II.       The president's prescription drug benefit, tempting at      first glance, is tied to a restructuring of Medicare that      will curtail, not enhance, the delivery of health services to      the elderly. It was designed to look like an act of      compassion. It's not.       The hydrogen cars initiative was a particularly deft touch      for a president who has been hammered for his environmental      policies. Hydrogen-powered autos could make a difference in      the long term, say 20 or 30 years from now, or more. But what      is much more significant is that Mr. Bush has stood like a      rock with the opponents of increased fuel efficiency for the      cars we're driving right now. The payoff for immediately      improving vehicle fuel economy would be huge. In addition to      saving money for motorists, it would cut pollution, curtail      our contribution to the greenhouse effect and reduce our      dependence on foreign oil.       We heard nothing about that in the speech.       The Bush administration is changing the nation in      fundamental ways. However one feels about a U.S.-led invasion      of Iraq, over the long term a bullying, go-it-alone foreign      policy wedded to a military doctrine of preemption is a      recipe for destabilization and paranoia around the world. And      despite its professed commitment to compassionate policies at      home, the administration's obsession with tax cuts is proving      destructive on two fronts: It is draining the nation's      coffers of money for social programs (including Medicare and      Social Security), and blocking any real attempt to invest in      a range of programs and infrastructure initiatives that are      crucial to the nation's long-term future.       Some of those programs relate directly to domestic      security. These issues get short shrift in an atmosphere of      imminent war. But I doubt that this is the kind of country      most Americans want. And we are already beginning to pay the      price. Local taxes are soaring and services are breaking      down.       On the night of the president's speech, the governor of New      Jersey, James McGreevey, announced that he would be cutting      state aid to colleges and universities by 10 percent because      of a $5 billion state budget gap, In Connecticut, nearly      3,000 state workers have been laid off and Gov. John Rowland      said another 1,000 needed to go. In some states the public      school week is being curtailed. In some, prisoners are being      furloughed.       These are telling indications of the real state of the      union. As the most powerful nation on earth, and the world's      only superpower, the United States has a particular      obligation to use its might wisely abroad and to distribute      its benefits fairly at home. That is not an easy mission for      a hard-right-wing administration, which is why the Bush      administration puts such a premium on the rhetoric of      compassion.       Behind the veil of rhetoric is a Darwinian political      philosophy that, if clearly understood, would repel the      majority of Americans. http://www.nytimes.com.                          ____________________
