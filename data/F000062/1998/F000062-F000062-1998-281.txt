 President, there are also brand new letters that I did not enter into the Record my last time on the floor speaking about this issue. They are from the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, from the professor and chairman of the Department of Developmental Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine, the American Society for Cell Biology, which interestingly enough is signed by more Nobel laureates than I have ever seen signing one letter. And this is truly amazing. There are 27 Nobel laureates on this letter.  What they say, in summing up, is:       If legislation is deemed to be necessary, we respectfully      urge you to be sure that it be limited to the cloning of      human beings and not include language that impedes critical,      ongoing, and potential new research.  And I have letters from the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society for Human Genetics, the National Association for Biomedical Research, a telegram from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,                                  Bethesda, MD, February 10, 1998.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bond: We are writing to express a number of      concerns regarding your bill, S. 1601, the Human Cloning      Prohibition Act, which would prohibit the use of ``Somatic      cell nuclear transfer technology for purposes of human      cloning.'' Our main concern is that harm not be done to      biomedical research through your well-intentioned effort to      prevent disreputable individuals or companies from attempting      to clone a human being. We recognize it is not your intent to      harm biomedical research. However, we respectfully point out      that this would be the likely result if the bill were to      become law in its current form.       Our first concern is that few of the scientific terms used      in the bill are defined. The bill defines the broad term      ``human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology,'' but the      definition is flawed in several ways. The use of the word      ``technology'', for example, implies that it is the physical      tools needed to carry out human somatic cell nuclear transfer      that are banned, not the process itself. The technology      needed to carry out such a nuclear transfer is readily      available in any modern biological laboratory dealing with      reproductive biology; surely it is not your intention to ban      these tools.       The definition also includes as banned the production of      ``an embryo (including a preimplantation embryo)''. This      inclusion would clearly interfere with work needed to develop      a variety of therapies described below for burn victims,      diabetes sufferers, and others suffering from more rate      genetic diseases.       The bill also does not define the term ``oocyte,'' which      many members of the Senate may not understand. It would be      useful to define term so these senators know what is being      discussed. The same could be said for the terms ``nuclear'',      ``nuclear transfer,'' ``cell,'' ``somatic cell,'' and      ``cloning.'' The point of this discussion of definitions is      that this whole area of biology is extremely complex, and the      process itself is only now beginning to be understood by      people who have devoted years of study to the subject. It is      thus premature to attempt to define in legislation a process      that is still evolving.       Second, we are concerned by the bill's permanent      prohibition of human somatic cell nuclear transfer. While no      responsible member of the life sciences community is in favor      of cloning humans at this time, there may come a time, after      further research and study, when it will be viewed as less      egregious. For example, infertile couples might appreciate      the availability of human somatic cell nuclear transfer, as      it might someday enable them to experience the joys and      rewards of parenthood.       Third, cloning is a widely used technique in modern biology      to produce large numbers of cells and other biological      materials scientist need to carry out modern biomedical      research. The National Institutes of Health has produced a      paper called ``Cloning: Present Uses and Promises'', which      discusses all of these issues in clear and useful detail.       This paper explains that human somatic cell nuclear      transfer can have profound benefits for human health if      research is allowed to proceed using the technique. For      example, a burn victim often needs skin grafts. Current      grafting techniques require taking undamaged skin from the      victim and grafting it onto the patient's burned areas. Skin      from other humans cannot be used because it would be rejected      by the victim's immune system. However, if adult cells can be      taken from the victim, treated in such a way as to return      them to an embryonic state and then made to grow into skin      cells, virtually unlimited quantities of the victim's own      skin could be grown and used as grafts. This skin would not      be rejected since it would be genetically identical to the      victims' original skin.       The NIH paper also discusses the potential use of somatic      cell nuclear transfer in attacking diabetes, and other, more      rare genetic diseases. Of course, these therapies are not      available now--but they might be in the future, if biomedical      research on the uses and limits of somatic cell nuclear      transfer is not permanently banned, as it would be under the      provisions of your bill.       Even though your bill notes that ``Nothing in this Act . .      . shall be construed to restrict areas of scientific research      that are not specifically prohibited . . .'' section 2      declares that ``. . . it is right and proper to prohibit the      creation of cloned human embryos that would never have the      opportunity for implantation and that would therefore be      created solely for research that would ultimately lead to      their destruction.'' This language, plus the way your      definition of ``human somatic cell nuclear transfer      technology'' is phrased, makes it impossible for research to      continue on these therapies using somatic cell nuclear      transfer. We respectfully note that we cannot support such a      broad prohibition.       A fourth matter to consider is that history is replete with      examples of bad law that were primarily the products of undue      haste. In our view, human cloning is not going to occur soon      enough to justify taking this bill directly to the floor of      the Senate without hearings at the subcommittee and committee      level. Such hearings would develop the points we raise above      as well as many more, and explore the consequences (both      positive and negative) of the bill's provisions. There is no      need at this point to short-circuit the normal hearing      process, which serves our country and the Congress very well.       Finally, all of the above notwithstanding, it is not      absolutely clear that the now famous sheep Dolly was cloned      using an adult cell and not a fetal cell in the first pace.      One prominent researcher, Dr. Norton Zinder, of Rockefeller      University, believes that it has not been proven that Dolly      was created using the nucleus of a somatic cell. In a recent      letter to Science, he notes that so far, Dolly has not been      replicated, and that it took 400 tries to create her in the      first place. One success in 400 ``Is an anecdote, not a      result,'' he writes. Thus, since it has not been definitely      proven that an adult cell was used to clone Dolly, it is      possible that Dr. Wilmut's announcement approximately a year      ago was mistaken, and that a fetal cell was used by accident      (the sheep from which the cell was taken was pregnant at the      time, and fetal cells circulate throughout the body in such      situations).       Thus, it may be that there is no danger of somatic cell      nuclear transfer being used to clone a human being because it      cannot be done! We simply don't know at this point. It would      therefore be unfortunate if this technique, which has promise      in so many other biological applications, was placed ``off      limits'' to researchers before its promise and pitfalls were      thoroughly explored. This is yet another reason why haste is      not desirable.       Let me make it clear that the ASBMB does not support human      cloning. This is why the ASBMB Public Affairs Advisory      Committee supports the National Bioethics Advisory      Commission's call for a 5-year moratorium. The committee      adopted the following resolution in September 1997:       ``The ASBMB Public Affairs Advisory Committee supports the      declaration of a voluntary five-year moratorium on cloning      human beings, where `cloning human beings' is defined as the      duplication of an existing or previously existing human being      by transferring the nucleus of a differentiated, somatic cell      into an enucleated human oocyte, and implanting the resulting      product for intrauterine gestation and subsequent birth.''       Numerous life sciences organizations, such as the Society      for Developmental Biology, the Federation of American      Societies for Experimental Biology, the American Society for      Cell Biology, and the Association of American Medical      Colleges, have indicated their support for a voluntary      moratorium on human cloning. We are confident that such a      moratorium will be effective in preventing the act you fear      from occurring. It would also allow the issue to be revisited      later, after further research and deliberation.       We hope you will take all these thoughts into consideration      before moving ahead with a bill that is well-intentioned but      which could also do serious harm to biomedical research      unless it is modified. We would be pleased to provide you      with further information on these issues in the days and      weeks ahead.       For your information, the American Society for Biochemistry      and Molecular Biology,     founded in 1906, is a scientific and educational organization      with a membership of 10,200 life scientists who teach or      conduct research at most of our country's colleges and      universities, nonprofit research institutions, in industry,      and for the federal government. We publish the Journal of      Biological Chemistry, one of our nation's premiere peer-     reviewed journals in the life sciences. Our headquarters are      on the campus of the Federation of American Societies for      Experimental Biology, in Bethesda, Maryland.           Sincerely,                                                 I. Robert Lehman,     President.                                  ____                                               Beckman Center,                                   Stanford, CA, February 4, 1998.     Hon. Connie Mack,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Mack: The Congress is moving rapidly, indeed      precipitously, to legislate a ban on attempts to produce a      human being by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)      technology. The bill sponsored by Senators Bond, Frist, Gregg      and others, if passed, would be the first to ban a specific      line of research. I believe this is a serious mistake, one      that we could regret because of its unintended implications      for otherwise valuable biomedical research.       Extending the President's moratorium to the private sector      would provide an interim solution to preventing any and all      attempts to produce a human being by SCNT until a      congressional commission determined whether and what kind of      legislation would be appropriation.       I call to your attention a position statement supported by      many scientific societies which recommends a course of action      you should consider.       At the request of the National Bioethics Advisory      Commission, the American Society for Cell Biology recommended      in the Spring of 1997 a voluntary international moratorium on      human nuclear transfer for the purpose of creating a new      human being. This would allow scientists and the public the      opportunity to determine the safety and appropriateness of      such experimentation.       The ASCB continues to support such a moratorium as a      constructive interim response to the concerns raised by the      cloning of an adult sheep. However, recent events in the U.S.      have escalated and infused new urgency into this debate,      resulting in increased demands for regulatory legislation.       The ASCB urges that if legislation is needed, it should      specifically be concerned with the reproduction of a human      being by nuclear transfer. At the same time, any legislation      should not impede or interfere with existing and potential      critical research fundamental to the prevention or cure of      human disease. This research often includes the cloning of      human and animal cell lines and DNA, but not whole human      beings.       The National Biomedical Advisory Commission did recommend a      three to five year moratorium on human nuclear transfer for      the purpose of creating a new human being in order to allow      time to evaluate the safety of and public views about such      procedures. The ASCB urges that the Commission's      recommendation be the basis for any federal legislation.           Very sincerely yours,                                                        Paul Berg,     Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1980.                                  ____                                          The American Society for                                                 Cell Biology,                                   Bethesda, MD, February 9, 1998.     To the President of the United States and Members of the          United States Congress:       There is a broad consensus supporting the President's      National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission's proposal to      ban the creation of a human being by somatic nuclear      transplants. The Commission urged that such a ban should not      deliberately or inadvertently interfere with biomedical      research that is critical to the understanding and eventual      prevention of human disease. To that end, we the undersigned      endorse the statement on cloning from the American Society      for Cell Biology. If legislation is deemed to be necessary,      we respectfully urge you to ensure that it be limited to the      cloning of human beings, and does not include language that      impedes critical ongoing and potential new research.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Senators Kit Bond (R-TN) and Bill      Frist (R-TN) have introduced S. 1601, ``to prohibit the use      of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for purposes of      human cloning.'' While the majority of the scientific      community and the public supports a ban on human cloning, the     bill's language would effect other important areas of medical      and scientific research.       As President of The American Society of Human Genetics      representing over 6,000 researchers in the field human      genetics, I want to go on record as opposing this bill.       Congress must make sure that any bill would not restrict or      inhibit stem cell research which is being used to create a      whole new type of therapy--cell therapy. Congress must also      make sure that research is not restricted into the pathology      of disease, gene therapy research, research into the ways      genes operate in the cell and other basic biomedical research      which gives hope that we can find and develop cures and      therapies for deadly and disabling diseases.       Thank you for allowing us to go on record as opposing S.      1601.           Sincerely yours,                                               Arthur Beaudet, MD,     President, ASHG.                                  ____                                          National Association for                                          Biomedical Research,                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The NABR membership respectfully      requests that you vote ``no'' next Tuesday, February 10, when      a motion to invoke cloture and proceed to consider S. 1601, a      bill to ban human cloning, is scheduled to come before the      Senate. There is virtually unanimous agreement that human      beings should not be cloned. However, as currently drafted S.      1601 threatens to restrict research efforts far beyond those      which could involve cloning human beings. The proposal is      going to the floor without the customary committee      consideration and recommendation. The result is a well-     intentioned, but ill-defined, measure that will destroy      promising new research avenues that might provide long-     awaited solutions to untold human suffering. Your ``no'' vote      is needed to protect responsible biomedical research and      allow this legislation to receive the full deliberation it      deserves.       We all fear a disastrous outcome of new cloning      technologies; however, S. 1601 is not focused on outcomes.      Rather, for the first time, the government would ban a      specific research technique and process. To prevent a real or      imagined future calamity, approval of this bill would mean      the public must also forego all the beneficial fruits of      ``somatic cell nuclear transfer,'' including the possible      cloning of cells or tissue to cure and treat cancer,      diabetes, Alzheimer's and many other illnesses. (Please see      enclosed Time article for further discussion.) For this      reason, Congress certainly should take the time to carefully      consider S. 1601 and other proposals dealing with human      cloning. Surely, the people whose healthy futures depend on      more and better research must have the opportunity to      understand and participate in the decisions Congress is      facing. The current rush to pass imprecise, misunderstood      legislation to ban human cloning is much more dangerous to      the pubic than the remote chance a mad scientist might      actually attempt it in the near future.       Until the moral, ethical and medical questions surrounding      the possibility are fully explored and satisfactorily      answered, no one should try to duplicate a human being by      cloning. The nation's leading scientific, medical,      pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations agree and have      already subscribed to a voluntary moratorium to this effect.      In addition, the Food and Drug Administration has announced      it will exercise regulatory authority over human cloning      should any irresponsible individual try to ignore the      mainstream scientific community. Therefore, it is not      necessary to act hastily in the absence of all the facts.       Should you or your staff require additional information,      please contact NABR. Thank you for your consideration of this      urgent matter.           Sincerely,                                                 Frankie L. Trull,     President.                                  ____                                  Federation of American Societies                                     for Experimental Biology,                                   Bethesda, MD, February 3, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       The Federation of American Societies for Experimental      Biology (FASEB) urges the Senate to proceed extremely      cautiously as it considers legislation regarding human      cloning. While the Federation considers the cloning of human      being to be reprehensible, dangerous, and unethical, we are      concerned that overly restrictive legislation could      unintentionally preclude critical research of great benefit      to the American people. We believe that S. 1599, currently      pending consideration by the Senate, would be damaging to      worthwhile research. By flatly banning all use of human      somatic cell nuclear technology for any purpose, this      legislation would close off key areas of research which do      not involve the creation of humans. We urge that the Senate      not approve this legislation in its current form as it does      not balance appropriate ethical considerations with the      health needs of the American people.                                        Ralph G. Yount, Ph.D.,                                                        President.
