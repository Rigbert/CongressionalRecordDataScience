President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that would ensure geriatric education for our current workforce while it would optimize resources to bolster academic careers in geriatrics and help to attract the best and the brightest into this field. Together, these programs would develop exactly the kind of highly qualified workforce that we need to care for Americans as our Nation grows older.  I thank the Presiding Officer.                                 ______                                       By
