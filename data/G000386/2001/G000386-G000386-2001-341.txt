 President, I urge the defeat of this amendment. We have hundreds of thousands of American taxpayers who deserve immediate tax relief and they are being cast aside if this amendment is adopted.  For instance, the unified credit would only be $2 million in the year 2010, whereas our bipartisan RELIEF Act raises the unified credit to $4 million per person.  Remember, that is $8 million per family, no strings attached. You don't need to have a family farm or a family business. The RELIEF Act makes it simple. There is no long-term lien. It is simple. The death tax stays at 60 percent under this amendment. There is no repeal, no help at all. I urge the defeat of this amendment. Also, the marginal rate tax cuts are scaled back.  Finally, even though the Senator talks about infrastructure, this amendment spends not one penny on infrastructure.
