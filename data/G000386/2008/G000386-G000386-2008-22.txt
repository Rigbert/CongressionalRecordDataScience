 Among other questions, the poll asks whether folks thought of themselves as upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. In other words, basically dividing the country into different quintiles.  According to the poll, 53 percent of Americans considered themselves middle class, 19 percent consider themselves upper middle class, and 19 percent consider themselves lower middle class. So you have this outstandingly high percentage of 92 percent of Americans who consider themselves something other than upper class or lower class.  Since we are examining Senator McCain's and Senator Obama's tax plans, it is fair to ask about their definition of middle class.  On August 16 of this year, Senator McCain appeared on Pastor Rick Warren's forum at Saddleback Church in Albuquerque, NM. Pastor Warren asked Senator McCain to draw a line, in tax relief dollar terms, between the middle class and the rich. Senator McCain's answer reflects the ambiguity of the factcheck.org definition. I quote Senator McCain:       I think the rich should be defined by a home, a good job,      an education and the ability to hand our children a more      prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited.       So if you're just talking about income--  Then on television there was kind of a laugh and smile at that point--     how about $5 million? No, but seriously, I don't think you      can. I don't think seriously that the point is I'm trying to      make, seriously, and I'm sure that comment will be distorted      but the point is . . . that we want to keep people's taxes      low, and increase revenues. . . . So it doesn't really matter      what my definition of rich is because I don't want to raise      anyone's taxes. I really don't.  How does Senator Obama define the middle class? In an interview with Fox News of Bill Hemmer, Senator Obama answered the question this way:       You know, what I would say is, if you are making more than      $250,000, then you're more than middle class. You're doing      better. If you are making less than $250,000, then you are      definitely somewhere in the middle class. And if you're      making $150,000 or less, then I would think most Americans      would agree you're middle class. So that's why the fact that      you are making less than $250,000, you will not see your      taxes go up under an Obama administration. And you will see      tax cuts with more money in your pocket, if you are making      less than $150,000.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Bill Hemmer interview.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Obama Defines ``Middle Class''                           (By Major Garrett)       Washington.--I wanted to throw out for consideration and      debate a question I've found myself asking Democrats,      Republicans, Independents and economists for years: who is in      the middle class?       In the 1990s, the answers I received were almost entirely      linked to income figures--the income of a family of four, or      three or of a single person in his or her twenties, or an      elderly person on a fixed income determined how close or how      far they were from ``middle class'' status.       About the time of millennium, I began to notice that the      answer to who was ``middle class'' began to change from      relatively precise figures to very broad income strata. It      was as if politicians--particularly at the national level--     began to believe that incomes varied as widely as the core      cost of living. Therefore, an income designation, for      example, linked to the U.S. Census Bureau definition of      median or mean income for an individual or family, would no      longer work as a means of defining with precision who was or      was not middle class.       In other words, individuals or families in New York, Los      Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston or other high-cost      urban areas could earn three times the median or mean family      income and still feel strapped by month-to-month costs.       In other words, middle class status seemed over time to be      less rooted in specific income figures, but regional      differences in income and cost-of-living. It also seemed to      reflect a sense among politicians and some economists that      ``middle class'' is not just a matter of figures, but also a      state of mind.       At my suggestion, my colleague Bill Hemmer was kind of      enough to ask Sen. Barack Obama in London how he defined the      middle class.       Here is the transcript of that exchange:       HEMMER: You mentioned the economy. You travel back to the      U.S. this weekend. You're going back to a country with a      limping economy, ``ailing,'' I think, is one of the words The      Economist used at the end of last week.       You have suggested that taxes will be raised on some      Americans. You have also suggested that taxes will be lowered      for some Americans. In a limping or an ailing economy, why      raise taxes on anyone?       OBAMA: Well, the--because we also have a $400 billion or so      budget deficit, because we've also got to invest in      infrastructure. We've got to deal with the fact that a lot      more people are unemployed and are going to need unemployment      benefits. We've got to shore up the housing market because      people are experiencing foreclosures.       And that's why I've structured a change in the tax code      where if you are making $150,000 a year or less, you're      getting a tax cut, 95 percent of the American families will      get a tax cut.       HEMMER: What do you consider . . .       OBAMA: And the people who are going to see their income      taxes raised, go up, are making more than $250,000 a year. So      you and I will pay a little bit more in taxes because we can      afford it. And what that allows us to do is to help the vast      majority of Americans who are really hurting in this economy.       HEMMER: I know we're pushed for time. Can you give me a      definition of the middle class based on income, within a      range?       OBAMA: You know, what I would say is, if you are making      more than $250,000, then you're more than middle class.      You're doing better. If you are making less than $250,000,      then you are definitely somewhere in the middle class.       And if you're making $150,000 or less, then I think most      Americans would agree that you're middle class. So that's why      the fact that if you are making less than $250,000, you will      not see your taxes go up under an Obama administration. And      you will get tax cuts and more money in your pocket if you      make less $150,000.       I think that's the right way to promote the kind of bottom-     up economic growth that's going to make a difference in      people's lives.       Here is how the government tabulates two different types of      mid-point incomes in America. The Census Bureau calculates      median income (the precise mid-point between all tabulated      incomes) and the mean income (the average of all the      tabulated incomes) of families and individuals. The figures      below are for families and individuals for 2006.       Income of family households in U.S. in 2006 (most recent      year available)Median: $59,894 Mean: $77,315       (Source: Census Bureau: Income, Poverty, and Health      Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006, http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf and Current      Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (ASEC)      Supplement, http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032007/faminc/new07_000.htm)       Income of all households in U.S. in 2006 (most recent year      available)Median: $48,201 Mean: $66,570       (Source: Census Bureau: Income, Poverty, and Health      Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006, http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf and Current      Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (ASEC)      Supplement, http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032007/hhinc/new06_000.htm)       So, the question I set before those of you who wish to      discuss and debate are these: what is the middle class; are      you in the middle class; have you always been there and do      you ever imagine you live better than ``middle class''; and      to what extent does your conception of ``middle class''      affect your view on how high taxes should be which income      category.       Let the discussion and debate begin.
