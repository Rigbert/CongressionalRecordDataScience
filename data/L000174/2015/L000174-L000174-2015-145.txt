 In June 2013, Americans learned for the first time that section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has for years been secretly interpreted to authorize the collection of Americans' phone records on an unprecedented scale. And they learned that the NSA has engaged in repeated, substantial legal violations in its implementation of section 215 and other surveillance authorities.  Since that time, Congress and the American public have been engaged in an important debate about the breadth of government surveillance powers and the legal rationale used to authorize the collection of Americans' data. Under my chairmanship last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee held six open and public hearings that sharpened the committee's thinking and furthered the public dialogue on these important issues. Senator Lee, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, Congressman John Conyers, and I introduced bicameral, bipartisan legislation, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2013, S. 1599/H.R. 3361, on October 29, 2013, to end bulk collection and reform our surveillance laws. The President announced his support for ending the bulk collection of Americans' phone records in March 2014. The House of Representatives passed a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act in May 2014, and after lengthy discussions with the executive branch, the technology industry, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders, Senator Lee and I introduced the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, S. 2685, on July 29, 2014. On November 18, 2014, the full Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, by a vote of 58 to 42.  Despite falling two votes shy last Congress, Senator Lee and I knew that the May 31, 2015, expiration date was approaching, and we continued to work on a bill to reform these authorities. Senator Lee, can you explain the process we have undertaken this year?
