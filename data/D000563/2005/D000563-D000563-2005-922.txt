. Army and its soldiers who are risking their lives in Iraq, ran a headline story that the Senate pushed off the Department of Defense authorization bill, which included amendments which were being offered to provide additional financial assistance to the widows and orphans of those soldiers who lost their lives in combat, took away the bill which included an amendment to allow additional payment for totally disabled veterans, and instead moved on the floor this bill for one special interest group, the gun lobby.  The Senator has made it clear the Republican leadership considers this bill, a National Rifle Association sponsored bill, more important than the Department of Defense authorization bill.  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts if he could tell me if he knows of any other industry, any business in America which enjoys the same kind of immunity from liability for their wrongdoing--any other business with immunity from liability that the gun industry and gun dealers are asking for in this legislation.
