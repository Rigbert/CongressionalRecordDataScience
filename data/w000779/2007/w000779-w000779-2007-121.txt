Bingaman, and the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for their leadership in crafting the America COMPETES Act and managing it on the Senate floor. I would also like to thank Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy for their roles in developing and moving this bill. It is a critical piece of legislation that will help ensure our great Nation remains competitive in the global economy.  I would also like to thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon, Mr. Smith, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mr.Pryor, for working with me to draft language to enable high schools and colleges to purchase nanotechnology equipment through grants from the National Science Foundation. And I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, for working with us to add some of that language to his important amendment to this fine bill.  Nanotechnology involves the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers--as small as a single molecule. At that scale, unique phenomena enable novel applications. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving the way many things are designed and made. It will continue to be at the heart of innovation in a wide range of sectors for decades to come.  With the inclusion of the language that we proposed, partnerships between low income school districts, colleges and universities, and businesses will be able to secure funds to purchase classroom versions of scanning electron microscopes and other tools that are fundamental to the study of nanotechnology.
