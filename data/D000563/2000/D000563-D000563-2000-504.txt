President, the annual March 25th celebration of Greek Independence Day commemorates the independence of Greece from 400 years of oppression under the Ottoman Empire. Greeks have made great contributions to the world in literature, philosophy, mathematics and government. The names of Homer, Socrates, Euclid and Alexander echo through the pages of world history. It was the Greek people who started the Olympic Games saying there was more honor in peaceful competition than in wars of conquest. The greatest gift Greek people have given the world, though, is a simple yet powerful idea that was born over 2,000 years ago. It is the idea that a nation's power lies in the hands of its people. The Athenian republic was the world's first democracy, a fact that all free nations must respect.  The bonds that join the United States and Greece are deep and long lasting. Our fore-fathers recognized the spirit and idealism of ancient Greece when drafting our Constitution. Forty-five years after our own revolution for independence, Greece freed itself with its own revolutionary struggle.  In every major international conflict of this century, Greece has been a proud ally of the United States. Honoring this day will pay special tribute to those Greek men and women who gave their lives for the common cause of freedom. Greek-Americans can especially take pride in their ancestors' sacrifice. The many Greek sons and daughters who have come to the United States have worked honorably in all areas of American life, including public service. Greek culture flourishes in American cities, adding to our country's rich diversity.  I hope Greece will resolve its differences with its Turkish neighbors over Cyprus. I hope all people in the region share in America's belief that this can be achieved through diplomacy instead of violence. Let us be mindful of the olive tree and the Olympic flame, the great symbols of Greece, and remember, too, that they are also symbols of peace.                          ____________________
