 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Congressman William Dickinson, who passed away on Monday, March 31, 2008. Bill was a skilled legislator and a personal friend, and along with the entire State of Alabama, I mourn his passing.  William Dickinson was born on June 5, 1925, in Opelika, AL. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and as a Major in the United States Air Force Reserves. In 1950, he obtained a law degree from the University of Alabama. He then practiced law for 2 years. In 1952, Bill began his career as an elected official, serving as a judge in city, juvenile, and circuit courts in Lee County. After his successful career as a judge, Bill was an executive for the Southern Railway. Bill also served on the Opelika Board of Education.  When Bill was elected to Congress in 1964, most of his constituents had never before been represented by a Republican. Nevertheless, Bill was elected to 14 consecutive terms in office and was a pivotal force in Alabama's change into a two-party State. While in office, Congressman Dickinson accomplished a great deal for his district, the State of Alabama, and our Nation.  He worked tirelessly for the 13 counties in his congressional district, particularly on military matters. As ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Bill was able to protect and strengthen the military bases in Alabama. He was a steamroller in military funding issues for the Air War College at Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, and Gunter Annex in Montgomery, AL, and also further south in Alabama at Fort Rucker, where Army helicopter pilots go through their training. His exemplary work in this area improved both the economy of our State and the security of our Nation.  Bill's work for the military also extended to the national level. He was very influential in the rearming of America during the Cold War, working to stop the spread of communism and providing the military with the programs and equipment they needed during the Vietnam war. Bill is credited both with the creation of the Aviation Department in the Department of the Army and for the Apache Attack Helicopter program. In fact, Bill was nicknamed the ``Father of Army Aviation'' due to his advocacy on behalf of those issues.  His work garnered the attention of the American Conservative Union, which presented him with the Statesman Award; the Army Aviation Association of America, which awarded him with its Congressional Appreciation Award; and the Association of the United States Army, which presented William with the Distinguished Service to Soldiers award, among others.  Bill is loved and will be missed by his wife Barbara, his four children and his five grandchildren. He was an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his service to our Nation. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of our colleague, Congressman William Dickinson.                          ____________________
