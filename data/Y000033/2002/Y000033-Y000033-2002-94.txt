Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the House the conference report on the 2002 supplemental appropriations bill. This is a war-time supplemental to add further to our efforts to respond to the terrorist attacks on September 11, to provide necessary funding to pursue the al Qaeda, to secure America, and to support further recovery from the vicious attack on September 11 of last year.  On May 24, almost 2 months ago, the House passed this version of this supplemental by a vote of 280 to 138. Two weeks later, the Senate passed its version of the bill. Over the past month and a half, we have worked diligently to address the differences in the House and Senate bills. The agreement being presented here to the House today is a fair bill that provides the funding that President Bush has requested as he leads our Nation against terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, this is a tremendously important bill, and I would again like to state that this is a wartime supplemental appropriations bill. It provides money for our troops, our intelligence community, our safety and security, the victims of New York, and to promote U.S. foreign policy.  The bill totals $28.9 billion in discretionary spending; $15 billion of that is for the Defense Department, including additional funds for the call-up of the Guard and Reserves as they were called to active duty to respond to September 11; $6.7 billion is for homeland security requirements; $2.1 billion is for foreign assistance and embassy security programs; and $5.5 billion is to further support recovery in New York.  The bill also includes $1 billion in funds to avert the estimated shortfalls in the Pell Grant student aid program. It includes $417 million for veterans' medical care, $205 million for Amtrak, $400 million for programs and activities to improve general election administration in our country, and $100 million to begin to address the need to respond to floods and the tremendous fires that our Nation has experienced and is still experiencing.  The committee has identified $3 billion in offsets to help pay for much of the new spending contained in the bill. These offsets are real, they are actual offsets; they are not smoke and mirrors.  It is a good bill, and I hope we can get it to the President's desk as soon as possible so that our soldiers, our diplomats, our law enforcement, and our intelligence officers can have the resources they need to protect our country from future attacks. At this point in the Record I will insert a table identifying the details of the conference report.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.001[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.002[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.003[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.004[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.005[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.006[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.007[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.008[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.009[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.010[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.011[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.012[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.013[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.014[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.015[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.016[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH2302.017
