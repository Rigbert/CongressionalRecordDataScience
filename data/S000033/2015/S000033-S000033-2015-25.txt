 President, as someone who travels around this country, I am always amazed by the huge disconnect that exists between what we do here in Congress and what the American people want us to do. The simple truth, as poll after poll has shown, is that Congress is way out of touch as to where the American people are. Let me give a few examples before I get to the thrust of my remarks.  Many of my Republican colleagues are still talking about cutting Social Security--a disastrous idea--but according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, by a 3-to-1 margin the American people want us to expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. How out of touch can one be?  About 2 weeks ago, the same poll told us that while there is virtually no Republican in the Senate who is prepared to support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, what the American people want by a pretty solid majorityis not to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour but to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour--something that is occurring now in Los Angeles, Seattle, and other places around the country.  Tragically, this Congress is way out of touch with the American people on issue after issue, and it is high time we started to get our act together and to respond to the needs--the pressing needs--of the American people.  Between 1985 and 2013, there was a huge redistribution of wealth in America. I know my Republican colleagues get very nervous when people talk about wealth distribution. Well, guess what, over the last 30 years we have had a huge degree of distribution of wealth in America. Unfortunately, that redistribution went in the wrong direction. That redistribution, to the tune of trillions of dollars, went from the pockets of the middle-class and working families of our country into the hands of the top one-tenth of 1 percent. So if we want to understand economics in the last 30 years, the middle class shrank and one-tenth of 1 percent doubled the percentage of wealth they own.  Today the United States has more wealth and income inequality than any other major industrialized country on Earth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns 22 percent of all the wealth in this country, while the bottom 90 percent owns 22.8 percent. In other words, the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and the trend is toward more and more wealth and income inequality. That is the economic reality we are looking at now.  But let me talk for a moment about another reality which saddens me very much and which we cannot continue to ignore. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Yet we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major industrialized nation on Earth, with almost 20 percent of our kids living in poverty.  In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires in this country. Yet over 50 percent of the children in our public schools are so low-income that they are eligible for the free or reduced-price School Lunch Program.  As a result of the collapse of the American middle class over the last 40 years, men and women in this country are working longer and longer hours in order to cobble together enough income to sustain their families. Yet while over 85 percent of male workers are working more than 40 hours a week and over 66 percent of working women are working more than 40 hours a week, we have a dysfunctional childcare system which denies millions of working families the ability to secure high-quality and affordable childcare.  Last week I spoke to a woman who lives right here in Washington, DC, and she told me that to get her 1-year-old child into quality daycare here in the Nation's Capital, she and her husband are spending close to $30,000 a year for one child. DC childcare is probably more expensive than other parts of the country, but millions of parents are struggling with childcare bills of $15,000, $20,000 or $25,000 a year when their income is $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. If you have two young kids, I don't know how you manage.  The truth of the matter is that while working families are desperately trying to find quality childcare at an affordable cost, we are turning our backs on those families. The result is that millions of children in this country are not receiving the quality childcare or early education they need when the psychologists tell us that ages 0 to 4 are the most important years of a human being's life in terms of intellectual and emotional development.  What sense is it that we ignore the needs of millions of working families and their children? What sense is it to tell working moms and dads that they cannot get the quality and affordable childcare they need? What sense is it to send many children into kindergarten and first grade already far, far behind where they should be intellectually because they had inadequate childcare?  This is not what a great country is supposed to be about. When we talk about the future of America, we cannot be talking about turning our backs on the children of this country. That is why we should be doing in this country what nations all over the world have done, and that is to invest in our kids and move toward a universal pre-K education system for all of our children.  I am glad that the Elementary and Secondary Educating Act is on the floor right now for debate. I want to thank Senator Murray and Senator Alexander for their hard work on this important bill. In Vermont and around this country--and I have had town meetings on this issue in Vermont where hundreds of teachers, parents, and kids come out--they understand that No Child Left Behind has failed, and what we are doing now begins to address that failure and move us in a very different direction.  When we talk about the needs of young people--something we very rarely do--we should understand that it is not just that we have a dysfunctional childcare and pre-K system which must be significantly improved, it is not just that No Child Left Behind must be reformed, and it is not just that a college education is now unaffordable for millions of working-class and low-income families. All of those are terribly important issues that we must address. But I hope very much there is another issue that we will finally start to pay attention to. This country, this Senate, and the House of Representatives must come to grips with the fact that today in America we have a horrendous, horrendous level of youth unemployment in this country. This is an issue that gets virtually no discussion at all. This is an issue of crisis proportions that we are not addressing. For the future of this country, not to mention for the future lives of millions of our young people, we cannot continue to sweep the issue of youth unemployment under the rug.  Last month the Economic Policy Institute released a new study about the level of youth unemployment in this country. What they found should concern every Member of the Congress and, in fact, every person in our country. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed census data on unemployment among young people who are jobless--who have no jobs--those who are working part time when they want to work full time, and those who have given up looking for work altogether. This is what they found. From April 2014 to March 2015--a 1-year period--the average real unemployment rate for young, White high school graduates between the ages of 17 and 20 was 33.8 percent. The jobless rate for Hispanics in the same age group was 36.1 percent. Unbelievably, the average real unemployment rate for Black high school graduates and those who dropped out of high school was 51.3 percent.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the EPI's findings.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Working Economics Blog, Economic Policy Institute, June 8,                                  2015]     Young Black High School Grads Face Astonishing Underemployment                           (By Alyssa Davis)       Last week, I wrote about how high school graduates will      face significant economic challenges when they graduate this      spring. High school graduates almost always experience higher      levels of unemployment and lower wages than their      counterparts with a college degree, and their labor market      difficulties were particularly exacerbated by the Great      Recession. Despite officially ending in June 2009, the      recession left millions unemployed for prolonged spells, with      recent workforce entrants such as young high school grads      being particularly vulnerable.       Underemployment is one of the major problems that young      workers currently face. Approximately 19.5 percent of young      high school graduates (those ages 17-20) are unemployed and      about 37.0 percent are underemployed. For young college      graduates (those ages 21-24) the unemployment rate is 7.2      percent and the underemployment rate is 14.9 percent. Our      measure of underemployment is the U-6 measure from the BLS,      which includes not only unemployed workers but also those who      are part-time for economic reasons and those who are      marginally attached to the labor force.       When we look at the underemployment data by race, we often      see an even worse situation. As shown in the charts below,      23.0 percent of young black college graduates are currently      underemployed, compared with 22.4 percent of young Hispanic      college grads and 12.9 percent of white college grads. And as      elevated as these rates are, the picture is bleakest for      young high school graduates, who are majority of young      workers.       51.3 percent of young black high school graduates are      underemployed, compared     with 36.1 percent of young Hispanic high school grads and      33.8 percent of white high school grads. This means a      significant share of young high school graduates in all      racial groups either want a job or have a job that does not      provide the hours they need. A majority of young black high      school graduates wish they could work more but can't because      of weak job opportunities.       While there has been real progress in healing the damage      inflicted on the labor market by the Great Recession, these      underemployment rates among young high school graduates      remain quite elevated relative to pre-recession levels. In      order to correct these high rates, we need to prioritize low      rates of unemployment and boost aggregate demand for workers.      Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative John      Conyers introduced the Employ Young Americans Now Act to help      young Americans find pathways to employment. This bill is a      necessary first step to putting young high school graduates      back to work and to put our economy on the road to full      employment.
