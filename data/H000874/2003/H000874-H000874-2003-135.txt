 There is another bill, as we all know, that the authorization of which is expiring the end of this month, and that is the Transportation Efficiency Act 21. TEA-21, as we refer to it, is expiring. That has been in consideration. I know there is a lot of controversy about how much investment ought to be authorized in that bill. Can the gentleman tell us the status of that particular piece of legislation, which is so critical to the welfare of our country? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  It is my understanding that two bills were introduced today extending the funding for transportation infrastructure for the next 5 months in one bill and 6 months in another bill. We hope to have one of those bills to the floor by next week. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is working very hard to prepare that bill for floor consideration, and the gentleman is absolutely right. It is critical to keep highway funding flowing, particularly going into the winter season. We want to get as much construction finished in the northern States now before the winter completes, and there are a lot of contracts of construction out there right now.  So it is vitally important for us to extend the highway program while we are working on a more comprehensive 6-year highway bill.
