 NCIRE was founded in 1988 to administer research at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. It is the largest of over 90 nonprofit research institutes associated with the VA. It is also designated as a Department of Defense Center of Excellence in Neuroscience and Neuroimaging for its work benefiting our more recent veterans, including gulf war illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, neurotrauma and closed-head injury resulting from combat.
