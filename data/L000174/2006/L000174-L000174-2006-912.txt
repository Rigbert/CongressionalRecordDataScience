President, again I agree with what the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has said. This is a bipartisan bill. In fact, to emphasize it, he and I have sent a letter to all of our colleagues, signed jointly, asking them, if they have amendments which they plan to offer, to let us know.  It should be emphasized that not only did we have hours upon hours of hearings, but we had many open meetings in the office of the Senator from Pennsylvania, in my office, and the offices of others. We made sure that the stakeholders, all the stakeholders were able to come to those meetings. We also made sure that the office of every Senator--everybody who expressed any interest, Republican or Democrat--was invited to those meetings. They were wide open. In fact, almost all of the Senators on both sides of the aisle either attended those meetings or had staff attend those meetings.  At these meetings that we had, again, every single stakeholder was involved. It was open. It was bipartisan. That was made clear by the Senator from Pennsylvania from the beginning, that they would have to be open and bipartisan. He, as would be expected, kept his commitment all the way through.  I would highlight two things the Senator from Pennsylvania just said that were of concern to me. One, if we do not do it now, we lose the opportunity. I believe it will be decades before anybody would put together the kind of coalition that it has been possible to put together. The other thing he said was that it is not just some of the powerful financial stakes involved, but it is a powerful amount of suffering that is going on by the people who are suffering from asbestos poisoning in all the different forms. They are the ones who are held in limbo throughout all this time. We can bring some relief to them now; not the possibility of relief 10 years from now after a series of lawsuits go through, but now.  We have had members of the Supreme Court, ranging from the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--certainly two differing philosophies--who have called upon the Congress to bring about a legislative solution because our courts are unable to handle all the cases that might come up. Let's be clear about that. There are some who say we are litigating forever on this, but the fact is our courts are unable to handle it. It cries out for a legislative solution.  I urge people to come to this with an open mind, vote it up or down, vote the amendments up or down. I have heard some opponents quoted as being prepared to demagog this bipartisan bill. This bill did not just suddenly springout of nowhere; it was worked on in such a way that it is a bipartisan bill. And I might say there is pain in it for everybody. Everybody has had to give something in this. The Senator from Pennsylvania did not get everything he wanted. I did not get everything I wanted. The stakeholders who came to the table, virtually all of them openly and honestly, they gave up a lot on it. But the people who are suffering from asbestos poisoning in whatever form are the ones waiting for us to act.  The time is right to act. We can pass a bipartisan bill. I believe the other body would be glad to see such a bill. The President has stated publicly and he certainly stated privately to both Senator Specter and myself that he is behind taking action. Everybody cries out for some bipartisan action around here. This is one of those cases where Republicans and Democrats could come together, where the Congress and the White House could work together, and actually those who benefit will be the people suffering. We ought to get on with it.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2006.       Dear Colleague: The Patriot Act is due to expire on      February 3, 2006 after being extended from its prior      expiration date of December 31, 2005.       The Senate is faced with three options:       1. Invoke cloture on the Conference Report and pass the      Conference Report as the House of Representatives has already      done;       2. Extend the present Act for a period of time. The current      discussion with the House is to extend it for four years; or       3. Let the Act expire.       To my knowledge, no one wants to let the Act expire.       Technically, the House/Senate Conference has been      discharged with the filing of the Conference Report. While it      is always possible to take another course of action such as      changing the Conference Report if there is unanimous      agreement, the House has taken the emphatic position that      there will be no more concessions from the Conference Report      and the House is very firm in this position.       Everyone, including those who are urging further House      concessions, agrees that the Conference Report is much more      protective of civil rights than the current Patriot Act. I am      enclosing a side-by-side comparison. While I would have      preferred the Senate bill, we do have a Bicameral System and      the Conference Report was hammered out after extensive      negotiations with significant concessions by the House.      Senate proponents for further House concessions had, at one      point, stated their willingness to sign the Conference Report      if three conditions were met including a change in the sunset      date from seven to four years. Those conditions were met and      then there was insistence on further concessions.       I urge the Senate to invoke cloture and pass the Conference      Report as the best of the available alternatives.           Sincerely,     Arlen Specter.                                  ____                        Side-by-Side Comparison------------------------------------------------------------------------      Conference report (2006)          Current law (PATRIOT Act 2001)------------------------------------------------------------------------    Requests for Business Records (``Library Provision'') Section 215------------------------------------------------------------------------Application to the FISA Court for    No requirement of any factual an order under Section 215           showing. requires a statement of facts.Records can be obtained only if the  Records can be obtained if the FBI FISA Judge finds that the            merely ``specif[ies] that . . . statement of facts shows             they are sought for an authorized ``reasonable grounds to believe      investigation.'' that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation''.May not be used for threat           May be used for threat assessments. assessments.Encourages the FBI to demonstrate a  No analogous incentive for the FBI connection to terrorism or           to demonstrate a connection to espionage by providing a             terrorism or espionage. presumption of relevance if the records sought pertain to: (a) a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; (b) the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of the investigation; or (c) an individual in contact with, or known to, a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of the investigation.Requires the use of minimization     No requirement that minimization procedures that will limit ``the     procedures be used. retention, and prohibit the dissemination'' of information concerning U.S. persons.Explicit right of recipients of      No explicit right of recipients of Section 215 requests to consult      Section 215 requests to consult legal counsel.                       legal counsel.Explicit right of recipients of      No explicit right of recipients of Section 215 requests to challenge    Section 215 requests to challenge their legality in court.             their legality in court.Requirement that the FBI Director,   No special requirements for Deputy Directer, or Executive        sensitive documents such as Assistant Director personally        library records. approve requests for certain sensitive documents, including library records, medical records, educational records, and gun records.Limits the scope of Section 215      No specified limitation on the requests to materials that could     scope of Section 215 requests. be obtained via grand jury subpoena or a similar court order for the production of records.Adds the Senate Judiciary Committee  ``Fully inform[ed]'' reports given as a recipient of the ``fully        only to House and Senate inform[ed]'' reports.

Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Gonzales: I write to let you know      some of the subjects which I would like you to address in      your opening statement on the Judiciary Committee hearing      scheduled for February 6, 2006, on ``Wartime Executive Power      and the NSA's Surveillance Authority.''       (1) In interpreting whether Congress intended to amend the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the September      14, 2001 Resolution (Resolution), would it be relevant on the      issue of Congressional intent that the Administration did not      specifically ask for an expansion for Executive powers under      FISA? Was it because you thought you couldn't get such an      expansion as when you said: ``That was not something that we      could likely get?''       (2) If Congress had intended to amend FISA by the      Resolution, wouldn't Congress have specifically acted to as      Congress did in passing the Patriot Act giving the Executive      expanded powers and greater flexibility in using ``roving''      wiretaps?       (3) In interpreting statutory construction on whether      Congress intended to amend FISA by the Resolution, what is      the impact of the rule of statutory construction that repeals      or changes by implication are disfavored?       (4) In interpreting statutory construction on whether      Congress intended to amend FISA by the Resolution, what would      be the impact of the rule of statutory construction that      specific statutory language, like that in FISA, trumps or      takes precedence over more general pronouncements like those      of the Resolution?       (5) Why did the Executive not ask for the authority to      conduct electronic surveillance when Congress passed the      Patriot Act and was predisposed, to the maximum extent      likely, to grant the Executive additional powers which the      Executive thought necessary?       (6) Wasn't President Carter's signature on FISA in 1978,      together with his signing statement, an explicit renunciation      of any claim to inherent Executive authority under Article II      of the Constitution to conduct warrantless domestic      surveillance when the Act provided the exclusive procedures      for such surveillance?       (7) Why didn't the President seek a warrant from the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing in      advance the electronic surveillance in issue? (The FISA Court      has the experience and authority to issue such a warrant. The      FISA Court has a record establishing its reliability for non-     disclosure or leaking contrasted with concerns that      disclosures to many members of Congress involved a high risk      of disclosure or leaking. The FISA Court is a least as      reliable, if not more so, that the Executive Branch on      avoiding disclosure or leaks.)       (8) Why did the Executive Branch not seek after-the-fact      authorization from the FISA Court within the 72 hours as      provided by the Act? At a minimum, shouldn't the Executive      have sought authorization from the FISA Court for law      enforcement individuals to listen to a reduced number of      conversations which were selected out from a large number of      conversations from the mechanical surveillance?       (9) Was consideration given to the dichotomy between      conversations by mechanical surveillance from conservations      listened to by law enforcement personnel with the contention      that the former was non-invasive and only the latter was      invasive? Would this distinction have made it practical to      obtain Court approval before the conservations were subject      to human surveillance or after-the-fact approval within 72      hours.       (10) Would you consider seeking approval from the FISA      Court at this time for the ongoing surveillance program at      issue?       (11) How can the Executive justify disclosure to only the      so-called ``Gang of Eight'' instead of the full intelligence      committees when Title V of the National Security Act of 1947      provides:       Sec. 501. [50 U.S.C. 413] (a)(1) The President shall ensure      that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully      and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the      United States, including any significant anticipated      intelligence activity as required by this title. (Emphasis      added)       (2)(e) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority      to withhold information from the congressional intelligence      committees on the grounds that providing the information to      the congressional intelligence committees would constitute      the unauthorized disclosure of classified information or      information relating to intelligence sources and methods.      (Emphasis added)       (12) To the extent that it can be disclosed in a public      hearing (or to be provided in a closed executive session),      what are the facts upon which the Executive relies to assert      Article II wartime authority over Congress' Article I      authority to establish public policy on these issues      especially where legislation is approved by the President as      contrasted to being enacted over a Presidential veto as was      the case with the War Powers Act?       (13) What case law does the Executive rely upon in      asserting Article II powers to conduct the electronic      surveillance at issue?       (14) What academic or export opinions does the Executive      rely upon in asserting Article II powers to conduct the      electronic surveillance at issue?       (15) When foreign calls (whether between the caller and the      recipient both being on foreign soil or one of the callers or      recipients being on foreign soil and the other in the U.S.)      were routed through switches which were physically located on      U.S. soil, would that constitute a violation of law or      regulation restricting NSA from conducting surveillance      inside the United States, absent a claim of      unconstitutionality on encroaching on Executive powers under      Article II?       This letter will further confirm our staffs' discussions      that the Committee will require, at a minimum, the full day      on February 6th for your testimony.           Sincerely,                                                    Arlen Specter.
