Speaker, before I begin my remarks, let me insert for the Record the memo written on October 4, 2002 by the Honorable Kenneth Starr addressed to Mr. Bartlett of the Financial Services Roundtable, since the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) has repeatedly referred to it.                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2002.     Hon. Steve Bartlett,     President, the Financial Services Roundtable, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. Bartlett: This letter responds to your request for      my views with respect to Section 330 of the Conference Report      on H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer      Protection Act of 2002. In particular, you requested my view      concerning two aspects of Section 330: the effect it will      have on anti-abortion protests, be they lawful or unlawful;      and the effect it will have on other types of protests,      including the recent IMF/World Bank protests.       In my view, Section 330 will have very little practical      effect. Importantly, the provision does not penalize any      lawful behavior. To the contrary, it applies only if (i) a      person violates the law; (ii) a court then enters an award      against that person or the person settles the charges; (iii)      the person later files a bankruptcy other than a Chapter 13      bankruptcy; (iv) the person thereafter seeks to discharge a      debt based on fines, damage awards, or other penalties      assessed because of the unlawful protest activity; and (v)      the creditor continues to pursue the matter. Even then,      Section 330 overlaps almost entirely with Bankruptcy Code      Sec. 523(a), which already prohibits the discharge of fines      payable to the government and civil damages resulting from      intentional injury to others. As a result, Section 330 will      have at most minimal practical effect. What is more, the      Conference version of Section 330 contains rigorous intent      requirements that should prevent any innocent protesters from      being swept up in its provisions. Thus, even if Section 330      does have some limited practical effect, that effect should      be felt only by the intentional lawbreakers it expressly      targets.       In answer to your second question, Section 330 is written      in an evenhanded, neutral fashion. It applies not only to      abortion-related protests, but also to unlawful protests      targeted at the providers of any lawful goods or services. By      its express terms, Section 330 applies--with no exceptions--     to all those who unlawfully intimidate or interfere with a      person by physical obstruction or threat of force if those      actions were motivated by the person's obtaining or providing      of any lawful goods or services. Thus, it would apply, for      example, to the anti-IMF/World Bank protesters who apparently      threw rocks through the window of a bank and attempted to      impede delegates from entering or departing the World      Bank's headquarters. So too, it would apply to similar      protests by animal rights activists, environmentalists,      and unions.       It bears emphasis that the Conference compromise bill      represents a substantial improvement over the original Senate      bill. Under the Senate bill, debt related to an unproven      allegation of ``harassment,'' or an unintentional violation      of a court order, could have been nondischargeable. In      contrast, under the Conference compromise, there must have      been an actual and intentional ``violation'' of either the      federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 248 (``FACE''), or a court order. These significant      improvements over the now-replaced Senate version are some of      the reasons that Section 330 will not have significant      practical or legal effect in light of the state of existing      law.     Section 330 is primarily a restatement of existing law       Section 330 is primarily a restatement of existing law. The      Bankruptcy Code has long provided that any debt ``for a fine,      penalty, or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a      governmental unit'' is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. 11      U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(7). As a result, criminal fines and civil      penalties payable to the government are already      nondischargeable.       The Bankruptcy Code further provides that civil damages      payable to private parties are nondischargeable if they      result from ``willful and malicious injury by the debtor to      another entity or to the property of another entity.'' 11      U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6). The courts have interpreted this      language broadly to include injuries to intangible personal      or property rights. See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy para.      523.12[2] (15th ed. rev. 2002). As a result, the pivotal      limitation on this provision is the intent element--a debt is      nondischargeable in bankruptcy only if the debtor      intentionally caused the injury. See Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523      U.S. 57, 61 (1998).       Our research has revealed that, to date, three courts have      issued published decisions on the question whether debtors'      abortion protest-related debts were dischargeable in      bankruptcy. Each held the debts to be nondischargeable under      Section 523(a)(6). See In re Treshman, 258 B.R. 613 (Bankr.      D. Md. 2001); In re Bray, 256 B.R. 708 (Bankr. D. Md. 2000);      In re Behn, 242 B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). As one court      explained, the debt was not dischargeable because the debtor      had acted ``with the specific intent to interfere with or      intimidate the plaintiffs from engaging in legal medical      practices and procedures.'' Bray, 256 B.R. at 711. Each court      also noted that the conduct at issue, which included apparent      death threats, was unlawful and unprotected by the First      Amendment.       Of course, the ultimate issue of dischargeability      necessarily depends on the facts of each case. But Section      330 is drafted in such a way that it overlaps with Section      523(a)(6). Under Section 330, a debt is nondischargeable only      if the debtor violated either FACE or a pre-existing court      order or injunction.       Under the first of those circumstances, a debt is      nondischargeable only if the debtor: (i) intentionally      injured, intimidated, or interfered with a person, (ii) by      force, threat of force, or physical obstruction, (iii)      because the person was obtaining or providing any lawful      goods or services (such as fur products or banking services).      Because the injury, intimidation, or interference must be      intentional, any such debt would likely satisfy the existing      criteria for     nondischargeability under Section 523(a)(6). One might argue      that Section 523(a)(6) erects a higher standard than Section      330 because it requires ``willful and malicious'' (as opposed      to intentional) injury, but the terms ``intentional,''      ``willful,'' and ``malicious'' have similar meanings in the      law. The Supreme Court has held, for example, that      ``willful'' means ``deliberate or intentional'' in Section      523(a)(6). Geiger, 523 U.S. at 61. Thus, the Section 330 and      523(a)(6) standards appear to be very similar.       The second circumstance under which Section 330 renders      debt nondischargeable is when (i) the debtor violated a court      order or injunction that complies with the First Amendment      and protects the provision of lawful goods or services, and      (ii) either the debtor's violation was ``intentional or      knowing,'' or the violation occurred after the debtor had      previously been found to have violated the same court order      or another order protecting access to the same facility or      person. This provision of Section 330 might expand somewhat      on Section 523(a)(6), because a debtor might argue that      although he meant to violate an injunction (such as an      injunction prohibiting him from approaching within 8 feet of      a clinic entrance), he had no intent to intimidate or impede      anyone while within the restricted area. Thus far, however,      the courts have held that damages attributable to violation      of a court injunction against abortion-related protest      activity are ``ipso facto the result of a `willful and      malicious injury''' for purposes of Section 523(a)(6), in      part because the violation reflects an ``intention to cause      the very harm to the protected persons that [the] order was      designed to prevent.'' Behn, 242 B.R. at 238. While I find      this rationale questionable, it reflects the fact that courts      to date have already used Section 523(a)(6) for the same      purpose that Section 330 would serve. Thus, Section 330      represents either a restatement of existing law or, at most,      a modest extension of that law.     Even if section 330 were interpreted more broadly than the          existing nondischargeability provisions of the bankruptcy          code, it would still have no effect on lawful protest and          little effect on unlawful protest       Even if courts were to interpret Section 330 more broadly      than Section 523, the practical consequences would be      minimal. Section 330 does not affect lawful protest at all.      Even with respect to unlawful protest, it applies only if: a      person committed an intentional violation of the federal FACE      statute or a pre-existing court order or injunction; a court      entered an award against that person, or the person settled      the charges; the person later filed bankruptcy other a      Chapter 13 bankruptcy; the person would otherwise be entitled      to discharge a protest-related debt in bankruptcy,      notwithstanding Section 523(a) and the Bankruptcy Code's      other existing limitations on dischargeability; and the      creditor continued to pursue the matter. It would appear that      very few, if any, people will fall into this category. As      noted above, we have found only three reported cases in which      people challenged the dischargeability of abortion protest-     related debt, and in each instance the court held the debt      was nondischargeable under existing law. Thus, Section 330      would have had no effect in any of the reported cases to      date.       Even if a small number of protesters are affected by      Section 330, the Conference version of the bill seeks to      ensure that ``innocent'' protestors will not be affected. As      explained above, Section 330 applies only to those who either      (1) intentionally injure, intimidate, or interfere with a      person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction; or      (ii) intentionally or repeatedly violate a court order that      complies with the First Amendment. While some such conduct      can be ``peaceful,'' it is nonetheless intentional conduct      that has a physical element to it (in the case of the FACE      statute) or that has already been judicially determined to      thwart legitimate state interests (in the case of an existing      injunction). Moreover, peaceful of ``innocent'' conduct is      not likely to lead to substantial damage awards that a debtor      would need to discharge in bankruptcy. Instead, the reported      cases to date have involved much more provocative, highly      aggressive behavior, including perceived death threats,      ``wanted'' posters, and the like. For these reasons, it is      unlikely that anyone other than intentional and determined      lawbreakers, no matter how sincere the may be, will be      affected.     Section 330 is non-discriminatory       In any event, neutrality of operation is the order of the      day. Section 330, as I indicated above, applies by its      express terms to all those who unlawfully intimidate or      interfere with a person by physical obstruction or threat of      force if their actions were motivated by the victim's      obtaining or providing of any lawful goods or services. Thus,      it applies equally and neutrally to unlawful activity      directed toward the providers or recipients of all lawful      goods or services, not only abortion-related services.       The recent IMF/World Bank protests provide a useful example      of Section 330's intended neutrality. Many protestors, it      appears, attempted to interfere, by physical obstruction,      with the ability of the IMF/World Bank delegates to attend or      leave meetings because they disapproved of lawful services      provided by the IMF and World Bank. Other protestors      reportedly threw rocks through a window of a bank. All of      this behavior is covered by the plain language of Section      330. Also protected are similar protests by animal-rights      activists against stores that lawfully sell fur products and      the like; environmentalists that target oil and other      companies; and some unlawful union strike activity. As long      as an unlawful protest satisfies the Section 330 criteria, it      is covered to the same extent as an anti-abortion protest.     Conclusion       In sum, as modified in conference, Section 330 is primarily      a restatement of existing law. It targets only intentional      unlawful activity, and even then is not likely to have      significant practical effect. To the extent that it does have      such effect, Section 330 will apply neutrally and      evenhandedly to anti-abortion protests and other protests      aimed at business establishments.       While there is, to be sure, some risk that a court might      construe the statute unreasonably, the conference minimized      that risk by drafting the statute clearly. To provide further      protection, however, one of the sponsors of the legislation      (or another Representative) might consider making a statement      of intent on the House floor. While courts vary in their      treatment of such statements, some judges give consideration      to floor statements, especially those made by a sponsor of      the legislation. As a result, a suggested floor statement is      attached to this letter, for such consideration as may be      deemed appropriate.           Sincerely,                                                 Kenneth W. Starr.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill. This is essential bankruptcy reform which will help revive our economy.  In 1998, $40 billion of debt was written off, and that amounts to a hidden tax of $400 for every family in this country who pays their bills on time and is agreed upon, and that tax hits the poor people hardest because that type of a tax is regressive.  We need to pass this legislation to prevent bankruptcy from being used as a financial planning tool.  Now, my friends over here on my right claim that this is going to hurt poor people. That is absolutely not true, because people who are genuinely unable to repay their bills will be able to get their discharge through chapter 7. But where there is a possibility of people repaying their bills over a 5-year period of time, or some of their bills, then they have to go through a reorganization, so that the money is recouped and not passed on to the consumers.  I would point out that if this legislation goes down, either on the vote on the rule or the vote on the conference report, the current homestead exemption which is unlimited in places like Texas and Florida will end up still being the law and the corporate crooks will be able to put millions in their mansions and shield them from bankruptcy. There is a partial plug to prevent people who defraud the public from being able to do that, notwithstanding State law. So voting down the rule gives the corporate crooks a get-out-of-bankruptcy-free card.  Now, to my friends over here on my left, we have heard an awful lot of allegations that this bankruptcy provision that was negotiated between Senator Schumer and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) is an outrageous attempt to financially ruin pro-life protestors. There is not a person in this Chamber that has given his life more to the pro-life movement than the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), and he negotiated this and he signed off on this agreement, and I think that we ought to respect his work for this pro-life movement.  We have heard that section 330 of the bill is an outrageous trampling of first amendment rights. Let me read it for my colleagues.  It says, ``Except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect any expressive conduct, including peaceful picketing, peaceful prayer, or other peaceful demonstration protected from legal prohibition by the first amendment of the Constitution.''  Read the bill. It does not affect first amendment rights. They are protected by the Constitution, and the black and white text of this provision protects things that are protected by the first amendment.  We have heard about the infamous Starr memorandum. A part of that says that section 330 does not affect lawful protest at all. What it does do is affect unlawful protest. And you are on the side of people who break the law, who want to break the law. What we do here is we protect people who want to abide by the law.  Now, in order for section 330 to come into play, there have to be nine steps that are done by the person whose debtis to be declared nondischargeable, and I want to go through them.  First, there must be a violation of Federal or State statutory law. Second, the violation must result in some type of monetary liability such as civil or statutory damages. Third, the monetary liability must be based on a Federal or State court order or from a settlement agreement entered into by the debtor. Fourth, the violation of the law must result from an intentional act by the debtor. This does not apply to unintentional violations of the law and, thus, it would not apply to innocent protestors. Fifth, the intentional act must involve force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction. Sixth, the intentional act must result in intentional injury, intimidation, or interference, or intentional damage or destruction of property. Seventh, the debtor must have injured, intimidated, or interfered with a person because such person obtained or provided lawful goods or services or because a facility provides lawful goods or services. Eighth, the debtor must file for bankruptcy relief; and ninth, the party holding the monetary judgment against the debtor must bring an action in the bankruptcy court for the purpose of having the court determine whether the debtor's liability for the judgment is nondischargeable under section 330.  They have to do all nine of these things to get a debt nondischargeable.  Now, if the opponents of this bill and the opponents of the rule are successful, the current bankruptcy law which would stand makes all fines and forfeitures nondischargeable, including those that arise under the FACE Act. So defeating a necessary bankruptcy reform is not going to accomplish this purpose. The rule and the bill ought to pass.
