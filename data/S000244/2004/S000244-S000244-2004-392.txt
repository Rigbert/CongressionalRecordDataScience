Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit for now, but I am prepared to accept this motion to recommit for a number of reasons.  First of all, I think the motion to recommit is redundant in that all Federal laws apply to these special elections, not just the laws that are enumerated to the motion to recommit with instructions that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) has offered, but I want to be much more serious in terms of dealing with this.  How the House is reconstituted following a disaster should not be an issue of partisan debate. Much of what has gone on here today has been a partisan debate; and in accepting this motion to recommit, I am reaching out to the other side to say let us make the passage of this bill bipartisan because the acceptance of the motion to recommit should make the bill bipartisan.                              {time}  1600  And that, coupled with my commitment to deal with the gentleman from Washington's (Mr. Baird) constitutional amendment, certainly should show that we are dealing with this issue in good faith. And whether one supports the gentleman from Washington's (Mr. Baird) amendment or not, it is important, I think, to make sure that the replacement representatives that are elected are elected and seated as soon as humanly possible, and that is what this bill attempts to do.  So I would hope that after the acceptance of this motion to recommit, we could pass this bill by an overwhelming vote; and I would reach out to my friends on the other side of the aisle and make that offer and hope that they reciprocate.  I yield to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), chairman of the Committee on Rules.
