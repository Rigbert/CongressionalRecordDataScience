Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information as to the schedule. As I am sure he knows, I will want to ask him some questions about things that are not yet scheduled and, of course, the next week we will take a recess.                              {time}  1130  As the gentleman knows, the budget was passed out of the Budget Committee last month. We understand, of course, obviously, the Appropriations Committee is proceeding to mark up bills notwithstanding the fact that the budget has not been passed.  We are not sure exactly what the allocations for each subcommittee are going to be because, apparently, there has been no 302(b) allocation, which is the allocation to the 12 subcommittees.  It is going to be hard for us to tell exactly how much money is left if, in fact, appropriations bills are brought to the floor without knowing fully the distribution of funds for both defense and domestic priorities.  First, let me ask the gentleman: Does the gentleman expect the budget to be brought to the floor prior to the bringing of appropriations bills to the floor?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We will continue to work through the budget process, and I will update the Members once there is more information.
