  I came to the floor last week and spoke in support of S. 1237, which is the Homeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health Care Authorities Act of 2010, an extremely important and timely bill that will help many women, women with children, and men with children today who served our country, who have come home and do not have the support and services they need and end up homeless on our streets. So I come to the Senate floor today to urge our colleagues to pass this bill quickly.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 360, S. 1237, the Homeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health Care Authorities Act; that the committee-reported substitute amendment be considered; that an Akaka amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the committee-reported title amendment be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.
