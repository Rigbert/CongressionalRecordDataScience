  Today, there is no assurance of safety--no one is watching the store--and products are coming in from all over the world.  My legislation has two objectives. First, it will put an immediate end to the unregulated and unsafe situations of drug imports that we have today by default. This is key because the situation today threatens the safety of our Nation's drug supply and puts patients who obtain these drugs at risk of harm.  Second, the legislation will provide the Food and Drug Administration with the resources and authority to ensure the safety of imported drugs, and importation will only be permitted by registered exporters who submit to the Food and Drug Administration authority.  Now, this bill will get referred to the Finance Committee because it has tax provisions in it, but the bulk of my bill falls under the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee, and my friend, Senator Gregg, as chairman of that committee, has announced he will hold a markup this year on a drug importation bill.  I do not intend to assert jurisdiction over this proposal, and I believe we should rely upon that regular committee process to work. That is how we get legislation passed in the Senate. Because that is where bipartisanship is formulated, at the committee level.  I hope my colleagues will look at this bill. I wanted to get these ideas out here for discussion. I hope some of my colleagues will want to cosponsor this bill. It is time we got this done, and this is the year to get it done, particularly following upon the vote that was in the House of Representatives last year.  We must not let partisan politics get in the way, and I think it is getting a little bit in the way right now. I hope we overcome that. I hope I am able to develop a relationship with Democrats, once again, to work on this bill in a bipartisan way. If we do not do this, I think there is going to be a penalty paid at the ballot box in November.  The American consumers are waiting. Let's get the job done.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Exhibit 1                        Overview of Key Elements       Legalizes reimportation (or importation) of prescription      drugs from FDA approved exporters. To be approved, registered      exporters must agree to meet safety requirements and to      permit FDA inspectors on their premises full time to ensure      compliance.       Creates a ``fast-track'' regulatory process for FDA to      implement the importation system quickly.       Importation of qualified prescription drugs from Canada is      immediately legalized while the new importation system is      developed and implemented by FDA.       Under the new system, individuals, pharmacies, and drug      wholesalers are permitted to legally import prescription      drugs from registered foreign exporters:       Individuals may order drugs from a registered exporter      pursuant to a valid prescription issued by a U.S. doctor and      filled by a pharmacist whose licensing requirements are      equivalent to those required in the U.S. or by a dispensing      pharmacist duly licensed by a state.       Commercial shipments are permitted only to licensed      pharmacists for resale directly to consumers and by drug      wholesalers who can sell to pharmacies as they do today.       Drugs imported to U.S. pharmacies and drug wholesalers must      be FDA approved drugs produced in the United States or in FDA      inspected manufacturing facilities in other counties. FDA is      required to provide the proper labeling for drugs for      importation.       The FDA through its inspectors is responsible for tracing      all drugs exported to the U.S. back to their original      manufacturing plant and ensuring that they have been stored      and transported safely from that plant.       Individuals may also purchase drugs that are bioequivalent      to FDA-approved brand name drugs that are produced by the      same brand-name manufacturer.       These drugs are drugs not technically approved by the FDA      but the foreign government has approved the drug and that      drug has the same active ingredient or ingredients as the      FDA-approved drug and the same route of administration,      dosage form, and strength.       If a drug manufacturer believes, however, that the non-FDA      approved drug is not bioequivalent to the FDA approved drug,      then it must submit a petition to the FDA to show that (a)      the differences result in a product that is not bioequivalent      to the drug approved in the U.S., and (b) that such      differences are due to scientifically and legally valid      differences in the regulatory requirements of the U.S. and      the country(ies) in which the apparently similar drug is      marketed. The manufacturer is required to pay a user fee      sufficient to cover the cost of the FDA's review of the      petition and supporting documentation.       A User Fee charged to registered exporters provides the      financing to provide the resources to FDA to ensure the      safety of imported drugs.       User fees charged to registered exporters would be      sufficient to cover all costs including those incurred for      inspection and verification within the United States, at the      exporter's premises and any other location where the drugs      have been stored prior to entry into the U.S.       The FDA would be required to verify the source and inspect      the intermediate handlers of all drugs intended for export      into the United States.       FDA would also be required to determine by a statistically      significant sample that the recipients held valid      prescriptions (individuals ordering 90-day supply or less) or      verify that recipient was a licensed pharmacy that only      dispensed drugs to individuals.       The FDA would also be required to supply valid U.S.      labeling upon request of the registered exporter and affix or      supervise the affixing of seals, markings or tracking      technology that would inform border personnel that such      imports were lawful to be entered as labeled.       Drugs not permitted for importation include controlled      substances and certain other drugs not appropriate for      importation because of storage, significant safety concerns,      or drugs that are more likely to be counterfeited.     Provisions to Protect Safety of the Public       Unauthorized imports would be treated as contraband and      would be seized and destroyed upon entry without notice.       For the first two years, importation would be limited to      Canada. The Department of Health and Human Services would      submit a report to Congress in the second year, and unless      Congress changed the law, countries from which importation is      permitted would be expanded to include, the European Union,      the European Free Trade Association, Japan, Australia, and      New Zealand. Other countries meeting statutory criteria could      also be added to the list by the Secretary.       The legislation continues to prohibit the import or      reimport of drugs supplied free or at nominal cost to      charitable or humanitarian organizations including the United     Nations or a government of a foreign country.       Requires pedigrees from the manufacturer to the dispensing      pharmacist for all prescription drugs sold within the U.S. or      to an exporter authorized to export drugs into the U.S.       Requires the automatic suspension of an exporter's      registration for any attempted entry of non-qualified or      unsafe drugs with restricted ability to seek re-instatement      in the future.       Requires that registered exporters submit to the      jurisdiction of the U.S. federal court system and provides a      mechanism for civil actions against the property of persons      that import non-qualified drugs.       Repeals the provision in the Controlled Substances Act that      permits the personal import of scheduled drugs, which is a      significant source of illegal drug trade in the U.S.     Tax Incentives for Manufacturers to Facilitate Reimportation       Incentive To Not Prevent Reimportation: Manufacturers that      do not take any action, directly or indirectly, to prevent      reimportation receive a 20% increase in R tax credit for      that year.       Penalty For Preventing Reimportation: Manufacturers that      take any action, directly or indirectly, to prevent      authorized reimportation lose the business expense deduction      for advertising expenses.                  Questions and Answers about the Bill       Question. What are the goals of the legislation?       Answer. The legislation has two objectives. First, it would      put an immediate end to the unregulated and unsafe situation      with drug imports that exists today. Second, the legislation      would provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the      resources and authority to ensure the safety of imported      drugs.       Question. How does the bill work?       Answer. Current law prohibits the importation of      prescription drugs until the Secretary of Health and Human      Services (HHS) certifies that importation can be done safely.      Using current resources and authority, the FDA has not been      able to provide an assurance of safety of imported drugs.       The bill immediately halts unsafe importation but permits      individuals to obtain prescriptions from Canadian pharmacies      on an interim basis while FDA gets the new drug importation      system up and running.       Under the bill, the FDA is required to issue final      regulations for the new system within 90 days of enactment.      Under the new importation system, individuals, pharmacies,      and drug wholesalers could purchase qualified drugs for      import into the U.S. from foreign exporters that register      with the FDA. To obtain a registration, a foreign exporter      must demonstrate compliance with safety measures, must submit      to jurisdiction of U.S. courts, and take others steps to      assure safety of imported drugs. A user fee charged to      registered exporters would provide the financing needed for      FDA to register and oversee foreign drug exporters and ensure      the safety of imported drugs.       Question. How will patients get their prescriptions filled      at an overseas drug exporter?       Answer. First of all, consumers that want to have their      prescriptions filled at an overseas prescription drug      exporter will be able to go to the FDA website and find a      list of companies that have passed FDA's requirements to      become a registered exporter. Just as for filling a      prescription in the U.S. today, the patient must have a valid      prescription written by a health care professional licensed      in a state to prescribe drugs. The patient will then compare      drug prices at the different registered exporters to find the      best price available. To get the prescription filled, the      patient will have to contact that exporter and either mail or      fax the prescription to them.       Alternatively, the registered exporter could call the      patient's prescriber and get the prescription over the phone.      This is the same process as mail order pharmacies in the U.S.      use today.       A pharmacist at the registered exporter would fill the      prescription according to the prescriber's instructions. The      registered exporter may only fill the prescription with      brand-name drugs, meaning these are the same drugs as those      approved by the FDA and manufactured by the same company as      approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S.       Individuals can also have a prescription filled that is      technically not an FDA-approved drug, but the drug has the      same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, and route of      administration as the FDA-approved drug and is made by the      same manufacturer as the FDA-approved drug. These drugs are      manufactured by the same brand-name manufacturer and are made      for sale in the market of the approved country.       The registered exporter is required to verify that the drug      can be traced back to the original manufacturer and the drug      must have been stored and handled properly. The FDA, through      its on-site inspectors, will also be verifying that the      prescription drugs being dispensed to patients meet FDA's      criteria.       Once the prescription is filled, the registered exporter      will place a label or other markings on the package for      shipping that identify the shipment as being in compliance      with FDA's safety requirements and all registration      conditions. These markings will be designed by FDA and may      include track-and-trace technologies and anti-counterfeiting      measures. When the package enters the U.S., that marking will      signify to Customs officials that the product was dispensed      from a registered exporter and can therefore be permitted to      enter the country. Packages with drugs that lack this marking      will be seized by Customs and destroyed.       Question. Can the importation of prescription drugs from      other countries be expanded?       Answer. Yes. In the second year of the importation program,      HHS would be required to submit a report to Congress on the      safety of the program and its impact on trade. Unless      Congress acted, the program would be expanded in year three      to include importation from the European Union, the European      Free Trade Association, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.      Other countries that meet specific statutory criteria may      also be added to the list.       Question. What is the complete list of countries that would      be permitted in the third year of the program?       Answer. There are currently 15 members of the European      Union: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,      Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,      The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Beginning on May 1,      2004, there will be 10 new member states in the European      Union: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,      Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. There are 4      member countries in the European Free Trade Association:      Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.       Question. How much does this program cost?       Answer. The infrastructure needed to guarantee the safety      of the imported prescriptions would be financed through user      fees. User fees would be paid by registered exporters, which      could be the overseas pharmacies or prescription drug      wholesalers, for example. Congressional Budget Office has not      yet officially scored the bill.       Question. Now that the bill is introduced, what comes next?       Answer. Because the bill contains tax provisions, it has      been referred to the Finance Committee. Senate leadership has      expressed an interest in developing legislation this year to      allow the importation of prescription drugs. Because the bulk      of the legislation falls within the jurisdiction of the      Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee, it is      expected that HELP will take the lead in reporting any      legislation.       Question. How is this bill different than other legislation      on importation?       Answer. While the idea of importation of prescription drugs      from foreign countries enjoys broad bipartisan support, the      issue of safety continues to remain a major barrier to      allowing importation to move forward. Secretaries of HHS from      both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have determined      that safe importation of prescription drugs cannot be      guaranteed with the authority and resources the FDA has      today. Many bills presume that importation is safe and that      FDA and the public should not be overly alarmed. However,      there is a legitimate concern about unsafe pharmaceuticals      entering the U.S. every day. Hundreds of thousands of      packages enter our country on a daily basis, with little or      no ability for the U.S. Customs Service or the FDA to      guarantee these drugs are safe and effective. Rather than      ignore the safety issue, this bill responds to the concerns      raised by FDA and others and creates a way to ensure safe      access to lower cost prescriptions.       Question. How does this bill lower the costs of      prescription drugs Americans have to pay?       Answer. United States consumers pay 30 to 300 percent more      for their prescriptions drugs than those in other countries.      Drug manufacturers are forced to sell their products at lower      prices in other countries and try to re-coup their profits by      making Americans pay higher prices for the same products.      This bill recognizes that competition in the global      marketplace can work to lower prescription drug costs. If      lower cost pharmaceuticals are made available to Americans,      drug companies will be forced to re-think their pricing      strategy and won't be able to gouge consumers in the United      States.       Question. What mechanisms does the bill propose to      guarantee safety?       Answer. The bill would allow importation of qualified drugs      only from registered exporters, whose actions will be held      accountable in U.S. Federal courts.       Registered exporters must have an FDA-approved compliance      plan that demonstrates they are meeting the safety      requirements established in the bill or by FDA. Exporters      must permit FDA inspectors to be present onsite on a      continuous day-to-day basis and FDA is required to have      assigned inspectors to that exporter. FDA will conduct day-     to-day onsite monitoring of the exporter at the place of      business for the exporter including any warehouses owned or      operated by the exporter and FDA will have access to inspect      the exporters records to ensure compliance. Only where an      exporter has demonstrated a track record of compliance will      FDA be permitted to perform periodic inspections. The FDA      must verify the chain of custody for each qualifying drug      from the manufacturer of the drug to the exporter.       Only licensed pharmacists at the registered exporter will      be allowed to dispense prescriptions with a valid U.S.      prescription from a U.S. physician. Commercial shipments can      only be received and resold by licensed pharmacists.      Unauthorized imports     would be treated as contraband and would be seized and      destroyed upon entry without notice. Under the bill, an      exporter's registration would automatically be suspended for      any attempted entry of non-qualified or unsafe drugs and      these exporters can be barred from seeking re-instatement in      the future. The bill would allow for importation first from      Canada in order to test the safety of the system and      determine whether additional controls are needed before      expansion to additional counties.       Question. How does the bill prevent drug manufacturers from      gaming the system?       Answer. Drug manufacturers that take any action, directly      or indirectly, to prevent authorized importation will see a      loss of their tax deduction for advertising expenses. Drug      manufacturers that do NOT take action, directly or      indirectly, to prevent importation will see a 20 percent      increase in their research and development tax credit for      that year.                                 ______                                       By
