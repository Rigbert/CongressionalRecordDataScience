 The issue is the local exchange and because of the particular ``proposition 13'' situation where local revenues are so restricted, property taxes are so restricted, it is extraordinarily difficult. So utility user taxes, local exchange taxes actually play a substantial role in some smaller cities' budgets. That is just a fact.  Los Angeles, the biggest city, a city with a lot of problems, a city with a big gang population, needs a lot of police. Some of that police force is actually funded from this local exchange money, which totals $40 million a year.  I yield time to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. May I ask how much time he would like.
