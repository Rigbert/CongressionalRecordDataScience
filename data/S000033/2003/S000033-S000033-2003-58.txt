 Chairman, I thank my friend.  First, I want to apologize to my friends for forcing them to vote. I have never done this before. It is not my style.  I had an amendment at the desk dealing with an issue of deep concern to tens of millions of Americans and, I think, a majority of the Members of this body, and that is to make an important change to the USA PATRIOT Act so that the FBI is not given carte blanche to go into our libraries or our book stores with no probable cause.  Now, I understand that there are Members who may disagree with that notion. I would tell my colleagues that we have 129 cosponsors, conservatives, liberals, progressives, and the support of the American Library Association, the American Book Sellers Association. What is disturbing me very much is the possibility that this important issue, and both sides of the issue, will not be allowed to be debated this afternoon in this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I brought forth an amendment which is at the desk. We needed to make, upon advice from the Parliamentarian, some minor modification. I asked the chairman of the committee to give us unanimous consent to make a minor modification so that we could debate both sides of this issue, one of the most important civil liberties problems facing the United States of America, and the chairman refused that courtesy.  So let me be very clear. The American people have a right to read without the FBI looking over their shoulder. The American people have a right to have that issue debated on the floor, and I intend, with my colleagues, to do everything I can to make certain that that occurs.
