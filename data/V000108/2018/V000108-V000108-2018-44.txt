Speaker, it is with great honor and respect that I recognize the Community Civility Counts Initiative as the organization celebrates its third annual World Civility Day on April 12, 2018, along with the Gary Chamber of Commerce, the entire community of Northwest Indiana, and beyond. World Civility Day is a day in which we are asked to become aware of our behavior towards others and to become mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions. It is a day to remember that we can be better people in every area of life, and to remember that our actions serve as an example for generations to come. In observance of this special event, a day of civility-themed activities will be held at the Indiana Welcome Center in Hammond, and an awards banquet will follow in the evening at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville.  In 2015, Chuck Hughes, Executive Director of the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and Dr. Gordon E. Bradshaw, Chairman of the Public Policy Committee, worked together through the Gary Chamber to create the Civility Counts Initiative. The organization's mission is to build public awareness of civility and to help transform communities through positive programs and relationships. The Initiative works to raise the consciousness level of individuals and groups of people, as so many of us face incidents of disrespect, intolerance, bullying, or violence. For striving to make a difference in our communities, the organization and its supporters are worthy of the highest praise.  The Initiative has been overwhelmingly successful and recognized throughout many communities. Civility Resolutions have been approved by many local municipal councils including those in Gary, Hammond, Valparaiso, La Porte, and Lake County. In addition, Civility Resolutions have also been approved by the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate. Support for the Initiative has grown tremendously with numerous organizations and individuals dedicating their time and resources to this great cause year after year.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in honoring and congratulating the Community Civility Counts Initiative and in celebrating World Civility Day. The significance of this movement will have a positive impact on generation after generation. For their influence, passion, and dedication to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, the leaders and supporters of the Community Civility Counts Initiative are to be commended.                          ____________________
