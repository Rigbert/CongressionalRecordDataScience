President, as we hope for peace in the Middle East, some parties in the region are making peace less likely by inciting violence against Israel. It is imperative to recognize these words and actions for the poisons they are to achieving peace. An excellent November 23, 2014, opinion piece by Jeffrey Robbins in the Boston Herald entitled ``U.S. mute as Abbas incites violence'' articulates why silence is the wrong response to the anti-Israeli rhetoric and ideology that encourage further violence and terror. Jeff is a former delegate from the United States to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and I believe my colleagues and the American people would benefit from reading the entire piece, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Boston Herald, Nov. 23, 2014]              Robbins: U.S. Mute as Abbas Incites Violence                           (By Jeff Robbins)       At a meeting in Jerusalem last December, a State Department      official was asked about the unremitting anti-Semitism      emanating from Palestinian officials, their continuing      celebration of the murderers of Israeli civilians and what      the United States was doing about it. It was ``a challenge,''      she said, adding that it was ``our position'' that      Palestinian incitement of violence was ``unhelpful'' to      peace. Beyond this banality, she had nothing to offer.       This week's massacre of worshippers in a Jerusalem      synagogue--following the Palestinian murders of Israelis in      recent days by     stabbing them and by running them over--raises yet again the      disquieting question: has the Obama administration's      fecklessness about confronting Palestinian incitement of      terror served to enable it?       In the last few weeks alone, the Palestinian Authority has      posted cartoons of an Israeli pulling down his pants and      preparing to ``rape'' an Arab woman representing a Muslim      holy site. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas praised the      Palestinian shot while attempting to assassinate an Israeli      as a ``martyr'' who was destined for heaven. A new hit song      on Palestinian social media calls for listeners to ``destroy,      annihilate [and] blow up'' Israelis. Al-Quds University has      created the ``Martyr Ibrahim Al-Akhari Tournament'' to honor      the man who recently murdered two Israelis and injured 13      others by running them over with his car.       Despite the fact that American taxpayers provide $500      million to the Palestinian Authority annually, the Obama      administration has failed to use that leverage to pressure      the recipients of American aid to stop its incitement. Though      then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton warned back in 2007 of the      need to ``stop the propaganda to which Palestinian children      are being exposed,'' the administration has declined to      demand that the Palestinians cut it out.       It is bad enough that the president has not lifted a finger      to pressure the Palestinian Authority to put an end to      incitement to murder. Even worse, his administration has      conducted itself in a way which, however unintended it may      be, has effectively green-lighted anti-Israelism of the most      vicious sort--which in turn fuels the kind of violence that      has left European Jews fearful for their lives and Israelis      reeling.       This has included years of publicly derisive treatment of      Israel that has conveyed to Israel's enemies and others that      it stands alone, encouraging the conclusion that attacks on      Israel--political and physical--have no consequences as far      as the United States is concerned.       Earlier this month the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of      Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told the Carnegie Council for      Ethics in International Affairs that Israel deserved credit      for having gone to ``extraordinary lengths to limit      collateral damage and civilian casualties'' in trying to      defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Dempsey's      praise placed the administration's scornful, damaging      criticism of what were obviously unintended deaths of      civilians in Gaza during this summer's wholly defensive war      in stark relief.       Whether by giving interviews witheringly critical of      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at particularly      sensitive moments or by using obscenities to castigate him,      the White House has encouraged the impression that Israel is      a fair target for those who wish it ill.       The administration's scornful treatment of Israel has      registered deeply with Israel's enemies, who have been      encouraged to believe that America's ally is being cut loose.      And it has registered with particular force in the Middle      East, where the intensity of anti-Semitic incitement has      grown steadily.       No serious person can claim that the administration wants      an upsurge of terror. But it is hard to deny that it bears a      share of responsibility for it.                          ____________________
