President, this evening, the Senate is considering S. 627, as amended by the House of Representatives--the bill now called the Budget Control Act of 2011. Earlier this week, the House Republican Leadership used a procedural maneuver to strip from this bill bipartisan provisions to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, that unanimously passed the Senate. I urge the Senate to restore the bipartisan Leahy-Cornyn Faster FOIA Act of 2011, as originally and unanimously passed by the Senate in May, when the Senate considers its budget bill.  The Faster FOIA Act enjoys broad bipartisan support from across the political spectrum. The Senate unanimously passed this bill in May, after the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill by voice vote. Recently, more than 35 transparency organizations urged the House Committee onOversight and Government Reform to act on this legislation. On Tuesday, the Washington Post editorialized that the House should promptly enact this bipartisan bill to improve the FOIA process.  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced the Faster FOIA Act in 2005, to address the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal agencies. During the intervening years, the problem of excessive FOIA delays has not gone away. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the Senate unanimously passed it last year. The current bill is the most recent product of our bipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.  The Faster FOIA Act would establish a bipartisan Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays to examine the root causes of excessive FOIA delays. The Commission would recommend to Congress and the President steps that should be taken to reduce these delays, so that the administration of the FOIA is more equitable and efficient.  The Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of government information to the American people, so that our democracy remains vibrant and free. This is a laudable goal that we all share. Neither Chamber of Congress should allow partisan politics to obstruct the important goal of this bill.  The ongoing debate in Congress about the national debt has made clear that we must find ways to work together, across party lines and ideologies, to address the many challenges facing our Nation. This bipartisan spirit is at the core of the Faster FOIA Act. I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue it is truly an American value and virtue that we all must uphold. I urge the Senate to include the Faster FOIA Act in its budget bill, and I urge the Congress to promptly enact this good government measure.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letters in support of reinstating the Faster FOIA Act in the final debt ceiling package.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Sunshine in Government Initiative,                                     Arlington, VA, July 29, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. John Boehner,     U.S. House of Representatives.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     U.S. House of Representatives.       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell,      Speaker Boehner, and Minority Leader Pelosi: We urge the      Congress to reinstate the bipartisan, uncontroversial      language strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)      that was removed from S. 627, the Faster FOIA Act, as it was      amended to address the unrelated issue surrounding the debt      limit. The original language would create a bipartisan      commission to recommend concrete ways to strengthen      transparency in the federal government and has broad,      bipartisan support.       The Sunshine in Government Initiative is a coalition of      media associations promoting government transparency,      especially focusing on FOIA. SGI members include the American      Society of News Editors, the Associated Press, Association of      Alternative Newsweeklies, National Newspaper Association,      Newspaper Association of America, Radio Television Digital      News Association, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the      Press and Society of Professional Journalists.       Especially in this fiscal environment, the Faster FOIA      Commission would help the public understand how taxpayer      dollars are being spent by bringing together experts inside      and outside the government to look ``under the hood'' of      agency FOIA operations and to propose within a year the most      realistic, effective and cost-efficient improvements to      improve government transparency.       The Freedom of Information Act is the vital law that helps      ensure the public can see what its government is up to while      protecting personal privacy, national security, trade secrets      and other important interests. The Commission's work should      provide timely insight to help inform next steps that      Congress with your leadership might undertake to strengthen      transparency in the federal government.           Sincerely,                                                        Rick Blum,     Coordinator.                                  ____                                                    July 28, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. John Boehner,     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, The Capitol,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, The Capitol,          Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell,      Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the      undersigned organizations concerned with government openness      and accountability, we are writing to urge you to restore the      bipartisan Faster FOIA provisions in S. 627, now known as the      Budget Control Act of 2011.       This week, Speaker Boehner took S. 627 as a vehicle for his      budget bill. This procedural maneuver could shave a few days      off of Senate consideration, should the House pass the      Boehner budget control bill. However, in doing so, the      Speaker unnecessarily stripped the Faster FOIA Act from      S.627, completely replacing the language with the budget      bill. If the Faster FOIA language is not restored in S. 627,      the bipartisan progress made by the Senate on the legislation      will be wiped out. This is a setback for openness and      accountability in the executive branch, and bipartisan action      in Congress.       The Senate unanimously passed the Faster FOIA Act, authored      by Senator Leahy (D-VT) and Senator Cornyn (R-TX) in May. The      legislation would establish the Commission on Freedom of      Information Act (FOIA) Processing Delays (the Commission) to      examine several thorny issues that create unreasonable bars      to public access under the FOIA and recommend to Congress and      the President steps that should be taken to reduce delays and      make the administration of the FOIA equitable and efficient      throughout the federal government.       The Faster FOIA Act enjoys strong support among a broad      range of non-governmental organizations. Recently, more than      35 organizations joined to urge the House Committee on      Oversight and Government Reform to act on the legislation. A      recent editorial in the Washington Post also called on the      House to embrace the bill in the same bipartisan spirit as      the Senate in the interest of improving the FOIA process.       We urge you to advance openness and accountability to      restore the bipartisan Faster FOIA provisions in S. 627. We      thank you in advance for your consideration of our request.
