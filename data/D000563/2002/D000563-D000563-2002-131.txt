I thank the Senator from Nevada.  The point the Senator from Michigan makes is an important one. We did pass a prescription drug bill. It was not what we wanted. We wanted a voluntary program under Medicare which would be universal and available for all Americans so they could get the benefits of Medicare when it came to prescription drugs.  We could not convince our Republican friends to go along with us on that, but we did pass a bill in terms of generic drugs to reduce costs for all families across America, to let States come up with their own plans so they could find ways to reduce costs for all the citizens in their State, as well as the safe reimportation of drugs from countries that have much lower costs. Those are three good issues, but do not forget the fourth.  Senator Rockefeller's amendment provides that $6 billion, on an emergency basis, will be given for Medicaid to States facing high unemployment. These States have cut back in reimbursements to providers and hospitals. My State is one of them--I bet the State of Michigan is too--and that $6 billion would come back to the States right now. It would help them keep hospitals open and provide basic health care.  We cannot get the House of Representatives to consider that legislation. Now they are talking about dropping everything and coming up with a resolution on Iraq. Why is it they can drop everything for a resolution on Iraq, but cannot drop everything, when it comes to prescription drugs, to move the issue forward?  Our bill is there. It is pending. It would be a help to all families across America, not just the families of senior citizens.  I say to the Senator from Michigan, we have to keep reminding the President and the Republican leadership that there are many issues in this country, not the least of which is good quality health care for everyone.
