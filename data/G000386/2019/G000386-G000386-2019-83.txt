 President, later today, I will attend the portrait unveiling of my former colleague and friend, Senator Ted Stevens, who served in the Senate from 1968 until 2009.  This portrait is being added to the Senate leadership portrait collection because of Senator Stevens' service as the President pro tempore, a position I now hold.  Senator Stevens was known for his tireless work on behalf of the State of Alaska and their citizens. He had quite a reputation for reaching across party lines to get the job done.  I am honored to attend today's ceremony adding Senator Stevens' portrait to the historic walls of the U.S. Capitol.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
