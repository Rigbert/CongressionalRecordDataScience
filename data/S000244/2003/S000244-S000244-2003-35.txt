Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, let us be clear about this. This is an amendment in the nature of a substitute. If it is adopted, there will be no more amendments in order and the bill will come up for a vote on final passage right away. All of the work that has been done relative to reforming Prison Industries will be tossed in the waste basket, and we will get another study and the Committee on the Judiciary is going to have to start over from scratch in terms of putting together legislation to reform Federal Prison Industries.  The Committee on the Judiciary has held hearings on the problems relating to Prison Industries. We have had a markup on this bill where all views were considered. In the last Congress we did the same. To say that all of this work should be tossed in the waste basket and we have to start over from scratch is nothing but a means of saying let us keep the present system as it is.                              {time}  1245  It is a stalling technique, and it really should not be seriously considered in the House.  Let us look at what is in the 48 pages of H.R. 1829. It makes reform of the government-wide procurement policy with respect to purchases from FPI. It has public participation regarding expansion proposals by FPI. It has a transitional mandatory source authority. It gives FPI the authority to perform as a Federal subcontractor. It deals with inmate wages and deductions. It has additional rehabilitative opportunities for inmates, and provides an authorization for it. It restructures the board of directors of FPI, which I think is vitally necessary because it is the board that determines what Federal Government agencies have to buy and what goods they have to buy. It provides additional management flexibility for FPI. It requires a report by FPI to Congress. It has an independent study to determine the effects of eliminating the Federal Prison Industries' mandatory source authority.  All that is completely obliterated by the amendment that my colleague from Wisconsin has offered. He can be against the bill. If he is against the bill, he ought to vote against it. But to stop FPI reform in its tracks and force everybody to go back to square one is not warranted given all of the work that has been put into this. I would urge that this amendment be overwhelmingly rejected.
