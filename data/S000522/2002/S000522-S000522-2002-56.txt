Mr. Speaker, to their everlasting credit, 86 percent of hospitals in America do not do abortions. Why? Because they are all about saving life, nurturing, and healing. Pregnancy is not a disease; the unborn child is not a wart or tumor to be killed. Chemical poisoning, literal dismemberment, abortions, are violence against children.  This is all about protecting the right of conscience. NARAL let the cat out of the bag on one their web sites. They said, Maryland NARAL is launching this hospital provider project to increase access to abortion services by requiring Maryland hospitals to provide abortion. They want to compel hospitals of conscience to do abortions--it's that simple.  Not all of the hospitals are religious. There are people who are not religious who have deep, moral convictions, and they believe that abortion takes the life of a baby. We ought to be nurturing. We should not compel our places of healing to become killing fields.
