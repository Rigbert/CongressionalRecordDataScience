Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would, first of all, indicate my regard for the abilities, intellect, as well as the commitment to the environment of the gentleman of New York (Mr. Boehlert). I appreciate his working with the chair and the committee to make the bill a better bill. But I make a couple of observations to my colleagues.  The first is that the language proposed by the gentleman from New York essentially provides for a political solution to a fundamental flaw in the legislation as far as the Clean Water Act and protecting wetlands.  Secondly, I do think that, again, the underlying language that we are talking about is extraordinary as far as the additional costs to the Corps to now issue these reports and studies, the diversion of their energies, and a potential delay from the proposed end of these programs; and that is for the jurisdictional issue to be resolved in September and permit 26 to be resolved in November. That, despite the December 30 date in both of these instances, the time frame we are facing today is shorter, so there is still a delay involved.  Additionally, I think it is extralegal because, under permitting, there is no requirement for the agency to provide a costs study. So what is being requested here is outside of what is legally required under the law.  The gentleman's language does not touch upon the issue of jurisdiction that is part of the amendment that is pending before the House.  But saying that, I can read English. I respect the gentleman. The gentleman has, in a way, improved the language of the bill, and I appreciate him for doing it. I accept the gentleman's language, and I would ask every one of my colleagues in the House to do the same.
