Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to thank my good friend from Nebraska, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. He is very much involved on a day-to-day basis with what is going on in China. We have worked cooperatively on this resolution. He had some very useful text changes, and we thank him for that.  I wanted to thank the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), who is always a great friend of human rights; the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi); and I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), my ranking member of the subcommittee, and all the Members who have helped forge this legislation.
