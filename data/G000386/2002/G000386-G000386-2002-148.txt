 President, I thank my colleagues for their comments and I agree completely with them that the definition of perishable and cyclical agricultural products includes livestock and meat production. It is clear to me that there can be no other reading of the legislation and I believe that our colleagues intended for these products to be covered. We expect our negotiators, to include these products under these provisions.
