 President, I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline Coats, a 28-year-old widow currently living in San Francisco.  Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status lapsed in 2003, and the Department ofHomeland Security began deportation proceedings against her.  Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for several years.
