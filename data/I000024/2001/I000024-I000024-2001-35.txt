President, I am going to reread that because this is very simple. This is not the comprehensive amendment I had which would have put H.R. 4 into the Defense authorization bill.  There is no one in this Chamber who wants to have a Defense authorization bill more than I do. I will not jeopardize that. However, this amendment is simply a sense of the Senate on availability of energy-related supplies for the Armed Forces. It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should, before the adjournment of the first session of the 107th Congress, take action on the comprehensive national energy security legislation, including energy production and energy conservation measures, to ensure there is an adequate supply of energy for the Armed Forces.  The reason I am bringing this issue up is I cannot imagine that someone would not want to support it. Right now we are, as we all know--you have heard me say this many times--56.6-percent dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our ability to fight a war. Roughly half of that comes from the Middle East and the largest, fastest growing contributor to energy, to oil that is imported by the United States, is Iraq.  So what we are saying is we are dependent upon Iraq for our ability to fight a war against Iraq. Now, that is insane.  The very least we can do is recognize that energy is a national defense issue. So I ask for the adoption of the amendment.
