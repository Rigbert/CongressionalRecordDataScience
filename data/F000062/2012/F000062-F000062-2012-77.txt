 President, I am in support of this resolution with Senator Boxer congratulating the Los Angeles Kings on their 2012 Stanley Cup Championship. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the players, staff, and fans for obtaining professional hockey's ultimate prize.  The Los Angeles Kings have won the Stanley Cup for the first time in the 45-year history of their franchise. Since 1967 the Kings have proudly represented the Los Angeles community with unwavering commitment. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
