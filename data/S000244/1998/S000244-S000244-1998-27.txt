Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon).  (Mr. McKEON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the impeachment of the President.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to echo the words of our forefathers who once held the highest office in our land. The advise that they have provided is among the best that our nation has ever received. I would like to share with you two phrases from our first two Presidents. I think they ring true today more than ever.  In his farewell address, President George Washington underscored the importance of having leaders tell the truth. He said, ``Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in the courts of justice?''  On his second night in the White House, John Adams wrote the following, ``I pray Heaven to Bestow the Best of Blessings on this House and on All that shall hereafter Inhabit it. May none but honest and Wise Men ever rule under this roof.''  In my opinion the issue of impeachment is simple: should we have two systems of justice, one for the President and one for everybody else? where is the fairness for the people who are convicted of perjury every year and sentenced to detention?  What a shame that today this Congress must revisit these issues because President Clinton failed to follow the advice of these very wise men. As I will be casting my vote to impeach on all four articles today, I will keep in mind these words. I will also keep in mind that the impact of my vote today will ring true to generations for years to come that perjury has no place in the highest office of the land.
