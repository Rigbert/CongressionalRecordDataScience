Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would note that at our very first hearing as chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, we talked about ``I Can'' and the various domain names that were out there. All of us jumped on the name of Dot Kids and how it could be protective of our kids. The stories we hear virtually every day, whether it be this morning, this young girl killed in Danbury, Connecticut, stories in our own districts across the country, we know that we need something that can protect our children from a nightmare that no family, no community ever wants to experience. I would reiterate that groups who spend literally every waking hour trying to protect families across this country, groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Family Research Council, American Center for Law and Justice, the National Law Center for Children and Families, a Safer America For Everyone, all of them as well as every parent that serves in this House, every Member of Congress that has watched some of this junk that has come in unasked for, we know that Dot Kids can be a savior for all of us. We compliment those Members of the Senate that are wishing to pursue this legislation. We look forward to when this can be enacted into law by President Bush. We know that the administration supports this legislation.
