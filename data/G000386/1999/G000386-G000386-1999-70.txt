 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:56 p.m., adjourned until Friday, November 12, 1999, at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
