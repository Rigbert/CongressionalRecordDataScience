 President, today I introduce legislation designed to provide a framework for joint congressional-executive decision-making about the most solemn decision that a nation can make: to send men and women to fight and die for their country.  Entitled the ``Use of Force Act,'' the legislation would replace the war powers resolution of 1973 with a new mechanism that, I hope, will be more effective than the existing statute.  Enacted nearly a quarter century ago, over the veto of President Nixon, the war powers resolution has enjoyed an unhappy fate--scorned by Presidents who questioned its constitutionality, and ignored by a Congress too timid to exercise its constitutional duty.  That was not, of course, the intent of its framers, who sought to improve executive-congressional cooperation on questions involving the use of force--and to remedy a dangerous constitutional imbalance.  This imbalance resulted from what I call the ``monarchist'' view of the war power--the thesis that the President holds nearly unlimited power to direct American forces into action.  The thesis is largely a product of the cold war and the nuclear age: the view that, at a time when the fate of the planet itself appeared to rest with two men thousands of miles apart, Congress had little choice, or so it was claimed but to cede tremendous authority to the executive.  This thesis first emerged in 1950, when President Truman sent forces to Korea without congressional authorization. It peaked twenty years later, in 1970, when President Nixon sent U.S. forces into Cambodia--also without congressional authorization, but this time accompanied by sweeping assertions of autonomous Presidential power.  President Nixon's theory was so extreme that it prompted the Senate to begin a search--a search led by Republican Jacob Javits and strongly supported by a conservative Democrat, John Stennis of Mississippi--for some means of rectifying the constitutional imbalance. That search culminated in the war powers resolution.  Unfortunately, the war powers resolution has failed to fulfill its objective. If anything, the monarchist view has become more deeply ingrained with the passage of time.  This trend was been on display throughout this decade. Before the gulf war, for example, with half a million American forces standing ready in Saudi Arabia--a situation clearly requiring congressional authorization--President Bush still refused to concede that he required an act of Congress before using force. Only at the last minute, and only grudgingly, did President Bush seek congressional support. Even then, he continued to assert that he sought only support, refusing to concede that congressional authorization was a legal necessity.  Several years ago, the notion of broad executive power was claimed on the eve of a proposed invasion of Haiti--an invasion that, thankfully, was averted by a last-minute diplomatic initiative.  In 1994, officials of the Clinton administration characterized the Haiti operation as a mere ``police action''--a semantic dodge designed to avoid congressional authorization--and a demonstration that the monarchist view prevails in the White House, without regard to political party.  And, most recently, the Clinton administration asserted that it had all the authority it needed to initiate a military attack against Iraq--though it never publicly elaborated on this supposed authority.  In this case, the question was not clear-cut--as it was in 1991. But two things emerged in the debate that reinforce the need for this legislation. First, it demonstrated that the executive instinct to find ``sufficient legal authority'' to use force is undiluted.  Second, it demonstrated that Congress often lacks the institutional will to carry out its responsibilities under the war power. Although there was strong consensus that a strong response was required to Saddam Hussein's resistance to U.N. inspections, there was no consensus in this body about whether Congress itself should authorize military action. Lacking such a consensus, Congress did nothing.  Congress' responsibilities could not be clearer. Article one, section eight, clause eleven of the Constitution grants to Congress the power ``to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal and to make rules concerning captures on land and water.''  To the President, the Constitution provides in article two, section two the role of ``Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.''  It may fairly be said that, with regard to many constitutional provisions, the Framers' intent was ambiguous. But on the war power, both the contemporaneous evidence and the early construction of these clauses do not leave much room for doubt.  The original draft of the Constitution would have given to Congress the power to ``make war.'' At the Constitutional Convention, a motion was made to change this to ``declare war.'' The reason for the change is instructive.  At the Convention, James Madison and Elbridge Gerry argued for the amendment solely in order to permit the President the power ``to repel sudden attacks.'' Just one delegate, Pierce Butler of South Carolina, suggested that the President should be given the power to initiate war.  The rationale for vesting the power to launch war in Congress was simple.The Framers' views were dominated by their experience with the British King, who had unfettered power to start wars. Such powers the Framers were determined to deny the President.  Even Alexander Hamilton, a staunch advocate of Presidential power, emphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be ``much inferior'' to the British King, amounting to ``nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces,'' while that of the British King ``extends to declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies--all which, by [the U.S.] Constitution, would appertain to the legislature.''  It is frequently contended by those who favor vast Presidential powers that Congress was granted only the ceremonial power to declare war. But the Framers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial aspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. As Hamilton noted in Federalist twenty-five, the ``ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.''  The conclusion that Congress was given the power to initiate all wars, except to repel attacks on the United States, is also strengthened in view of the second part of the war clause: the power to ``grant letters of marque and reprisal.''  An anachronism today, letters of marque and reprisal were licenses issued by governments empowering agents to seize enemy ships or take action on land short of all-out war. In essence, it was an eighteenth century version of what we now regarded as ``limited war'' or ``police actions.''  The framers undoubtedly knew that reprisals, or ``imperfect war,'' could lead to an all-out war. England, for example, had fought five wars between 1652 and 1756 which were preceded by public naval reprisals.  Surely, those who met at Philadelphia--all learned men--knew and understood this history. Given this, the only logical conclusion is that the framers intended to grant to Congress the power to initiate all hostilities, even limited wars.  In sum, to accept the proposition that the war power is merely ceremonial, or applies only to ``big wars,'' is to read much of the war clause out of the Constitution. Such a reading is supported neither by the plain language of the text, or the original intent of the framers.  Any doubt about the wisdom of relying on this interpretation of the intent of the framers is dispelled in view of the actions of early Presidents, early Congresses, and early Supreme Court decisions.  Our earliest Presidents were extremely cautious about encroaching on Congress' power under the war clause.  For example, in 1793, the first President, George Washington, stated that offensive operations against an indian tribe, the Creek Nation, depended on congressional action: ``The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the subject, and authorized such a measure.''  During the Presidency of John Adams, the United States engaged in an undeclared naval war with France. But it bears emphasis that these military engagements were clearly authorized by Congress by a series of incremental statutes.  The naval war with France also yielded three important Supreme Court decisions regarding the scope of the war power.  In 1799, Congress authorized the President to intercept any U.S. vessels headed to France. President Adams subsequently ordered the Navy to seize any ships traveling to or from France.  The Supreme Court declared the seizure of a U.S. vessel traveling from France to be illegal--thus ruling that Congress had the power not only to authorize limited war, and but also to limit Presidential power to take military action.  The court ruled in two other cases bearing on the question of limited war. Wars, the Court said, even if ``imperfect,'' are nonetheless wars. In still another case, Chief Justice Marshall opined that ``the whole powers of war [are] by the Constitution . . . vested in Congress . . . [which] may authorize general hostilities . . . or partial war.''  These precedents, and the historical record of actions taken by other early Presidents, have significantly more bearing on the meaning of the war clause than the modern era.  As Chief Justice Warren once wrote, ``The precedential value of [prior practice] tends to increase in proportion to the proximity'' to the constitutional convention.  Unfortunately, this constitutional history seems largely forgotten, and the doctrine of Presidential power that arose during the cold war remains in vogue.  To accept the status quo requires us to believe that the constitutional imbalance serves our nation well. But it can hardly be said that it does.  As matters now stand, Congress is denied its proper role in sharing in the decision to commit American troops, and the President is deprived of the consensus to help carry this policy through.  I believe that only by establishing an effective war powers mechanism can we ensure that both of these goals are met. The question then is this: How to revise the war powers resolution in a manner that gains bipartisan support--and support of the executive?  In the past two decades, a premise has gained wide acceptance that the war powers resolution is fatally flawed. Indeed, there are flaws in the resolution but they need not have been fatal.  In 1988, determining that a review of the war powers resolution was in order, the Foreign Relations Committee established a special subcommittee to assume the task.  As chairman of the subcommittee, I conducted extensive hearings. Over the course of two months, the subcommittee heard from many distinguished witnesses: former President Ford, former Secretaries of State and Defense, former Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Members of Congress who drafted the war powers resolution, and many constitutional scholars.  At the end of that process, I wrote a law review article describing how the war powers resolution might be thoroughly rewritten to overcome its actual and perceived liabilities.  That effort provided the foundation for the legislation I introduced in the 104th Congress, and that I reintroduce today. The bill has many elements; I will briefly summarize it.  First, the bill replaces the war powers resolution with a new version. But I should make clear that I retain its central element: a time-clock mechanism that limits the President's power to use force abroad. That mechanism, it bears emphasis, was found to be unambiguously constitutional in a 1980 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice.  It is often asserted that the time-clock provisions is ``unworkable,'' or that it invites our adversaries to make a conflict so painful in the short run so as to induce timidity in the Congress.  But with or without a war powers law, American willingness to undertake sustained hostilities will always be subject to democratic pressures. A statutory mechanism is simply a means of delineating procedure.  And the procedure set forth in this legislation assures that if the President wants an early congressional vote on a use of force abroad, his congressional supporters can produce it.  Recent history tells us, of course, that the American people, as well as Congress, rally around the flag--and the Commander-in-Chief--in the early moments of a military deployment.  Second, my bill defuses the specter that a ``timid Congress'' can simply sit on its hands and permit the authority for a deployment to expire.  First, it establishes elaborate expedited procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur. And it explicitly defeats the ``timid Congress'' specter by granting to the President the authority he has sought if these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote.  Thus, if the President requests authority for a sustained use of force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.  Third, the legislation delineates what I call the ``going in'' authorities for the President to use force. One fundamental weakness of the war powers resolution is that it fails to acknowledge powers that most scholars agree are inherent Presidential powers: to repel anarmed attack upon the United States or its Armed Forces, or to rescue Americans abroad.  My legislation corrects this deficiency by enumerating five instances where the President may use force:  (1) To repel attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;  (2) To deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. interests;  (3) To extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;  (4) To forestall or retaliate against specific acts of terrorism;  (5) To defend against substantial threats to international sea lanes or airspace;  It may be that no such enumeration can be exhaustive. But the circumstances set forth would have sanctioned virtually every use of force by the United States since World War Two.  This concession of authority is circumscribed by the maintenance of the time-clock provision.  After sixty days have passed, the President's authority would expire, unless one of three conditions had been met:  (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory authorization;  (2) The President has requested authority for an extended use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request, notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by this act:  (3) The President has certified the existence of an emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the United States.  The legislation also affirms the importance of consultation between the President and Congress and establishes a new means to facilitate it.  To overcome the common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535 Secretaries of State,'' the bill establishes a congressional leadership group with whom the President is mandated to consult on the use of force.  Another infirmity of the war powers resolution is that it fails to define ``hostilities.'' Thus, Presidents frequently engaged in a verbal gymnastics of insisting that ``hostilities'' were not ``imminent''--even when hundreds of thousands of troops were positioned in the Arabian desert opposite Saddam's legions.  Therefore, the legislation includes a more precise definition of what constitutes a ``use of force.''  Finally, to make the statutory mechanism complete, the use of force act provides a means for judicial review. Because I share the reluctance of many of my colleagues to inject the judiciary into decisions that should be made by the political branches, this provision is extremely limited. It empowers a three-judge panel to decide only whether the time-clock mechanism has been triggered.  The bill contains a provision granting standing to Members of Congress, a door that the Supreme Court appears to have largely closed in the case of Raines versus Byrd--the line-item veto challenge brought by the senior Senator from West Virginia. I believe, notwithstanding the holding of that case, that a Member of Congress would suffer the concrete injury necessary to satisfy the standing requirement under article three of the Constitution.  The reason is this: The failure of the President to submit a use of force report would harm the ability of a Member of Congress to exercise a power clearly reposed in Congress under article one, section eight. That injury, I believe, should suffice in clearing the high hurdle on standing which the Court imposed in the Byrd case. No private individual can bring such a suit; if a Member of Congress cannot, then no one can.  I have no illusions that enacting this legislation will be easy. But I am determined to try.  The status quo--with Presidents asserting broad executive power, and Congress often content to surrender its constitutional powers--does not serve the American people well.  More fundamentally, it does not serve the men and women who risk their lives to defend our interests. For that, ultimately, must be the test of any war powers law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Short Title. The title of the bill is the ``Use      of Force Act (UFA).''       Section 2. Table of Contents.       Section 3. Findings. This section sets forth three findings      regarding the need to provide a statutory framework to      facilitate joint decisionmaking between Congress and the      President regarding decisions to use force abroad.       Section 4. Statement of Purpose. The key phrase in this      section is ``confer and confirm Presidential authority.'' The      Use of Force Act is designed to bridge the long-standing--     and, for all practical purposes, unresolvable--dispute over      precisely what constitutes the President's ``inherent''      authority to use force. Whereas the War Powers Resolution      purported to delineate the President's constitutional      authority and to grant no more, the Use of Force Act sets      forth a range of authorities that are practical for the      modern age and sufficiently broad to subsume all presidential      authorities deemed ``inherent'' by any reasonable      constitutional interpretation.       Section 5. Definitions. This section defines a number of      terms, including the term ``use of force abroad,'' thus      correcting a major flaw of the War Powers Resolution, which      left undefined the term ``hostilities.''       As defined in the Use of Force Act, a ``use of force      abroad'' comprises two prongs:       (1) a deployment of U.S. armed forces (either a new      introduction of forces, a significant expansion of the U.S.      military presence in a country, or a commitment to a new      mission or objective); and       (2) the deployment is aimed at deterring an identified      threat, or the forces deployed are incurring or inflicting      casualties (or are operating with a substantial possibility      of incurring or inflicting casualties).                      title i--general provisions       Section 101. Authority and Governing Principles. This      section sets forth the Presidential authorities being      ``conferred and confirmed.'' Based on the Constitution and      this Act, the President may use force--       (1) to repel an attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;       (2) to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S.      interests;       (3) to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;       (4) to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of      terrorism;       (5) to defend against substantial threats to international      sea lanes or airspace.       Against a complaint that this list is excessively      permissive, it should be emphasized that these are the      President's initial authorities to undertake a use of force--     so-called ``going in'' authorities--and that the ``staying      in'' conditions set forth in section 104 will, in most cases,      bear heavily on the President's original decision.       Section 102. Consultation. Section 102 affirms the      importance of consultation between the President and Congress      and establishes new means to facilitate it. To overcome the      common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535      secretaries of state,'' the UFA establishes a Congressional      Leadership Group with whom the President is mandated to      consult on the use of force.       A framework of regular consultations between specified      Executive branch officials and relevant congressional      committees is also mandated in order to establish a ``norm''      of consultative interaction and in hope of overcoming what      many find to be the overly theatrical public-hearing process      that has superseded the more frank and informal consultations      of earlier years.       Note: An alternative to the Use of Force Act is to repeal      (or effectively repeal) the War Powers Resolution and leave      in its place only a Congressional Leadership Group. (This is      the essence of S.J. Res. 323, 100th Congress, legislation to      amend the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Byrd,      Warner, Nunn, and Mitchell in 1988.) This approach, which      relies on ``consultation and the Constitution,'' avoids the      complexities of enacting legislation such as the UFA but      fails to solve chronic problems of procedure or authority,      leaving matters of process and power to be debated anew as      each crisis arises. In contrast, the Use of Force Act would      perform one of the valuable functions of law, which is to      guide individual and institutional behavior.       Section 103. Reporting Requirements. Section 103 requires      that the President report in writing to the Congress      concerning any use of force, not later than 48 hours after      commencing a use of force abroad.       Section 104. Conditions for Extended Use of Force. Section      104 sets forth the ``staying in'' conditions: that is, the      conditions that must be met if the President is to sustain a      use of force he has begun under the authorities set forth in      section 101. A use of force may extend beyond 60 days only      if--       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory      authorization;       (2) the President has requested authority for an extended      use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request      (notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by      Title II of this Act);       (3) the President has certified the existence of an      emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the      United States.       The second and third conditions are designed to provide      sound means other than a declaration of war or the enactment      of specific statutory authority by which the President may      engage in an extended use of force.     Through these conditions, the Use of Force Act avoids two      principal criticisms of the War Powers Resolution: (1) that      Congress could irresponsibly require a force withdrawal      simply through inaction; and (2) that the law might, under      certain circumstances, unconstitutionally deny the President      the use of his ``inherent'' authority.       To defuse the specter of a President hamstrung by a      Congress too timid or inept to face its responsibilities, the      UFA uses two means: first, it establishes elaborate expedited      procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur; second,      it explicitly defeats the ``timid Congress'' specter by      granting to the President the authority he has sought if      these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote. Thus, if      the President requests authority for a sustained use of      force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails      to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.       The final condition should satisfy all but proponents of an      extreme ``monarchist'' interpretation under which the      President has the constitutional authority to use force as he      sees fit. Under all other interpretations, the concept of an      ``inherent'' authority depends upon the element of emergency:      the need for the President to act under urgent circumstances      to defend the nation's security and its citizens. If so, the      UFA protects any ``inherent'' presidential authority by      affirming his ability to act for up to 60 days under the      broad-ranging authorities in section 101 and, in the event he      is prepared to certify an extended national emergency, to      exercise the authority available to him through the final      condition of section 104.       Section 105. Measures Eligible for Congressional Priority      Procedures. This section establishes criteria by which joint      and concurrent resolutions become eligible for the expedited      procedures created by Title II of the UFA.       A joint resolution that declares war or provides specific      statutory authorization--or one that terminates, limits, or      prohibits a use of force--becomes eligible if it is      introduced: (1) pursuant to a written request by the      President to any one member of Congress; (2) if cosponsored      by a majority of the members of the Congressional Leadership      Group in the house where introduced; or (3) if cosponsored by      30 percent of the members of either house. Thus, there is      almost no conceivable instance in which a President can be      denied a prompt vote: he need only ask one member of Congress      to introduce a resolution on his behalf.       A concurrent resolution becomes eligible if it meets either      of the cosponsorship criteria cited above and contains a      finding that a use of force abroad began on a certain date,      or has exceeded the 60 day limitation, or has been undertaken      outside the authority provided by section 101, or is being      conducted in a manner inconsistent with the governing      principles set forth in section 101.       While having no direct legal effect, the passage of a      concurrent resolution under the UFA could have considerable      significance: politically, it would represent a clear,      prompt, and formal congressional repudiation of a      presidential action; within Congress, it would trigger      parliamentary rules blocking further consideration of      measures providing funds for the use of force in question (as      provided by section 106 of the UFA); and juridically, it      would become a consideration in any action brought by a      member of Congress for declaratory judgment and injunctive      relief (as envisaged by section 107 of the UFA).       Section 106. Funding Limitations. This section prohibits      the expenditure of funds for any use of force inconsistent      with the UFA. Further, this section exercises the power of      Congress to make its own rules by providing that a point of      order will lie against any measure containing funds to      perpetuate a use of force that Congress, by concurrent      resolution, has found to be illegitimate.       Section 107. Judicial Review. This section permits judicial      review of any action brought by a Member of Congress on the      grounds that the UFA has been violated. It does so by--       (1) granting standing to any Member of Congress who brings      suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia;       (2) providing that neither the District Court nor the      Supreme Court may refuse to make a determination on the      merits based on certain judicial doctrines, such as political      question or ripeness (doctrines invoked previously by courts      to avoid deciding cases regarding the war power);       (3) prescribing the judicial remedies available to the      District Court; and       (4) creating a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court      and encouraging expeditious consideration of such appeal.       It bears emphasis that the remedy prescribed is modest, and      does not risk unwarranted interference of the judicial branch      in a decision better reposed in the political branches. It      provides that the matter must be heard by a three-judge      panel; one of these judges must a circuit judge.      Additionally, the power of the court is extremely limited: it      may only declare that the 60-day period set forth in Section      104 has begun.       In 1997, the Supreme Court held, in Raines v. Byrd, that      Members of Congress did not have standing to challenge an      alleged constitutional violation under the Line-Item Veto      Act. That case might be read to suggest that a Member of      Congress can never attain standing. But such a conclusion      would be unwarranted. First, the Court made clear in Raines      that an explicit grant of authority to bring a suit      eliminates any ``prudential'' limitations on standing. Raines      v. Byrd, 521 U.S. ____, ____, n.3 (1997) (slip op., at 8,      n.3) Second, a more recent decision of the Court suggests      that a Member of Congress could attain ``constitutional      standing'' (that is, meet the ``case or controversy''      requirements of Article III) in just the sort of case      envisaged by the Use of Force Act. In Federal Election      Commission v. Akins, a case decided on June 1, 1998, the      Court permitted standing in a case where the plaintiffs      sought to require the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to      treat an organization as a ``political committee,'' which      then would have triggered public disclosure of certain      information about that organization. The Court held that      standing would be permitted where the plaintiff ``fails to      obtain information which must be publicly disclosed pursuant      to statute.'' A case under the Use of Force Act would be      analogous--in that the plaintiff Members of Congress would      seek information in a ``Use of Force Report'' required to be      submitted to Congress by Section 103(a). Such information,      quite obviously, would be essential to Members of Congress in      the exercise of their constitutional powers under the war      clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11),      a power they alone possess.       Section 108. Interpretation. This section clarifies several      points of interpretation, including these: that authority to      use force is not derived from other statutes or from treaties      (which create international obligations but not authority in      a domestic, constitutional context); and that the failure of      Congress to pass any joint or concurrent resolution      concerning a particular use of force may not be construed as      indicating congressional authorization or approval.       Section 109. Severability. This section stipulates that      certain sections of the UFA would be null and void, and      others not affected, if specified provisions of the UFA were      held by the Courts to be invalid.       Section 110. Repeal of War Powers Resolution. Section 110      repeals the War Powers Resolution of 1973.                     title ii--expedited procedures       Section 201. Priority Procedures. Section 201 provides for      the expedited parliamentary procedures that are integral to      the functioning of the Act. (These procedures are drawn from      the war powers legislation cited earlier, introduced by      Senator Robert Byrd et al. in 1988.)       Section 202. Repeal of Obsolete Expedited Procedures.      Section 202 repeals other expedited procedures provided for      in existing law.                                 ______                                       By
