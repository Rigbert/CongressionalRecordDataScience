 That goes beyond just a flooding situation; it is because of the catastrophic flooding throughout our State and to tell everybody that it is not over. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of significant spring flooding yet to come.  We are seeing increased flows in the Missouri River, the Mississippi River, and their tributaries. Iowans should review their insurance policies for gaps and consider flood insurance. That is one of the things Governor Reynolds is suggesting. Also, it would be good to have a plan in case it is necessary to evacuate, including important personal belongings and pets. FEMA's website, ready.gov, can help you with that information.  Iowans know severe weather, including massive snowstorms, flooding, tornadoes, and heavy winds. The key is that we prepare, help our neighbors, and stay vigilant.  I thank Governor Reynolds for alerting people to the future, as well as worrying about the past.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
