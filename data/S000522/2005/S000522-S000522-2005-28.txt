Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 294) calling on the international community to condemn the Laogai, the system of forced labor prison camps in the People's Republic of China, as a tool for suppression maintained by the Chinese Government, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 294       Whereas the Laogai is a vast prison labor system in the      People's Republic of China and consists of a network of more      than 1,000 prisons, camps, and mental institutions in which      detainees must work at factories, farms, mines, and other      facilities;       Whereas the two major aims of the Laogai are to generate      economic resources for the state through free labor and to      ``reform criminals'' through hard labor and political      indoctrination;       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China      relies on the Laogai as a tool for political suppression of      pro-democracy activists, Internet dissidents, labor      activists, and religious and spiritual believers, including      Han Chinese, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and ``house      church'' Christians;       Whereas, while the Soviet Gulags no longer exist, the      Chinese Laogai is still fully operational, subjecting most of      its three million prisoners to forced labor by threatening      torture;       Whereas fifty million people have suffered as prisoners in      the Laogai since its inception;       Whereas Laogai prisoners are deprived of religious freedom      and forced to give up their political views in order to      become a ``new socialist person'' and uphold communism and      the Chinese Communist Party;       Whereas in recent years, more than 100,000 religious      believers have been unjustly and illegally imprisoned in one      Laogai camp alone, where they have been beaten, tortured, and      often killed;       Whereas Laogai prisoners are forced to work long hours in      appalling conditions, including mining asbestos and other      toxic chemicals with no protective clothing, tanning hides      while standing naked in vats filled with chemicals used for      softening of animal skins, and working in mining facilities      where explosions and other accidents are a common occurrence;       Whereas it is documented that China's national policy since      1984 has been to extract organs from executed prisoners      without prior consent of the prisoners or their family      members, setting China apart from every other country in the      world;       Whereas there are more than 1,000 instances in which organs      are harvested from executed Chinese prisoners every year;       Whereas both Chinese and foreign patients from around the      world receive organs transplanted from executed Chinese      prisoners;       Whereas Laogai prisoners are required to make confessions      of their wrongdoings, which include political and religious      views that the Chinese Communist Party wishes to suppress;       Whereas Chinese citizens are not guaranteed due process of      law nor even a right to trial;       Whereas many individuals are often convicted and sentenced      with no trial at all, or they are convicted with ``evidence''      extracted through torture;       Whereas in one part of the Laogai system known as the      Laojiao, or reeducation-through-labor, Chinese citizens can      be detained for up to three years without any judicial review      or formal appearance in the judicial system;       Whereas goods produced by forced labor in the Laogai system      continue to be exported to the United States and the world;       Whereas the Chinese Government has continuously encouraged      the export of goods produced through the Laogai prison system      and relies on forced labor as an integral part of its      economy;       Whereas forced labor and torture practices carried out in      the Laogai violate international laws, standards, and      treaties to which China is party, including the United      Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,      and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman      or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and       Whereas China, a member State of the International Labor      Organization, also violates many agreements regarding labor      conditions and the rights of workers: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That Congress--       (1) calls on the international community to condemn the      Laogai, the system of forced labor prison camps in the      People's Republic of China, as a tool for suppression      maintained by the Chinese Government;       (2) calls on the Government of the United States to fully      implement United States laws that prohibit the importation of      forced labor products made in the Laogai;       (3) calls on the Government of the United States to take      actions to review the implementation of the Memorandum of      Understanding on Prison Labor in 1992 and the Statement of      Cooperation in 1994 with respect to the Laogai;       (4) will undertake efforts to join with the European      Parliament to urge the introduction of a resolution at the      United Nations Human Rights Commission condemning the Laogai      and the human rights situation in China;       (5) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of      China to release information about the Laogai, including the      total number of Laogai camps and prisoners throughout China,      the exact locations of the camps, and the business production      activities taking place at the camps;       (6) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of      China to release information about the number of executions      of prisoners at the camps that are carried out every year,      and the extent of the harvesting and transplantation of      organs of executed prisoners;       (7) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China      to allow unrestricted visits by international human rights      inspectors, including United Nations inspectors, to Laogai      camps throughout China; and       (8) urges the Congressional-Executive Commission on China      to continue to investigate the Laogai system in China and to      make recommendations for United States policy that will help      protect human rights for Chinese citizens.
