 General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be here, as we all know. This is an eagerly anticipated update on political and military progress being made in Iraq.  Less than a year after our counterinsurgency plan went into full effect, we have been getting a steady flow of positive reports on the security situation in Iraq. Overall violence in Iraq is down. Civilian deaths are down. Sectarian killing is down. Attacks on American forces are down. As a result, thousands of U.S. troops have already begun to come back home.  Another measure of the Petraeus plan's success is the dramatic increase in Iraqi security forces since the full implementation of the counterinsurgency strategy last June. Between December 2007 and last month, Iraqi security forces have increased by more than 40,000, bringing the total number to more than 530,000. This includes 141,000 assigned soldiers and officers and a police force of 347,000 strong. Over the last year, the so-called surge of Iraqi security forces has been three or four times larger than our own surge. As we stand here, the Iraqi security forces continue to expand, with young Iraqis signing up for local police forces to protect the border and for special operations.  As the Iraqis take over more of their own security needs, Congress can help by passing a supplemental appropriations bill that has been on request for more than a year.
