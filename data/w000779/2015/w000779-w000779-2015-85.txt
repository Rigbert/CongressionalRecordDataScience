President, 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court handed down a wonderful decision recognizing that all Americans have the right to marry the man or woman they love. It was a triumphant movement in the march toward justice, one I was happy to celebrate at home with a group of Oregonians who were truly elated. In my remarks that morning, I said: Love won and there is more to be done.  So, today, along with 36 colleagues, I am introducing the Equal Dignity for Married Taxpayers Act of 2015. What this legislation does is it removes each gender-specific reference to marriage from the Tax Code. Now, in his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy pointed out the importance of providing equal dignity in the eyes of the law.  Our legislation enshrines that equal dignity and respect in our Nation's tax laws by recognizing a new dawn of liberty for all Americans. In my view, on a more symbolic level, this legislation is one way to help close the door on an era when too many of our laws denied equality to the LGBTQ community. In my view, this is a particularly important step in the march toward justice. It is a straightforward way to cement the recognition that all Americans share certain unalienable rights--among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I was proud to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in the Congress 20 years ago and fight measure 36 a decade ago in Oregon. I have always said--always said--that if you don't like gay marriage, don't get one. This is fundamentally an issue of justice and of liberty. I hope all Americans take pride in the wave of acceptance and equality that has rolled across our land and this decision embodies.  This legislation now has 36 cosponsors. My hope is this body will support this proposal on a bipartisan basis. I look forward to working with our colleagues to take this next step. It is a step toward the arc of justice--the arc of justice that says that all of us--all of us--have to be free. All of us should enjoy true and full equality for all Americans. I am very pleased 36 colleagues are joining me in this proposal this morning. I hope the Senate will pass it expeditiously on a bipartisan basis.                                 ______                                       By
