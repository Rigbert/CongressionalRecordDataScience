 However, the House bill is now before us, which would extend the sunset of the FISA Amendments Act 5 years versus 2\1/2\ years in the Leahy Amendment. So, before us is the 5-year authorization period which the House has already passed. We have 4 days before the FISA Amendments Act essentially end. I cannot support that shorter time but I support the 5-year extension.
