 I look forward to hearing the two subsequent speeches that the Senator from South Carolina is going to make on the subject. No one better expresses in stronger and more persuasive terms what needs to be said in the wake of these tragedies than the Senator from South Carolina, and I congratulate him on his outstanding remarks.                          ____________________
