 President, I recognize and congratulate the following young men who recently achieved the rare and honored distinction of being presented the Eagle Scout Award. The wide range of knowledge that they have gained in earning this award reflects dedication and accomplishment in many different fields of human endeavor that will benefit the Council Bluffs, Iowa community in which they live.  These new Eagle Scouts include Joshua Reinders, son of Greg and Jackie Reinders; Paul McGrath, son of Ray and Marsha McGrath; Steven DeLong, son of Don and Melissa Delong; Gregory Versch, son of Mark and Rebecca Versch; and Roland Whitt, son of Tillman and Susan Whitt.  All of these young men and their families are to be commended for their community involvement and service.                          ____________________
