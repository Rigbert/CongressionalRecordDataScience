 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to correct serious problems with a law passed by this Congress at the beginning of last year. This law was intended to bypass environmental safeguards to speed up tree harvesting in national forests.  Mr. President, this law, commonly known as the salvage rider, has not worked. Instead, it has reopened old wounds in the Pacific Northwest, and sparked major controversy throughout the region. It has once again cast political uncertainty over working families, and blatantly cut regular people out of decisions over their own forests.  In short, what was billed as a commonsense approach to removing dead trees has turned out to be another case of legislative overkill on the environment.  Mr. President, it doesn't have to be this way. My bill will defuse a tense situation, provide certainty for workers, and restore a role for the public in forest management. Let me explain how.  The salvage rider has three problems: It allows large, old-growth timber sales previously declared illegal to be harvested without regard to fish and wildlife concerns; it could relegate the Northwest forest plan to the trash heap; and it cuts the public completely out of any final decision to harvest trees in national forests.  First, my bill resolves the old-growth issue by suspending timber sales commonly referred to as section 318 sales, and requiring the Forest Service to provide substitute timber volume or buy these sales back from the purchaser. In either case, the purchaser is held harmless, and so are the sensitive old-growth areas.  Second, my bill expedites implementation of the Northwest forest plan by making sure resources are available to complete recommended watershed analyses. The primary goal of this provision is to protect the scientific validity of option 9, so that timber sales can move ahead and private land owners can proceed with their habitat conservation plans.  This is a very important point: The State of Washington and every major timber land owner in the region are working on comprehensive habitat conservation plans. Every single one of these groups assume full implementation of option 9 as the basis of fish and wildlife protection in their own plans. If option 9 goes belly up, all of these habitat plans are worthless.  Third, my bill establishes a permanent, reasonable salvage program. The key work is permanent. I propose moving away from ad hoc forest planning by Congress, switching gears with every swing of the political pendulum. Instead, we should put a long-term program in place, something everyone can plan around, year in and year out.  Let me be very clear: This is not about salvage logging; this is about public input and accountability. Salvage logging is appropriate--and sometimes necessary--is done right. My bill sets up a program that allows the agencies to target salvage logging on an expedited basis when needed, under the full scrutiny of the public eye. If the agencies can defend their proposals, then they will go forward unimpeded.  Mr. President, I remember what it was like last spring. There was a new feeling in Congress; the people had called for change, so the leadership was running through bills left and right in the heat of the moment. A lot of things passed that might not have stood up under closer scrutiny, and this was one of them.  The irony here is thick: The salvage rider gave the Federal Government more power, and less accountability. As a result, the public has no say in how their own national forests are managed. I don't think the people wanted that kind of change.  People say this issue is too controversial to resolve, and that over the years it has become too polarized. To watch the debate, you might think that's true. Any person's idea is immediately rejected by someone else. And that may be the case with my bill. But if we keep rejecting everything, we will be left with nothing, except more chaos.  With all the controversy, people ask me, ``why bother?'' I'll tell you why: Because I care deeply about the Northwest. I care deeply about what government is saying to people about tough issues; more often than not, we're telling people that someone, somewhere, has to lose. That's not what I'm about. Most of all, I care deeply about the kind of legacy we're leaving for our children in this world.  We simply cannot continue the way of divide and conquer.  There are several ideas out there about how to proceed on this issue, from doing nothing at all, to repealing the salvage rider outright. My bill cuts a middle path. It says to workers: Salvage logging is something we should always be able to do. It says to conservationists: You will have an opportunity to hold the administration to its word. It says to large landowners: Your habitat planning efforts will pay off.  In my view, people ought to be willing to settle for this as a responsible approach.  Mr. President, I intend to pursue this matter on the continuing resolution when it comes before the full Senate. It is my understanding that the CR will contain limited language on this issue, but I do not believe it will solve the problem. I look forward to working with my colleagues.  Mr. President, I would also like to explain further some of the concepts contained in this bill.      replacement volume for section 2001(k) Sales, Section 102(b)  The Secretary and contract holder/sale purchaser should immediately begin negotiations to locate alternative volume agreeable to both parties. Because these purchasers have owned these contracts for half a decade, the Secretary should make every effort to find and plan environmentally sound timber sales or modifications of the existing sale. The Secretary should direct agency personnel to make substitute volume a priority.  New sales or modifications of existing sales must comply with all applicable law, forest and regional plans, and standards and guidelines. Specifically, they must comply with the Northwest forest plan and, when developed, the plan--or plans--implementing the Interior Columbia Basin ecosystem management project. Furthermore, they must comply with Forest Service and BLM standards and guidelines, including PACFISH, INFISH, and Eastside screens.                   bidding rights, section 102(c)(2)  This bill contains provisions allowing for purchasers holding timber sale contracts for sales that do not comply with environmental or natural resource laws to exchange the value of those contracts for bidding credits. Such a concept has operated for mineral rights in at least two other natural resource laws--see Public Law 97-466, 96 Stat. 2540; and Public Law 96-401, 94 Stat. 1702.  This bill authorizes monetary credits based on the negotiated value of the purchaser's timber sale contract. The bidding credits extend to the purchaser and his or her successors and assigns to use in whole or part payment for future timber sales on Forest Service sales where the credits originated therefrom or on Bureau of Land Management sales, where the credits originated therefrom.        salvage sales initiated under the rider, section 103(a)  Sales initiated under section 2001 (b) or (d) are all those begun since passage of the Emergency Timber Salvage Act, on July 27, 1995. Title III of this bill applies to sales where its provisions are timely. For example, if a sale has been advertised, this law does not require the agency to host an interdisciplinary team meeting with public participation. All sales that have not been awarded are subject to appeal under the provision of title III.            appeal of awarded salvage sales, section 103(b)  In section 103(b), I address sales that have been awarded to timber sale purchasers under the salvage and Northwest forest plan provisions of the rescissions bill. I give the public an opportunity to appeal immediately and thereby suspend sales that are causing environmental damage. The administration insists that it is complying with all environmental laws, and I want to give the public an opportunity to prove that is the case.  However, the agencies were required by the law at the time these sales were awarded--section 2001 of Public Law 104-19--to take procedural short cuts. I do not believe the purchasers should be denied their contract rights while the public challenges the agencies for obeying the law's procedural timelines. On the other hand, I do not want any sales that cause environmental harm to go forward. Thus, I try to strike a balance between these competing needs by limiting appeals to substantive complaints.  I understand that often substantive claims are raised in the context of procedural laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act. Some courts have suggested that NEPA is a purely procedural statute. The term ``procedural'' in this bill is not meant to eliminate claims regarding environmental harm, even if they could be characterized as a purely procedural challenge. Let me give some examples.  Where an agency had documentation in which a biologist recommended a sale not go forward, but the agency allowed the sale to be awarded to a purchaser, then such documentation could be the basis for an appeal and would not be considered a procedural challenge. Another example would be where the agency went forward with a sale prior to obtaining the concurrence from the National Marine Fisheries Service or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding whether an activity will or will not jeopardize a species under the Endangered Species Act. This should not be characterized as a procedural challenge. A final example would be that section 2001 of Public Law 109-14 required the agencies to, in their discretion, file only environmental assessments, not environmental impact statements. Because both EA's and EIS's should disclose the effects of a sale on the environment, a challenge could not be made simply because the agency published such information in an EA, rather than an EIS. However, if the documentation, no matter what its title, failed to disclose the effects on the environment, it would be open to challenge.              Funding to Implement Title III, Section 304  In this bill, the agencies are given discretion at the forest supervisor's and district manager's levels to combine several funds and accounts to implement this bill. The intent is to provide adequate funds for such activities as salvage timber sales, stewardship programs, watershed restoration, including road decommission, and data inventory and collection. This fund may not be used to carry out any activities that violate the forest plans, agency standards and guidelines, or the intent of this bill. This flexibility of funding will allow the agency to address critical salvage situations, correct an apparent agencywide problem with inadequate inventory of forest resources, and address a backlog of stewardship and restoration projects.           Pilot Program for Harvest Contracting, Section 306  The legislation authorizes a pilot program to change the way salvage timber sales are undertaken on Forest Service and BLM lands. The Forest Service currently sells timber by planning and preparing the sale, offering the sale to bidders, and administering the timber harvest. Harvest contracting or stewardship contracting is an alternative to the current method, entailing a two-step process: A timber harvest contract or contracts to cut and remove wood, and log sales from the collected and sorted wood.  There are several advantages to harvest contracting, including allowing the agencies to better implement ecosystem management, providing an opportunity to improve tree health without a large component of merchandise timber, eliminating below-cost timber sales, and reducing timber theft.  Specifically, harvest contracting would improve ecosystem management by basing contracts on the work performed and the resulting conditions of the forest. This would eliminate incentives for purchasers to inappropriately harvest large, lucrative trees. This pilot project encourages harvest so smaller, less valuable trees that have proliferated in many years of the West due to fire suppression and historic timber practices, such as highgrading. These young, dense stands are expensive to harvest, but many scientists believe it is important to remove them in order to restore health to timber stands.  The primary financial benefit is that gross timber sale revenues would be substantially higher because purchasers would not have road construction or logging costs--they would simply buy the wood from the log yard. Because the agencies may not be as efficient as a private enterprise, the agencies should consider contracting the log marketing business to a private business.  A secondary financial benefit would be the elimination of many opportunities for timber sale fraud and theft. Under harvest contracting, the scaling system would be eliminated and the contractor would not benefit from cutting trees designated to be left standing because of the fixed contract price and, in fact, might be penalized for not performing to contract specifications. That is why the bill contains a provision limiting the ability of the contractor who performs the contract from also selling the harvested wood.  Finally, this pilot project should benefit timber workers in several ways. First, salvage timber sales or thinning sales that were previously uneconomical to harvest would be offered, providing jobs for loggers and other resource experts. Second, timber companies would be purchasing wood after seeing its quality and knowing the exact board footage, rather than hypothesizing about the quantity of wood contained in a standing timber sale and not knowing how weather or timber markets might affect the ability to harvest or make a profit from the wood. Third, companies would not be subject to changes or delays in ability to harvest based on legal or political changes as they held long-term timber sale contracts; they would simply purchase wood.  While harvest contracting appears to offer many benefits from many different aspects, it remains untested on a large scale. This bill requires the Forest Service and BLM to establish pilot programs. This should provide guidance as to the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of the concept.  In addition, Senator Max Baucus has introduced a bill, S. 1259, that also establishes a demonstration program to use stewardship contracting. The concepts contained in this bill were developed by a group of conservationists, forest product industry representatives, and community leaders. This should also offer guidance as how to implement this pilot program.                   Forest Timber Stand Study Title IV  The Forest Service has initiated a similar study to that required in this bill. The Western Forest Health Initiative should be used as a foundation for the requirements of this bill. There is no need for the agencies to be duplicative, rather this bill's provisions should be supplemental to the work done in the WFHI.                      Collaborative Decisionmaking  Early drafts of this bill included use of collaborative decisionmaking. The concept was dropped from the bill because it was too difficult to described in legislative language. However, this decisionmaking process was very effective when it was used to plan and develop timber salvage sales after the wildfires of 1994 on the Wenatchee National Forest. The process was developed by Steve Daniels and Gregg Walker, of Oregon State University, as a tool to support ecosystem-based management of forest.  Collaborative learning is a framework designed for natural resource management situations that have the following features: Multiple parties and issues, deeply held values and cultural difference, scientific and technical uncertainty, and legal and jurisdictional constraints. The key notions that define collaborative learning are: Redefining the task away from solving a problem to one of improving a situation; viewing the situation as a set of interrelated systems; defining improvement as desirable and feasible change;recognizing that considerable learning about science, issues and value differences--will have to occur before implementable improvements are possible; and promoting working through the issues and perspectives of the situation.  Because of its success on the Wenatchee National Forest, I recommend the agencies consider use of collaborative decisionmaking procedures to increase valuable and productive participation by various interest parties.                                 ______      By Mr. D'AMATO:  S.J. Res. 50. A joint resolution to disapprove the certification of the President under section 490(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 regarding foreign assistance for Mexico during fiscal year 1996; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.                 CERTIFICATION DISAPPROVAL LEGISLATION  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution that disapproves of the administration's certification of Mexico. I am joined by my colleagues Senator Helms, Senator McConnell, and Senator Pressler in presenting this resolution and urge its immediate passage.  As a result of the amount of drugs that are found to have come into the United States through Mexico, we know that Mexico has failed to stem the international drug trade. If this administration does not want to recognize Mexico's failure, then it is up to Congress to do so. I will speak on this issue in more detail tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 50       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That pursuant      to subsection (d) of section 490 of the Foreign Assistance      Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291j), Congress disapproves the      determination of the President with respect to Mexico for      fiscal year 1996 that is contained in the certification      (transmittal no.   ) submitted to Congress by the President      under subsection (b) of that section on     , 1996.                          ____________________
