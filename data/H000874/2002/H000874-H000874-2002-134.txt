Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.  I am going to support the underlying bill, as I know the ranking member and certainly the chairman will. I will speak at greater lengths on the substance of the bill, which is excellent, and I appreciate the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor) working with us.  Mr. Speaker, we are in an environment that is very dangerous. It is an environment in which secrecy in the marketplace has undermined the confidence of investors. It has undermined the confidence of the investors to the extent that the market has plummeted, and millions of people have lost very substantial amounts in their 401(k)s, their Keoughs, and other savings plans.  One might say, well, that is interesting. What does it have to do with this bill? What it has to do with this bill is that we ought to be in an environment of making sure that investors, in this case taxpayers who invest in America, know what is happening with their tax dollars, and know what is happening with those around them in terms of contributing to the war on terrorism, to homeland security, to education, to health care, to the welfare and greatness of this Nation. Thatis what the Moran amendment seeks to do.  Very frankly, self-respect, if nothing else, should compel us to adopt the Moran amendment. Self-respect to the extent that the House says to one of its committees, produce a report, in this case, the Republican chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, not a Democrat. Notwithstanding that request, and notwithstanding the fact that the Joint Committee on Taxation conducted a study about tax absconders, tax dodgers, that report is being kept secret.  Mr. Speaker, we ought to oppose this rule and put the Moran amendment back in this bill.
