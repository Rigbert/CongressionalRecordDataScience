President, I thank the ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, as well as Senator Reid of Nevada, for coming to the floor today to discuss the agenda of Congress. It is worthy of reflection.  Some of us went home last week after the vote dispirited because this administration was afraid to offer the Iraq reconstruction package as an up-or-down vote. They believed--and I think they were right--they couldn't pass it. So many Members of Congress had so many questions and reservations, the only way it could pass was to combine it with the money for our troops. Many of us, looking at this terrible Faustian bargain, had to vote for the bill to support the troops, believing that, frankly, if it were my child, someone near or dear to my family, as it is for so many people in Illinois, I wouldn't want to shortchange the troops one penny. So we ended up passing about $15 or $16 billion in reconstruction for Iraq.  Trust me, stories are already pouring in about some of the questionable contracting that is going on over there. There is real doubt among some as to whether this money will achieve the goal we are seeking. We want peace in Iraq. We want stability. We want our troops to come home. But we want to do it in the right way.  So far, this administration, since the declaration of the military victory, has seen a long string of embarrassments and defeats and setbacks. There have been pretty pictures painted by some on the other side who have gone there, but they can't overcome the reality of every morning's newscast which tells about another soldier being killed or another 10 soldiers being maimed.  I have visited with some of those soldiers who have returned from Iraq. Their lives will never be the same. To say they got by because they were simply wounded is to overlook the obvious. Many of them will carry scars for the rest of their lives because of a policy of this administration which, frankly, has not stood the test of time.  The reason I think it is important to reflect on that is to consider where we are today. Now that we have moved from the issue of Iraq, we are back on an issue which is near and dear to the Republican leadership in Congress as well as to the White House. Take a look at the agenda of this Congress and particularly what we are discussing today. It is an agenda which attempts to slow down the legitimate responsibilities of government directly through Executive orders and indirectly with historic deficits.  Yes, this fiscal conservative, compassionate Republican President has stood by and watched as we have reached record depths in terms of debt in America. Although he can point to a recession which he blames on the previous President, which is fair game in Washington, he can point to a war on terrorism, the fact is, most of this deficit is his own creation.  President Bush's tax policy, his economic plan has been a failure for America's economy. But it has been a dramatic success for those who were praying for a bigger deficit. I don't know who that might be, but if you were looking for a President to deliver the biggest deficit in the history of the United States, this President has done it. That deficit, of course, shortchanges us when we need to really pursue the valuable and vital functions of government.  There are some things which only government can do. I know my friends from the conservative side of the political spectrum hate to concede this point, but there are certain things only government can do. Certainly military defense is one. Defense against terrorism is another. But there are others, and they will come to our attention as we consider the debate before us on a bill related to class action lawsuits.  The agenda of the Republicans in Congress and the President is one that is guided by the naive belief that the balance of power within our Government is outdated. It is an agenda which would close the courthouse doors to ordinary Americans in the name of penalizing trial lawyers but continue to protect the most politically powerful. This is nothing new in government. The people who have the power to line the Halls of Congress with their lobbyists in their three-piece suits and fancy shoes are well represented. They are the voices you hear when you come to vote for a bill.  The voices that are not heard are those of consumers and families and working people who are disadvantaged time and again by these special interests. The Class Action Fairness Act is a special interest piece of legislation designed exclusively to protect those who are wealthy and powerful from even being held accountable in court.  When you look at the options available to us, if you have a President who really doesn't care to work for consumers and working families, and a Government which is unresponsive because of that President or the lack of funds, and a Congress unwilling to address these same issues, there is only one place for an American to turn. That is the court system. So what this Congress tries to do time and time again is to close the doors of the courthouse so that that family, that consumer, that small business, that individual doesn't have a chance to go into the courthouse and ask for justice. They are doing that with this class action bill.  Whether the agenda is driven by the White House, the leadership of the House of Representatives, the committees on the floor of the Senate, the notso invisible hand of the right-wing agenda is busily at work. We see it in the nominees sent up for lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary, men and women who are not even close to the center stripe of political thinking, in the hopes that if you cannot close the courthouse door, make sure there is a judge on the bench who will rule consistently on behalf of the wealthy and powerful in America.  Some will say what I am saying sounds a lot like class warfare. I can recall what Warren Buffet, one of the wealthiest men in America, told us a few weeks ago. He came to a luncheon on Capitol Hill and spoke to a group of Senators and talked about President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. This wealthy man from Omaha, NE, said, ``Some people say this is class warfare.'' He said, ``I want to tell you something. It is true, and my class is winning the war.''  That is a fact. They have won the war with the President's tax cuts. They will continue to win the war when it comes to closing the courthouse doors. The agenda is being driven by President Bush and his gang of compassionate conservatives. It is not just this issue of litigation and tort reform. It stretches in so many directions. This is an administration that wants to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge rather than to demand that automobile manufacturers in Detroit make more fuel-efficient cars, which they can do. The technology is available. But this administration would much rather invade a pristine wildlife refuge set aside by President Eisenhower 50 years ago than pick up the phone and say to the Big Three in Detroit that you have to do better. We need more fuel-efficient cars and we are going to support legislation to make it happen.  That shows you where they are coming from. They would much rather drill in a wildlife refuge than to ask for more fuel efficiency from the automobile manufacturers. This is an administration that cuts education funding for schoolchildren to pay for tax benefits for the wealthiest people in America. It is an administration that would restrict background checks on gun purchasers while protecting gun manufacturers from liabilities. Rather than to make certain that we keep guns out of the hands of people with criminal records or a history of mental illness, they say instead, in the name of a second amendment, we cannot ask those questions and, if we do, we cannot keep the records long enough for law enforcement to use them. It is a constitutional right as far as they are concerned under the second amendment.  Yet when it comes to gun manufacturers making defective products and dangerous products and selling them, this administration falls over backward in an effort to protect them from any liability in court, this administration which would cap the compensation of injured victims of medical negligence, medical malpractice, and never question the insurance companies that continually make mistakes and charge the most outrageous premiums. Now we are forced to debate a bill that divides instead of unifies us.  It is especially troubling at a time when so many appropriations bills have not even been considered in the Senate and we are going to work on this bill for special interest groups. The majority leader brought this bill before us instead of an appropriations bill. Here we are after October 1, at a time when we should have passed all of our appropriations bills, but instead of addressing the immediate needs of Government, we are going to address the immediate needs of the special interest groups.  I find it interesting that the bill before us is not the bill that passed the Judiciary Committee, which I served on a little earlier this year. There is a provision back in the bill called a mass tort provision. I will not go into all the details of it other than to tell you the special interests have won again. There was a bipartisan motion in the Judiciary Committee--I am not sure there was debate--to delete a section of the bill for so-called mass tort actions. It was a motion by Senator Specter, a Republican, and Senator Feinstein, a Democrat. It was removed without controversy.  Guess what happened. That bill was thrown away. The bill before us today reinstates this prohibition against mass tort actions. That is fundamentally unfair, and we knew that. The special interest groups prevailed again.  How fair is the Class Action Fairness Act before us? It is not about fairness or justice. It is about protecting the powerful against legal challenges from the little guy. Who wants this bill? Who wants this class action bill? I will tell you those who line up on the side of this bill. It is the major tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, which is sick and tired of being sued by those who have been damaged by their deadly tobacco products. They have come to the Republican Congress and prevailed on them to make it more difficult for the victims of those tobacco products to come to court. So the tobacco companies want this bill to pass. Gun manufacturers, understanding their exposure to liability by selling defective guns, selling them in quantities where they knew or should have known they would fall in the hands of criminals, don't want to be sued in court anymore. Even though the death rate in America--on the streets of Chicago, New York, and Washington--continues to climb from gun murders, this bill says the victims are going to have a tougher time suing the gun manufacturers.  Those who pollute want this bill. Those involved in environmental pollution are less likely to be sued because of this bill.  Others include the pharmaceutical companies, every insurance company in America that I know of, the National Association of Manufacturers, and Financial Services Roundtable. The list of special interest groups is very lengthy.  There is another group on the other side who oppose this bill--an interesting coalition. Listen to those who have come out in opposition to the bill. The first name on the list may be the most curious. It is Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist. Why? Because this bill shifts a lot of class action lawsuits from State courts to Federal courts. Chief Justice Rehnquist understands that the Federal courts are not in a position to deal with these lawsuits. He said this is a bad bill; it is bad for the administration of justice in America. He is not a bleeding heart when it comes to consumer cases. His precedents and rulings will speak for themselves. But he says this bill is bad, and he is right.  Then the list of organizations--which I will not read--is two pages long. These groups are a clear indication of why it should not be passed. I will say generically that many of the leading medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, the Heart and Lung Society, many leading environmental groups in America, and almost every one of the major consumer groups in America, say this is a bad bill. It will keep ordinary Americans from having their day in court.  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.
