 Herman Dillon, Sr., who passed away on Friday, May 23, 2014. Mr. Dillon, Senior was the tribal council chairman of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians in my home State of Washington and at the time of his passing had dedicated an astounding 35 years to the tribal council.  Mr. Dillon, Senior served his tribe and his country throughout his life. He joined the Navy Reserves at 17, at the tail end of World War II. Following 4 years in the Navy Reserves, he was drafted by the Army and served for 2 years guarding the port and prisoner of war camps in Puson during the Korean war. Of course, his life of service did not end there, and he was first elected to the Puyallup Tribal Council in 1971. In the time since he was first elected to the tribal council, Mr. Dillon, Senior experienced a number of historical changes. He saw his fellow tribal members get arrested for exercising their treaty-protected right to fish in the Puyallup River, and on February 12, 1974, Judge Boldt of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a decision affirming the rights of Washington treaty tribes to take up to half of the harvestable fish in Washington State fishing waters. Of course, he also served on the tribal council as the tribe experienced a time of great economic development and diversification of their business interests in an effort to set themselves on a path to economic sustainability.  I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Dillon, Senior throughout my time in the Senate. I was always impressed by his leadership, integrity, and dedication to the Puyallup people. He was their champion on issues from health care to the construction of a new tribal justice center. He also led by example, earning his GED when he was 50 years old and fostering children in his home. Even into his ninth decade of life, Mr. Dillon, Senior continued to advocate for his tribal community and was dedicated to solutions that would help his Tribe better themselves.  Washington State and our country lost a great tribal leader in May, and I am grateful I had the opportunity to work with Mr. Dillon, Senior and advocate on the Puyallup Tribe's behalf in Washington, DC. My thoughts are with Darlene Dillon, Mr. Dillon, Senior's, wife of over 40 years, his 12 children, the children whose lives he changed through fostering, his entire extended family, and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians. We are all better for having known him and will work to carry his legacy forward.                          ____________________
