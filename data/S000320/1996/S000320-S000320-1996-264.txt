 President, I understand the committee has included $6 million in the transportation appropriations bill for the development of vessel traffic service systems or VTS systems by the Coast Guard. I wanted to briefly ask the chairman whether it is the intent of the committee's report language that the Coast Guard undertake a review of this system, including the costs associated with implementing the program, before proceeding with their plans to install these systems in various ports around the country, including Mobile, AL.  The GAO report that the committee refers to in its report identified serious underestimations of the cost of the VTS 2000 program. I continue to have serious reservations about this system and the Coast Guard's current plan for its implementation and use. It would appear that the GAO has raised many important issues that need to be resolved before the Coast Guard proceeds in the implementation of this program. It is the intent of the committee that such a review take place by the Coast Guard before it proceeds with the VTS program?
