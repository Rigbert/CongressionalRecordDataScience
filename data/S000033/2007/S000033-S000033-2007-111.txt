 I was going to say that if there was a substantive debate, we are prepared to offer several second-degree amendments. I hope I don't have to do that because I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that we are dealing with higher education now, a very important issue, and I think we should keep it clean and move forward. But if something else evolves, we are prepared to offer several second-degree amendments.
