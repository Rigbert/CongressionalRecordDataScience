 President, it is crucial that we never forget to honor our veterans for their service and dedication to this nation. As the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I would like to recognize and applaud the service of Mr. Francis James Walton and Mrs. Jessie Ruth Walton, both of whom served our Nation during World War II and turn 90 years old this year.  Mrs. Jessie Ruth Walton was born in Exeter, VA, on May 31, 1921. Heeding the call to service, she enlisted in the Navy WAVES in 1943 and went on to serve her country during World War II as a pharmacist, dispensing needed medicine for the troops in Washington, DC, and in Long Beach, CA.  Mr. James Walton, Jessie's husband, was born in Cadillac, MI, on July 14, 1921. He enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 1941. He served in Carlson's Raiders of the 2d Marine Battalion, an elite unit that was among the first U.S. special operations forces to see combat in World War II. Jim's time in the Marines included deployment to the South Pacific, where he fought in Bougainville and Guadalcanal Island, contributing to a strategic victory that turned the tide for the Allied forces in the Pacific. A valiant warrior, he spent 30 days fighting behind enemy lines, 30 days that must have felt a lifetime.  Following World War II, Jim returned to Michigan, where he obtained a college degree and married Jessie Ruth Meade. After his time in the service, Jim began teaching and ultimately found a rewarding career at General Motors, where he worked for 30 years before retiring. Together, Jim and Jessie raised a family of four children--James, Susan, Julie, and Jane--who have picked up the mantle of their parents in service to their communities in a range of capacities. In particular, I am delighted to note that their son Jim serves as president of Centralia College in my home State of Washington. Mr. and Mrs. Walton are also fortunate to have 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.  I am delighted to extend birthday wishes and gratitude to the Waltons on this joyous occasion. I wish them and their family all the best as they celebrate this wonderful milestone.                          ____________________
