 He is absolutely right. I know the three of us and many others have been trying to focus this Congress on the issue of corporate welfare. When most Americans think about welfare, they say, my money is going to those poor people. Wake up. More money is going to the rich and to large corporations in terms of Federal subsidies and tax breaks than are going to the poor people.  I know Mr. Owens worked on the issue of corporate welfare. I know you have some thoughts on it. Would you share some of those?
