 BROWNBACK. The effective date of the placed-in-service-extension, section 336 of the conference report, states that the amendments ``shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by section 101 of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.'' I believe that this means only that, if a purchaser orders a plane for delivery in 2005, the limitations on the amount of the deposit, time for construction and purchase price must be met. It does not mean that taxpayers who did not or will not take delivery and place the aircraft in service after December 31, 2004, would retroactively be subjected to these limitations. The limitations apply only if a taxpayer wishes to take advantage of the extended placed-in service period. Does the Chairman agree with this interpretation?
