President, as I stated earlier, I think there was general agreement among the body that we wanted to find a way to approach what many see as a problem on the Internet. We had different ways of approaching it. I note that only because those who supported the underlying amendment were trying to find the most constitutional way of doing it. It was not a case of anybody--anybody--in this body being in favor of providing pornography to children, it simply should go without saying, but so there will not be any mistake on that point.  Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Louisiana. He has an amendment on behalf of the two of us.                           Amendment No. 1421
