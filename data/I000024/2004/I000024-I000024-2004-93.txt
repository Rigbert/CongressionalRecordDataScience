President, I stand here today in memory of a courageous young American who gave his life for freedom. He gave his life for the people of Iraq, he gave it for his fellow Americans, and he gave it especially for those he loved. SGT Kyle Brinlee at the age of 21 gave up his life for the sake of others, and for his service and his sacrifice, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.  SGT Kyle A. Brinlee of Pryor, OK, was deployed from Fort Sill and served as a masonry and carpentry specialist with the 120th Combat Engineering Battalion in Iraq. When he went to Iraq in February, he left the familiar comfort of Pryor, OK, for the unknown hostility of the Middle East. He left his family, friends, and neighbors, expecting to be home within 6 months or a year at the most. Only 3 months passed before these same people lined the streets of Pryor as his funeral procession passed.  On May 11, near Alasad, Iraq, an explosive device destroyed the vehicle in which Kyle Brinlee was riding. He died while securing the freedom of millions of Americans, while trying to secure a chance of that freedom for the Iraqi people.  Sergeant Brinlee, the first Oklahoma guardsman to give his life in Iraq, was eulogized in May in front of a crowd of 1,300 people at the Pryor High School auditorium. Kyle was remembered as an outstanding soldier, a morale builder who was always willing to be the first to volunteer, and as someone who all will miss. After his death, the National Guard awarded Kyle the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He has also earned my admiration and prayers and those of many other Americans. His choice was that of a true hero: He endangered his own life for the sake of something greater, and that courage to act for the good of all will mark his legacy forever.  Sergeant Brinlee stands as a true example of bravery. He knew of the dangers that awaited him. He knew he might never have another opportunity to see his family, but he also knew his mission. He knew that American freedom does not come from the complaints of the many but from the sacrifices of the few. SGT Kyle Brinlee was man enough to be counted amongst those noble few. Kyle Brinlee was a true American hero.  Mr. President, on each trip I take overseas as one of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the message I get back from the troops in the field is always the same: Why is it that people in America do not understand what we are doing? I think the media has done a lousy job, distorting the true reality of the freedoms that are taking place in Iraq, of all the good things that are happening over there.  I hear from these brave young troops. They know what their mission is. They know America is in its most threatened position today. They know they are risking their lives, yet they are willing to do it. Certainly SGT Kyle Brinlee is one of those, a very good, heroic example.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
