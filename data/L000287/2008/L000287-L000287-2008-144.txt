Madam Speaker, today I rise to introduce the Civil Rights Act of 2008. This legislation will keep the promise of equality that this Congress has made in passing our civil rights laws and ensure that discriminators are held accountable for their actions. Over the years, Congress has addressed some of our most pressing civil rights concerns by passing bipartisan legislation, legislation that protects American workers from discrimination on the basis of color, race, religion, age, disability, and sex. Our civil rights laws have strengthened our country, providing opportunity to those who had been denied opportunity and affording the Nation the benefit of abilities that would have otherwise been wasted. They have brought us closer to the beloved community where all people are able to succeed based on their abilities.  Unfortunately, over the years, the Supreme Court has weakened some of these basic protections in ways that Congress never intended. They have undermined the protections for workers, for older Americans, for the disabled, for racial and ethnic minorities, for women, and for those in the military. So today, I join Senator Edward Kennedy in introducing the Civil Rights Act of 2008 to restore workers' rights and strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to the promise of equal opportunity. The bill corrects the misinterpretations of our civil rights laws that have left too many American workers without a remedy when they have suffered discrimination.  The relationship between workers and civil rights in America runs wide and deep. It was the laborers--the sharecroppers, the sanitation workers, the teachers, the students, the construction workers, and the street sweepers--who tore down the walls of racial segregation in the South. It is these ordinary men and women with extraordinary vision who have sacrificed their lives in confrontations throughout American history to help build this democracy. We cannot stand by and let their hard-earned victories be erased.  This bill better protects workers from discrimination in agencies that receive Federal money, defends students against harassment, fortifies civil rights for State employees, and prevents employers from forcing workers to give up their right to a day in court. It also ensures remedies for undocumented workers who are victims of unfair labor practices. It restores the individual right to challenge practices that have an unjustified discriminatory effect based on race, color, national origin, disability, age, or gender. It ensures that members of the Armed Forces who work for State governments are protected from discrimination.  If you work for a State government, you should have the same protections from discrimination as a person working in private industry--but the courts didn't see it that way. Students who are victims of sexual harassment shouldn't have to meet a higher standard of proof than their teachers--but the courts didn't see it that way. Members of the uniformed services should be able to get relief if they are discriminated against while they are on active military duty, whether they are employees of State governments or the private industry--but the courts didn't see it that way.  The struggle for civil rights is beyond one bill, one vote, or one judicial decision. It's beyond one Presidential term or act of Congress. Ours is the struggle of a lifetime, and each generation, each citizen, each president and each member of Congress must do his or her part. Together all of our efforts comprise the struggle of a nation to build the beloved community, a nation at peace with itself and its own ideals. This bill is just another step in that struggle to ensure the freedoms of all Americans to pursue their dreams.                          ____________________
