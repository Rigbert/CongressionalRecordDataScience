Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding, and I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for all of his work on this legislation.  I would like to thank the chair and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and all of their staff for their strong support of the legislation.  This bill is very simple. It simply ensures that these medals are displayed at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opens next year.  In 2004, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to grant the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mrs. Coretta Scott King. I introduced the House bill, and my good friend, Senator Carl Levin, sponsored the Senate companion.  The legislation passed in the House and Senate by voice vote. Unfortunately, a couple of years later, my good friend, Coretta Scott King, passed away. She was a beautiful and strong spirit and, like her husband, a national treasure.  They were heroes, breaking down barriers, opening doors, fighting injustice across our country, and building bridges around the world. It is only fitting that this congressional tribute is on exhibit to the world in a permanent national memorial.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the bipartisan leadership and staff for all of their good and great work in support of this commonsense legislation.
