President, today I am introducing the Microcap Fraud Prevention Act of 2001. This bill will close loopholes in the enforcement of our securities laws and furnish Federal authorities with the tools they need to combat growing fraud in the microcap securities market. While the Enron debacle has focused attention on the need for tougher and fuller financial disclosure standards to protect small investors, microcap fraud costs investors an estimated $6 billion every year.  I first introduced this bill in the 106th Congress after extensive examination by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chaired. I am pleased that the North American Securities Administrators Association, which is made up of our Nation's State securities regulators, has once again sent me a letter of strong support and has made passage of legislation such as this one of its top legislative priorities.  Today's securities markets are much different than they were even a decade ago. Many more people own securities than ever before. The rise of the Internet has allowed investors greater access to market information and investment advice. Unfortunately, not all of this information and advice has been sound, or even honest.  These problems are exacerbated in the microcap market. Microcap stocks are those of smaller, thinly capitalized companies. Because the individual share prices may be higher than a certain threshold, however, they may avoid regulation as ``penny stocks.'' Because investors typically know little of these companies, their share prices are easier to manipulate due to the small amount of total capital. They are often less regulated than the securities of larger companies and, therefore, they can pose difficult challenges for law enforcement and unique opportunities for dishonest brokers.  It is this combination of a microcap company's low capitalization, making its share price more easily manipulable, and obscurity, along with high-pressure sales tactics, that make microcap stocks so appealing to the more dishonest elements in our securities markets.  Frequently, salesmen will call customers, pitching these investments with high pressure sales tactics. More sophisticated scams involve a practice known as the ``pump and dump'' where a securities firm that has purchased a large block of a microcap company's stock will market it aggressively and quickly to investors. As a result of the surge in demand, the share's price will rise sharply but temporarily, despite the unchanged fundamentals underlying the stock's price.  After a short time, investors will realize that the company's performance does not merit its new share price. The stock's share price will then plummet, but the firm will by then have unloaded its shares, leaving investors holding the bag. In other cases, however, dishonest brokers and firms simply fail to execute sales orders or otherwise commit garden variety theft masquerading as securities transactions, such as churning or making unsuitable recommendations.  States prosecute these criminals activities with some success and often obtain orders prohibiting further securities activities by bad actors within their jurisdiction. Because such an order ends at a State's borders, however, the defendants can simply pick up, move to a new State, and begin their schemes anew. In contrast, a Federal order would have effect nationwide. Because Federal law enforcement resources are limited, however, there is only so much it can do, and many smaller time criminals can continue to operate below the federal government's radar screen. My bill would institute several reforms to address these problems.  First, it would allow the SEC to take enforcement actions against brokers and firms on the basis of those already concluded by state agencies. Although States may base their actions on Federal actions, the reverse is not true. As a result, the SEC must duplicate the State's efforts to provide nationwide protection to investors. By allowing the SEC to base disciplinary actions on those concluded by states, the State's disciplinary actions can be given effect nationwide, when appropriate, without the SEC's having to commit significant amounts of additional resources.  Second, the bill would allow the SEC to keep those who commit any type of financial fraud from participating in the microcap market. Currently, the SEC can ban those who commit securities violations. But the SEC should have the poser to discipline those who commit other types of financial services offenses as well.  Third, this bill would broaden provisions designed to prevent fraud in the penny stock market. Under current law, the SEC can suspend or bar those who commit fraud in this market. However, brokers so barred can turn around and commit the same types of offenses in the microcap market because their individual share prices might exceed $5 per share, even though the total capitalization amount is small enough to lend itself to easy manipulation. The penny stock market ban needs to be expanded to the microcap market as well.  Fourth, the statutory officer and director bar would be expanded to cover all publicly traded companies. Currently, this bar only applies to companies that report to the SEC, leaving open the possibility that those who have been barred from serving in these companies could serve in others that are exempt from reporting. Companies involved in microcap schemes are frequently traded over the counter and are not covered by the bar. Under my bill, this bar would extend to all publicly traded companies.  Finally, the bill would allow the SEC to enforce its own orders and court injunctions against repeat offenders directly rather than waiting for the Justice Department to initiate contempt proceedings. Instead the SEC would be able to seek immediate civil penalties for repeat violations without the delay that can occur from the initiation of contempt proceedings.  These are common sense, measured steps that can make a real difference in the level of protection that we provide to investors, many of whom are new to our capital markets. I would urge the Senate to consider and pass theMicrocap Fraud Prevention Act quickly. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support from the NASAA be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                        NASAA,                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2001.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the membership of North      American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (NASAA),      I commend you for recognizing and confronting the problem of      fraud in the microcap securities market. We appreciate your      efforts to protect the investing public from frauds in low-     priced securities, and for your plans to introduce      legislation to enhance enforcement efforts in this area.       As you know, several years ago, state securities      administrators recognized the problem of fraud in the      microcap market. Since then the states have led enforcement      efforts and filed numerous actions against microcap firms.      There are systematic problems in this area, but they can be      addressed effectively if state and federal regulators and      policymakers work together on meaningful solutions.       NASAA wholeheartedly supports the intent of The Microcap      Fraud Prevention Act of 2001. It would be an important step      in combating abuses in the microcap market and maintaining      continued public confidence in our markets.       We applaud your leadership in the fight against microcap      fraud, and I pledge the support of NASAA's membership to      continue to work with you to secure passage of this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                               Joseph P. Borg,                                      Alabama Securities Director,                                                  NASAA President.                                 ______                                       By
