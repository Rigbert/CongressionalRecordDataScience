'  The New York Times today reported, ``As Wall Street has returned to business as usual, industry power has become even more concentrated among relatively few firms.''  A handful of mammoth banks has brought our Nation, our credit system and our economy to its knees. Some call them ``too big to fail.'' One must ask:  Why should a few big players have so much power that they can force taxpayer bailouts for themselves, can shut off credit and can hold the reins of our economy in their hands?  A handful of firms are gobbling up our money and are killing off smaller banking institutions. Congress and this administration are just letting them do it. My friends, such concentration of financial power is dangerous to our country.  A few Wall Street firms are on the fast track to controlling all banking in this country. Rather than address this by breaking up these banks, some in Washington say they just want to regulate them better. If you believe that, you haven't paid any attention over this last year.  The biggest banks are getting bigger. In fact, a year ago, the biggest ones controlled 30 percent of the deposits in the country, according to Fortune magazine. Now they're up to 37 percent, and they're growing even faster. Here are their names: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and PNC. PNC practically has price control power over western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio right now.  These firms have already shown us that regulations mean nothing to them. They invent loopholes before Washington has even thought of them. Why wouldn't they again? Not all of their activities were by the book either. Fraud is rampant. Yet we cannot even get a grip on fraud because there are not enough FBI agents to look into mortgage, corporate and securities fraud. We need 1,000 FBI agents, not a few hundred, to untangle what has really been going on.  Americans have a right to be angry about being cheated out of their money, their homes and their jobs; but how long will Congress and the administration tiptoe around the power grab? Wall Street goes right on, seizing all they can get their hands on, and they are holding onto the money so tightly they're not lending it. They're buying up one another and the smaller banks, rewarding themselves quite handsomely.  There is a clear solution: Break them up. It's overdue. The Governor of the Bank of England says to break them up. Why not? Why are we protecting Wall Street's bad boys?  Another terrible precedent: rewarding more hazard rather than preventing it. We've been there before, and look where it got us now. This brings to mind Charles Dickens' 19th-century English masterpiece, ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' except this is the United States, and it is the 21st century, and it is a tale not of two cities but of two countries.  There is one country where the giant banks are making so much money that they are setting aside enough to pay each worker in their investment banking division a bonus of $353,834. That country is Wall Street. The other country, where I come from--Toledo, Ohio and places like it--is where the median household annual income is not even one-tenth of what they get as bonuses. Our median income is $35,216. That's not even one-tenth as much as JPMorgan Chase is setting aside just for bonuses for its investment banking employees.  In one country, banks make themselves too big to fail. They privatize their profits and they socialize the losses. In the other country, which I represent, families, which are too small to matter, lose their jobs to globalization and their homes to foreclosure.  In the other country, where I live, the unemployment rate exceeds 13 percent. Housing values have fallen more than 10 percent in a single year, and foreclosures are up 94 percent. The mortgage workouts Congress promised with all of those bills that were rushed through here are just an illusion. They're not happening.  There is something really wrong with this picture. There is something really wrong with our economy.  Even one of the Wall Street analysts picked up on it. He was quoted by the AP as saying, ``Wall Street is picking up quite smartly while Main Street continues to suffer.'' Do you mean someone up there has finally noticed?  Madam Speaker, there is a solution here: Break them up. It's long overdue.                [From the New York Times, Oct. 26, 2009]           Trying To Rein In ``Too Big To Fail'' Institutions                          (By Stephen LaBaton)       Washington.--Congress and the Obama administration are      about to take up one of the most fundamental issues stemming      from the near collapse of the financial system last year--how      to deal with institutions that are so big that the government      has no choice but to rescue them when they get in trouble.       A senior administration official said on Sunday that after      extensive consultations with Treasury Department officials,      Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House      Financial Services Committee, would introduce legislation as      early as this week. The measure would make it easier for the      government to seize control of troubled financial      institutions, throw out management, wipe out the shareholders      and change the terms of existing loans held by the      institution.       The official said the Treasury secretary, Timothy F.      Geithner, was planning to endorse the changes in testimony      before the     House Financial Services Committee on Thursday.       The White House plan as outlined so far would already make      it much more costly to be a large financial company whose      failure would put the financial system and the economy at      risk. It would force such institutions to hold more money in      reserve and make it harder for them to borrow too heavily      against their assets.       Setting up the equivalent of living wills for corporations,      that plan would require that they come up with their own      procedure to be disentangled in the event of a crisis, a plan      that administration officials say ought to be made public in      advance.       ``These changes will impose market discipline on the      largest and most interconnected companies,'' said Michael S.      Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial      institutions. One of the biggest changes the plan would make,      he said, is that instead of being controlled by creditors,      the process is controlled by the government.       Some regulators and economists in recent weeks have      suggested that the administration's plan does not go far      enough. They say that the government should consider breaking      up the biggest banks and investment firms long before they      fail, or at least impose strict limits on their trading      activities--steps that the administration continues to      reject.       Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said his committee      would now take up more aggressive legislation on the topic,      even as lawmakers and regulators continue working on other      problems highlighted by the financial crisis, including      overseeing executive pay, protecting consumers and regulating      the trading of derivatives.       Illustrative of the mood of fear and anger over the huge      taxpayer bailouts was Mr. Frank's recent observation that      critics of the administration's health care proposal had      misdirected their concerns Congress would not be adopting      death panels for infirm people but for troubled companies.       The administration and its Congressional allies are trying,      in essence, to graft the process used to resolve the troubles      of smaller commercial banks onto both large banking      conglomerates and nonbanking financial institutions whose      troubles could threaten to undermine the markets.       That resolution process gives the government far more      sweeping authority over the institution and imposes major      burdens on lenders to the companies that they would not      ordinarily face when companies go into bankruptcy instead of      facing a takeover by the government.       Deep-seated voter anger over the bailouts of companies like      the American International Group, Citigroup and Bank of      America has fed the fears of lawmakers that any other changes      in the regulatory system must include the imposition of more      onerous conditions on those financial institutions whose      troubles could pose problems for the markets.       Some economists believe the mammoth size of some      institutions is a threat to the financial system at large.      Because these companies know the government could not allow      them to fail, the argument goes, they are more inclined to      take big risks.       Also, under the current regulatory structure, the      government has limited power to step in quickly to resolve      problems at nonbank financial institutions that operate like      the failed investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns,      and like the giant insurer A.I.G.       As Wall Street has returned to business as usual, industry      power has become even more concentrated among relatively few      firms, thus intensifying the debate over how to minimize the      risks to the system.       Some experts, including Mervyn King, governor of the Bank      of England, and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the      Federal Reserve, have proposed drastic steps to force the      nation's largest financial institutions to shed their riskier      affiliates.       In a speech last week, Mr. King said policy makers should      consider breaking up the largest banks and, in effect,      restore the Depression-era barriers between investment and      commercial banks.       ``There are those who claim that such proposals are      impractical. It is hard to see why,'' Mr. King said. ``What      does seem impractical, however, are the current arrangements.      Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail      depositors and other creditors, and then suggested that such      funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative      activities, would be thought rather unworldly. But that is      where we now are.''       The prevailing view in Washington, however, is more      restrained. Daniel K. Tarullo, an appointee of President      Obama's, last week dismissed the idea of breaking up big      banks as ``more a provocative idea than a proposal.''       At a meeting Friday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,      the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in      response to a question by a former Bank of England deputy      governor that he would prefer ``a more subtle approach      without losing the economic benefit of multifunction,      international firms.''       Republican and Democratic lawmakers generally agree that      the ``too big to fail'' policy of taxpayer bailouts for the      giants of finance needs to be curtailed. But the fine print--     how to reduce the policy and moral hazards it has      encouraged--has provoked fears on Wall Street.       Even before Mr. Frank unveils his latest proposals,      industry executives and lawyers say its approach could make      it unnecessarily more expensive for them to do business      during less turbulent times.       ``Of course you want to set up a system where an      institution dreads the day it happens because management gets      whacked, shareholders get whacked and the board gets      whacked,'' said Edward L. Yingling, president of the American      Bankers Association. ``But you don't want to create a system      that raises great uncertainty and changes what institutions,      risk management executives and lawyers are used to.''       T. Timothy Ryan, the president of the Securities Industry      and Financial Markets Association, said the market crisis      exposed that ``there was a failure in the statutory framework      for the resolution of large, interconnected firms and      everyone knows that.'' But he added that many institutions on      Wall Street were concerned that the administration's plan      would remove many of the bankruptcy protections given to      lenders of large institutions.                                  ____                   [From CNNMoney.com, Oct. 20, 2009]                   Big Banks Take Your Money and Run the titans that survived last year's tumult have gathered deposits by    the bushel. but they have shown less of a knack for lending it out                            (By Colin Barr)       New York.--A river of cash has flowed into the biggest      banks over the past year. But for borrowers, it has been more      of a meandering stream.       Deposits at the top five bank holding companies soared 29%      in the year ended June 30, according to the Federal Deposit      Insurance Corp.       Yet only one of those banks--PNC (PNC, Fortune 500) of      Pittsburgh--boosted its lending by the same magnitude,      according to midyear data from regulatory filings.       At Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500), JPMorgan Chase (JPM,      Fortune 500) and Wells Fargo (WFC, Fortune 500), loan growth      trailed deposit growth by a wide margin.       And Citigroup (C, Fortune 500), the bank that has received      the most federal aid since the market meltdown of September      2008, reported a decrease in lending despite an increasing      pool of deposits.       All told, the five biggest deposit-taking banks added $852      billion in core deposits over the past year--essentially      checking and savings accounts of less than $100,000.       Over the same period, their loan portfolios rose by just      $564 billion.       This is noteworthy because these five banks received more      than $100 billion in direct taxpayer assistance via the      Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)--a program that was set      up to replenish the depleted capital levels of banks and      allow them to boost lending to consumers and small      businesses.       Some fear the lending gap could hamper chances of an      economic recovery.       Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo told Congress this      month that commercial bank lending has declined through most      of 2009, ``with particularly severe consequences for small-      and medium-sized businesses, which are much more dependent on      banks than on the public capital markets that can be accessed      by larger corporations.''       Of course, the slower loan growth is hardly a shocker. Loan      demand naturally drops off during a recession, as consumers      and businesses pay down debt and build cash reserves.       The latest Fed senior loan officer opinion survey cited      weaker demand for all sorts of loans--particularly industrial      loans and commercial real estate loans.       JPMorgan Chase spokesman Tom Kelly ``said that's why the      bank's loan growth lagged its deposit growth.       ``We continue to lend, but what happened in the market and      the economy last year really spooked a lot of people. So they      started parking cash at banks,'' he said.       Banks have also been reluctant to lend since they have been      taking big hits as existing loans go sour as well.       Commercial net loan charge-offs hit 2.06% in the second      quarter--their highest level since the government started      tracking the data in 1988, according to the Federal Financial      Institutions Examination Council.       Still, evidence that the banks are sitting on cash won't      sit well with the growing chorus of bailout critics.       Big banks have come under fire for resisting plans to      reduce the risk of another financial sector meltdown and for      handing out huge pay packages at a time when jobs are      disappearing.       Last week's disclosure that Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500)      has set aside $16.7 billion for employee pay this year      inflamed critics who question why bankers should reap the      fruits of unlimited taxpayer support while the unemployment      rate is at a 26-year high.       Many of the deposit gains came after big banks took over      weakened competitors during last year's crisis.       JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual after the Seattle-     based savings and loan became the nation's largest bank      failure.       Bank of America bought Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, both      of which owned banks that were among the top 20 in deposits      before their acquisition. BofA didn't immediately return a      call seeking comment.       Wells Fargo and PNC both bulked up by buying bigger but      deeply troubled rivals. Wells acquired Wachovia after it      suffered a deposit run, while PNC purchased National     City after its request for TARP funding was denied. PNC      didn't comment.       ``We are in fact lending to creditworthy customers,'' said      Wells spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard. She said Wells      extended $471 billion in new loan commitments between October      2008 and the end of the second quarter--some 19 times the      bank's TARP take.       Even Citi, which sat out last fall's frenzied game of      banking musical chairs, still posted double-digit deposit      growth as Americans fled other investments for the safety of      federally insured banks. Citi didn't reply to a request for      comment.       The top five firms--dubbed too-big-to-fail, or TBTF, for      their implicit government support--now control 37% of the      nation's deposits.       That's well above their average from earlier this decade,      reviving questions about the risks of a financial system      that's even more concentrated than the one that imploded last      fall.       ``The TBTF problem has not only moved beyond the banking      system, it has become much too costly for taxpayers and the      U.S. economy,'' University of Massachusetts researcher Jane      D'Arista wrote in an August paper.                          ____________________
