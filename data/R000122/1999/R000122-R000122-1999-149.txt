The Senator is absolutely right. Both the perception of an unfair, unbalanced procedure, and I would also argue the reality, ultimately, will be such that you are not going to get a fair evaluation of your claim.  I cannot conceive of a company--and the HMOs are famous now for their concern for the bottom line--that would go out of its way to retain people who are sensitive to the needs of patients versus the needs of the company and its bottom line. They will pick reviewing authorities who will invariably decide that this expensive procedure, or this inexpensive procedure, is not needed by a patient.  What you are doing also is creating a degree of cynicism about the whole process of appeals. As a result, rather than making a sound, objective, external evaluation of the merits of the case with all the evidence and telling the patient, no, this is not necessary for you, or, yes, it is, a huge legal, bureaucratic labyrinth is created, at the end of which you find yourself facing somebody who basically works for the HMO.
