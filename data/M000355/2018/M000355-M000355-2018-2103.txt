 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 649 through 660 and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk, and that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
