 President, very briefly, we could have tonight passed the House-passed Sportsmen's bill. It would have gone straight to the President for signature. That having been thwarted by our friends on the other side, I certainly think it is appropriate to vote to proceed to the measure before us and I intend to vote aye.  I yield the floor.
