 President, let me say to my friend, the majority leader, I appreciate his position. But as he knows, not only is there massive opposition to this TPP agreement, but there is a lot of concern that the American people have not been involved in the process, that there is not a lot of transparency. What we are trying do is to make sure this debate takes place out in the public, that the American people have as much time as possible to understand the very significant implications of this trade agreement. I, and I suspect others, will do our best to make that happen.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand the position of my friend from Vermont on this. This Finance Committee meeting obviously will be open to the public. There will be many amendments offered, most of them I expect reflecting the views of the Senator from Vermont, but the meeting will go forward. The committee will simply be inconvenienced by the current actions of the Senator from Vermont, but the committee will go forward. The Senate will be in recess, and the committee will meet at the earliest possible time and finish the bill today.
