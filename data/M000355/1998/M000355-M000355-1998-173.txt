 President, while we have a moment, I would like to recognize an organization from my home state of Kentucky which has been on the front lines responding to international disasters.  The Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA), headquartered in Louisville, has responded to international disaster issues in 37 countries and has mission relations in 80 countries. It is dedicated to responding to national and international disasters, aiding refugees and displaced persons, assisting refugee resettlement, educating the world's children, and making efforts designed to foster development abroad. Clearly, it has made a difference in the world and brought hope to the needy.  Just recently, following the tragic bombings in Kenya and Sudan, PDA provided the staff services of its eye clinic and specialized orthopedic rehabilitation center for victims. PDA also worked closely with the Presbyterian Relief and Development Association of Sudan.  In early summer, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, in cooperation with other organizations, was able to provide a shipment of fishing supplies to over 25,000 households in the Upper Nile Region where the ability to fish the rivers will keep these people from slipping into the grip of famine. PDA was able to serve people across several ethnic boundaries, ensuring that this assistance benefited those most in need.  Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me in saluting the courageous work of Presbyterian Disaster Assistance. It gives me a great deal of pride that this organization which offers such important and valuable service is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We all hope for a time when the efforts of organizations such as PDA are not necessary, but until that occurs we can take comfort that the job will be undertaken with vigor, compassion, and expertise.                          ____________________
