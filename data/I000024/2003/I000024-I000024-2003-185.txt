President, as the Senate's only commercially licensed pilot, I rise today, along with my colleagues, Senator Kyl, Senator Burns, Senator Thomas and Senator Grassley, to introduce a bill that will help end age discrimination among airline pilots.  This bill will abolish the Federal Aviation Administration's, FAA, Age 60 Rule--the regulation that for 43 years has forced the retirement of airline pilots the day they turn 60--and replace it with a rational plan that raises the retirement age to 63 immediately and then incrementally increases the age limit to 65.  Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules. The United States is one of only two countries in the Joint Aviation Authorities that requires its commercial pilots to retire at the age of 60. Some countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have no upper age limit at all.  The Age 60 Rule has no basis in science or safety and never did. FAA data shows that pilots over age 60 are as safe as, and in some cases safer than, their younger colleagues. In 1981, the National Institute of Aging stated that ``the Age 60 Rule appears indefensible on medical grounds'' and ``there is no convincing medical evidence to support age 60, or any other specific age, for mandatory pilot retirement.''  This bill will allow our most experienced pilots--demonstrably healthy, and fit for duty--to retain their jobs, a step that will benefit pilots, the financially burdened airlines, and most importantly, passengers. Now, more than ever before, we need to keep our best pilots flying.  Again, there is no scientific justification for requiring pilots to retire at age 60. Our pilots, our airlines, and our passengers deserve our consideration. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 959       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON AGE RESTRICTIONS.       Section 44703 of title 49, United States Code, is amended      by adding at the end the following:       ``(k) Limitation on Age Restrictions.--       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, the Administrator may not, solely by reason of a      person's age, if such person is 65 years of age or younger--       ``(A) refuse to issue to, or renew for, such person an      airman certificate for the operation of aircraft engaged in      operations under part 121 or part 135 of title 14, Code of      Federal Regulations; or       ``(B) require an air carrier to terminate the employment      of, or refuse to employ, such person as a pilot on such an      aircraft owned or operated by the air carrier.       ``(2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall only apply to      persons who have not reached the age of 64 as of the date of      enactment of this subsection.''.                                 ______                                       By
