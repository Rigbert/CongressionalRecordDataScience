There are many commercial technologies that can save the Defense Department money in the long run. For example, one Navy COSSI program uses sensors and software to monitor engine and rotor components on helicopters. The technology tells the user when a given part needs to be replaced, as opposed to the current system, which for safety reasons requires perfectly usable parts to be replaced at regular intervals. Navy program managers have estimated that this technology can save over $1 billion over 10 years if adopted on just two kinds of helicopters. In thistime of tight budgets, this is the kind of program that we should all be supporting.
