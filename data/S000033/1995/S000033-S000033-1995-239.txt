 We think that much of what is in the Contract With America benefits the people who go to the $1,000 a plate fund-raising dinners. We think there are sensible public policies we can develop--we brought forth some of them this afternoon--that in fact we can raise the standard of living for American people, give people hope for the future, where today there is no hope.  I want to thank both the gentleman from New York, Mr. Owens and Mr. Hinchey, for joining me. We will do this again.                          ____________________
