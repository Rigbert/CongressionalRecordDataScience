Speaker, it appears a negotiated proposal that is bipartisan will come to a vote before this House today to end the government shutdown and avert a debt default. The American people surely are looking for reassurance that their government will offer them the security and dependability that they expect.  Our citizens expect a Nation that is confident and certain, not unsteady and uncertain. With the expectation that this compromise from the Senate will now be brought before the House, the Dow today already is up 200 points. That is what America wants--a growing economy, job creation here at home, a government run efficiently as part of a larger whole in which we all have a stake. As our Nation grows itself out of the deepest recession in modern history, the least any Member can do is do no harm.  A working bipartisan majority here in this House holds the power to govern this Nation. All it needs is the will. Frankly, the world depends on the certainty of the U.S. dollar. Let's get back to regular order. America's challenge is to grow our economy and the jobs that go with it.  Mr. Speaker, let's vote to end the shutdown today, pay our bills, and get America back to work for the American people. It is overtime.                          ____________________
