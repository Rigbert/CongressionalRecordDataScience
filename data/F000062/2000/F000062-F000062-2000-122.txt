 President, I also am buoyed by the prospects. As we go through this more and more, I understand more and more what is happening behind the scenes. I do want to enter into the record this latest letter from Professor Larry Tribe. Senator Kyl will be interested in one quote. He says deep into his letter:       I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of      ostensibly ``liberal'' lawyers and scholars who do not look      askance when they learn of my support for this amendment.      Friends who otherwise respect me and admire my work have a      difficult time, it seems, assimilating the notion that a      liberal champion of defendants' rights--something I think I      have been all my life--should take seriously the idea that      the victims of violent crime actually have ``rights'' that      the Constitution should compel government to take seriously      and to treat with respect, rather than merely being the      unfortunate--well, victims--of criminal predations that the      state is charged with combating, in a system where the only      ``rights'' worth naming and treating as such of course belong      to those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the wrong      end of the machinery of criminal justice. With all respect, I      do not share that perspective. Rather, I regard its deeply      ingrained nature as the principal argument for the conclusion      that statutory measures will never fully suffice.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Professor Tribe's letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                Harvard University                                                   Law School,                                    Cambridge, MA, April 27, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I have previously set forth my      reasons for supporting S.J. Res. 3, the proposed Victims'      Rights Amendment now under consideration in the Senate, and      little purpose would be served by my repeating those reasons      here. I understand the objections some have raised to the      proposed amendment and have enormous respect for many who      oppose the measure, but on balance I am persuaded that the      considerations favoring the amendment outweigh those against      it, even placing an appropriately skeptical thumb on the      scale's negative side.       I am writing to address one consideration in particular      that is highlighted by the proposed Crime Victims' Assistance      Act, S. 934, whose sponsors, many of whom are my good      friends, evidently hope by this federal statute to obviate      the need for the proposed constitutional amendment. I favor      S. 934's enactment, at least in principle. I assume that      closer study of its detailed provisions that I have been able      to undertake would disclose ways in which it might be      improved, but minor technical flaws or even design defects in      the contemplated statute would be beside the point and are      not my focus here. After all, detailed problems with the      statute's terms could be cured by redrafting and would not in      themselves explain why only an amendment to the Constitution      could meet the need for fuller national protection of      victims' rights.       My concerns are different ones. First, I am concerned that,      as the authors of S. 934 doubtless realized given how they      wrote their bill, it does nothing directly for the vast      majority of crime victims--those victimized by violations of      state or local rather than federal law. To be sure, S. 934      would offer the states money for pilot projects and the like,      and money of course helps, but the basic reasons for the      dramatic underprotection of state crime victims are more      attitudinal than fiscal: Even when states enact victims'      rights measures of their own in response to pressures from      constituents, there is a tendency to ignore or underenforce      such rights whenever they appear to rub up against either the      rights of the criminally accused or the needs or wishes of      the prosecution. And I do mean to say ``appear to rub up      against,'' for the problem I have in mind arises in those      situations where a careful analysis would reveal that the      seeming conflict between victims' rights and the rights of      the accused or the interests of the state is a false or a      readily avoidable one. The mere brandishment of the banners      of defendants' rights or of prosecutorial needs too often      suffices to push the needs and interests of victims--to be      notified, to observe, to be heard, to have their views      considered, to achieve closure, to be compensated if      possible--into the background. Rather than creatively and      determinedly seeking ways to protect victims' rights in      ways that manage fully to respect the genuine rights,      privileges, and needs both of the accuser and of the      accused, state and local officials are understandably but      unfortunately tempted to relegate victims and their rights      to second-class status or to shelve them altogether,      treating as merely hortatory and aspirational provisions      of law enacted with something much stronger and more      operational in mind.       State statutory and constitutional provisions cannot      overcome this phenomenon so long as the only parties whose      rights receive federal constitutional recognition,      recognition that reinforces and amplifies traditional habits      of mind at the state and local levels, are the defendants in      criminal prosecutions. And S. 934, which obviously could not      touch the actual conduct of state and local criminal      investigations, prosecutions, and adjudications, is      manifestly incapable of affecting this pervasive tendency.       Indeed--and this is my second major concern--even in the      federal criminal context within which S. 934 would operate,      the proposed statute would take effect against the background      of a legal culture in which the very notion of ``victims'      rights'' has traditionally been dismissed either as a vague      metaphor or as an atavistic throwback to a primitive era of      private justice. In a federal universe within which victims      are pervasively perceived as mere passive beneficiaries of      government protection--as bystanders to the majesty of the      criminal process rather than as entitled participants in that      process--a merely statutory codification of certain      ``rights,'' removable by the grace of the same Congress that      bestowed them, is most unlikely to effect the pervasive      attitudinal change that is so badly needed. When push comes      to shove, even where adequately protecting victims does not      in truth entail any abridgment of the federal constitutional      rights of criminal defendants or of the needs of government      prosecutors to protect the public and vindicate the law, any      superficially plausible protest from either the prosecution's      table or the defense bar is likely to shove victims and their      S. 934 rights back into the shadows, from which a federal      judiciary steeped in precisely the same legal culture is      unlikely to rescue them.       Evidence of the depth and pervasiveness of this basic      attitude, and of the view that to defend the rights of      victims is to engage in a primitive exercise in emotionalism,      incompatible with the structure of our adversary system of      justice and with the rational character of the modern      bureaucratic state, is the ferocity and generality of the      opposition to a constitutional amendment to protect victims'      rights, at least among the elite and especially in the      supposedly enlightened circles with which I like to think I      associate. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number      of ostensibly ``liberal'' lawyers and scholars who do not      look askance when they learn of my support for this      amendment. Friends who otherwise respect me and admire my      work have a difficult time, it seems, assimilating the notion      that a liberal champion of defendants' rights--something I      think I have been all my life--should take seriously the idea      that the victims of violent crime actually have ``rights''      that the Constitution should compel government to take      seriously and to treat with respect, rather than merely being      the unfortunate--well, victims--of criminal predations that      the state is charged with combating, in a system where the      only ``rights'' worth naming and treating as such of course      belong to those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the      wrong end of the machinery of criminal justice. With all      respect, I do not share that perspective. Rather, I regard      its deeply ingrained nature as the principal argument for      the conclusion that statutory measures will never fully      suffice.       Permit me to add one point before closing: I want to      address the argument that S. 934 should not be faulted for      failing to reach state proceedings because, after all, it is      designed only to operate at the federal level, and because      either state statutes or state constitutional provisions or      perhaps federal civil rights-like legislation enacted under      Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment could fill the state      and local gap that S. 934 necessarily leaves unfilled. That      argument is flawed first, because it fails entirely to come      to terms with the basic reasons, set forth above, that merely      statutory measures would be unable to combat the deeply      rooted attitudinal problems confronting victims and their      claims of right; and second, because, insofar as it assumes      broad congressional power to act under Section 5 of the      Fourteenth Amendment, it is simply ignorant of the series of      decisions in the 1990s and reaching into 2000, beginning with      the invalidation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and      continuing with the invalidation of provisions of the Patent      Reform     Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, in which      the modern Supreme Court has dramatically curtailed the      legislative authority of Congress to use its Section 5 power      to protect interests that Congress, but not yet the Court, is      prepared to recognize as constitutional rights, or even to      protect Court-recognized constitutional rights in      circumstances, or by means, not shown in the legislative      record to be ``necessary.''       In sum, although S. 934 represents an intelligent step in      the much-needed strategy of operationalizing and      institutionalizing the rights of victims, neither by itself      nor as part of a series of measures, both federal and state,      can it hope to provide a satisfactory substitute for the more      fundamental constitutional step represented by S.J. Res. 3, a      step that I consider not only wise but necessary despite--and      (paradoxically) in part because of--its current lack of      appeal for ``the usual suspects'' on the criminal justice      scene, both in the defense and civil liberties bars and among      prosecutors and their champions.       I hope you find these observations to be of some use, and I      apologize for my inability to get them to you sooner. I wish      you well in the difficult effort to obtain passage of this      amendment by the requisite two-thirds vote and, should you      succeed in that respect, in the onerous effort to win its      ratification by the requisite three-fourths of the state      legislatures.           Sincerely yours,                                                Laurence H. Tribe.
