 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I submit the following statements into the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.      Rami Faour and Pat Griffin Regarding the Legal Drinking Age       Rami Faour: Representative Sanders, and other distinguished      guests, we are here to     speak about lowering the drinking age to help alleviate the      problem with teen drinking. We understand that there are a      large number of people between the ages of 18 and 20 who      drink regardless of the law, and many of them even binge      drink. Even though the legal drinking age is 21, many teens      are able to purchase alcohol to consume on their own. 18 to      20 year olds can pay taxes, adopt a child, be drafted into      the military, hold firearms, but they are not allowed to      touch alcohol. This is an illogical inconsistency and      infringement of civil rights on this age group. They are      legal adults in every other respect and ironically not a lot      of these legal adults who drink illegally increase the      alcohol use and abuse it is meant to reduce.       Alcohol has become a forbidden fruit for teens. Drinking is      more exciting when it is illegal than when it is legal. So      many people go out and get drunk simply because they know      they should not be drinking at all. Just look at our American      history, we saw prohibition backfire. Instead of stopping it,      it glorified it and we had increased alcohol. We see teens      following that pattern.       Pat Griffin: The solution to this topic is a realistic      drinking age combined with education of teens about drinking.      There is no reason that an 18-year-old cannot drink as      responsibly or even more responsibly than a 24-year-old. The      level of maturity between these two ages are about the same.      The solution is to educate young youths in how to drink      responsibly for the first step but current alcohol education      in high school, and in college set up on how to drink      responsibly and ending with the message ``Do not drink      because you would be too young.'' First we need to educate      teens, then we need to trust them. If we treat them like      children, they will act like children. If you treat them as      responsible adults, they will act maturely. With these steps      we see many different changes of attitudes and behavior of      young adults.       We wish to thank you for your time to educate young adults      in how to drink responsibly and then let them drink      responsibly. Thank you.                                  ____                                         Kyle Rose, Erin Gover and Kim Klein Regarding Teen Centers       Erin Gover: Good morning. My name is Erin Gover and today I      will be speaking on the topic of funding of teen centers      throughout Vermont.       For years society has been asking why teens turn to alcohol      and drugs. So far we have concluded that the solution to this      issue is positive alternatives. Well, teen centers are      positive alternatives. Yet, out of all the towns in Vermont,      Colchester is one of the only ones that does not have one.      Yet, for three years organizations like the Colchester Growth      Group have founded buildings, got the community's support and      fundraised the money for a teen center, but to no avail. In      its place is a gas station, a quicky mart, or even a bar. I      do not know about you, but I would rather have my child going      to a teen center where he or she can hang out with his      friends, get help on homework, or just have a good time      rather than hanging out at a bar.       To compensate for this teens founded Club 242 located under      Memorial Auditorium in downtown Burlington. Club 242 is a      place where high school bands can play, get their start, and      other high schoolers can come watch, have a good time, and      just hang out. And there is absolutely no alcohol, no drugs      and no smoking, a positive alternative you might say. Yet      funding is currently being taken away from Club 242. Why?      This leaves Burlington and Colchester with about three      alternatives: shopping, movies and drugs. And it is the City      of Burlington and the Town of Colchester that are making this      decision, not the teens.       It is also your decision. As our representative, I believe      you should make it your goal to not only make all of your      fellow congressmen aware of the need for funding, but also to      use your influence to pass a bill making it possibly a      requirement for each town to have a teen center, a positive      alternative. You should make yourself aware of these teen      centers and make sure funding is not taken       The youth of Vermont have worked on this for years and      continue to rally the support of the community. We are      trying, but it is now your turn to help. And remember,      actions speak louder than words.       Kim Klein: 90 percent of the reason why children go out and      cause trouble is because there is not really anything for      them to do. I mean there are parks and stuff like that, but      most children will either go out and hand out in front of      stores or stuff like that and go to parties, because there is      nothing constructive for them to do. And as Erin said, Club      242, being a musician and playing in high school bands, it is      hard for us to get anywhere. I mean, we played there, but to      be able to play in other towns and stuff, there aren't places      for us to do that because they are all bars.                                  ____                                     Matt Plunkett and Ryan Esbjerg Regarding Teen Drinking and Driving       Matthew Plunkett: Congressman Sanders, eight young people      die a day in alcohol-related crashes. During a typical      weekend and average of one teenager dies each hour in a car      crash; nearly 50 percent of those crashes involve alcohol.      Alcohol is the number one drug problem among young people.      This is a serious problem not only here in Vermont, but also      across the nation. Drunk driving causes many deaths each year      and many of us have suffered from the loss of friends and      family who have died because of bad decisions involving      alcohol and vehicles. When we look at the statistics on a      national level, they may not seem very high but there is      still a problem and more needs to be done, but then there is      never enough that can be done until the problem ceases to      exist.       We feel there should be more programs helping inform young      drivers in training of the risks of how much more of a chance      they have of getting in an accident while intoxicated. In our      opinion there should be more funding or there should be      funding for a problem that states some of the evils involved      in alcohol-related crashes.       Ryan Esbjerg: These vehicles should not be overlooked. They      are an educational resource that could be placed on display      in private locations or driver's education classes can view      the crash first-hand. Once young people see the results of      one of these crashes, it might prevent them from making the      same mistake as others. The viewing of the wreckage of cars      in which people have died makes an impression that no film or      lecture can match.       We keep track of history for a reason, to learn from      mistakes and the mistake of drinking and driving is repeated      too often. The accidents do not just affect the family of the      driver or the passenger, they affect the whole community. We      are urging you to extend the education of this subject, help      save lives in any way that is possible, because you never      know when it is your family member or your best friend you      could read about in the newspaper.       Thank you for your time.                                 ____________________
