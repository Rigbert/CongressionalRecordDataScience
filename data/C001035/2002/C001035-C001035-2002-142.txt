President, I am pleased to join Senators Lieberman, Torricelli, Snowe, and Cochran in introducing the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act of 2002 to improve patients' access to the colorectal cancer screening benefit under Medicare.  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States for both men and women: more than 57,000 Americans will die from this disease this year, yet it is a disease that many of us feel uncomfortable discussing.  The sad irony is that cancer of the colon is probably the most treatable and survivable of all cancers, but only if it is caught early. If detected and treated early, colon cancer is curable in more than 90 percent of diagnosed cases. Conversely, if the cancer is detected in an advanced stage, death rates are high. As many as 92 percent of these patients will die within five years.  Despite the fact that we have extremely effective screening tests for colon cancer, our screening rates for colon cancer, even among those Americans who are most at risk, are woefully low. Moreover, even the addition in 1998 of a new Medicare benefit covering these services has not improved the situation.  In 2000, the General Accounting Office, GAO, conducted a review of claims data to determine the extent to which this new preventive health service has been used. According to the GAO, only 3.8 percent of Medicare patients received either a screening or diagnostic colonoscopy in 1999, far below the recommended use rates and just a one percent increase over the rate in 1995.  Clearly we must find ways to heighten public awareness about the importance of colon cancer screening and remove any remaining barriers that may be preventing Medicare beneficiaries from receiving these critically important services. While the GAO identified a lack of patient awareness, understanding and inclination as the most significant factors inhibiting the use of colorectal cancer screening services, it also found that physician practices affect rates of screening. One factor is the inadequate Medicare reimbursement rates to cover the costs involved.  Medicare reimbursement rates for this procedure have declined in recent years and are almost universally lower than reimbursements under private insurance. Moreover, in many States, the Medicare rates are lower than Medicaid rates. Our legislation will therefore increase the Medicare payment rates for colonoscopies performed both in hospitals and outpatient settings. Specifically, the payment rates in hospitals and outpatient facilities would be increased by 30 percent, while payment for procedures done in physicians' offices would be increased by 10 percent.  Our legislation will also require Medicare to provide reimbursements for pre-procedure consultations to ensure that beneficiaries are properly prepared and educated before they undergo a screening colonoscopy. Medicare currently only pays for the pre-procedure appointment prior to a diagnostic colonoscopy. This pre-procedure visit is no less necessary in the case of a screening colonoscopy and should be covered.  Finally, under our legislation, the normal Part B deductible will not apply for screening colonoscopy, just as it does not apply for screening mammography. This will remove a financial disincentive for seniors to seek screening and increase the likelihood that they will undergo screening colonoscopy.  The Colon Cancer Screen for Your Life Act of 2002 will not only help to ensure the safety of colorectal cancer screenings, but it will also increase Medicare patients' access to this life-saving procedure, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                          ____________________
