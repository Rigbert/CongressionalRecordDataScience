Cole to serve as Deputy Attorney General.''  Chuck Rosenberg, former Chief of Staff for Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who served under President George W. Bush, wrote, ``I know how important it is for this crucial position to be filled by the right person. Jim is the right person. He is smart, experienced, thoughtful and has the proper skills and temperament to help Attorney General Eric Holder lead the Justice Department.''  In his letter recommending Mr. Cole, Michael J. Madigan, a Republican counsel on many high-level Senate investigations, described Mr. Cole as ``one of those somewhat rare individuals in this city about whom you will never hear even the mildest of criticism.'' He concluded that Mr. Cole ``is a good man and perfectly suited for the challenging position for which the President has wisely nominated him.''  Mr. Cole's critics have been wrong to try to blame him for the actions of AIG. His limited role was as an outside monitor of other corporate functions and there is no evidence showing he did not perform his assignment well. Let us hold those responsible at AIG accountable. Not a single person at AIG has been. There is no basis for making Mr. Cole the scapegoat for the action of AIG. Blame the AIG agents and employees, blame its officers, blame its board, or even criticize the lack of oversight by state and Federal regulators and law enforcement officials if you like. But scapegoating this good man is wrong. As The Washington Post observed in an editorial last year when Mr. Cole's nomination was being blocked on the Senate floor, ``There is no suggestion that Mr. Cole suffers from the kind of ethical or legal problems that would disqualify a nominee.''  There is no justification for the failure to act on this critical national security nomination, and for failing to make sure that the administration has its full national security team in place. During the time when I was chairman we moved very quickly on President Bush's nominees for Deputy Attorney General because of the importance of the security of the United States. It is important for every President to succeed, no matter their party.  I hope that the Senate will reject this destructive and unprecedented filibuster so that we can finally consider and confirm Jim Cole after many months of unnecessary delays. As I said, I could not remember a time in my 37 years here where we had filibustered a nominee to be Deputy Attorney General and that proved to be true.                               Exhibit 1                                                   Bryan Cave,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2010.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions: I write in strong      support of Jim Cole's nomination to serve as Deputy Attorney      General of the United States.       By way of background, I am a Partner at Bryan Cave LLP in      Washington, DC. Prior to joining Bryan Cave, I was Chairman      of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and was a      Commissioner on the FEC from 2002-2007. Prior to being      appointed to the FEC, I served as Chief Counsel of the      Republican National Committee, General Counsel of the Bush-     Cheney 2000 Campaign, and General Counsel of the 2000 Bush-     Cheney Transition Team.       I have known Jim Cole for approximately 15 years and have      had the privilege of being a colleague of Mr. Cole's at Bryan      Cave for the last three years. I first met Mr. Cole when he      served as Special Counsel for the House Ethics Committee's      inquiry concerning Speaker Gingrich and I was an attorney      representing Speaker Gingrich in the     matter. Although Mr. Cole and I obviously had conflicting      interests in the Gingrich matter, I was tremendously      impressed with the thoroughness and professionalism by which      Mr. Cole conducted himself in the Gingrich matter, and that      has been a hallmark of all of my experiences with Mr. Cole      over the last 15 years.       Mr. Cole is superbly qualified to serve as Deputy Attorney      General of the United States. Mr. Cole is one of the smartest      and most able criminal lawyers in the country, and Mr. Cole's      prior service at the Justice Department will be invaluable      experience in working with Attorney General Holder in      managing and leading the Justice Department. In light of his      extensive experience, legal acumen, professionalism and      integrity, I can think of no better person that Mr. Cole to      serve as Deputy Attorney General.       Jim Cole has my highest recommendation to serve as Deputy      Attorney General of the United States and it is an honor to      have the opportunity to write on Mr. Cole's behalf. If      confirmed, I believe that Mr. Cole would serve the Department      of Justice and the country with great distinction in the      years ahead.           Sincerely,     Michael E. Toner.                                  ____                                                Phelps Dunbar,                                   New Orleans, LA, June 10, 2010.     Re Nomination of Jim Cole to be next Deputy Attorney General          of the United States of America.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judicial Committee,     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing this letter to recommend,      without hesitation, Jim Cole to be confirmed as the next      Deputy Attorney General in the United States Department of      Justice.       As a former United States Attorney in Louisiana, I worked      with Jim Cole when he prosecuted a corrupt federal judge. I      also have worked with Mr. Cole for more than a decade while      he worked in the private sector.       I know Jim Cole to be bright, hard-working, dedicated and      beyond reproach. If confirmed by the United States Senate, I      believe Jim Cole will be an asset to both the Justice      Department and the citizens of the United States. I      respectfully ask you to consider my wholehearted support of      Jim Cole as the next Deputy Attorney General.       I know that you, and the other members of the Judiciary      Committee as well as the Senate, strive for bipartisan      cooperation. As a Republican Presidential appointee, I      believe it is critical for members of the Justice Department      to have bipartisan support and the confidence of the American      people regardless of party affiliation. I appreciate your      consideration of my views as to the soundness of the      nomination of Jim Cole for Deputy Attorney General and would      welcome an opportunity to provide you with additional      information if you so choose.       Thanking you again for your courtesies and with best      regards, I remain,           Sincerely,     Harry Rosenberg.                                  ____                                                       Orrick,                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2010.     Re James M. Cole, Nominee for Deputy Attorney General.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: It is my great privilege      and honor to add my voice, wholeheartedly, to those      supporting the nomination of Jim Cole for the critically      important position of Deputy Attorney General of the United      States.       I have known Jim for years and he is and has been a truly      outstanding lawyer and, most importantly, an even better      person. For the last two years I have had the honor of      serving with Jim on the ABA-DOJ Dialogue Group where he has      been an always thoughtful and important member.       Jim, as you already know, has had an outstanding career      both as a federal prosecutor and as a criminal and civil      trial lawyer. Indeed, Jim, I dare say, is one of those      somewhat rare individuals in this city about whom you will      never hear even the mildest of criticism. He is a good man      and is perfectly suited for the challenging position for      which the President has wisely nominated him.       I am honored to offer unqualified support for Jim's      nomination.           Respectfully yours,                                               Michael J. Madigan.
