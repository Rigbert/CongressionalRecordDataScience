President, I ask unanimous consent that following the cloture vote on the Collins amendment No. 3896, Senator Enzi or his designee be recognized to make a budget point of order against McCain amendment No. 4039; further, that Senator McCain be recognized to make a motion to waive the point of order and that the Senate immediately vote on the motion to waive.  I further ask that the votes in this series be 10 minutes in length, strictly enforced.
