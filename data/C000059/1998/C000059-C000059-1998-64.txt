Speaker, last December I attended the international global warming summit in Kyoto, Japan. I took with me to the meeting information I had gathered at three hearings I convened in my Science Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. At those hearings, where the Subcommittee took testimony from experts in climatology, it became obvious that there is no clear scientific consensus on which the Administration can base its claim that human-induced global warming is harming our planet.  Over the next few days I will submit for the Record portions of studies that bring to light the weaknesses in the Kyoto Protocol. Today, I am submitting an Executive Summary of an analysis of the agreement conducted by the Business Roundtable. The summary gives an excellent account of the key issues of concern regarding the Protocol, making clear that the agreement has serious flaws in terms of its ability to improve the environment without harming the economy:        Executive Summary of the Kyoto Protocol: A Gap Analysis       In an in-depth analysis of an international agreement to      curb greenhouse-gas emissions, The Business Roundtable finds      that the accord, known as the Kyoto Protocol, contains major      gaps that must be filled before its impact on the world's      environment and economy can be evaluated. The Business      Roundtable recognizes that the Protocol is only a first step      toward a comprehensive agreement to reduce emissions, but      urges the Clinton Administration not to sign the Kyoto      Protocol until these gaps have been addressed.       Background: On December 11, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the      Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change      reached an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, that sets      legally binding limits on the man-made emissions of      greenhouse gases from 38 industrialized countries. Global      carbon emissions would continue to increase under the      agreement because it exempts Developing Countries--including      China, India, Mexico, Brazil, and 130 others--from any      commitments to limit their rapidly growing emissions.      Continued growth in energy demand, and thus greenhouse-gas      emissions, by Developing Countries will more than offset the      reductions made by Developed Countries. President Clinton is      expected to sign the Kyoto Protocol later this year, but he      does not intend to submit the agreement to the Senate for its      constitutional role of advice and consent until ``key''      Developing Countries agree to ``participate meaningfully'' in      the effort.                         key issues of concern       The targets and timetables would require the United States      to make significant and immediate cuts in energy use. The      Protocol would require the U.S. to reduce emissions 7 percent      below 1990 levels by 2008-2012, an unprecedented 41 percent      reduction in projected emission levels. The process of Senate      ratification and the subsequent lengthy domestic      implementation process post-ratification would leave the U.S.      very little time to make the painful choices regarding energy      use that will be necessary to achieve these reductions. In      addition, because the Protocol sets different targets for      each industrialized country and the target is based on what      is now an eight-year old baseline, the U.S. in effect will      shoulder a disproportionate level of reduction and may be      placed at a competitive disadvantage.       Unless the Developing Countries also commit to emission      reductions, the Protocol is incomplete and will not work. The      Byrd-Hagel Resolution unanimously adopted by the U.S. Senate      in July 1997 states that the U.S. should not be a signatory      to any protocol unless it mandates ``new specific scheduled      commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions for      the Developing Country Parties within the same compliance      period.'' Many Developing Countries are rapidly growing their      economies and will become the largest emitters of greenhouse      gases in the next 15-20 years. Greenhouse gases know no      boundaries, and stabilization of greenhouse-gas      concentrations cannot be achieved without global      participation in a limitation-reduction effort. Moreover,      regulating the emissions of only a handful of countries could      lead to the migration of energy-intensive production--such as      the chemicals, steel, petroleum refining, aluminum and mining      industries--from the industrialized countries to the growing      Developing Countries.       Certain carbon ``sinks'' may be used to offset emission      reductions, but the Protocol does not establish how sinks      will be calculated. Carbon sinks, a natural system that      absorbs carbon dioxide, have tremendous potential as a means      of reducing emissions, but too much is currently unknown to      make a fair determination. It is unclear how sinks might help      the U.S. reach its emission-reduction commitment and, though      the Parties to the Convention will work to develop rules and      guidelines for sinks in Buenos Aires, the rules cannot be      adopted until after the Protocol enters into force.       The Protocol Contains no mechanisms for compliance and      enforcement.       Simply put, it would be inappropriate for any country to      ratify a legally binding international agreeement which lacks      compliance guidelines and enforcement mechanisms. The      Protocol outlines a system of domestic monitoring with      oversight by international review teams, but what constitutes      compliance and who judges it will not be determined until      after the Protocol enters into force. The means of      enforcement--also unknown--is equallly critical, since a      country's noncompliance could give it a competitive advantage      over the U.S., and eviscerate the agreement's environmental      goals.       The Protocol includes flexible, market-based mechanisms to      achieve emission reductions, but it does not establish how      these mechanisms would work and to what extent they could be      used. The U.S. intends to rely heavily on market-based      mechansims to find the most efficient and cost-effective ways      to reduce emissions. But until the rules and regulations are      established it is uncertain how effective these mechanisms      will be and to what extent they can be used by companies.      Many countries are resisting these market-based mechanisms      and their reluctance may hinder the development of adequate      free-market guidelines. The absence of many countries from      the marketplace, and the possible limitations and      restrictions on the marketplace, could render these      mechanisms useless or of little value.       The Protocol leaves the door open for the imposition of      mandatory policies and measures to meet commitments. Just as      the U.S. favors flexible market mechanisms, the European      Union and many Developing Countries favor harmonized,      mandatory ``command-and-control'' policies and measures--such      as carbon taxes and CAFE standards--to meet commitments, and      they will have numerous opportunities to seek adoption of      these policies.       Finally, the procedures for ratification of, and amendment      to, the Kyoto Protocol make it difficult to remedy before it      enter into force. The Protocol may not be amended, nor can      rules and guidelines be adopted, until after the Protocol      enters, into force. The Clinton Administration is now      considering the negotiation of a separate or supplemental      protocol to attain necessary additional commitments, but this      approach would open all issues to further negotiation.       The Business Roundtable believes that the Congress and the      American people cannot evaluate the Kyoto Protocol until the      Administration sets out a plan as to how it intends to meet      the targets of the Protocol. To place the magnitude of the      U.S. reduction commitments in perspective, it is the      equivalent of having to eliminate all current emissions for      either the U.S. transportation sector, or the utilities      sector (residential and commerical sources), or industry. The      Administration needs to detail how targets in the Protocol      will be met, and how the burden will be distributed among the      various sectors of the economy.       The Business Roundtable feels it is imperative that a      public dialogue take place on the major issues highlighted in      our Gap Analysis before the Protocol becomes the law of the      land and government agencies begin to write regulations.                               ____________________
