I am very much for this. I am a cosponsor of that. I want to pass it as soon as possible.  It's been the chairman's judgment as to when to bring it up. He is going to bring it up, and I am going to bring it as soon thereafter as is practical, which I suspect to be a matter of days. But if he passes it on Thursday and if we are not scheduled to be here on a Friday, I don't know that I will schedule Friday; we may pass it Tuesday, but I expect to pass it very shortly after it passes out of committee.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I will make this pledge: I know you asked me for help. I will help you with this bill, too.
