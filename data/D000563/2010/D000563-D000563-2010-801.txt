 Let me just say that at the end of the day--currently, lobbyists are being paid $120,000 a day by Wall Street to stop this bill. So far, they have Republicans on their side and they have been successful. In an hour, I hope that all changes. Let them join us in a bipartisan effort to make this economy stronger, make the rules work for average people, and to put some protection in there for the consumers of America.  I yield the floor.
