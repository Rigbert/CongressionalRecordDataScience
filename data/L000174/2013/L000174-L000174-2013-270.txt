President, I oppose this amendment because it would significantly delay even the initial registration process.  I have said the pathway to citizenship should not be a false promise. We either make the promise or we don't. It should be attainable, not something that is always over the next mountain.  The drafters worked long and hard to reach a bipartisan agreement. Similar efforts to this were defeated on a bipartisan basis in the Judiciary Committee's consideration because we did not want to make the legalization program inappropriately subject to partisan disputes.  This amendment would simply remove a real promise of citizenship. I oppose the amendment.
