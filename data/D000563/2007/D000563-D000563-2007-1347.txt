President, I rise today to honor PFC Arva ``Marie'' Johnson, who recently retired from the United States Capitol Police force after more than 32 years of dedicated service.  Marie Johnson made history on October 15, 1974, when she became the first woman to serve as a uniformed officer of the U.S. Capitol Police. She also holds the distinction of being the first African-American woman hired by the USCP to serve in a law enforcement capacity.  This could not have been an easy achievement. At the time, the force did not have locker room facilities or even uniforms designed for female officers. But Johnson brought real commitment to the job and a positive attitude that helped her earn respect among her colleagues.  When asked about her historic role in paving the way for female and black officers in the U.S. Capitol Police Force, Marie Johnson said ``I didn't mean to do it, it just happened.''  I believe Marie Johnson is being modest. In fact, she was a founding member of the United States Capitol Black Police Association, an organization that advocates fair hiring practices and performance standards in the Capitol Police Force. The Association seeks to eliminate the barriers that limited the ability of African Americans to pursue careers in law enforcement.  The Capitol Police Force has a very different face now then it did when Marie Johnson joined in 1974. Today there are more than 120 black female officers on the force.  Marie Johnson is a pioneer. Her long career is a testament to her determination and strong work ethic. As a Member of the Senate, I am indebted to those who, like Marie Johnson, put their lives on the line to protect our security here, in this historic building. I commend Marie Johnson on her long and distinguished career. I know my colleagues will join me in wishing her and her family the very best in the years to come.                          ____________________
