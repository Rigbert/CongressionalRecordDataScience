 President, I rise today in support of the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004, a bill that will increase the ability of our civilian agencies to effectively respond to complex emergencies and stabilize countries in the wake of war or crisis.  I commend and express my gratitude to Chairman Lugar for his leadership on this issue. Since December of last year, the chairman and I have been engaged in discussions with experts fromin and outside government on whether the United States is adequately organized and equipped, and its personnel trained, to deal with post-conflict reconstruction. Our premise was this: in the last decade, the United States has taken on post-conflict stabilization missions in countries such as Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Somalia, and now Afghanistan and Iraq. In the decade to come, whether we like it or not, nation building will remain vital to our national security.  We have learned a lot from our efforts. And we have made a lot of mistakes in the process. One lesson that I think is clear is that we have not done a very good job of turning our experience into tools for the future. So the chairman and I put together a group of outside advisers who had held senior positions in the last two administrations; we also invited officials from this administration to give their ideas. The bill we are introducing today is the product of those consultations. I wish to thank all of the participants of the group for their invaluable input to this bipartisan initiative.  Addressing the needs present in post-conflict reconstruction--and in particular, in countries that are on the verge of becoming failed states--is one of the greatest challenges we face today. It matters to the people living in those nations, and it matters to the American people. A bipartisan commission organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Association of the U.S. Army found, to no one's surprise, that ``failed states matter--for national security as well as for humanitarian reasons. If left to their own devices, such states can become sanctuaries for terrorist networks, organized crime and drug traffickers, as well as pose grave humanitarian challenges and threats to regional stability.''  We should not have to reinvent the wheel every time we are faced with a stabilization crisis--it's inefficient and ineffective. Rather than address crises on an ad hoc basis--cobbling together plans, procedures, and personnel--as we have been doing, we need to be forward-thinking, comprehensive, and strategic.  The thrust of this legislation is to do precisely that. The bill authorizes the creation of an office within the State Department that will be the focal point for creating plans and procedures to respond to crises, and it establishes a corps of active duty and reserve personnel who will be able to deploy rapidly when and where critical needs arise.  Mr. President, this bill is not a cure-all. But I believe it is a good start to addressing a critical need: that of strengthening our civilian capacity to handle complex emergencies overseas. Again, I thank Chairman Lugar and the members of our policy advisory group for their work on this issue.  I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
