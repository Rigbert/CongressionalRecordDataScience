President, we have seen an increasing amount of attention on the growing problem of community and hospital-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections. The CDC estimates that in 2005 in the U.S., 94,000 people developed an invasive drug-resistant staph infection. Out of 94,000 infections, researchers found that more than half were acquired in the health care system--people who had recently had surgery or were on kidney dialysis, for example. Nearly 19,000 Americans die, often needlessly, from these infections every year. This is more than the number of people who died from HIV/AIDS, homicide, emphysema, or Parkinson's.  The infections impact not only our civilian families but also our military families. CDC worked with the Army in 2003 to look at an outbreak of serious infections among soldiers. Between March and October 2003, they discovered that 145 American soldiers had been infected with another drug-resistant bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, or ABC. This outbreak of drug-resistant wound infections among soldiers in Iraq appears to have come from the U.S. military hospitals where they were treated, not the battlefield.  Hospitals are taking active steps to identify and control infections, but keep in mind that about half of the infections that end up being treated in a hospital were actually picked up in the community. Schools in Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky have had to close to help contain the spread of an infection. School officials in Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Virginia reported student deaths within the past month from bacteria, while officials in at least four other States reported cases of students being infected. Most recently, a 12-year-old in Brooklyn died from a community-aquired staph infection.  In the State of Illinois, cases of the drug-resistant staph infection closed schools in Aurora and Joliet. Other cases were confirmed in the Indian Prairie School District in the Aurora Naperville area. Two suburban Catholic elementary schools outside of Chicago were closed for heavy-duty cleaning after school leaders discovered each of the student bodies had a case of a drug-resistant staph infection.  States are taking important steps to control staph infection. The State of Illinois has taken aggressive steps to identify the infection before it grows out of control. Illinois is the first State to require testing of all high-risk hospital patients and isolation of those who carry the bacteria called MRSA. Twenty-two States have passed laws that will give their residents important information about hospital infections. Nineteen States have laws that require public reporting of infection rates.  States are actively pursuing the options that the CDC recommends for communities and hospitals to help fight the spread of drug-resistant bugs. It is time for the Federal Government to follow suit.  Today, I introduce the Community and Healthcare Associated Infections Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation builds on what hospitals are already doing and what infectious disease experts and Government agencies agree is critical to reducing the emergence of these infections.  My colleagues, Senator Obama and Senator Schumer, and I introduced this bill because we believe we have a national responsibility to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of community and health care-associated infections. To do so, we need to tackle the problem from all sides.  We need better data to understand the problem at hand. The bill requires hospitals to report infection rates to the Federal Government, which we will then use to target high risk areas, identify hospitals that are doing a good job of controlling infections, and do a better job of communicating what we know to hospitals and health departments around the country. With better data, researchers will learn more about how to treat and, ideally, how to prevent these dangerous infections.  But, reporting is not enough. We need comprehensive infection control programs. The bill commissions an updated, comprehensive look at best practices for hospitals on infection control to provide hospitals the tools they need to best address these infections.  The bill also requires the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study on the creation of a Federal payment system to acknowledge and reward hospitals that are preventing these infections. Would this system work and is it what hospitals need? Hospital workers, doctors, and nurses do their very best to protect patients from infection. What more can be done to reward hospitals that are keeping infection rates low?  In addition, the bill addresses the growing impact of these infections--inside and outside the hospital. A new public health campaign will increase awareness in the public and educate people about reducing and preventing infections, especially in schools, locker rooms, playgrounds--the areas where we know bacteria can thrive. Finally, the bill calls for greater coordination of and greater emphasis on research at the Federal level. There are promising approaches to the control of infectious disease--for example, some investigators are looking at the use of bacteria-resistant surfaces in hospitals and other settings.  In a Nation as rich as ours, with the best health care professionals in the world, we don't expect people to come into a health care setting with a broken bone and then go home with a dangerous infection. Our health care system is safe and high quality, and I think we can only improve on that with a stronger emphasis on prevention, reporting and research. Our patients need it, our families deserve it, and everyone of us wants it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2278       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Community and Healthcare-     Associated Infections Reduction Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Effective antibiotics have transformed the practice of      medicine and saved millions of lives, but the emergence and      spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens poses a      significant threat to patient and public health.       (2) Although many antibiotic-resistant infections occur      most frequently among individuals in hospitals and other      healthcare facilities, they also affect otherwise healthy      individuals in the community.       (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention (referred to in this Act as the ``CDC''),      healthcare-associated infections (referred to in this Act as      ``HAI'') are one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the      United States.       (4) In American hospitals alone, HAI account for an      estimated 1,700,000 infections and 99,000 associated deaths      each year. In 70 percent of these deaths, the bacteria are      resistant to at least one commonly used antibiotic.       (5) Dr. John Jernigan, Chief of Interventions and      Evaluations at the CDC, estimates that HAI in hospitals      result in up to $27,500,000,000 in additional healthcare      costs annually. The growing problem of antibiotic resistance,      which affects the most common and least expensive antibiotics      first, also shifts utilization toward more expensive      antibiotics.       (6) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (referred      to in this Act as ``MRSA''), one of the most dangerous forms      of antibiotic-resistant staph infections, highlights the      magnitude of the problem. A recent study by the CDC estimates      that nearly 95,000 people became infected with invasive MRSA      in 2005 in the United States, resulting in 19,000 deaths,      more than the number who died from HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's      disease, emphysema, or homicide. A vast majority (85 percent)      of these infections were associated with healthcare      treatment.       (7) MRSA also affects individuals outside the healthcare      setting and in the community. Recent weeks have seen an      increase by health and education officials in reported staph      infection outbreaks, including antibiotic-resistant strains.      These infections have occurred in New York, Kentucky,      Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida,      and the District of Columbia.       (8) The problem of antibiotic-resistant infections is not      limited to MRSA. High levels of resistance in enterococci,      Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli      have also been reported.       (9) Antibiotic-resistant infections have been discovered in      troops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. A CDC study      showed that between March and October 2003, 145 United States      service members at military treatment facilities were      infected or colonized with a multidrug-resistant gram-     negative bacterium called Acinetobacter baumannii. The most      likely source of this outbreak was bacteria within deployed      field hospitals.       (10) Despite this significant public health threat,      information on community and healthcare-associated infections      (referred to in this Act as ``CHAI'') is incomplete and      unreliable. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and      individual consumers have little information about hospital      infection rates, making it difficult to diagnose the scope of      the problem and evaluate current infection prevention      efforts, and assess potential remedies.
