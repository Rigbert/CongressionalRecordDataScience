President, my amendment would require the Coast Guard to report to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation on proposed changes to the civil engineering program before the Coast Guard takes any action to alter or reduce operations within this particular program. The mission of the civil engineering program is to provide high-quality planning and real property and facilities maintenance to support Coast Guard units across the country. In my judgment, reducing staff and reorganizing the civil engineering program is not appropriate, given the current workload and the increased number of homeland security responsibilities taken on by the Coast Guard. If significant reductions in personnel and offices take place, I have serious concern that the Coast Guard would not be able to adequately support its shore facilities in New England and across the Nation.  The work performed by employees of the Coast Guard civil engineering program is of paramount importance. It is important that Congress review any plan to reorganize or consolidate this program.  It is my understanding, hope, and expectation that the amendment will be accepted by voice vote. I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and the Commerce Committee for their kindness.
