President, I rise today with great pleasure to recognize Mrs. Ellie McNamara for a career of exemplary service in Vermont public schools. Her career spans four decades, beginning in 1958 as a fourth grade teacher, and for the last 17 years as principal of the C.P. Smith primary school in Burlington. She will retire at the close of this school year.  There is no better evidence than the work of Mrs. McNamara to the truth of the adage, ``There is no substitute for a good teacher.''  The devotion with which she met the challenges of teaching and then as a principal won her the hearts and minds of students, faculty and parents alike. She has made a difference.  Even as she moves into retirement she continues to serve as a role model for all of us. I wish her well as she moves into the next stage of her life.  Marcelle and I have known Ellie McNamara, her husband Jim who is a distinguished lawyer and her wonderful family for decades. Burlington and Vermont are proud of her and her family.  I ask that an article regarding her retirement from the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  The article follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 28, 1998]                      Retirement Is Principal Loss                            (By Anne Geggis)       Guests, gifts and tokens celebrating Ellie McNamara's 17      years leading Burlington's C.P. Smith School keep pouring in      as the days of her career run out.       The message they all bring: Don't go.       Wednesday, community members ranging from kindergartners to      her now-grown students to Gov. Howard Dean gathered to admire      the longtime principal's accomplishments. Janet Breen, a      mother of three, wasn't the only wistful attendee.       ``She's a wonderful woman, wonderful,'' Breen said. ``I      wish she'd retire after my toddler left, but that would be 10      years.''       Dean told the assembled crowd that McNamara is the reason      his kids are in Burlington schools. Faculty members got      teary-eyed talking of the fun she has brought to the New      North End elementary school.       ``It's a huge loss,'' sighed Leslie Kaigle, a School Board      member from the Old North End who has worked with McNamara on      school committees. ``Her connections with families, with      people . . .''       McNamara, however, remains firm that a career started in      1958 teaching his fourth-grade at the now-demolished Converse      School, should come to an end now.       ``You should leave while the audience is still clapping,''      she said, flashing her trademark toothy smile.       The force of a personality that can memorize the names of      all 358 of her students and their siblings and parents, is      something to be reckoned with. In the space of a half hour      Wednesday, she examined a scraped knee, started a purple      fleece jacket on the road to a reunion with its owner and      watched more than 100 wriggling bodies during lunch.       There's a devilish side, too: She's been known to take her      hairdresser's phone calls before the superintendent's.      Holding a conversation with her requires that eyes remained      fixed on her. Look away for a moment and she's gone around a      corner. She's often quoted as saying, ``I've got to see you.      I'll be back on a minute.''       But ask what's planned for C.P. Smith's final assembly on      the last day of school, and the frenetic pace of this 62-     year-old grandmother of six stills.       ``The final assembly . . .'' she said, a catch in her      voice. Eyes suddenly turn misty. ``That's when . . . well, I      can't talk about it now.''       Linda Dion, who has been school secretary for 16 of      McNamara's 17 years, picked up where McNamara left off: ``At      the end of the assembly, the fifth-graders march out as we      sing the C.P. Smith song. This time, Ellie will be marching      out behind them.''                          ____________________
