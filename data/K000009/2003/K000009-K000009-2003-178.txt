Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of women in community development. Women are key leaders in building quality, affordable housing and they are revitalizing their communities in the United States as well as internationally. The central role of women in any effective community development strategy, whether the goal is economic development, housing, education or health, has been well documented.  The National Network of Women in Community Development, in partnership with women community development leaders from across the country are working to bring a collective voice to foster new policies and improve existing ones, which are more responsive to the housing and community development needs of women and children.  On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the McAuley Institute, the only national nonprofit community development intermediary that focuses its resources on the housing and related needs of women and their families, I would like to recognize the vital role that women-led development organizations have played in creating housing across the country and in the restoration of communities.                          ____________________
