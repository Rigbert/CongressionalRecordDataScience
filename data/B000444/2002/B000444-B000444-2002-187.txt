 President, I rise today to pay homage to the legion of African-American leaders who have made extraordinary contributions to humanity by fighting to secure equality and justice for us all. As a consequence of their valiant efforts, people of color can now enjoy a quality of life, including unprecedented educational and professional opportunities, never before realized. Because of their courage, we all can experience the benefits that flow from building a nation that values the creativity and talent of all her citizens. I am, and we all should be, proud to be the beneficiaries of their heroic acts.  Despite the extraordinary accomplishments of the past century, however, we began this new millennium still burdened by the weight of racial prejudice and the hatred, and sometimes violence, that emanates from it. Based on improved data collection efforts, we now know that far too frequently individuals may be victimized or otherwise targeted for vicious acts, simply because of the color of their skin, or the content of their faith, or because of any number of distinguishing characteristics--differences that should form the basis of our best American values, but instead are used to injure certain individuals and tarnish the American spirit.  Simply stated, hate violence is a scourge on our national consciousness, and the incidents of it are embarrassingly high. Perhaps the best-known racially-motivated hate crime in recent years is the callous killing of James Byrd, who, for no other reason except the color of his skin, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and dragged to his death. Mr. Byrd's death was senseless and shocking, but by no means is it the only example of such a crime. Each year, thousands of Americans are subjected to hate crimes, in perhaps not so savage a manner as Mr. Byrd's murder, but no less cruel and no less harmful.  Consider these numbers: while the overall number of crimes reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2000 declined slightly, by 0.2 percent, reported hate crimes increased 2.3 percent, from 7,876 in 1999 to 8,063. And by all indicators, those numbers likely underestimate the true magnitude of hate violence in our country. Studies by organizations like the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives have revealed that countless targets of hate violence, some of whom are immigrants who fear reprisals or deportation, decline to report these crimes to the police.  As disturbing as the quantity of hate crimes committed each year, however, is the record number of young people who are perpetrating these crimes. According to a special report by the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1997 to 1999, 33 percent of all known hate crime offenders were under the age of 18 years. For that same time period, another 29 percent of all hate crime offenders were 18 to 24 years of age. In total, an alarming 62 percent of all offenders were under the age of 24. When they should be imagining their college years or their early career plans, some kids, sometimes suffering under great mental depression, are instead conjuring up awful acts of hatred.  The damage caused by these crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of the physical injury inflicted or the property costs incurred. The devastation they provoke is far greater and much more destructive. These crimes fragment our society and inspire distrust. They fuel fear and suspicion of groups and communities that are unfamiliar. And, perhaps most fatal, they threaten to stall the important growth and community-building that must transpire for this Nation to retain its standing as a world leader for centuries to come.  If we have learned anything from the tragic events of September 11, it is that we cannot tolerate acts of hatred. We must enable a swift and tough law enforcement response by refining Federal hate crime laws, as well as give our children the tools to confront violent bigotry by providing necessary education and programming.  We can undertake to do nothing more important, nor pay any greater tribute to the heroes we honor during Black History Month, than to fight hate violence in every form and in every way we know. The security and safety of all Americans depend on it.                          ____________________
