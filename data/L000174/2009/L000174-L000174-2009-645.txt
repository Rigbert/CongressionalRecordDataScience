Specter):  S. 200. A bill to authorize a cost of living adjustment for the Federal judiciary; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Today I am again introducing legislation to authorize cost of living adjustments, COLA, to the salaries of United States justices and judges. I thank Senator Specter for joining me as a cosponsor of this long overdue bill. This legislation would provide judges the COLA needed to keep pace with inflation. In the last Congress, I supported a cost of living increase for Federal judges; it was not enacted. We are introducing this measure early in this new Congress because of all Federal employees, judges were the only ones who did not receive a COLA in the continuing resolution passed last year.  This bill responds in part to issues raised by Chief Justice Roberts in his ``Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary.'' Chief Justice Roberts noted that ``Judges knew what the pay was when they answered the call of public service. But they did not know that Congress would steadily erode that pay in real terms by repeatedly failing over the years to provide even cost-of-living increases.'' The issue relates to judicial independence, which is critical for preserving our system of government and protecting the rights of all Americans.  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other high-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress enacted Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific congressional action to give COLAs to judges. With the end of the last Congress, however, the continuing resolution providing funding failed to suspend Section 140, thus ensuring that no COLA would be provided for Federal judges during the current fiscal year, unless additional action is taken now. Two years ago, the last time Congress missed making a scheduled cost-of-living adjustment for the judiciary, I sponsored remedial legislation, and it was enacted. We should do so again.  This bipartisan legislation provides a COLA for Federal judges consistent with the law and with fairness. It is vital to the independence of the judiciary and the administration of justice that the Federal bench continues to attract, and keep, the most talented lawyers in the country. I have been dedicated as both Ranking Member and now Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to ensuring the independence of our judiciary.  Some of us have tried over the years to improve the compensation of judges, and I intend again to do what I can to have Congress fairly evaluate this issue to see what solutions may be possible. I hope Congress and the President will reconsider this measure early this year and will do their duty when it comes to fair compensation for the independent judiciary. We can start now by taking up and passing this bill allowing for judicial COLAs.                          ____________________
