Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of Mr. Bradley David DeBraska, a police officer with the Milwaukee Police Department. It gives me great pleasure to join the International Union of Police Associations in recognizing his service to the Milwaukee community.  Mr. DeBraska has honorably served the police force since 1977. He worked tirelessly as a Police Officer, and for the past twelve years has served dual roles as a Police Liaison Officer and Detective. Mr. DeBraska's service also extends to numerous Boards and Associations, helping to guide several police and community organizations. In addition, he faithfully served the residents of Wisconsin as a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. He has truly fulfilled his duty as a citizen of this country.  I am proud of the work that Mr. DeBraska has accomplished in his 28 years of service. Once again, I congratulate him. I wish Mr. DeBraska a healthy and happy retirement.                          ____________________
