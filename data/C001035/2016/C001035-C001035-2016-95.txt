President, I just want to thank the Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia for an excellent statement. As he has indicated, he comes to this issue from the perspective of an attorney who is an expert in the Fair Housing Act, which, as he notes, is a landmark civil rights law. But he also brings a very important perspective of having been a mayor who was the recipient of Federal funds and who looked to HUD for guidance on how to make sure that, when community development block grant monies, for example, were given to local communities, the communities used them in ways that carried out the goals of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. It is very valuable that he has both the technical understanding of an attorney who has practiced in this very field for many years and also as a municipal official who had to live with the Federal rules.  The fact is, as he indicated, the Fair Housing Act regulation that came out last year is intended to give clarity to local officials who are the recipients of Federal funds.  I am very much opposed to the amendment offered by Senator Lee that would prohibit any funding for carrying out HUD's affirmatively furthering fair housing rules.  It is important to recognize that this rule didn't just come out of the blue. It is based on a specific requirement included in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which mandates that HUD ensure that the recipients of Federal funds not only prevent outright blatant discrimination but also act to affirmatively further the fair housing goals of the act.  In fact, Congress has repeatedly reinforced this concept in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, and the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. All of those laws require HUD program recipients to affirmatively further fair housing. It is probably a phrase that most of us are not that aware of, and it does not come trippingly off of one's tongue. But it is an integral part of the 1968 civil rights law, the Fair Housing Act.  It is also important to remember that when we are discussing fair housing, we are not only talking about discrimination based on race but also discrimination based on disabilities, national origin, and even against families with children.  It is important to note that more than 50 percent of all reported complaints of housing discrimination are initiated by individuals with disabilities. That is one reason the Paralyzed Veterans of America organization has come out so strongly against the amendment that will be offered by Senator Lee.  In a letter issued by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the organization notes:       HUD's AFFH rule helps curb discrimination against people      with disabilities, including veterans and the elderly. Each      year, over 50% of all reported complaints of housing      discrimination are initiated by people with disabilities.  The organization goes on to say:       This alarming trend will continue and affects Americans      returning from conflicts abroad with a disability and the      growing percentage of elderly Americans with a disability.      HUD's AFFH rule will help governments identify strategies and      solutions to expand accessible and supportive housing choices      for our veterans and elders with disabilities.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Paralyzed Veterans of America be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                                   Washington, DC.             Vote ``No'' on Lee Anti-Civil Rights Amendment       Senator Mike Lee plans to introduce an amendment to the      FY17 T-HUD/MilCon-VA appropriations bill which would prohibit      HUD from implementing or enforcing its ``Affirmatively      Furthering Fair Housing'' (AFFH) rule (FR-5173-P-01), keeping      long-awaited guidance and data intended to help state and      local govemments connect housing and community development      dollars to neighborhood opportunity. Any limitation or      reversal of HUD's AFFH rule will stop our nation from      ensuring that federal investments connect every neighborhood      to good schools, well-paying jobs, public transportation      options, and safe places for children to play and grow.       Senator Lee's amendment would halt implementation of the      Fair Housing Act and throw our nation back into the pre-civil      rights era. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was intended to      prohibit discrimination and dismantle historic segregation,      which continues to limit the housing choices and      opportunities of people of color, people with disabilities,      families with children, and religious groups. To achieve this      goal, the Fair Housing Act requires that recipients of      federal housing and community development funding      ``affirmatively further fair housing'' (AFFH).       HUD's AFFH Rule closes recommendations made by the GAO. In      2010 the GAO issued a report recommending that HUD reform its      process of implementing the AFFH provision of the Fair      Housing Act and the guidance that it provides to grantees.      HUD's rule implements the GAO's recommendations by providing      state and local governments and PHAs with data about the      demographics and housing needs of their communities as well      as a framework that they can use to identify and address      issues that contribute to isolation and economic inequality.       HUD's proposed rule emphasizes local control in the      development and implementation of solutions to remove      obstacles to opportunity. Once an analysis of the barriers to      fair housing is complete, governments and PHAs have the power      to decide for themselves which issues they and local      stakeholders identify are important to prioritize and      address. HUD leaves these choices to the discretion of local      governments and PHAs.       HUD's AFFH rule helps curb discrimination against people      with disabilities, including veterans and the elderly. Each      year, over 50% of all reported complaints of housing      discrimination are initiated by people with disabilities.      This alarming trend will continue and affects Americans      returning from conflicts abroad with a disability and the      growing percentage of elderly Americans with a disability.      HUD's AFFH rule will help governments identify strategies and      solutions to expand accessible and supportive housing choices      for our veterans and elders with disabilities.
