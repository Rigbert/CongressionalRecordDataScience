 In the 1958 case of NAACP v. Alabama, the Court ruled definitively on the issue of whether a group could be required to disclose its membership or donor list as a precondition for criticism or discussion of public issues. So the Supreme Court very much is opposed to requiring groups, as a condition of engaging in issue advocacy, constitutionally-protected speech, that they have to disclose their list.  Interestingly enough, two groups that certainly have not been aligned with this Senator on this issue over the years had something to say about that. Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, on the question of disclosure of issue advocacy:       Top officials in Public Citizen and the Sierra Club      Foundation, a separate tax-exempt offshoot of the      environmental organization, argued that divulging their donor      lists would either give an unfair advantage to competitors or      unfairly expose identities of their members.       ``As I am sure you are aware, citizens have a First      Amendment right to form organizations to advance their common      goals without fear of investigation or harassment.''  That was Joan Claybrook, with whom I have dueled on this issue for a decade, in response to questions about whether or not Public Citizen would be willing to disclose their donor list. Claybrook goes on:       We respect our members' right to freely and privately      associate with others who share their beliefs, and we do not      reveal their identities. We will not violate their trust      simply to satisfy the curiosity of Congress or the press.       Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the      Sierra Club Foundation, said [of] donors to the separate      Sierra Club's political action committee . . .  Of course they are required to disclose, because they engage in express advocacy. That is part of hard money, part of the Federal campaign system. What Senator Snowe's amendment is about is issue advocacy, which is an entirely different subject under Supreme Court interpretations; an entirely different subject.  Now, the Sierra Club said with regard to compelling them to disclose their membership as a precondition for engaging in issue advocacy--Hamilton said:       That is basically saying, ``Turn around and give us your      membership . . . . We want public disclosure of the 650,000      members of the Sierra Club, which is a valuable resource,      coveted by others, because they can turn around and make      their own list.''  The last thing he had to say I find particularly interesting, and knowing the occupant of the Chair is from out West, he might appreciate this. He said:       It can also be turned around and used against them. We have      members in small towns in Wyoming and Alaska (who could by      hurt) if word got out that they belong to the Sierra Club.  So I say to my friend from Maine, this is not in a gray area. The Supreme Court has opined on the question of the Government requiring a donor list of groups as a precondition for expressing themselves at any time--close to an election or any other time.  My good friend from Maine also cited a 1990 case, commonly referred to as the Austin case, in support of the notion that, somehow, the Court would sanction this new category of electioneering. The Austin case, I am sure my good friend from Maine knows, had to do with express advocacy, not issue advocacy. In the Austin case, they banned express advocacy by corporate treasurers. That of course has been the law since 1907. That is not anything new. You can't use corporate treasury money to engage in express advocacy of a candidate.  But the definitive case on the issue the Senator from Maine is really talking about, because her amendment deals with issue advocacy, is First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti in 1978, where the Court held that corporations could fund out of their treasuries--out of their treasuries, issue advocacy.  So, with all due respect to my good friend from Maine, the courts have already ruled on the kind of issues that she is discussing here. No. 1, you can't compel the production of membership lists as a condition to criticize all of us. And, No. 2, issue advocacy cannot be redefined by Congress. The courts have defined what issue advocacy is.  Now, with regard to the opinion of various scholars, let me just say America's expert on the first amendment isthe American Civil Liberties Union, and they wrote me just yesterday, giving their view on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. Let me read a pertinent part.       We are writing today, however, to set forth our views on an      amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue      advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and      Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a      compromise measure which would replace certain of the more      egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-     Feingold, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment still embodies the      kind of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that      violates bedrock First Amendment principles.       Those time-honored principles were set forth with great      clarity in Buckley v. Valeo.  Which we frequently refer to. The ACLU goes on:       First, ``issue advocacy'' is at the core of democracy. In      rejecting the claim that issue-oriented speech about      incumbent politicians had to be regulated because it might      influence public opinion and affect the outcome of elections,      the Supreme Court reminded us of the critical relationship      between unfettered issue advocacy and healthy democracy.      ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the      qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of      the system of government established by our Constitution.''  Further, the ACLU said:       . . . in an election season, citizens and groups cannot      effectively discuss issues if they are barred from discussing      candidates who take stands on those issues. ``For the      distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and      advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often      dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially      incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving      legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do      candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on      various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate      issues of public interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43. If any reference      to a candidate in the context of advocacy on an issue      rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign      finance controls, the consequences for First Amendment rights      would be intolerable.       Third [the ACLU says] to guard against that, the Court      fashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine.  The Court fashioned it. They didn't say, Congress, you can make up something called electioneering. This is not our prerogative. The Court fashioned the critical express advocacy doctrine, which holds that:       Only express advocacy of electoral outcomes may be subject      to any form of restraint. Thus, only ``communications that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate'' can be subject to any campaign finance      controls.  Express advocacy: Within the Federal Election Campaign Act. Issue advocacy: Outside the Federal Election Campaign Act. That just didn't happen last year. This has been the law since Buckley. Issue advocacy has been around since the beginning of the country.       Finally, and most importantly, all speech which does not in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate is totally immune from any regulation;  The ACLU continued:       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to      safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even      though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an      election. The doctrine provides a bright-line, objective test      that protects political speech and association by focusing      solely on the content of the speaker's words, not the motive      in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's      audience, or the proximity to an election.       Nor does it matter whether the issue advocacy is      communicated on radio or television, in newspapers or      magazines, through direct mail or printed pamphlets. What      counts for constitutional purposes is not the medium, but the      message.  My understanding of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is that these restrictions only apply to television and radio. But there is no constitutional basis for sort of segmenting out television and radio and saying those kinds of expenditures require the triggering of disclosure, but it's OK to go on and engage in direct mail or presumably telephones or anything other than the broadcast medium. That is in a somehow different category.  By the same token, it is constitutionally irrelevant whether the message costs $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. It is content, not amount, that marks the constitutional boundary for allowable regulation and frees issue advocacy from any impermissible restraint. The control of issue advocacy is simply beyond the pale of legislative authority.  So the Snowe-Jeffords amendment violates these cardinal principles. First, the amendment's new category, which we have not heard before, of electioneering communication is simply old wine in old bottles with a new label. The provision would reach, regulate and control any person, group or organization which spent more than $10,000 in an entire calendar year for any electioneering communications.  The ACLU says that critical term is defined solely as any broadcast communication which refers to any Federal candidate at any time within 60 days before a general or 30 days before a primary election and is primarily intended to be broadcast to the electorate for that election, whatever that means.  The unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express advocacy simply because it refers to a Federal candidate who is more often than not a congressional incumbent during an election season.  The ACLU says the first amendment disables Congress from enacting such a measure regardless of whether the provision includes a monetary threshold, covers only broadcast media, applies only to speech during an election season and employs prohibition or disclosure as its primary regulatory device. It would still cast a pall over grassroots lobbying and advocacy communication by nonpartisan, issue-oriented groups like the ACLU, for example.  It would do so by imposing burdensome, destructive and unprecedented disclosure and organizational requirements and barring use of any organizational funding for such communications if any corporations or unions made any donations to the organization.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire letter.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                             ACLU,                                   Washington National Office,                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1998.       Dear Senator: We have shared with you our grave concerns      about the different versions of the McCain-Feingold campaign      finance bill that have been before the Senate. (See ``Dear      Senator'' letter dated February 19, 1998 and enclosure.) For      the reasons we have stated previously, the most recent      ``pared down'' reincarnation of that bill remains      fundamentally flawed, and we continue fully to oppose it.       We are writing today, however, to set forth our views on an      amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue      advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and      Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a      compromise measure which would replace certain of the more      egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-     Feingold, the Snow-Jeffords amendment still embodies the kind      of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that violates      bedrock First Amendment principles.       Those time-honored principles were set forth with great      clarity in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) and reaffirmed      by numerous Supreme Court and lower court rulings ever since.       First, ``issue advocacy'' is at the core of democracy. In      rejecting the claim that issue-oriented speech about      incumbent politicians had to be regulated because it might      influence public opinion and affect the outcome of elections,      the Supreme Court reminded us of the critical relationship      between unfettered issue advocacy and healthy democracy.      ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the      qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of      the system of government established by our Constitution.''      424 U.S. at 14.       Second, in an election season, citizens and groups cannot      effectively discuss issues if they are barred from discussing      candidates who take stands on those issues. ``For the      distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and      advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often      dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially      incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving      legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do      candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on      various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate      issues of public interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43.

Thus, only ``communications that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate'' can be subject to any campaign finance      controls.       Finally, and most importantly, all speech which does not in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate is totally immune from any regulations;      ``So long as persons and groups eschew     expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to      spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his      views.'' 424 U.S. at 45.       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to      safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even      though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an      election. The doctrine provides a bright-line, objective test      that protects political speech and association by focusing      solely on the content of the speaker's words, not the motive      in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's      audience, or the proximity to an election.       Nor does it matter whether the issue advocacy is      communicated on radio or television, in newspapers or      magazines, through direct mail or printed pamphlets. What      counts for constitutional purposes is not the medium, but the      message. By the same token, it is constitutionally irrelevant      whether the message costs $100 or $1,000 or $100,000. It is      content, not amount, that marks the constitutional boundary      of allowable regulation and frees issue advocacy from any      impermissible restraint. The control of issue advocacy is      simply beyond the pale of legislative authority.       The Snowe-Jeffords amendment violates these cardinal      principles.       First, the amendment's new category of ``electioneering      communication'' is simply old wine in old bottles with a new      label. The provision would reach, regulate and control any      person, group or organization which spent more than $10,000,      in an entire calendar year, for any ``electioneering      communications.'' That critical term is defined solely as      any broadcast communication which ``refers to'' any      federal candidate, at any time within 60 days before a      general or 30 days before a primary election, and ``is      primarily intended to be broadcast to the electorate'' for      that election, whatever that may mean.       This unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to      regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express      advocacy, simply because it ``refers to'' a federal      candidate--who is more often than not a Congressional      incumbent--during an election season. The First Amendment      disables Congress from enacting such a measure regardless of      whether the provision includes a monetary threshold, covers      only broadcast media, applies only to speech during an      election season and employs prohibition or disclosure as its      primary regulatory device. It would still cast a pall over      grass-roots lobbying and advocacy communication by non-     partisan issue-oriented groups like the ACLU. It would do so      by imposing burdensome, destructive and unprecedented      disclosure and organizational requirements, and barring use      of any organizational funding for such communications if any      corporations or unions made any donations to the      organization. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment would force such      groups to choose between abandoning their issue advocacy or      dramatically changing their organizational structure and      sacrificing their speech and associational rights.       Beyond this new feature, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment      simply leaves in place many of the objectionable features of      McCain-Feingold that we have criticized previously. One is      the unprecedented generic expansion of the definition of      ``express advocacy'' applicable to all forms of political      communication going forward in all media and occurring all      year long. Another are the intrusive new ``coordination''      rules which will be so destructive of the ability of issue      organizations to communicate with elected officials on such      issues and later communicate to the public in any manner on      such issues. And the radically expanded activities      encompassed within the new category of ``electioneering      communications'' would be subject to those radically expanded      coordination restrictions as well. The net result will be to      make it virtually impossible for any issue organization to      communicate, directly or indirectly, with any politician on      any issue and then communicate on that same issue to the      public.       All of this will have an exceptionally chilling effect on      organized issue advocacy in America by the hundreds and      thousands of groups that enormously enrich political debate.      The bill flies in the face of well-settled Supreme Court      doctrine which is designed to keep campaign finance      regulations from ensnaring and overwhelming all political and      public speech. And the bill will chill issue discussion of      the actions of incumbent officeholders standing for re-     election at the very time when it is most vital in a      democracy: during an election season. It may be inconvenient      for incumbent politicians when groups of citizens spend money      to inform the voters about a politician's public stands on      controversial issues, like abortion, but it is the essence of      free speech and democracy.       In conclusion, the ACLU remains thoroughly opposed to      McCain-Feingold. The ACLU continues to believe that the most      effective and least constitutionally problematic route to      genuine reform is a system of equitable and adequate public      financing. While reasonable people may disagree about the      proper approaches to campaign finance reform, McCain-     Feingold's restraints on issue advocacy raise profound      constitutional problems, and nothing in the Snowe-Jeffords      amendment cures those fatal First Amendment flaws.           Sincerely,     Laura W. Murphy,       Director, ACLU Washington Office.     Joel Gora,       Dean & Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School and Counsel to      the ACLU.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will discuss this issue further tomorrow. Let me sum it up by saying the courts are clear. The definition of express advocacy has been written into the laws of this country through court decisions. It is clear what issue advocacy is. It is clear that under previous Supreme Court decisions that you cannot compel a group to disclose its donors or membership lists as a condition for expressing themselves on issues in proximity to an election or any other time for that matter.  Mr. President, I will be happy to discuss these issues further tomorrow. With that, I yield the floor.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Vermont.
