First of all, I have been told by the budget analysts that, in fact, they were not offset. Some of them proposed tax increases. You could call that an offset. I don't. That is increasing taxes to do it.  We are getting off center from the purpose of my amendment. My amendment does something specifically that you can't argue against. You are either for or against it. As I look at these, these are specific amendments. It shows the amount, what the amendment does, and the years that would be affected. So it is true that that would be over a 5-year period because that is what the amendment was for. But if you take that on to the end of it----
