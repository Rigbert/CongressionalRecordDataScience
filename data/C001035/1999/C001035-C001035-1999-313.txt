President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would establish a commission to study the impact of deregulation of the airline industry on small-town America. For too long, we have allowed small and medium-sized communities from Bangor, Maine to Billings, Montana to Bristol, Tennessee to weather the effects of airline deregulation without adequately assessing how deregulation has affected their economic development, the quality and availability of air transportation for their residents, and the long-term viability of their local airports. It is time to evaluate the effects of airline deregulation in a new, meaningful way.  The 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has dramatically shaped the modern airline industry and the way Americans travel. The purpose of deregulation was to harness the market in order to foster competition that would improve service and lower costs for consumers. According to some measures, this market experiment has been a success. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, since the advent of deregulation, the average airfare in major hubs has been reduced by 35 percent. Economists at George Mason University and the Brookings Institution estimate that the increased competition resulting from deregulation saves consumers billions of dollars.  Similarly, other studies conducted by the General Accounting Office have shown that deregulation has ushered in an overall decline in airfares and an improvement in the quality of air service--although many of us who fly frequently would take strong issue with the finding of improved quality.  For many large cities, this is as far as the story needs be told. But for many smaller and medium-sized communities, several chapters remain. The rest of the story tells us that deregulation's benefits are not evenly distributed throughout U.S. markets. Although a March 1999 GAO report found that, on average, airfares declined about 21 percent from 1990 to the second quarter of 1998, it also found that airports serving small communities have experienced the lowest average decline in airfare. Similarly, the Department of Transportation has found that the competition encouraged by deregulation has not made its way to all parts of our great nation. Indeed, the number of cities served by more than two airlines has fallen 41 percent since 1989.  In short, there are signs that the airline deregulation story is not good for smaller and medium-sized communities--like Presque Isle and Bangor in my state. There are important areas of inquiry that, I believe, no one has yet explored, and that is why I am introducing this bill today.  We need to know more about how airline deregulation has affected smaller and medium-sized communities, and we need to focus on the relationship between access to affordable, quality airline service and the economic development of America's smaller communities. As many communities continue to struggle to attract businesses, it is not enough for us report that airfares, in the aggregate, have decreased in constant dollars. Nor is it sufficient to select certain proxies for quality air travel and to conclude that quality has improved. Just as not all communities have benefitted equally from our recent prosperity, not all can say that deregulation has enhanced their air transportation. We need to evaluate how airline deregulation has affected these communities' ability to compete for business development, job creation, and economic expansion. In the process, we need to differentiate between business and leisure travel, as each serves a very different set of needs in our communities. And we much ask communities how they measure quality service, instead of making assumptions that may or may not apply to a given area.  What I am proposing is a thorough evaluation of the effects of airline deregulation on communities--an evaluation that has not yet been done, but would happen under the bill I introduce today.  Mr. President, during the past 20 years, air travel has become increasingly linked to business development. Successful businesses expect and need to be able to travel quickly over long distances. It is expected that a region being considered for business location or expansion should be reachable, conveniently, via airplane. Those areas without air access, or with access that is restricted by prohibitive costs of travel, infrequent flights, or small,slower planes are at a distinct disadvantage compared to those areas that enjoy accessible, convenient, and economical air service.  This country's air infrastructure has grown to the point where it now rivals our ground transportation infrastructure in its importance to the economic viability of communities. It has long been accepted that building a highway creates an almost instant corridor of economic activity of businesses eager to cut shipping and transportation costs by locating close to the stream of commerce. Like a community located on an interstate versus one only reachable by back roads, a community with a mid-size or small airport underserved by air carriers operates at a distinct disadvantage to one located near a large airport.  Bob Ziegelaar, Director of the Bangor, Maine International Airport, perhaps put it best. He tells me, ``Communities like Bangor are at risk of being left with service levels below what the market warrants both in terms of capacity and quality. The follow-on consequences is a decreasing capacity to attract economic growth.''  This issue is of critical importance and has not received the attention it deserves. The legislation I have introduced will result in a comprehensive examination of how this complicated issue affects the economy of small town America. It would establish a commission of 15 members from all areas of the country, including at least five members from rural areas, to study and report on the effects of airline deregulation. The Commission will examine a vital component of the deregulated airline industry--the effects on economic development and job creation, particularly in areas that are underserved by air carriers.  The Commission will also explore the broader effects of deregulation on affordability, accessibility, availability, and the quality of air transportation, nationally and in small-sized and medium-sized communities. It will explore deregulation's impact on the economical viability of smaller airports and the long-term configuration of the U.S. passenger air transportation system.  Mr. President, sometimes the best use we can make of the Senate's legislative powers is to study the results of our previous actions. In passing airline deregulation, Congress unleashed the power of competition with many positive benefits for consumers who live in large cities. It is now time to evaluate the impact on residents living in small-town America.  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1576       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
