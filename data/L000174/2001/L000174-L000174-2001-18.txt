 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Daschle, and the distinguished deputy majority leader, Mr. Reid, who have worked so hard to get these nominations on the calendar so we can vote on them.  William Johnson is the third Federal judge confirmed from New Mexico in just the past few weeks. We expedited the consideration of Christina Armijo in October, who was confirmed last month; likewise, Harris Hartz, President Bush's nominee to the Tenth Circuit from New Mexico. I had a hearing at the end of October, and he was confirmed last week. All three of these nominees came to us with the strong support of both Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman.  I mention this because it is so helpful to our committee when the White House takes time to consult with both Senators from the home State and get their support. We got this kind of consensus: When we confirm Mr. Johnson, we are going to fill another judicial emergency vacancy. After that, we are going to another nominee, Clay Land, who has been supported by Senators Cleland and Miller. I mention this because if we confirm both these next 2, we will have confirmed 27 Federal judges since July, when I took over the chairmanship, and 6 court of appeals judges.  To put that in perspective, since July, in those 5 months, we have confirmed as many as we confirmed all of the first year of the last President's administration--actually, a lot more judges in the courts of appeals.  Everybody has been working very hard. I also mention to my colleagues, this morning we were finally able to get a quorum in the Judiciary Committee. We had 10 nominations go through, 5 of them judges, 5 other nominations from the Department of Justice, all of which will go now on the calendar.
