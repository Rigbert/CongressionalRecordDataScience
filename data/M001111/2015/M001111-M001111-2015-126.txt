 President, due to inclement weather causing a flight delay, I was unavoidably detained during consideration of Brown amendment No. 1242 and missed the rollcall vote that occurred on Monday, May 18. As a cosponsor of S. 568, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015, and supporter of trade adjustment assistance for workers here at home, had I been present I would have voted yea.                          ____________________
