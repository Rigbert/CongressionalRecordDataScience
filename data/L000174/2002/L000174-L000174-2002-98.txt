I thank Senator Sessions for his statement yesterday in support of the bipartisan conference report on DOJ authorization. I do that because I know he opposes a significant piece of it, Senator Hatch's legislation regarding automobile dealer arbitration, but I applaud Senator Sessions for reaching beyond that for the better bill, the overall bill.  I compliment his work on the conference report on the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Grants, the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Alabama, and a number of other States.  In a hurried time, and sometimes partisan Senate, we do not take enough time to acknowledge and appreciate work done by those on the other side of the aisle. I take this moment to express my appreciation of the work of the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.
