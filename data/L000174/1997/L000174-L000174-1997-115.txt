President, I think it is regrettable that this week the Senate has failed to consider and confirm judges necessary to fill vacancies that are leading to a crisis in the Federal courts. Instead, this is going to be remembered as the week that the Republican leadership in the House and the Republican leadership in the Senate talked openly about seeking to intimidate--their word--to intimidate the Federal judiciary.  I regret that any Senator or any Member of the House of either party would speak of a desire to intimidate the Federal judiciary. One of the greatest hallmarks of the United States ofAmerica is that we have an independent Federal judiciary of the highest integrity. We are the envy of the world in that respect. To hear Republican leaders in the House and the Senate talk about intimidating that Federal judiciary was disheartening. It indicates our system of government showing disrespect to the intelligence of the American people and sends a signal of shame throughout the world.  These partisan attacks threaten the independence that the Founders created to insulate the judiciary from politics. These attacks threaten the checks and balances on the political branches of our Federal Government that have served us so well for over 200 years. These bedrock principles have helped preserve our freedoms for two centuries and has helped make this country a model for emerging democracies around the world.  Not since Congress and the American people rejected the Court-packing scheme over 60 years ago have we faced such a threat to our third branch of Government and its ability to act as the guardian of our constitutionally guaranteed rights.  On Sunday, Congressman DeLay of Texas was quoted in the Washington Post openly asserting that ``The judges need to be intimidated.'' We have heard Republicans clamor for impeachment when a judge renders a decision with which a Republican Member of the House of Representatives disagrees. We have heard demands that Congress destroy the orderly process of appellate court and Supreme Court review and, instead, assume the role of a supercourt and legislatively review and veto decisions on a case-by-case basis as it may suit Congress' passing political whim and fancy.  We have seen proposals to amend the U.S. Constitution to eliminate the independence and tenure that the Founders understood were essential if judges were to act impartially and in the interest of justice in each case rather than worry about partisan intrigue.  This extreme rhetoric and outlandish proposals have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere in which the Federal justice system is overloaded. We have heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee from judges around the country who fear that the quality of justice they will be able to provide in our Federal courts will be adversely affected. More and more courts around the country are being forced to rely on senior judges, retired judges, and visiting judges to hear cases. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals expects to include an outside visiting temporary judge on 80 percent--80 percent--of its panels over this year.  Other appellate courts have had to forego oral arguments in more and more cases, and litigants, the people who are paying the bills, the taxpayers of the United States, are denied any opportunity to see the judges who are deciding their causes and to have any reassurance that judges are personally considering their arguments and concerns. Court clerks and attorney staff are being used more and more extensively in the determination of cases as judges become overburdened and backlogs grow.  These are not the way to engender confidence in our system of justice or acceptance of the process and decisions being rendered or respect for courts and the Government.  The chief judge of the eleventh circuit has testified about ``crushing workloads.'' He has noted that Federal courts are ``no longer able to provide the public with the same standard of excellent service that [they] did in the past.'' The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, has called the rising number of Federal judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the Federal judiciary.'' He warned at the end of 1996 that ``filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.''  The second shoe dropped on Wednesday when it was reported that the Republican leader of the Senate echoed the sentiments of Mr. DeLay and defended the idea of Republicans plotting to intimidate the Federal judiciary and said, ``It sounds like a good idea to me.'' I can only hope that the reports of this exchange with the majority leader of the Senate were in error. For the Republican leader in the Senate to join Republican leaders in the House in an acknowledged effort to undercut the independence and integrity of the Federal judiciary would be a sign of grave danger for the American people and would be a sign of danger for the system of government that has protected this democracy for over 200 years.  Wednesday marked the 210th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. Rather than commemorating the principles that helped make this country great, the Republican leadership's statements this week undermined the separation of powers on which our charter is based.  Last Congress, the Republican leadership was bent on shutting down the executive branch of the Government. I remember being on the floor of the Senate arguing against that, but they shut down the Government. The American people rose up and rejected that effort outright, as the American people should. In my State, Republicans and Democrats alike roundly condemned what was done.  So now, these Republican forces have turned their fire on the branch of Government most protective of the people's rights but least equipped to protect itself from political attack.  They might not be able to speak up, but I will, because this year's continuing attack on the judicial branch, the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread threats of impeachment are all part of a partisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary. Judges cannot take the floor of the U.S. Senate and defend themselves. I will.  I have felt privileged to serve in the U.S. Senate representing the State of Vermont for 23 years. I have served twice in the majority in the Senate and twice in the minority in the Senate. I have served with Republican and Democratic Presidents, and I have worked alongside great majority leaders, like Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell. I have never known a time when the leadership of the Senate would tolerate partisan and ideological politics so diverting this institution from its constitutional responsibilities with respect to the third constitutionally coequal branch of Government. If Wednesday's reports are accurate, sadly the American people must know that not only is the Senate leadership allowing these efforts, it is condoning them.  Mr. President, the United States is a great democracy, I believe the greatest democracy history has ever known. Something that sets our great country apart from virtually all others in the world is the independence of our Federal judiciary and the respect that it commands among all of us.  Every nation in this century that has moved from a dictatorship toward democracy has sent observers to the United States. Why? To see how they can emulate our judiciary.  Those working for democracy in countries that are still struggling to adopt democratic principles know that one thing that is holding them back, one thing that allows crime and corruption and economic breakdown, is a lack of a truly independent judiciary. They know that unless they can come close to something like our independent judiciary, they will never become truly great democracies or truly free.  We have the greatest judicial system in the world. We are the envy of people around the world who are struggling for freedom. Independence of our third coequal branch of Government helps allow it to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches that are so easily susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment.  This is a sad week for America because it is a week in which a campaign to intimidate Federal judges was acknowledged and condoned.  Mr. President, I call upon the U.S. Senate to reject that effort and go forward to fulfil our constitutionally mandated duty to advise and consent on the nominations of judges that the President has sent to us. Vote them up or vote them down, but show that we are united, whatever party we belong to, in protecting the integrity and, most importantly, the independence of our Federal judiciary.                          ____________________
