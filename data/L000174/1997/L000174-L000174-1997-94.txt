President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I would like bring to the attention of the Senate a breast cancer survivor in Vermont who has poured herself into reaching out to others who are dealing with this devastating disease, and who has made finding a cure her lifetime crusade.  Pat Barr of Bennington, VT, is a true example of one person being able to make a difference.  It was a visit in early 1992 from Pat and several other Vermont women--grassroots organizers and survivors of breast cancer--that led to my long involvement in working with others to address the urgent need for more intensive research on breast cancer, which has taken the lives of more than 1 million women over the past 35 years.  Soon after that visit I was joined by several Members of Congress in starting a congressional campaign to help eradicate breast cancer. We began by introducing a resolution urging the Secretary of Health and Human Services to declare breast cancer a public health emergency. The resolution raised public awareness about breast cancer and sent a strong message that we needed to accelerate the investigation into the causes, treatments, and prevention of this illness.  Pat Barr's support, energy, and determination to make a difference has immeasurably helped me in efforts to elevate breast cancer research as a Federal priority, including in the annual Department of Defense budget, where we have been able to allocate $737.5 million for breast cancer research over the past 6 years.  She also worked closely with Congressman Sanders and with me in envisioning and crafting a new tool in the struggle to find a cure for all cancers: the National Program for Cancer Registries. Cancer registries serve as a foundation for a national, comprehensive prevention strategy. They monitor trends in the incidence of breast cancers and other cancers and in mortality rates, as well as offering a source for population-based epidemiologic research at NIH and other research institutions.  For a decade, Pat has tirelessly volunteered her time and energy to this effort. Pat is the founder of the Breast Cancer Network of Vermont. She has been a board member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition since its inception in 1991. She has served as a consumer advocate on panels at the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Army Breast Cancer Research Program.  Earlier this year, Vermonters honored Pat by dedicating the annual Vermont Race for the Cure in her honor.  A recent editorial in the Bennington Banner said it best: ``Pat Barr is a hero worth honoring.''  I ask that the text of the editorial be printed in the Record.  The editorial follows:                   Pat Barr Is a Hero Worth Honoring       You can make a difference. One local woman has shown the      way. Pat Barr of Shaftsbury has taken her experience with the      disease of breast cancer and turned it into a crusade for      better research with impacts from Bennington to Washington,      D.C.       And because of that personal achievement, the Annual Susan      G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Vermont Race for the Cure      was dedicated this year to Barr. The Sunday race is designed      to raise funds for breast cancer research, with 75 percent of      the money staying in Vermont.       Barr's own experience with breast cancer began in 1987,      when she was diagnosed. It has reoccurred since then, but      despite that Barr has not turned from her decade of tireless      work.       Barr founded the Breast Cancer Network, a Vermont advocacy      and service organization based in Bennington and also serving      New York and Massachusetts. The network helps area women get      tests, information and services.       She joined Vermont's U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy and U.S. Rep.      Bernard Sanders in developing the National Cancer Registry.      She worked with Leahy in his fight to secure an additional      $300 million toward breast cancer research in 1992.       Her efforts eventually took her to Washington with 2.6      million signatures to convince President Clinton to approve a      national action plan to fight breast cancer.       Barr, a mother, attorney and businesswoman, has also been      active in the Vermont Civil Liberties Union and the Vermont      Bar Association and was a member of the State Board of      Education.       Barr has kept her faith--she is a member of the      Congregation Beth El in Bennington and was instrumental in      its resurgence.       She is a role model and a credit to this community.       Barr is a local hero who cannot be honored enough for her      work for Vermont women.                          ____________________
