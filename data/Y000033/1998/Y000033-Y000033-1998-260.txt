Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Again, this is our opportunity, as we close this debate to thank everybody participating in the debate for their decorum and their honesty and their strong beliefs. I believe that this is the correct way to go. I believe it is the right thing to do. This is justice.  I will strongly oppose the Solomon amendment. I will support the bipartisan amendment of Burton-Young-Miller, and I suggest respectfully that this is the right thing for Congress today. And as we stop this great century and begin a new century, the right thing to do for the Americans of Puerto Rico and the great United States of America.
