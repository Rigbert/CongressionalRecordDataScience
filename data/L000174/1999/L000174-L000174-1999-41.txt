President, again, I reiterate what I said before: The Senator from Iowa and I, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and Senator Hatch have all been working very hard. We have gone from 300 some odd amendments down to only a half dozen or so remaining. I will continue to work with my friend from Iowa to try to clear whatever we can.
