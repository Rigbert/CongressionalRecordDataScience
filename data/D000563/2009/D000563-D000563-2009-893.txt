I will tell you that I think the Republican leader is out of step with America. America understands we need to do something about our health care system. We are spending twice as much per person for health care in America as any nation on Earth--twice as much--and the medical outcomes, unfortunately, do not reflect that kind of major investment. In other words, we are wasting money in our current health care system.  That has to change. So what we need to do is preserve those things in our health care system today that are good and fix the things that are broken, and that is what the President has challenged us to do. This is not something new. This challenge has been waiting for 15 years since former President Clinton tackled it and, unfortunately, could not pass it. We have seen our health care costs in America continue to skyrocket and our costs for health insurance following in track. Now we have to do something about it.  Time and again, the Senator from Kentucky comes to the floor and says: We are rushing into this. I would just say to him that in the year 2008 the Senate Finance Committee, under Chairman Max Baucus, held 10 hearings on health reform and a day-long bipartisan summit with the Finance Committee's ranking member, Republican Chuck Grassley. This year, the Finance Committee has held two reform-related hearings, three roundtabless, three walk-throughs with policy options, and a number of closed-door sessions to discuss all of the issues on a bipartisan basis.
