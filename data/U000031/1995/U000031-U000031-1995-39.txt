Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I would like to say I want to work very closely with the chairman and others on his side, as well as our side, to make sure that the intent of this legislation, or that the actual language follows the intent.  In some cases, of course, an individual not making child support payments may be doing so in conjunction with the court, and those we do not want to penalize. We want to make sure those individuals who are in fact in arrears at the subjugation, I guess, of the courts, are in fact those who are penalized. This language does not permit that.  I would like to work with the gentleman and others as the bill moves forward to make sure we get the best language available.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, we appreciate that. We support the gentleman's intent and motive, and hopefully we will be able to craft it in an appropriate manner so it can address effectively the intent. And I thank the gentleman.
