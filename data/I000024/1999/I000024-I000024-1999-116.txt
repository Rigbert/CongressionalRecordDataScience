President, I rise to make a few remarks about S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. This bill is designed to address the listing of certain flammable fuels under section 112(r)(3) of the Clean Air Act. The Committee determined that propane and flammables used as fuels should not be listed as a regulated or extremely hazardous substances because they do not comport with the Act's criteria for such listing. However, the National Association of Fire Fighters are concerned that removing these substances from Federal regulation under section 112(r) of the act will limit information regarding these fuels that would have been available to the public through the Risk Management Plans, RMP required by EPA's final rule implementing that section.
