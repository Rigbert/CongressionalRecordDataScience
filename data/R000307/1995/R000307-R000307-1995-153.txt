Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise in opposition to the substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I think Members should pay attention to page 16 of the bill in which it says the document shall  [[Page H2278]] contain a statement that places the nature and magnitude of risk to human health, safety and the environment in context, in context. Such statements shall, to the extent feasible, provide comparisons with estimates of great or lesser and substantially equivalent risks that are familiar to and routinely encountered by the general public as well as other risks.  The reason I bring that up is this. Several speakers have indicated we are rushing to judgment. For 14 years and even years before that, the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] and I have served on the sometimes powerful House Committee on Agriculture in an effort to ride this animal called FIFRA out of the chute and finally get some legislation with regard to food safety and finally repeal the clause called the Delaney clause that called for zero risk. Everybody agrees that has to be done.  We have tried and tried and tried to forge a coalition between industry, agriculture, and the environmental groups, all to no avail.  Part of the problem is the climate that we have had in reference to the whole pesticide issue and the whole business of risk assessment. That is what this bill is all about.  The gentleman from California, and his knowledge about this issue is second to none of anybody in the Congress, referred to the alar situation and the fact that it was concerned about children that led to that dispute. It is my recollection that the 60 Minutes story on alar just did not happen.  In fact, it was carefully planned by the Natural Resources Defense Council with the aid of a very savvy public relations firm called Fenton Communications.  In fact, in a memo published by the Wall Street Journal it was indicated as that report was being finalized, Fenton began contacting the media all throughout the country and that agreement was made with 60 Minutes to break the story. And later in that memo Mr. Fenton stated, a modest investment by NRDC repaid itself many fold in tremendous media exposure and submitted his campaign was a model for other such efforts.  What we had was a proven formula for really raising controversy and manipulating the public opinion. And it sure was not sound science. This was a strategy of manipulation that had serious implications for agriculture. In the food safety policy arena, the Congress was left out. The EPA, as a regulator, was left out. The scientific community in its research function was left out. Everybody in agriculture was left out, except the apple producer and they lost $400 million.                              {time}  1945  What we need is an approach to have risk assessment put in a common language that everybody can understand. Accurate science today lies in the eyes of the beholder, and today we have reached the point where risk assessment, based on so-called accurate science, is a shotgun marriage between science and politics. We have in chemical detection technology today the resources to detect parts per trillion, parts per trillion, so we can find a little bit of chemical everywhere we look. Almost everything is contaminated by something else.  Mr. Chairman, let us put this issue into perspective. The cancer risk in regard to aflatoxin, what we find in peanut butter sandwiches we feed our children that is 75 times greater than the dietary risk from minute amounts of the chemical EDB that has already been banned as a grain fumigant.  The reason I brought that up is I can remember in past debates on this issue, when people were worried about the amount of daminozide, which is the same thing, in peanut butter, and what was safe for our kids.  We come to find out that if everybody in this body had to consume the same amount of peanut butter and aflatoxin that the poor lab rat did before he went legs up, everybody here would have to consume 600 pounds of peanut butter a day.  Judging from the debate, I know some people over there that I would like to feed 600 pounds of peanut butter a day to, and it would certainly gum up the debate, or at least maybe shed a little bit of light.  A swimming pool, a child swimming in a swimming pool for an hour may be exposed to chloroform, that is a by-product of the chlorination we have, at levels that exceed the risk by EDB, which again was a grain fumigant that was banned, I am not for bringing it back, but we chlorinate the pool because the risk of disease and infection from bacteria is much greater than the risk in regard to the chloroform. That is what risk-benefit is all about.  We have a pesticide law, I mentioned it before, FIFRA, and we have the Federal Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act.
