 We settled it conclusively not only this January but actually January 2 years before that. What happened this January is we had an extensive bipartisan discussion about what rules or standing orders we might change. In the wake of that discussion, we passed two rules changes and two standing orders.  The majority leader said--well, this is what he said 2 years ago:       I agree that the proper way to change the Senate rules is      through the procedures established in those rules, and I will      oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the      Senates rules other than through the regular order.  That was in January of 2011. What he said back in 2011--and the reason I put that up even though that was a previous Congress--he said either this Congress or the next Congress, the Congress we are in now.  This January, I said to the majority leader:       I would confirm with the majority leader that the Senate      would not consider other resolutions relating to any standing      order or rules this Congress unless they went through the      regular order process?  That was this January, just a few months ago, a little over 140 days.  The majority leader said:       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate      procedure would be subject to a regular order process,      including consideration by the Rules Committee.  Now, that is not ambiguous. That is not ambiguous at all.  So the reason I and my colleagues have been talking about this repeatedly is that this is a huge institutional issue. The naive notion that somehow you can break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate for nominations only was laid out by Senator Alexander yesterday in which he suggested a hypothetical series of measures that, if I were in the job the majority leader is currently in a year and a half from now, would be a very appealing agenda to my side, things like repealing ObamaCare, things like national right to work, things like opening ANWR.  Now, I would say to my friends on the other side, that is not something they would be very excited about, but in American politics things change. There is a tendency, when you are in the majority, to be kind of arrogant about it and to think the rules of the Senate are unnecessarily inconvenient to what you are trying to achieve.  Well, the Senate was designed from the very beginning--George Washington was actually asked during the Constitutional Convention: What do you think the Senate is going to be like?  He said: I think it is going to be like the saucer under the tea cup. The tea is going to slosh out of the cup, down to the saucer, and cool off.  In other words, they anticipated that the Senate would not be a place where things happen rapidly.  Written right into the Constitution is advise and consent. Advise and consent. The Senate has a role to play, for example, on nominations--which seem to be the fixation of the majority at the moment even though there is no evidence whatsoever that this administration has been treated poorly with regard to either executive branch or judicial nominations, no evidence at all. This is a manufactured crisis. Nevertheless, they seem to be focused on nominations. What do my friends in the majority think ``advise and consent'' means? Apparently they think it means ``sit down and shut up. Do what I say when I tell you to.'' I do not think that is what the Founding Fathers had in mind.  So there are a number of reasons we should not go down this road:  No. 1, the majority leader gave his word. Your word is the currency of the realm in the Senate. That ought to end it right there.  No. 2, do not assume you could just sort of surgically break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate for nominations only.  No. 3, I think it would be appropriate, since the American people change their minds from time to time about whom they would like to be in the majority of the Congress, to think about the consequences when the shoe is on the other foot.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
