President, today I am joined by Mr. Cochran in introducing important legislation, the Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries, SKILLs, Act, to support our Nation's school libraries and librarians. This legislation is also being introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Grijalva and Representative Ehlers.  The SKILLs Act enhances the value of school libraries by reauthorizing and strengthening the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program of the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department of Education found that the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program is successful in improving the quality of school libraries receiving grants and school libraries are a critical component in improving student literacy skills and academic achievement by giving students access to up-to-date library materials, including well-equipped and technologically advanced school library media centers.  The SKILLs Act seeks to build on this success in several ways. It ensures that funds serve elementary, middle, and high school students. It encourages the hiring of highly qualified school library media specialists in our Nation'sschool libraries. Additionally, it expands professional development to include information literacy instruction appropriate for all grade levels, an assessment of student literacy needs, the coordination of reading and writing instruction across content areas, and training in literacy strategies.  Today's librarians do so much more than catalogue collections and check out books, they are educators in every sense of the word.  They provide tech support, guidance, and social services to patrons in need. They help teach our children how to safely and effectively navigate electronic media like the Internet and help instill a love of learning and reading in young students. In short, school libraries and librarians play an essential role in helping students get the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world and this legislation provide the necessary support for that endeavor.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1699       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
