 The Pharmacists Education Act takes a multi-faceted approach to the problem of workforce shortages in the pharmacy sector. In December 2000, the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, Bureau of Health Professions published a report entitled, ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Pharmacists''. This study considered the factors influencing the demand for pharmacists in the health care sector and also looked at the ability of our academic institutions to supply the quantity of pharmacy students required to meet this growing demand. The report concluded that there was indeed evidence of a shortage in the field, due primarily to the rapid increase in demand for pharmacists and the array of services they provide, coupled with a constrained ability to expand the number of pharmacy education programs to accommodate the need for more practicing pharmacists. The study also indicated that the shortage was unlikely to abate in the future without significant changes to the current system.  Pharmacists represent the third largest health professional group in the United States with about 190,000 active pharmacists last year. This figure is expected to grow to 224, 500 by 2010. Yet, despite this anticipated increase in the number of practicing pharmacists, the demand for the services is expected to continue to outpace supply. A recent employment survey conducted by the National Association of Chain Drug stores found that the number of vacancies among their member companies had increased by 1,000 positions in the last six months alone.  Remarkable advancements in medical science have made treatments for diseases once thought impossible to treat a reality. And what is possible is quickly what is practiced in the medical profession. Many of these dynamic breakthroughs have been in the area of pharmaceuticals.  These remarkable changes in health care have resulted in dramatic upswings in the number of retail prescriptions dispensed annually, from 1.9 billion in 1992 to 2.8 billion in 1999. Moreover, as medications become more complex and diverse, and our population becomes older and sicker, the role of the pharmacist in the health care setting has become evermore important. For these reasons, my colleagues and I felt it was very important that steps be taken to avert a more serious shortage of these critical health professionals.  The Pharmacy Education Act seeks to enhance not only the supply of pharmacists, by providing much needed support to Colleges of Pharmacy, it also aims to improve the distribution of pharmacists by building upon the National Health Service Corps. Specifically, the bill expands eligibility of certain existing Federal grant programs to Colleges of Pharmacy to upgrade and expand facilities and laboratory space and recruit and retain talented faculty to educate pharmacy students.  The bill also provides a number of new sources of financial aid to students interested in pursuing a career in pharmacy. First, the bill allows students entering pharmacy school and students who have graduated with a PharmD degree to apply for National Health Service Corps, NHSC, Scholarship and Loan Repayment funds. Second, it allows students who demonstrate financial need to apply for scholarships to qualifying schools of pharmacy.  This bill is endorsed by a number of organizations, including the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, National Community Pharmacists Association, American College of Clinical Pharmacy and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.  Increasing demand for pharmacists makes it imperative that a proactive response to current trends be undertaken before the situation becomes critical. I hope my colleagues will join me in seeking expeditious consideration and passage of this timely and important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Pharmacy Education Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1806       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act      of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's      health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is      threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide      important prescription related services.       (2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human:      Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine      reported that medication errors can be partially attributed      to factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists      (such as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff      shortages).       (3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and      Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for      pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human      Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a      shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to      what extent.       (4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage      of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary      of Health and Human Services published a report entitled      ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for      Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.       (5) The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand      for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall supply of      pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there has been      an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for      pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by the      currently available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly      indicates the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the      past two years''.       (6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing      the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in      the near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy      practice and education.'' The study projects that the number      of prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will      increase by 20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of      community pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6      percent by 2005.       (7) The demand for pharmacists will increase as      prescription drug use continues to grow.     SEC. 3.
