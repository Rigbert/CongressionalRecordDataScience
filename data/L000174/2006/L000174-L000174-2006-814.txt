The Government Accountability Office responded:       [T]o ensure the Government incurs no liability for      repayment of borrowing under this act, Congress may wish to      explicitly state repayment of borrowing is limited solely to      balances available in the fund.  That is precisely what we did in the FAIR Act.  A simple reading of the text of the bill shows that defendants and their insurers are obligated to pay $136 billion to the fund, and additionally another $4 billion of the assets from existing bankruptcy trusts. If this level of funding proves to be insufficient--most doubt it will not, but if it does--then we revert back to the tort system which we have now.  If we pass this legislation, thousands of people who had their health severely impacted through no fault of their own because of asbestos will have a chance to recover. Will some recover as much as some of the lucky few who were able to get through the whole tort system? No, nor will their attorneys even begin to recover the huge amounts some of the attorneys did.  The private companies are required under this legislation to continue making payments to the fund even after sunset until all of the fund's obligations are satisfied under section 405. Even the administrative expenses are paid from this private fund.  Finally, the bill clearly states:       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to create any      obligation of funding from the United States Government,      including any borrowing authorized . . .  The Senator from Pennsylvania and I have this as a touchstone all the way through, that we are not passing a piece of legislation for the taxpayers to fund. We are seeking help for those who have been injured.  Senator Specter and I have been working on this issue for years. We have carefully considered the design of the compensation program for asbestos victims and ways to avoid the pitfalls of other Federal compensation programs that have been enacted by Congress. Many of the compensation programs cited by the opponents of S. 852 were created by Congress with mandatory Federal spending and did not contain a provision to sunset the program if it went under-funded. We rejected such proposals for asbestos legislation.  Many opponents of our trust fund wanted the claims processing to be in a private corporation. Labor groups and victims testified that operating this trust fund in a new, private entity would delay compensation to sick victims and would entail significant administrative costs. Accordingly, we agreed to house the asbestos trust fund within the Department of Labor because it has expertise with compensation programs. It has existing staff with relevant experience and critical infrastructure and contracting capabilities to ensure an accelerated pace to pay the sickest victims within months of enactment.  Members of the financial services community recently contacted my office to rebut the conclusions made in the recent ``white paper'' distributed by the minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee. The investment community indicates that this minority staff report circulated last week dramatically overstates the financing expenses to be expected under this legislation.  This document alleges that $125 billion will be spent by the fund on borrowing because it vastly overstates claims projections and interest rates. The minority staff document ignores the fact that section 221 of the legislation provides that borrowing by the trust fund will be within a 10-year time frame. The document alleges that the FAIR Act will pay borrowing at an interest rate of a whopping 25 percent. This assumes an interest rate six times higher than the current 10-year Treasury bond rate.  In fact, the financial community opines that due to the structural aspects of the legislative language, it is ``overwhelmingly likely that financial markets will treat the trust fund as an investment grade credit'' and therefore it would have access to highly favorable borrowing rates.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the FIAR letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Financial Institutions for                                              Asbestos Reform,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2006.     Re Senate Budget Committee Democratic Staff White Paper.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: As members of the investing community we      must take issue with the recent report prepared by the      Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee. This staff      paper flunks ``Finance 101''. The analysis by Democratic      staff of S. 852 displays a basic misunderstanding of the      financing that will occur in the proposed asbestos claims      trust fund. It suggests that the trust fund's obligations      will exceed designed contributions by a hair-raising total of      $150 billion in nominal terms. This suggestion lacks any      credible basis.       The Democratic staff report attributes $117 billion of this      $150 billion to increased financing expenses. The report      estimate of $125 billion in financing costs contrasts with a      Congressional Budget Office estimate that net financing      expenses for the trust will be $8 billion. This huge      discrepancy is the result of flawed and unrealistic      assumptions in the staff report.       The staff study projects that the trust fund will make $160      billion in claims payments, vs. $130 billion estimated by the      CBO. In a worst case scenario where the incremental $30      billion of claims would be financed by borrowing in the trust      fund's initial years of operation, the trust would need to      borrow $50 billion as opposed to the $20 billion estimated by      CBO.       Section 221 of the FAIR Act provides that borrowing by the      trust fund will be within a ten year time frame. Doing the      math, the trust fund would be borrowing $50 billion at an      unheard of interest rate of 25% in order to generate $125      billion of net financing expenses over the ten-year borrowing      period. It should be noted that ten-year Treasury bonds      currently yield 4.54%.       There is not even a remote possibility that the trust fund      administrator will have to borrow at rates even approaching      25%. Structural aspects of the proposed trust, including a      super priority lien securing obligations of the payers, make      it overwhelmingly likely that financial markets will treat      the trust fund as an investment grade credit.       If the trust gets even the lowest investment grade rating      (BBB) and pays market rates, which are under 6%, its total      borrowing costs under the staffs draconian scenario would be      under $30 billion; a far cry from $125 billion.           Sincerely,       Financial Institutions for Asbestos Reform.
