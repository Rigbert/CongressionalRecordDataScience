Chairman, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith). He correctly states that the only reason this was not included in the bill when it was considered by the Committee on Science is that it would have triggered a sequential referral to the Committee on Resources which would have resulted in a delay. I would like to thank the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for signing off on this amendment. This simply integrates the efforts of the U.S. Geological Service into the type of research that is being done so that their mapping efforts can be much better digitalized and, thus, much more effective.
