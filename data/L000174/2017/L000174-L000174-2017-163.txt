Res. 56       Whereas the United States is a country founded on the      principles of religious and political freedom;       Whereas hateful rhetoric against refugees and asylum      seekers betrays the principles on which the United States was      founded;       Whereas for centuries, people from around the world have      sought refuge in the United States in pursuit of freedom and      protection for themselves and their families;       Whereas people often seek refuge and asylum in the United      States to flee war, armed conflict, violence, and religious,      ethnic, and political persecution;       Whereas refugees and asylum seekers have been welcomed by      towns, cities, and States across the United States;       Whereas refugees and asylum seekers have made their new      communities stronger and more vibrant and have positively      contributed to the betterment of the United States;       Whereas the United States has a moral obligation to ensure      that people fleeing violence and persecution are protected;       Whereas the United States Senate should continue its legacy      of bipartisan leadership on refugees and asylum seekers;       Whereas a ban or halt on resettlement may result in      prolonged and indefinite family separation;       Whereas executive actions targeting refugees and asylum      seekers could place these most vulnerable populations at      serious risk of death or injury; and       Whereas refugees are the most thoroughly screened and      vetted entrants to the United States, undergoing multiple      security checks by the Department of Defense, the Department      of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Federal      Bureau of Investigation, and the National Counterterrorism      Center: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--       (A) the United States should remain a global leader in      welcoming and providing refuge to refugees and asylum      seekers; and       (B) no person should be banned from entering the United      States because of their nationality, race, ethnicity,      religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender;       (2) the Executive Order titled ``Protecting the Nation From      Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States'' issued by      the President on January 27, 2017, undermines the national      interest of the United States; and       (3) the Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to      transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the      President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense,      the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the      Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the      Director of National Intelligence.
