 President, both the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Delaware are certainly hard acts to follow.  I want to comment on this bill, but before I do so I want to make a public appeal to the majority leader to please, please, please bring back on the floor the illegal immigration bill. This bill, I believe, has widespread bipartisan support. But more fundamentally, I cannot tell you how important this bill is to the safety and well-being of the people of California.  Right now on the border you have miles without a Border Patrol agent. Right now, for both Senator Boxer and I, Border Patrol people come in and tell us how they have rocks thrown at them, how they are concerned for their own safety.  A few weeks ago you had a major freeway accident with 19 people killed, illegal immigrants in a van. More recently you had an incident, publicized all over the United States, of an unfortunate law enforcement action which involved unrestrained force against illegal immigrants who pummeled on a freeway, hitting other automobiles, trying to get away from a sheriff's officer in pursuit.  This is the State that passed Proposition 187, which was a call for help from the Federal Government to enforce the law and change the law and stop illegal immigration.  Mr. President, there is so much that this bill--worked on so hard by Senator Simpson, worked on I think on both sides of the aisle in the subcommittee and in the full committee--does. Let me just say it adds 700 Border Patrol agents in the current fiscal year; 1,000 more in the next 4 years. It takes the total number of agents up to 7,000 by 1999. That is double the force that was in place 3 years ago. Every border State wants that.  It establishes a 2-year pilot project for interior repatriation. When somebody comes across the border, they are not just returned to the other side of the border, but they are returned deep into the interior to stop them from coming right back again.  It adds 300 full-time INS investigators for the next 3 fiscal years to enforce laws against alien smuggling, and it adds alien smuggling and document fraud, a big problem, as predicate acts in RICO statutes, something that Federal prosecutors have asked for.  It increases the maximum penalty for involuntary servitude, to discourage cases like the one we saw very recently where scores of illegal workers from Thailand were smuggled in and forced to work in subhuman conditions, against their will, in a sweatshop in southern California.  Mr. President, this bill is critical. It is an important thing for border States and particularly for the State of California. If Proposition 187 was not the bellwether that said, ``Federal Government, do your job,'' I do not know what else will be.  So I earnestly and sincerely, please, I beg the majority leader to bring this bill back on the floor, let us debate it, let us resolve it, let us pass it, let us get it signed, and let it get into law in the State of California.                          ____________________
