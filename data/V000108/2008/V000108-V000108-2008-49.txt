For the past 80 years, Saint Catherine Hospital has served the city of East Chicago and the citizens of northwest Indiana by offering quality care to those in need.  In the 1920s, recognizing the need for a healthcare facility in the heavily industrialized city of East Chicago, Indiana, community and business leaders began investigating the possibility of building a hospital within city limits. With the guidance of the Manufacturers Association of East Chicago and the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ (Ancilla Domini Sisters), a committee was appointed, led by Colonel Walter J. Riley. Due to the tireless efforts of these community and business leaders to formulate plans and raise money, Saint Catherine Hospital opened its doors on May 17, 1928.  Over the years, with the continued support of the Riley family and the Inland Steel Ryerson Foundation, the hospital flourished, increasing not only the number of beds but also the depth of its services. The medical staff at this time became well-known for their innovation and medical advancements, eventually creating the first school of x-ray technology in 1936. In addition, Saint Catherine Hospital became a very important location in the fight against polio, and in 1963, was the venue for the first open-heart operation. Expansion of the hospital continued through the years with new wings and remodeling, a new patient tower in 1987, and the Family Birthing Center in 1997.  In 2001, Donald S. Powers, a true visionary and one of northwest Indiana's finest citizens, brought together Saint Catherine Hospital, Community Hospital in Munster, and the Saint Mary Medical Center in Hobart to create the Community Healthcare System. From this vision emerged a partnership that would allow these outstanding hospitals to work together instead of competing with each other, resulting in one of America's best integrated healthcare delivery systems.  Subsequently, a $2.5 million MRI system was added at Saint Catherine Hospital and in 2002, a $2.2 million renovation of the emergency room was completed. In 2005, the CyberKnife Center opened, which brought the Community Healthcare System its most impressive piece of technology to date. Recently, Saint Catherine Hospital was awarded the 2008 HealthGrades Distinguished Hospital Award for Clinical Excellence, making it the third consecutive year that the hospital has received this award.  In honor of the 80th anniversary celebration, Saint Catherine Hospital will recognize the companies and individuals who have aided in the construction and enhancement of the hospital. -These honorees are: Donald S. Powers, ArcelorMittal Steel, ASF Keystone, BP, NIPSCO, the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ (Ancilla Domini Sisters), the Block family, and the Riley family.  Madam Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these honorees, as well as the staff and administration of Saint Catherine Hospital, past and present, who have spent the past 80 years providing quality healthcare services to the people of northwest Indiana. Through their efforts and their standards of excellence, many in the northwest Indiana community have had the opportunity to enhance their lives. It is the compassion and commitment of facilities like Saint Catherine Hospital that make northwest Indiana such a great community, and they are to be commended for their selflessness and dedication.                          ____________________
