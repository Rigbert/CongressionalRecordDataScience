Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As I have indicated, I rise in opposition to the amendment, basically for three reasons. One is in reference to the oilseed or the proposed oilseed loan program.  The Senate version of this added $132 million to the cost of their farm bill proposal. I do not know what the CBO estimate is of the gentleman's amendment. But I will move on to two other considerations.  This amendment strikes provisions that repeal a multitude of what I think are outdated statutes, as they refer to agriculture. We are talking about something here called permanent law or permanent agriculture law of either the 1938 or the 1949 farm bills. They have not been used for all practical purposes for decades. With a few exceptions, which our bill does recognize, these statutes really represent farm policy that is woefully outdated.                              {time}  1245  It simply does not apply to the modern-day world of agriculture.  I think we need to clean up the agriculture statute and get rid of these policies and provisions out of date, out of sync with today's markets and farm management systems. So for that reason we oppose the amendment.  I want to make it clear since Secretary Glickman, a good friend and a colleague, a former member of the House Committee on Agriculture, has pointed out that we in no way, we have to pass a farm bill, we in no way could go back to the 1949 act, and we all know that, and so I asked the Secretary, and I have asked the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm] and I have asked the chairman emeritus of the House Committee on Agriculture, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza] if they could propose a different kind of permanent farm law.  It is the 1949 act that I strongly object to, and it is just completely outdated. Those proposals have not been forthcoming. We have talked about it, and the gentleman from Texas has at least mentioned the possibility of the 1990 act in terms of permanent law. But since their substitute does contain the very awkward and very expensive permanent law for 1949, I think that is a very poor choice.  Then again this amendment also creates something called the Investment for Agriculture and Rural America Fund, similar to the Fund for Rural America that has passed in the other body, and this amendment would make $3.5 billion in CCC moneys, as the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has pointed out, available for rural development and conservation extension and research, purposes.  I support these initiatives. They are very fine initiatives. And the gentleman from Texas is right. We have been sorely pressed in agriculture, and these, as my colleagues know, these kinds of initiatives and these programs would be of tremendous help to our small communities all throughout the country.  But I do think, with all due respect and some reluctance in opposing this bill, that this amendment goes too far by giving these programs access to mandatory spending out of the CCC authority; the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has certainly mentioned that. The CCC has traditionally been reserved for use on farm and commodity and other related activities as opposed to this kind of spending.  We oppose this amendment, and I want all of my colleagues to understand this, we oppose this amendment because of its high cost. It virtually wipes out any budget savings achieved by the current bill, and its lack of details relative to how the Secretary would be allowed to spend these funds is very unclear and because it funds again wide discretionary programs out of mandatory spending accounts.  Now, I would like to say that in trying to work with the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza] and the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm] and also the gentlewoman from North Carolina [Mrs. Clayton], who has been an eloquent champion in behalf of rural development on the committee, that we considered a very similar bill in committee. I indicated at that time that I would do my very best to try to work for additional funding for rural development, and I have tried, and when we go to conference I will try again, and in the other body there is $300 billion made available to the Fund for Rural America, but $3.5 billion, as I indicated in the committee, is simply too much. We really abrogate what we do in terms of our budget savings, and the structure of this really troubles me. We do not want to get into an even-numbered year debate where we are saying that the money is being used for a secretary slush fund or something like that, and so consequently we are in opposition to the amendment for those reasons.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
