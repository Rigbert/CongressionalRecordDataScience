President, I rise today to offer legislation to allow seven States to more aggressively address the health and safety issues that threaten the citizens in their State, and do so immediately. I commend my fellow Kansas colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Boyda, for introducing similar legislation in the House.  Last December, Congress passed amendments to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 to extend the Abandoned Mines Land Trust Fund for 15 additional years. These amendments established a new distribution formula that works through a 4 year,program that phases in funding. Unfortunately, there are currently seven States that do not meet the active mining threshold to meet the minimum funding threshold. Today, I offer legislation that would allow ``minimum program states'' like Kansas to receive their full funding levels of $3 million starting in the fiscal year 2008, instead of requiring the minimum States to follow the percentage distribution formula. This legislation will assist several other States including Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alaska, and Maryland. With this funding, States can begin to protect their residents from the dangers of abandoned mines sooner rather than later.                                 ______                                       By
