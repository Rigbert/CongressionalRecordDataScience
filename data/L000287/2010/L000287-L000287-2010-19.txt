I want to thank my colleague, my brother, and my friend, Mr. Cohen, for introducing this resolution with me. I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia, along with Chairman Conyers and members of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this resolution to the floor tonight.  Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and appropriate that we pause to recognize the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, better known as SNCC. It grewout of the sit-in movement and the efforts of hundreds and thousands of young people who were standing up by sitting in.  These young people put their bodies, their hearts, and their spirits on the line to end racial discrimination and segregation in public accommodations. We were working to liberate the soul of a nation. It was the young people--black and white, Jewish and Christian, from the North and the South--coming together as a circle of trust and a band of brothers and sisters to change America forever.  As a young student in the Nashville Student Movement, people like Jim Lawson taught us the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolent resistance. He taught us the way of love. While we trained and learned and prepared to sit in, the Greensboro sit-ins happened. That was the spark that ignited the courage and the passion of students around the Nation.  On the day of the first Nashville sit-in, 124 of us gathered at the First Baptist Church, and we walked through downtown Nashville, two by two, quiet and solemn, well-dressed and well-mannered. My group went to Woolworth's. We sat at the counter, and we were told that we wouldn't be served. The lunch counter was closed early, and they turned out the lights, but we sat there all day, quietly--some of us reading, some of us doing our homework. We sat in again and again that week. It was the first time that I was arrested for civil disobedience. No sooner would one group be arrested than another group would take our place at the lunch counters.  Some of us were beaten, and the images of violence were broadcast around the Nation. Soon, the jails were full. The process of desegregation had begun. For months, all around the country, students sat in and stood in. The sit-ins spread around the South like wildfire. We marched; we sang; we prayed. Along the way, many were beaten, jailed, and some even died in the struggle.  During that time, 126 student delegates from 58 sit-in centers and 12 different States came to the campus of Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. That was the first meeting of what would become known as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, better known as SNCC.  SNCC did the hard, nitty-gritty work of organizing and mobilizing people in the heart of the Deep South to attempt to register to vote. From the sit-ins to the Freedom Rides, from Freedom Summer voter registration drives to the March on Washington, SNCC was there.  By 1963, at 23 years old, I had been arrested 24 times. I had been on the Freedom Rides. That year, I also became the chairman of SNCC.  SNCC was made up of people like Bob Moses and Bob Zelner, Julian Bond and Charles Sherrod, Bernard Lafyette and Diane Nash, Ruby Doris Smith and Fannie Lou Hamer, Howard Zinn and Ella Baker.  These young people, the students, carried the movement into the heart of the Deep South, and America is a better place because of them and the work of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. We hope that they will inspire the next generation to continue to build the beloved community. It is a society based on simple justice that values the dignity and the worth of every human being.  I ask and urge all of my colleagues to join us in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of SNCC and the sit-in movement.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my staff for working on this resolution, especially my legislative director, Michaeleen Crowell.                              {time}  0030
