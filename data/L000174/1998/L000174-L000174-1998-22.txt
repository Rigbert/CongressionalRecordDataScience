President, I am pleased to have been able to work with the Senator from Utah to gain passage of this important legislation, the Improvements to International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998. It will give United States law enforcement agencies important tools to help them combat international crime.  Unfortunately, recent incidents have made amply clear that crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part of our modern reality. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania are just the most recent reminders of how vulnerable American citizens and interests are to terrorist attacks. In a shockingly brutal attack, more than 250 men, women and children, were murdered in cold blood. Among those 250 victims were 12 of our fellow citizens.  With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with a push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans here and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it.  This bill does exactly that, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. The bill gives tools and protection to investigators and prosecutors, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals and terrorists now enjoy.  I initially introduced certain provisions of this bill on April 30, 1998, in the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998, S. 2011, with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein, and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden, on behalf of the Administration, the International Crime Control Act of 1998, S. 2303, which contains many of the provisions set forth in this bill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were included in another major anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' that I introduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and Torricelli.  We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete improvements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions may be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law enforcement priority.  The bill would provide discretionary authority for investigations and prosecutions of organized crime groups that kill or threaten violence against Americans abroad, when in the view of the Attorney General, the organized crime group was trying to further its objectives. This should not be viewed as an invitation for American law enforcement officers to start investigating organized crime around the world, but when such groups are targeting Americans abroad for physical violence and the Attorney General believes it is necessary, we must act.  In addition, the bill would expand current law to criminalize murder and other serious crimes committed against state and local officials who are working abroad with federal authorities on joint projects or operations. The penalties for murder against such state or local officials, who are acting abroad under the auspices of the federal government, are the same as for federal officers, under section 1119 of title 18, United States Code, and would therefore authorize imposition of the death penalty. While I oppose the death penalty, there is no reason to distinguish the penalties for murder of federal versus non-federal officials, who are both acting under the auspices of the Federal Government.  Also, the authority of the Attorney General to bring such prosecutions is limited so as not to interfere with the criminal jurisdiction of the foreign nation where the murder occurred. Thus, I would expect this authority to be exercised only in the rare circumstance in which the Attorney General believes the foreign country is not adequately addressing the crime.  The bill contains provisions to protect our maritime borders by providing realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to ``heave to'' or otherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able to stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity. The additional sanctions for resisting ``heave to'' orders and for lying to law enforcement officers about a boat's destination, origin and other pertinent matters, will help the Coast Guard in its efforts to interdict illegal drugs and other contraband.  The bill also provides specific authority to exclude from entry into our country international criminals and terrorists, including those engaged in flight to avoid foreign prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug trafficking under specific circumstances. At the same time, we ensure that the Attorney General has full authority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons.  The bill includes important money laundering provisions strongly supported by law enforcement. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on anti-terrorism, FBI Director Louis Freeh noted the importance of money laundering laws as a tool in stopping not only international drug kingpins, but also international terrorists, such as Usama bin Laden, the multi-millionaire terrorist who has been linked to the recent embassy bombings.  The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it provides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover computer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over access device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, where the victim of the fraud is within our borders.  We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, however. This bill facilitates such cooperation by allowing our country to share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage participation by foreign countries. It streamlines procedures for executing MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. Furthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role of state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, and authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their cooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our prosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission of foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, it will speed the wheels of justice by prohibiting international criminals from being creditedwith any time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges in our country.  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. Working together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will accomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure place.  Finally, I would like to address the encryption amendment that Senator Kyl offered and then withdrew during Committee consideration of this bill. This amendment would have criminalized the use of encryption in the commission of any federal felony.  Unlike analogous provisions incorporated into pending encryption bills, the Kyl amendment was not limited in any way to the criminal use of encryption ``for the purpose of avoiding detection by law enforcement agencies or prosecution'', as reflected in the SAFE bill, H.R. 695, or ``with the intent to conceal that communication or information for the purpose of avoiding detection by a law enforcement agency or prosecutor,'' as reflected in the Ashcroft-Leahy E-PRIVACY bill, S. 2067. The scope of the offered Kyl amendment raised concerns about inviting government over-reaching. There is no requirement in the amendment, for example, that a conviction for use of encryption be predicated on a conviction of any underlying criminal offense.  Moreover, were this amendment to become law, it could chill even the routine use of encryption in the course of every day business, such as communications between clients and lawyers or accountants, since the mere use of encryption could result in exposure to substantial criminal penalties of up to five years in prison.  In addition, as I noted during the committee's discussion of the amendment, the definition of encryption in the offered Kyl amendment varied greatly from definitions used in pending legislation, including bills I have introduced and cosponsored, that have been thoroughly vetted with encryption and other technical exports. The Kyl amendment definition of ``encryption'' is drafted so broadly that it could apply to any transformation of analog to digital communications, without any use of mathematical algorithms commonly associated with encryption. We can and should do better if we are going to add a definition of this highly technical operation to the criminal code for the first time.  I appreciate the chairman's efforts, and Senator Kyl's willingness, to address this issue in a considered fashion in the next Congress.  As a former prosecutor, I have long been concerned about helping law enforcement have the tools necessary to deal with changing technologies, and at the same time provide procedural safeguards to protect privacy and other important constitutional rights of American citizens. That is why I sponsored, among other laws, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986 and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act in 1994, and worked with Senator Kyl and Chairman Hatch on passage of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act in 1996 and, most recently, on identity theft legislation.  When it comes to encryption, I fully appreciate the challenge such technology poses for law enforcement officers, who may increasingly find that the communications they capture during court authorized electronic surveillance is unintelligible because it is scrambled with encryption technology. In the last Congress, I introduced legislation, S. 1587, that contained a provision to criminalize the use of encryption to obstruct justice. Again, in this Congress, I have introduced a bill with such a provision, S. 376, and cosponsored with Senator Ashcroft yet another bill, S. 2067, that contains a criminal penalty for the willful use of encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information. Thus, taking the step of creating a new crime to address the criminal use of encryption is not a new idea to me.  I remain frustrated that sound encryption legislation was not enacted this year, particularly since this technology is such an effective crime prevention tool. The longer we go without addressing encryption policy in a comprehensive fashion, the longer our computer information, networks and critical infrastructures remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks and theft.  I encourage the FBI to continue working with industry to try to define some cooperative efforts to facilitate court ordered access to encrypted files and communications. But the job of Congress is to ensure that procedural safeguards are in place to guide such cooperation in ways that comport with our Constitution. I look forward to working with Senator Kyl, as we have successfully in the past on technology issues, and with other members, on comprehensive encryption legislation that addresses both the criminal use of encryption as well as policy changes to promote the widespread use of encryption as a shield against cyber-crime.                  criminalizing the use of encryption
