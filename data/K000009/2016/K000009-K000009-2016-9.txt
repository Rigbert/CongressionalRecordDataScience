Speaker, I rise tonight in alarm over the stacking of Wall Street insiders in top positions for the incoming administration.  During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump said the system is rigged. He said hedge fund managers are ``getting away with murder'' and that he would ``tax Wall Street'' and called Washington, D.C., corrupt and promised to ``drain the swamp.'' President-elect Trump even closed his campaign with a political ad bashing Goldman Sachs.  Yet now, according to media reports, he has chosen a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner, Steven Mnuchin, to serve as Treasury Secretary. He will take the post most responsible for watching and regulating the dangerous, high-risk, high-stakes gambling behavior of Wall Street, which he has himself engaged in for decades. He worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years. His father worked there. His brother still works there, and he frequently returns for alumni and social gatherings. He was named the ``Foreclosure King'' after buying up the remains of IndyMac, a California-based mortgage lender, and evicted approximately 36,000 people who could not keep up their mortgage payments.  The last three administrations have had Goldman executives at the helm inside the White House and Treasury. While President-elect Trump promises to drain the swamp, he is not doing it. He is enlarging it.                          ____________________
