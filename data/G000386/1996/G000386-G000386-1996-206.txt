 President, I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Delaware in support of full funding for the international drug program. I would remind him, however, that the cuts to the international program began in 1993 when the Democratic-controlled Congress cut the INL program by 30 percent. The President's requests in 1993 and 1994 were also well below the Bush-era budgets. Even if we vote for the $213 million today, our international narcotics budget will still be over $200 million below the 1992 level. I also remind the Senator that he has been one of the most outspoken critics of this administration drug programs. He has noted the failings. I hope he and others here will join in voting to put this program back on track.
