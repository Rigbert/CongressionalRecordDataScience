 As he knows, I have worked steadily with him over the past several years to address his well-founded concerns with respect to the way the POW/MIA issue has been addressed by our Intelligence Community. I agree that the provision to which he refers would help us with our oversight responsibilities. That is why I supported his amendment, as did my Vice-Chairman, when our intelligence bill passed the full Senate earlier this year. I want the Senator to know that I will work closely with him over the next few months to find a way to get the listing of POW/MIA reports he seeks provided to the Senate. He has a right to review these reports, as does every Member of the Senate. I would urge the Director of Central Intelligence and heads of each of our intelligence agencies to work cooperatively with the Select Committee on Intelligence on this matter. I also want the Senator to know that I will include his provision in next year's authorization measure if the information he seeks is not provided to the Senate in the next few months. I thank him for his leadership on this important matter.
