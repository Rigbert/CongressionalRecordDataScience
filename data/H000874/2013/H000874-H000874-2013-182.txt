Of course, former President George Bush said, as the gentleman knows, just a few days ago, that we have a problem. The laws governing the immigration system aren't working, the system is broken, and he urged us to pass a bill. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, has said the same thing that I think the gentleman just said. We are very hopeful that we will bring a comprehensive, which we believe is absolutely essential, immigration bill to the floor and to realization so we can fix a broken system. And, yes, give a pathway to citizenship for those who meet the criteria that we would set forth.  But I thank the gentleman for his comments; and if he would like to respond further, I'd yield.  If not, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
