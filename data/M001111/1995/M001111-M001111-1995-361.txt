 President, I thank my colleague from California, who has been very persistent on this issue and deserves a great deal of gratitude and credit from all of us for insisting that we bring before us this very important sense of the Senate that speaks to the violence that has been occurring at reproductive health care clinics in this Nation.  We are all aware of the violence that has ravaged neighborhoods throughout our Nation. And I have to tell you every time kids gather in my kitchen or I talk to my next door neighbors or my parents, the first words out of their mouths is not unfunded mandates or line-item veto, it is: ``What are you going to do about the issue of violence in this country?'' They tell me they fear walking in their neighborhoods, fear going to their schools, and they want to know what we are going to do.  Well, the campaign of terror that is being perpetrated against doctors and patients in reproductive health clinics is a frightening example of this violence. The message that this violence sends to our children--that the world is a frightening place--is intolerable. When they see a gunman at a clinic, it reinforces in their minds that this [[Page S1050]] world is not a safe place. It is incumbent upon us as the elected leaders in this Nation to tell our children that we will do all we can to make sure that their world is safe.  I read yesterday's Washington Post and was very struck by the article that appeared. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 1995]         Clinic Killings Follow Years of Antiabortion Violence                (By Laurie Goodstein and Pierre Thomas)       Militant antiabortion activists have been waging a      protracted campaign of violence against women's health      clinics and the people who work in them over the past decade,      creating a climate of terror long before a gunman opened fire      last month at clinics in Massachusetts and Virginia.       The killings of two doctors, two clinic staff members and a      voluntary escort over the past 22 months have captured      national attention. But the tally of violence over the past      12 years includes 123 cases of arson and 37 bombings in 33      states, and more than 1,500 cases of stalking, assault,      sabotage and burglary, according to records compiled by the      Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the clinics      themselves.       ``We have seen a consistent pattern, acknowledging the fact      that people are willing to go to any means for their cause,''      said Ralph Ostrowski, chief of ATF's arson and explosives      division. ``In the past we would have acts of violence      directed at property. Now we see acts of violence directed at      people.''       Nearly all antiabortion leaders say they are aware of the      scope of the violence and have condemned it, and say no one      in their groups is associated with such tactics. They      describe the violence as an aberration.       ``There is not this collective soul-searching on the part      of our movement because we have been responsible and we have      been non-violent,'' said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director      of the Christian Defense Coalition. There are ``extremists in      every movement. . . . I think that extremists opposed to      abortion got frustrated, felt they were losing the battle and      felt it      was incumbent upon themselves to resort to violence.''       The Rev. Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue, went      further and accused ``those in the abortion-providing      industry'' of committing most of the violence in an attempt      to discredit the antiabortion movement. He should he would      soon bring evidence to Washington that would undermine the      government's statistics.       However, ATF spokeswoman Susan McCarron said of the 49      people prosecuted so far, ``We found that all expressed      antiabortion views. There is nothing in our cases that would      show it's providers or supporters of abortion that are doing      these acts, but we investigate all leads.''       Immediately after hearing the news of the killings last      month in Brookline, Mass., Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop      of Boston, issued a statement asking for a moratorium on      protests at abortion facilities. But his plea has been      rejected by other prominent figures across the spectrum in      the antiabortion movement--including Benham, Cardinal John J.      O'Connor of New York and Judie Brown of the American Life      League.       Like many other antiabortion leaders interviewed, Benham      said he sees no connection between angry rhetoric and violent      action. ``This whole thing isn't about violence. It's all      about silence--silencing the Christian message. That's what      they want,'' Benham said of abortion rights leaders. ``They      screech and scream about us crying fire in a crowded theater.      And I agree it is wrong, unless there is a fire. If there's a      fire in that theater, we better call it that. Our      inflammatory rhetoric is only revealing a far more      inflammatory truth.''       In most cases, the violence has disrupted clinics where a      large portion of staff time is devoted not to abortions but      to routine women's reproductive health care--pap smears,      teaching and supplying birth control methods, and treating      sexually transmitted diseases. Phone calls to a dozen clinics      targeted by the violence found that six of them did not even      provide abortion services.       At the Women's Pavilion Clinic in South Bend, Ind., which      does perform abortions, in recent years somebody has hacked      holes in the roof with an ax, shot out the windows and sent      repeated death threats to gynecologist Ulrich Klopfer by      phone and mail, said Marni Greening, the clinic's director.      Meanwhile, protesters with a group called the Lambs of Christ      have regularly barricaded the doors and blockaded the      driveway, undeterred by repeated arrests.       In the early hours of Mother's Day 1993, someone connected      a hose to the clinic's outdoor spigot and fed it through the      door's mail slot, flooding the clinic's entry room. The      person or persons then poured in butyric acid, a nearly      indelible substance that smells like feces and vomit and      becomes more potent in water. The clinic had to shut down for      7\1/2\ weeks to get rid of the smell, Greening said.       The unrelenting and unpredictable nature of the violence      has produced a resolute fatalism among the staff. Klopfer      said he was shot at last week as he drove home from work. He      reported it to federal marshals, but, he said: ``If it's      going to happen, it's going to happen. I'm realistic enough.      Look at all the people shooting up the White House, and that      has a hell of a lot better security than I do.''       Owners of the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk, where John C.      Salvi III allegedly fired about 23 shots, sustained $250,000      worth of damage in an arson case in 1984 and another $1,000      in damage in a bombing in the next year. Staff members there      have stopped commenting about attacks.       At the Planned Parenthood clinic in Lancaster, Pa., clinic      director Nancy Osgood remembers a 3 a.m. phone call in      September 1993 when she rushed to the clinic in time to see      the brick building smoldering, gutted by fire. The Lancaster      facility does not perform abortions, although other Planned      Parenthood clinics do.       No suspects have been arrested in that arson, although      national abortion rights groups offered a $100,000 reward for      tips on this and other crimes. ``Finally we have national      leadership talking about this being domestic terrorism. We've      said that for years,'' Osgood said.       ATF agents have arrested 49 people        in 77 of the bombing and arson cases. Thirty-three cases      have been closed because they have exceeded the statute of      limitations. The 50 cases still under investigation      include an arson at the Commonwealth Women's Clinic in      Falls Church last July 31.       Damages range from $150 at a Brooklyn N.Y., clinic that was      the target of two Molotov cocktails in 1993, to $1.4 million      caused by an arson fire at Family Planning Associates in      Bakersfield, Calif., in September of the same year. The total      damage to property amounts to more than $12 million.       A federal task force of officials with the ATF, FBI, U.S.      marshals and lawyers from the Justice Department's criminal      and civil divisions was created in 1993, and stepped up its      efforts after Paul D. Hill shot to death two people at a      Pensacola, Fla., clinic last July. A grand jury is currently      hearing evidence in Alexandria.       Authorities are focusing on whether there is a national      conspiracy, although some officials privately note they have      not found evidence to support that at this stage in the      investigation. Several law enforcement officials say it is      more likely they will find separate conspiracies conducted by      small cadres of activists, as well as campaigns carried out      by individuals.       Some of the incidents match the description of tactics in      ``The Army of God'' manual that law enforcement officers      found buried in the yard of Rochelle ``Shelly'' Shannon, an      Oregon activist convicted of shooting Wichita doctor George      Tiller, and awaiting trial on eight counts of arson at      clinics in several states.       ``Annihilating abortuaries is our purest form of worship,''      the manual says. It gives explicit instructions for home-     brewing plastic explosives, fashioning detonators,      deactivating alarm systems, and cutting phone, gas and water      lines.       Some federal investigators suspect that there is no      organized ``Army of God.'' They believe the manual has not      been widely distributed, but may have provided guidance in      several cases of arson, bombing and sabotage. The butyric      acid attack on the Women's Pavilion in South Bend precisely      matches tactics described in the manual.       After the recent shootings in Massachusetts, in which two      clinic receptionists were killed and five people      wounded, the Justice Department ordered federal officials to      record every threat against clinics and their staffs, and      began to enforce the civil provisions of the Freedom of      Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) law. Enacted last year,      the law makes it a federal crime to physically block      access to clinics, damage their property or injure,      interfere with or intimidate their staff or patients.       Last week a federal judge in Kansas City, Mo., used the      civil provisions of the FACE law to issue a temporary      restraining order against Regina Rene Dinwiddie for      threatening and intimidating staff and clients at the Planned      Parenthood of Greater Kansas City clinic.       Antiabortion protesters say the law is being used to limit      their freedom of speech. But federal officials are beginning      to crack down on the death threats that have become      increasingly common. There were about 400 death threats and      bomb threats logged in 1994 alone.       On Jan. 7, signs were found posted at four clinics in Long      Island saying, ``Danger: This is a War Zone. People are being      killed here like in Boston. You risk injury or death if you      are caught on or near these premises,'' said Karen Pearl,      executive director of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County.       The threats follow clinic staff members to their homes and      neighborhoods. Carolyn Izard, a nurse and clinic director at      Little Rock Family Planning Services in Arkansas, arrived      home one day to find her neighborhood was papered with fliers      calling her a ``death camp worker.''       ``It backfired on them,'' Izard recalled. ``I got calls      from neighbors that told me that they supported me 100      percent and they were furious that this kind of brochure was      left on their doors for their children to see.''       Curtis Stover has seen a dramatic change in the protesters'      behavior in the 21 years he's performed abortions in Little      Rock. ``Before, all they would do is quietly carry placards      around and not do much,'' Stover said. Now, ``every other      sentence is full of      [[Page S1051]] the word `murder.' Patients come in and they      yell at them not to murder their babies. I've had picketers      tell me I was going to die by a certain date.''
