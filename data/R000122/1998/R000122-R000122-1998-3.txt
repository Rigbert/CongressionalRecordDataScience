President, it is a bittersweet task that brings us back to Washington for one last vote before the end of the 105th Congress. Today, we will complete our work on the fiscal year 1999 budget.  To be sure, there is much that I like about the Conference Report before us, but there are some provisions that I strongly disagree with. On balance, however, it is a budget that is worthy of support.  Like many of my colleagues, I must lament the process that has brought us to this point--20 days after the start of the fiscal year. The Conference Report that we are about to vote on is almost 4,000 pages long. We have been given only a few hours to examine it. None of us knows the complete contents of the legislation, and there has been no opportunity to debate or offer amendments.  Fortunately, we have avoided a budgetary train-wreck similar to the one that closed down the government in 1995. But, Mr. President, this year the train is extremely late, and to hear the debate in this chamber, nobody wants to take responsibility for driving the engine.  We have subverted the regular budgetary process, failing even to pass a Budget Resolution. The majority could not reconcile its own discordant priorities to pass this blueprint legislation, which is required by law.  On this side of the aisle, we had a definitive agenda: preserve the budget surplus to save Social Security, invest in education, pass health care reform legislation, pass campaign finance reform, and pass legislation to prevent the tobacco industry from preying on our youngsters.  The President made these goals clear in his State of the Union Address and later with his fiscal year 1999 budget proposal. Claims that the priorities on this side were hidden until the very end are false. We have been here all along, working toward goals that the American people recognize as important, and we have had some success in achieving these goals in this legislation. There are a few provisions of the Conference Report that I would like to highlight:  This legislation preserves the surplus to help save Social Security.  It includes $1.2 billion for efforts to reduce class-size, of which $5.6 million would be awarded to my home state of Rhode Island. The omnibus bill also allocates funding to improve teacher preparation and recruitment, a cause that I was actively involved with during the drafting of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.  The budget bill also includes funding for critical reading legislation--$260 million to help address the serious declines in literacy levels that have left 40% of America's fourth graders without basic literacy skills. The newly created GEAR UP program would receive $120 million under the bill. This ambitious new initiative will help encourage youngsters living in high poverty areas to pursue their higher education goals.  Finally, this Conference Report contains $33 million for the construction of as many as five new Job Corps centers, including one in Rhode Island, which is one of only four states currently without a center.  On the negative side, $800 million in subsidies for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was slipped into this legislation. Neither House of Congress included this level of funding in its version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The omnibus package also retains a poorly constructed rider that prevents the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from conducting inspections on smallfarms in response to fatal accidents involving minors. I am committed to addressing both of these issues next year.  This Conference Report is also bad for what it does not contain. In particular, it lacks funding for school construction, which is required to help meet the $121 billion need for new and refurbished schools, nor does it include an important bipartisan initiative authored by Senators Jeffords and Kennedy to help individuals with disabilities join the workforce while maintaining their essential Medicare and Medicaid coverage.  Finally, it fails to adequately fund the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP), a federal-state program that is a major source of higher education grant aid. I worked hard with the other authors of the Higher Education Act Amendments to reauthorize and improve this program, and I believe the failure to sufficiently fund LEAP is short-sighted.  Mr. President, there is much that could be done to improve this Conference Report, but we must pass it to keep the government open. It is unfortunate that we have been put in the position of having to vote up or down on this hefty omnibus package with no opportunity to offer amendments, no opportunity for a substantive debate, and little chance to review the measure itself. Fast-Track budgeting at the end of a Congress is no way to make up for time squandered at the beginning. I hope that this is the last time we follow this kind of eleventh-hour, gerry-rigged process.                 ryan white aids funding under title iv
