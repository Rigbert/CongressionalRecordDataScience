 What is going on here, of course, is they had a Democratic election in 1990, internationally supervised. The side that won got 82 percent of the vote. And the State Law and Order Council locked up most of the leadership and put the leader herself under house arrest for 5 years.  That is what is going on here. We fiddle around--not just this administration, but the previous one--and have done nothing. As the Senator has pointed out, they have done absolutely nothing.  So the underlying bill calls for sanctions against Burma, something long overdue. I want to commend the Senator from New York for his leadership on this issue for his support.  We have had a sort of disjointed debate here on the Burma issue, Mr. President, over the course of the afternoon. At some point I am going to ask unanimous consent that all of that debate be consolidated in the Congressional Record because it will be hard for the readers to follow.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received today from the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, Office of the Prime Minister, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma,            Office of the Prime Minister,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: We understand that Senator Cohen      has introduced an amendment to your bill--Section 569 of the      Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, ``Limitation on Funds      for Burma.'' We have to reiterate our total support for your      version of the bill because it is the most and only effective      way of persuading the ruling military junta in Burma to enter      into a dialogue with the pro-democracy leaders.       If the U.S. Senate fails to vote for economic sanctions on      the junta as outlined in your bill, it will send a wrong      signal to Burma. The military junta will see it as a sign of      weakness on the part of the United States and encourage it to      step up the ongoing suppression of the democracy movement.       The National Coalition Government therefore opposes Senator      Cohen's legislation. The Senate cannot afford to send a wrong      signal. The imposition of economic sanctions is needed      because currently investments are only enriching the military      junta and its associates and are discouraging them to      negotiate with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the imposition of      economic sanctions because it is the best option available at      this moment. She understands Burma situation clearly and      would not initiate a move that would harm the people. Daw Suu      has categorically expressed her wish that investments in the      country cease until a clear transition to democracy has been      established. The National Coalition Government fully supports      Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's call for sanctions and that is why we      have expressed our total support for your bill.       I look forward to welcoming U.S. businesses helping rebuild      our country once a democratically elected 1990 Parliament is      seated in Rangoon. The Burmese people will remember who their      friends are.       The National Coalition Government also opposes any funding      to the military junta in connection with narcotics control. I      cannot find myself to condone any funding to a regime that      plays an active role in providing a secure and luxurious life      to the heroin kingpin Khun Sa.       I place my trust in the United States Senate to do the      right thing. Each vote for sanctions is a vote for the      democracy movement in Burma and our people who are struggling      to be so desperately free.           Sincerely,                                                         Sein Win,                                                   Prime Minister.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, essentially what it says is:       If the U.S. Senate fails to vote for economic sanctions on      the junta as outlined in your bill--  Referring to the underlying bill . . .     it will send a wrong signal to Burma. . . . [It will] step up      the ongoing suppression of the democracy movement.       The National Coalition Government therefore opposes Senator      Cohen's [amendment].  Which we will be voting on later, which is supported by the Clinton administration.       . . . currently investments are only enriching the military      junta and its associates and are discouraging them to      negotiate with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.       Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the imposition of      economic sanctions because it is the best option available at      this moment. She understands the Burma situation clearly and      would not initiate a move that would harm the people. . . .      The National Coalition Government fully supports Daw Aung San      Suu Kyi's call for sanctions and that is why we have      expressed our total support for your bill.  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado is on the floor. He has an amendment to offer as well. We would like to take that up. Have we laid the Domenici amendment aside?
