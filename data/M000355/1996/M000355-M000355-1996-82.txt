 President, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a vote left to be held on the Cohen amendment and on the Coverdell amendment. We are hoping that the Brown amendment will be worked out.  I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the Cohen amendment occur at 7:20and that the time between now and 7:20--that is 20 minutes on a side--be equally divided, and the time controlled by Senator Cohen and myself.
