 President, reserving the right to object, and I will not be objecting, I see the assistant majority leader on the Senate floor. I think it would be helpful, as soon as the majority leader or someone on that side can do so, to indicate at what point during the day tomorrow and at what point during the day on Sunday we might be having additional votes. It might be helpful to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in terms of planning for the weekend.
