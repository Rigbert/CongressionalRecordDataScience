 It is my intention to vote for this bill but also vote for amendments which I think will improve it. First, the cost ofprescription drugs goes up 10 to 20 percent a year, and as these costs rise, seniors are paying more out of pocket. In 653 pages of legislation, how much is dedicated to controlling the costs of drugs, keeping them affordable, not just for seniors but for all American families?
