Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mr. Jim Johnston, president and CEO of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA). Jim passed away on January 8, 2018.  Jim was born in 1939 in Summerfield, MA, but was raised in the Midwest after his family moved to Iowa when he was a child. In 1956, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and after completing his military service he entered the trucking industry as an owner-operator in 1960.  In 1969, Jim moved to Grain Valley, MO, during a turbulent time in the trucking industry. At that time--as it is now--trucking was dominated by small businesses. Recognizing theneed to form an association that could effectively communicate the concerns of small-business truckers to lawmakers, OOIDA was established in 1973.  Most of the founding members had returned to trucking full-time shortly after OOIDA was established. Jim was elected president and CEO of OOIDA in 1975, the Association's third president since its founding two years earlier. As Jim put it, he was the ``only one left and too dumb or stubborn to know when to quit.''  From its humble beginning in an office trailer chained to a light pole in Grain Valley, he grew OOIDA into the largest national organization fighting for the rights of all professional truckers. Under his leadership, OOIDA has grown to more than 160,000 members nationwide, increased its relentless advocacy efforts in Washington, DC, and offers a robust collection of unique services and programs for drivers.  Jim was OOIDA's leader for more than 42 years. OOIDA was his life's work and fighting for the rights of all truckers was his life's mission. Up until only days before his passing, he remained dedicated to both.  Jim leaves behind family, friends, and colleagues, but his contributions to the trucking industry will live forever.                          ____________________
