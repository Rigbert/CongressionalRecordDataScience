 I want to tell my young friend from North Carolina, that is the representation I have now made three times. I have made it to your leader. I suggest you ask your leader whether he trusts me to do that.  Mr. McHENRY. Reclaiming my time, I certainly want to understand this agreement, and since it is a unanimous consent put before the House, we need to have unanimous consent to proceed with that. I want to understand the three elements of this rule and since the majority leader does schedule the floor, Madam Speaker, I want to make sure I understand the agreement since you actually control the floor.
