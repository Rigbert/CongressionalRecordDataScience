President, I will be very brief. The Senator from Georgia has just raised issues of concern that many of the rest of us have. I hope this is a matter, as we work through conference, that can be handled. During this whole bill, we have been helped by the cooperation on both sides, by the distinguished chairman, by Robin Cleveland, Jim Bond and his staff, Tim Rieser on mine. I am sure that will continue that throughout the conference.               Amendments Nos. 2734 through 2767, En Bloc  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a group of amendments, en bloc, to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.
