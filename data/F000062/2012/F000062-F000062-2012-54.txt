 I think we had a good debate. I think we ended in a good place. I am very hopeful that the body will pass this now by a large majority. So I hope we are successful tonight in achieving something that hasn't been achieved for decades.  I want to thank everybody, our cosponsors, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Graham for the debate.
