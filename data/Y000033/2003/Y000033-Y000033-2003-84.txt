Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I suggest to the gentleman that his comments are very well taken and when the administration makes the request, which we do anticipate, for FEMA and other issues, that the Committee on Appropriations will move on it quickly and very likely apply it to the very next appropriations bill that is in the process and ready to be considered by the House.
