 President, I support the amendment offered by Senator Domenici to the amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller on disability compensation for veterans with smoking-related disabilities.  It seems to me reasonable to ask for more deliberate review of this issue. After all, President Clinton has twice proposed not to allow post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA disability compensation. Once the question has been thoroughly reviewed, we can then reconsider the matter.  This Domenici amendment would ask the General Accounting Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and the VA to review this matter over the next year. This will allow the main analytical resources of the Federal Government to come to bear on this question. And, when the assessment is finished, we will have greater confidence that we are doing the right thing.  With respect to the main Rockefeller amendment, we have to keep several things in mind. This would be an expensive program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, we are talking about around $10 billion over five years. It is also not clear that it is fair to all the other veterans who have service-connected disabilities which are clearly service-connected or low income veterans who have problems clearly related to military service that have led, or would lead, to receipt of disability compensation.  Furthermore, it is certainly possible that major inequities could result were the underlying amendment enacted. By this I mean that veterans who started smoking after military service could conceivably be eligible for disability compensation under terms of this amendment. Keep in mind also, that veterans who suffer from tobacco-related health problems can still qualify for health care services from the VA if they met the regular qualifying criteria.
