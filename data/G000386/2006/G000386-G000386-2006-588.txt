 President, the problem with the Dodd amendment is that it doesn't even do what the author says it does. He says it is paid for by using capital gains, but capital gains offsets don't even come into play until the year 2009. The author is leading us to believe that the military assistance is coming now. But it is not, if it is tied to an offset that won't come due until 2009. Our alternative now before the Senate will do the same thing as the Dodd amendment, but we don't tie it up with an offset that is way down the road 3 years. That is not truth in budgeting. I urge support for my amendment.
