Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very, very similar to one that the House rejected earlier today.  The project that would be funded by this amendment, by the shifting of this money, is not an authorized program to begin with. But even if it were, the Army's O&M account in the OCO portion of the bill is funded at over $39.1 billion.  And should this project remain in the final authorization bill and the Department concurs that it is a high enough priority, then there simply are ample funds to cover it with the $39.1 billion.  So I see no reason for this amendment, and I oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Gardner). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
