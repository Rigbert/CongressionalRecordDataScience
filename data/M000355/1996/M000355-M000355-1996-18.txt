 President, I rise today to recognize Marilyn S. Pennington who is retiring from the Social Security Administration after 29 years of Federal service.  Ms. Pennington began her Social Security career as a service representative in Louisville, KY, in August 1965. She was promoted to claims representative and reassigned to Paducah, KY, in October 1966 and then to Silver Spring, MD, in August 1967. She returned to Louisville in May 1969. Her performance as a claims representative was always outstanding and she served as a model and mentor to other employees. During the early 1970's, Ms. Pennington was assigned as an operations analyst for the Louisville District. She provided outstanding staff assistance to the Louisville management team. Her work as an analyst was instrumental in improving the overall efficiency of the Louisville District Office. On May 8, 1977, she was promoted to the operations supervisor position which she holds today.  During her career, Ms. Pennington won many performance-related awards based on her outstanding work in serving the public. Her service to the public has been a model of the best that Government can bring to the people.  Ms. Pennington has also helped implement major additions to Social Security programs. These include Medicare in July 1966 and the Supplemental Security Income program in January 1974. There have also been many other changes to Social Security programs during her career, such as the extension of coverage to include Federal employees and employees of non-profit organizations, taxation of benefits, and more.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing Marilyn S. Pennington for 29 years of dedicated service to the Federal Government.                          ____________________
