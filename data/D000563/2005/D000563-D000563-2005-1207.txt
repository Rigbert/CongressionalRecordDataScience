Those tuning in to this debate and starting to listen may not grasp what is at issue. The way you described it to us yesterday in the Senate Democratic caucus luncheon was that the Environmental Protection Agency is testing the toxicity, or poisonous nature, of pesticides on human beings here in the United States. Since this came to the attention of the House of Representatives, they have said this is wrong; we don't want to endanger anyone's life by testing them with pesticides, particularly children, pregnant women, others--for that matter, any person. So they decided to suspend, as I understand it, the authority of the EPA to go forward with this testing.  An argument is being made on the floor today, by those opposing your amendment, that we should go ahead and continue the testing? Is that what is at issue?
