 President, I rise to express my deep concern about the brutal subversion of democracy underway in Cambodia. I urge the administration to condemn the action for what it is: A bloody coup d'etat perpetrated by co-Prime Minister Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party.  The administration today announced it was suspending for 30 days all assistance provided to the Cambodian Government. All such assistance, including loans provided by the World Bank and other international financial institutions, should remain suspended until the democratically elected Government of Cambodia is restored.  Programs implemented through nongovernmental organizations--efforts supporting the rule of law, public health, prosthetics for mine victims, et cetera--should be reviewed to determine which ones can continue in light of recent events.  I applaud the decision taken by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to delay Cambodia's membership in that organization. Cambodia's neighbors are under no illusions that Cambodia today is prepared to be a responsible member of the international community.                               BACKGROUND  A few weeks ago, Cambodia seemed poised to close the book on a bloody chapter of its history by bringing the genocidal Khmer Rouge Leader Pol Pot to justice. But now Hun Sen threatens to plunge the country back into darkness and civil war.  Dozens of people have been killed. There are reports of mass arrests and looting in the Capital of Phnom Penh. Prince Ranariddh's supporters have been expelled from the legislative assembly. Interior Minister, and Ranariddh loyalist, Ho Sok reportedly has been executed while in the custody of government troops.  For the long-suffering people of Cambodia--victims of ``the killing fields''--Hun Sen's unconstitutional action is a painful blow to their quest for democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction. That quest seemed achievable in October 1991 when--after 12 years of civil war--Cambodia's warring factions and all of the foreign parties who had played a role in the Cambodian conflict signed the Paris peace accords. Vietnam withdrew its army from Cambodia and the United Nations established the U.N. Transitional Authority for Cambodia [UNTAC].  UNTAC's primary goal was to oversee the creation of a democratic, internationally recognized government in Phnom Penh. UNTAC was the largest, most comprehensive, and most expensive peacekeeping operation in the history of the United Nations. More than 12,000 troops, 4,000 civil police, and 20,000 civilian workers and volunteers from more than 50 countries poured into Cambodia.  UNTAC supervised the return of more than 400,000 refugees from Thailand and the registration of 5 million eligible voters. The operation cost more than $1.7 billion, with an additional $2 billion pledged by international donors to fund reconstruction of the war-torn country.  In May 1993, Cambodia experienced its first free and fair multiparty election. Despite terrorist threats from the Khmer Rouge--who refused to participate in the election and shelled some polling places--90 percent of registered voters came to the polls.  The incredible turnout was a testimony to the enthusiasm of the Cambodian people for democracy and their desire for peace.  Prince Ranariddh's party won those elections. Hun Sen's party came in second. But when Hun Sen disputed the results and threatened to plunge the country back into civil war, King Sihanouk, with the blessing of the international community, fashioned a compromise.  A coalition government was established, with Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen serving as co-Prime Ministers. They jointly administered Cambodia until Hun Sen's coup d'etat last weekend.  The coalition was never an easy one. In recent months, relations between the two Prime Ministers had become increasingly strained as both began jockeying for position in the runup to national elections scheduled for 1998.  The disintegration of the Khmer Rouge actually exacerbated the tension between the two major parties, as each sought the political and military support of the breakaway Khmer Rouge elements.  Now the tensions have flared into open conflict. The question for the friends of democracy in Cambodia is how to respond.  Our first priority must be to ensure the safety of more than 1,000 American citizens--including our diplomatic and military personnel.  Our very able Ambassador in Phnom Penh, Ken Quinn, has acted with courage and professionalism to provide asafe haven for Americans and to assist those seeking to leave the country. Thailand has been enormously helpful by providing aircraft to transport Americans and other foreigners out of Cambodia, and I want to express my personal thanks to the Royal Thai Government and the people of Thailand for their asssistance.                          restoring democracy  Mr. President, I fear that putting Cambodia back on the democratic path will prove difficult. The international community is not likely to fund a second UNTAC. The future of Cambodia is largely in the hands of the Cambodian people.  But the world must not turn its back on Cambodia.  At a time when pluralism and democracy are generally expanding in Asia, we should not condone the unconstitutional use of force to oust a legitimately elected government. As the world knows from recent history, political instability in Cambodia threatens the peace and security of all of Southeast Asia.  It is in the interest of the United States and all of our friends and allies in the region to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict consistent with the spirit of the Paris peace accords. As my colleague, Senator McCain urged this body yesterday, we must remain engaged and stand ready to do our part.  The tragic political violence occurring today in Cambodia is proof that one election does not make a democracy. In many respects, it is the second election--the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next--that is the miracle of democratic governance.  In the United States, we have the opportunity to experience that miracle every 4 years. In Cambodia, the second election, scheduled for 1998, is in jeopardy. The quest of the Cambodian people is endangered.  I urge Hun Sen to abandon the path of violence and subordinate his own ambitions to the will of the Cambodian people and their dream of peace. I hope and pray that Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh will heed King Sihanouk's call and find a way to settle their differences through the ballot box rather than the barrel of a gun.                          ____________________
