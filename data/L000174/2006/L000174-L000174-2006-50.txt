President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of amendment 5123 offered by Senators Collins and Feingold. This bipartisan amendment would extend the life of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, SIGIR, and restore the bipartisan agreement made regarding the termination of the SIGIR in the Senate-passed fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill.
