I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, here again is another amendment that is redundant, but let's call it what it is: It's an obstruction.  The Department of the Interior already requires that applicants must calculate worst case discharge before approving a permit. On June 18, 2010, the Department of the Interior issued a notice to lessees outlining the information requirements and standards to be met before a permit would be approved. In the notice it is required that a lessee ``describe the assumptions and calculations that you used to determine the volume of your worst case scenario.''  It's already required on permit applications today, and is further reiterated by the language in H.R. 1229, which passed the House earlier today.  The minority continues to try to divert attention away from the real issue of increasing energy production, creating jobs, lowering energy costs, andimproving national security by lessening our dependence on foreign oil.  In fact, it seems that the Democrats simply do not want to face the fact that this bill says we can move forward with an aggressive program of responsible oil and gas development while, at the same time, ensuring that increased safety measures are undertaken. These are not mutually exclusive goals.  Republicans want to make U.S. offshore drilling the safest in the world, and it is the safest in the world, so we can produce more American energy, create American jobs and strengthen our national security.  I reserve the balance of my time.
