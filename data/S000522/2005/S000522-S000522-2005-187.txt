Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 343 introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), and commend him for sponsoring this. At least ten other Members have joined him as cosponsors on the resolution.  In May of 2005, the Kuwaiti Parliament amended its basic election laws to provide something which we in America take for granted, the rights of women to vote and to run for office. This resolution puts the U.S. House of Representatives on record as commending this important step in the Middle East. The Kuwaiti Parliament has taken action to recognize the important role of women in international human rights, and the House states in its resolution how important that role is and how it must be respected and promoted regardless of historical, cultural or religious heritage. This action by the Kuwaiti Parliament underscores its recognition of these important rights and shows its support for the American policy of actively advancing women's rights all over the world.  This resolution recognizes America's view that this important step by the Kuwaiti Parliament is an important step for the women of Kuwait and for the nation as a whole. The resolution formally commends the government and the Parliament of Kuwait for this important action and urges full participation of Kuwaiti women in the political life of their country.  I urge support of this resolution, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
