 President, I announce to Members of this body who have amendments that are pending--and I think under the rules all amendments must have been filed by last week--that several of those amendments have been reviewed and agreed to. If those amendments can be offered today, we would like to have the Members come and bring those amendments up, and those amendments will be accepted.  I and other managers of this legislation, throughout the course of the day, will be happy to handle those amendments if the Members are not able to do so or do not want to do so this morning, so that we can use this time before the votes at 5 o'clock this afternoon to expedite as many amendments as we can from our list of over 200.  Mr. President, I am going to take this opportunity to speak as in morning business. When somebody comes and wants the floor for work on welfare reform, I will yield it.  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.
