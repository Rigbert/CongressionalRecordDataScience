 President, the Senate will tomorrow resume consideration of S. 1664. That is the immigration bill. That will be tomorrow morning. Senators should be reminded that there will be a cloture vote on the bill immediately following the vote on the Simpson amendment.  It is the hope of the majority leader that we will complete action on the immigration bill during Wednesday's session. All Senators can therefore be expected to have rollcall votes throughout tomorrow's session.                          ____________________
