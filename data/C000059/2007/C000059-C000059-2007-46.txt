Norco has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Harvey Sullivan is one of these individuals. On December 4, 2007, Harvey will be honored at a dinner in honor of his retirement from the Norco City Council.  Harvey has served on the Norco City Council for 8 years and has lived in Norco for 15 years. This year he served as mayor. Prior to being a councilmember, Harvey was an electrician. Mayor Sullivan has served on the Norco Schools Committee, Riverside County Library Taskforce, Chamber of Commerce Education Committee, CDA board member, Water Taskforce Committee, United Norconians for Life Over Alcohol and Drugs, UNLOAD Committee, Fee Study Committee for area fees, Alternate Trail Materials Committee, Beautification Committee, Riverside County Transportation Commission, Riverside Transit Agency, and the Western Riverside County Regional Wastewater Authority.  Mr. Sullivan has been a tireless advocate in promoting Norco as ``Horsetown USA,'' was instrumental in bringing the Extreme Mustang Makeover competition to Norco in 2009, has worked with Desert Power to bring solar energy to all of Norco's major city facilities, andhas used Norco's unique lifestyle as an economic driver to promote economic development in the community. In his spare time, Harvey enjoys horseback riding, camping, fishing, and skiing.  Harvey's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Norco, California. Herb has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires. I wish him and his lovely wife Mynon all the best.                          ____________________
