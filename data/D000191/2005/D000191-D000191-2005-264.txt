Chairman, I believe this would become the lawyers' full employment act, and the other side of the aisle is not usually avidly supporting the lawyers, because this is so vague, a description of the weight of scientific evidence. How would we weigh it? Do we weigh it physically? Do we weigh it on a molecular basis? What is the weight?  I expect that this would lead to lengthy and contentious litigation at great expense to the taxpayers and basically inhibit government agencies from using the best available science. It is too vague. It should be defeated.
