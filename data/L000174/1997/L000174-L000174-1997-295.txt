President, as I said yesterday, I believe that the goal of encouraging voluntarism is a laudable one. I stand ready to work with others on a bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to doing so. This bill, S. 543, is not the answer and appears not even to ask the right question. It is flawed and would benefit from attention through the normal legislative process of hearing, public comment, review, committee consideration, amendment and report, and Senate action. Instead, the majority is trying to force this bill through the Senate to catch the train of press coverage on the Presidents' summit on America's future.  The contrast between what has taken place in Philadelphia and here in Washington could not be more stark. In Philadelphia, thousands of volunteers and activists are joining with leaders who have served as Presidents from both major political parties, First Ladies, involved celebrities, and corporate sponsors. The summit may well spark a renewed dedication among the millions of Americans to get involved to make a difference.  Ours is a tradition rich in neighbor helping neighbor and citizen service. The honest involvement of so many and the commitment to improve the lives and futures of 15 million children is extraordinary.  By contrast, this week the Republican controlled Senate simply cannot abide the nonpartisan events in Philadelphia. I do not know whether it is the involvement of Gen. Colin Powell, Nancy Reagan, George and Barbara Bush, or President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton that is driving the Republican leadership bonkers, but something has. Is it not possible that something happening outside of Washington can have meaning to millions of Americans without congressional Republicans having to insert themselves for partisan gain. I asked yesterday why we are being forced to take up the ill-considered S. 543. The answer is because the Republican leadership says so. Otherwise, they might miss out on claiming credit in connection with this week's activities in Philadelphia. I guess in their minds nothing happens that does not involve their political agenda. Voluntarism should not be about politics. The summit was not partisan and about politics. Unfortunately, this heavyhanded effort is purely partisan.  I suggest that the 130 cosponsors of all political persuasion who have joined in the approach outlined by H.R. 911 may have a better idea. It is much less of the Federal Government knows best approach that is embodied in S. 543. Indeed, I suspect that sometime soon the Republican majority will try to snuff out this alternative approach to the excesses of S. 543. The House bill is too acceptable an alternative, too widely supported to be tolerated in these partisan times. Only a bill with a pure Republican pedigree will be tolerated in this 105th Congress. How quickly the Republican leadership has forgotten the lessons of legislating through bipartisan cooperation for the good of the country.  Why is the Federal incursion into State law and local volunteer activity needed? Why is this bill the top priority for Congress? Why has the majority leader threatened to shut down the Senate until this particular bill is passed and devoted an entire week to it? Well, the bill purports to protect volunteers from ``liability abuses.'' Voluntarism is at an all-time high according to the Wall Street Journal--and that was before the summit in Philadelphia. This morning the principal sponsor of the bill and the majority leader clarified that it is not so much that judgments are being awarded against volunteers or volunteer organizations but that there is a threat of suit. If that is so then why are we being forced to adopt broad-based Federal standards, which by the way willnot prevent the filing of lawsuits but only provide a series of Federal law defenses based on factual proof after hearings?  Why not, instead, encourage the States in their efforts to allow or require indemnification of volunteers for the costs of suit? That is what Georgia and Vermont and many other States have already done.  Where are the outrageous jury awards against charitable organizations that threaten voluntarism in America? This morning the proponents of this legislation admit that they do not exist. Nonetheless, purportedly in the interests of the beneficiaries of their services, we are being asked to adopt a Federal standard other than the exercise of due care that such activities otherwise might be held to under 200 years of State law development even though the behaviors we are discussing will affect the most vulnerable among us.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement of administration policy received from the administration.  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.                   Statement of Administration Policy     (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the          concerned agencies.)     S. 543--Volunteer Protection Act of 1997--(Coverdell (R)          Georgia and 10 cosponsors)       Although the Administration strongly supports national and      community service and volunteerism, it opposes S. 543.       The President has a deep commitment to volunteer and      service activities and supports efforts to encourage      Americans to engage in these activities. The Administration      will work with Congress on proposals that, while respecting      state law, help provide reasonable liability protection to      volunteers involved in the delivery of needed services.       S. 543 is not such a bill. Without any hearings      demonstrating the inadequacy of state law in this area, S.      543 effects a sweeping preemption of state law in cases      involving ``non-profit organizations'' and ``volunteers.''      The over-broad definitions in the bill--which might apply to      hate groups, street gangs, or violent militia--make this      takeover of state law potentially troubling.       As with broader tort reform measures, the Administration is      also troubled by the legislation's one-way preemption--state      laws would be preempted if they favor plaintiffs, but not if      they favor defendants--and by Section 5 of the Bill, which      would totally abolish joint-and-several liability for      noneconomic damages (e.g., pain and suffering). This      provision would unfairly discriminate against the most      vulnerable members of our society--the elderly, the poor,      children, and nonworking women--whose injuries often involve      mostly noneconomic losses. Noneconomic damages are as      important to victims as economic damages and must not be      relegated to second-class status.
