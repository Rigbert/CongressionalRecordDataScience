I can guarantee you that every word that is on the Record will come to comfort Mervyn and the Tubbs Jones family, their church family, her sisterhood, all the people of Cleveland, all the people who have known Stephanie across our Nation. I want to thank our colleagues for their generosity and for their good hearts.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that the Ohio delegation stands beside those from the Congressional Black Caucus, who will have the second hour this evening in remembrance of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. We thank them very much for doing this. I know how very much their words will mean not just today but in future years to those who love Stephanie always.
