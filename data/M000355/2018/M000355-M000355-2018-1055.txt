 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize Wendell Lawrence, of Elizabethtown, KY, who will be retiring from his role as the executive director of the Lincoln Trail Area Development District, LTADD, on August 1. After 35 years of service, including more than two decades as the executive director, Wendell leaves a lasting impact on his community and has helped the organization fulfill its mission.  Comprised of eight counties--Breckinridge, Grayson, Hardin, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, and Washington--the LTADD was formed in 1968 to foster regional strategies and partnerships to benefit the citizens of the Commonwealth. Kentucky was the first in the Nation to establish a statewide system of regional development organizations.  This region is an important part of Kentucky's economy and culture. It is the home of both the Abraham Lincoln National Historical Park and Fort Knox, a vital U.S. Army installation and the site of the U.S. Bullion Depository. Comprised of small businesses, heritage sites, and agricultural centers, the Lincoln Trail is a rich part of both our Commonwealth's history and its future. Under Wendell's leadership, the LTADD has helped communities and organizations secure grants and resources to help the area continue to thrive.  During his time leading the district, Wendell has helped establish a number of partnerships to increase the region's competitiveness and benefit its workers. With organizations like OneKnox and WIRED65, the region has leveraged unique geographical and commercial resources to help it flourish. Wendell also worked closely with Fort Knox to expand the installation's potential and to assist Fort Knox area military personnel transitioning out of service into the workforce through his role as the former advisory board chairman of Where Opportunity Knox. Although the region has changed and developed during his tenure, Wendell's diligent leadership of the LTADD has set the area and many of its award-winning municipalities on a pathway to a bright future.  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the LTADD. At a recent event to commemorate, its half century of excellence, the members showed their gratitude to Wendell by surprising him with their Lifetime Achievement Award. Wendell's dedicated service to the district throughout his impressive career has endeared him to so many in this area.  In addition to his passionate work in the Lincoln Trial area, Wendell also used his talents for the good of Kentucky and other causes close to his heart. As a previous chairman of the Kentucky Association of District Directors, he helped encourage economic growth throughout the Commonwealth. A retired captain in the U.S. Army Reserve with 23 years of Active and Reserve service, he is also passionate about our Nation's military and is a life member of the Reserve Officers Association and former member of the board of directors of the George S. Patton Museum and Center of Leadership at Fort Knox.  On a personal note, I have always enjoyed working with Wendell on behalf of the people of Kentucky. His decades of leadership have produced tangible benefits for the Lincoln Trail area, which will continue to be felt for years to come. In addition, his daughter Amanda is a constituent caseworker in my Louisville office. It is clear that a commitment to helping Kentuckians runs in the family.  When Wendell retires later this year, he will begin a new chapter in his life. Whatever his next adventure may hold in store, I am confident that with the support of his wife, Jackie, and their children, Amanda, Thomas, and Meredith, he will continue to find success.  I would like to join the people of Kentucky and the staff of the Lincoln Trail Area Development District in thanking Wendell for his years of achievement and wishing him well in the future. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me.                          ____________________
