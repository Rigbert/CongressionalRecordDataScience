President, let me, first of all, respond to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I agree. We have talked about the anguish.  We had a hearing yesterday where the service chiefs discussed the disaster facing our armed forces if we go through sequestration. I do not think most Members of this body fully understand what it means, not just to the defense of our country as a whole, but to each of the individual States.  In my State of Oklahoma, I am very concerned about Tinker Air Force Baseand its 16,000 civilian employees. What is going to happen there?  Anyway, let me just wind up this part by saying I have been ranked as the most conservative Member for many years. But I have always said: I am a big supporter of using our resources in two areas: One is national defense and the other is transportation and infrastructure.  A short while ago, the majority leader was kind enough to call my office and tell me I would be objecting to the consideration of the nomination of former Senator Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.  However, this is not a filibuster. I keep getting stopped by people out in the hall: Oh, we are going to filibuster. Who is going to filibuster?  What we are doing is not a filibuster. We are seeking a 60 vote threshold for a controversial nomination. If the majority really wanted to move forward quickly, all they have to do is agree to a 60-vote margin, like they did with the Sebelius and Bryson nominations.  In addition, as ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am obligated to assist the members of the committee.  First of all, the vote in the committee was a 100-percent partisan vote. Every Republican there voted against moving the Hagel nomination out of committee. Well, there has to be a reason for that.  One of the reasons--the major reason, I would say--and if you do not believe this, go back and look at the tape of the meeting yesterday where many of our members said: Why is it we are rushing to confirm Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense when he has not given us the information we have requested? One such Member is the junior Senator from Texas, who is in the Chamber with me right now.  But let me first clarify there is nothing unusual about requesting a 60-vote threshold. This happens all the time. I can remember when the majority leader agreed to a 60-vote threshold in the 2009 nomination of Kathleen Sebelius. She was confirmed.  There is nothing unusual about a 60-vote threshold.  John Bryson was nominated to be the Secretary of Commerce. Several of us had concerns about this nomination. Ultimately, he was confirmed. But once again the entire Senate agreed to a confirmation vote by a 60-vote margin.  I can remember when the majority leader--let me say this about the majority leader. He has been exceptionally good to me on things I have been involved in. I have two major bills that were my bills. One was in concert with Barbara Boxer--the highway bill. Frankly, I could not have gotten it passed without them. Another was my pilots' bill of rights. I could not get a hearing on it in committee. I tried for a year. He stepped in and helped me. I have said in national publications I could not have gotten it passed without Leader Harry Reid. So we have a very good relationship, and one which will continue.  However, Senator Reid, on numerous occasions, was concerned about Republican nominations. During the Bush Presidency, Stephen Johnson--who, incidentally, was a Democrat--was nominated to be EPA Administrator. I thought he would be good Administrator. There were several Democrats who thought he would not be good Administrator. So Harry Reid did what he is supposed to do, and he interceded on behalf of the Democrats who opposed him. As result, cloture was filed and, therefore, the nomination needed 60 votes to proceed. Well, the Administrator got 61 votes.  Another example was Dirk Kempthorne. He was nominated to be Secretary of the Interior. My colleagues will remember he is a former Senator from Idaho. Some objected to his confirmation. Of course, this was during the Bush administration. Senator Kempthorne was nominated, and he went ahead and was confirmed. It was a 60-vote margin. There is nothing unusual about this.  Getting back to Stephen Johnson, this is even more analogous to what we have right now because he was a Democrat who was nominated by a Republican President. Unfortunately, once again we were forced by the Democrats to have a cloture vote which requires 60 votes.  Stephen Johnson was a Democrat. So here we had the Republicans wanting Stephen Johnson and the Democrats not wanting Stephen Johnson. It is very analogous to what we have today. Today, we have former Senator Chuck Hagel, who is a Republican.  But in this case, we have a situation where cloture has been filed by the majority leader. I have no objection to voting. I do not want to wait. I do not want to string this out. I have other places to go other than hanging around here. I would vote tonight if we could just get the information that has been requested by the Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Keep in mind, the Hagel nomination was reported out of committee by a 100-percent partisan vote. All Republicans voted against sending him out. Why did they do it? They did it because we have not gotten the information we want.  I have a letter. This is a letter that is signed by 25 Republicans stating that we have not received the information necessary for a proper vetting of the Hagel nomination.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2013.     The Hon. Chuck Hagel,     Distinguished Professor in the Practice of National          Government, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service,          Gerorgetown University, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hagel, On January 29, two days before your      confirmation hearing, you received a request, via email, from      several Senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee for      additional information necessary to fairly assess your      nomination to be Secretary of Defense. The written copy of      the letter (delivered the next day) was signed by six      Senators, including the Ranking Member of the Committee. The      letter requested that you respond to the request before the      hearing, so that you could then answer questions concerning      your responses.       You declined to respond to the request for additional      financial disclosure.       At the hearing, you were told by Members of the Committee      that a response to our request for information would be      necessary before the Committee could vote on your nomination.      The Chairman of the Committee expressly asked you to submit      your response by Monday, February 4.       Monday came and went, and you still did not respond.       At the end of the day on Tuesday, February 5, you submitted      a short ``response'' to our request. In that response, you      explicitly declined to answer many of the questions asked of      you.       You were asked to disclose all compensation over $5,000      that you have received over the past five years. You declined      to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--the Atlantic Council has received foreign funding in      the past five years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--McCarthy Capital has received foreign funding in the      past ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--Corsair Capital has received foreign funding in the      past ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--Wolfensohn and Company has received foreign funding      in the past ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--M.I.C. Industries has received foreign funding in the      past ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--the National Interest Security Company has received      foreign funding in the ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--Elite Training and Security, LLC has received foreign      funding in the past ten years. You declined to do so.       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific      extent--Kaseman, LLC has received foreign funding in the past      ten years. You declined to do so.       Your own financial records are entirely within your own      control, and you have flatly refused to comply with the      Committee Members' request for supplemental information.       The records from the other firms--more than one of which,      you have disclosed, paid you $100,000 or more--are highly      relevant to the proper consideration of your nomination. Your      letter discloses no affirmative efforts on your part to      obtain the needed disclosure, and your lack of effort to      provide a substantive response on this issue is deeply      troubling.       If it is the case that you personally have received      substantial financial remuneration--either directly or      indirectly--from foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds,     lobbyists, corporations, or individuals, that information is      at the very minimum relevant to this Committee's assessment      of your nomination. Such remuneration may be entirely      appropriate, but that determination cannot be made without      disclosure.       If you have not received remuneration--directly or      indirectly--from foreign sources, then proper disclosure will      easily demonstrate that fact.       Your refusal to respond to this reasonable request suggests      either a lack of respect for the Senate's responsibility to      advise and consent or that you are for some reason unwilling      to allow this financial disclosure to come to light.       This Committee, and the American people, have a right to      know if a nominee for Secretary of Defense has received      compensation, directly or indirectly, from foreign sources.      Until the Committee receives full and complete answers, it      cannot in good faith determine whether you should be      confirmed as Secretary of Defense.       Therefore, in the judgment of the undersigned, a Committee      vote on your nomination should not occur unless and until you      provide the requested information.           Sincerely,       (Signed by 26 Senators).
