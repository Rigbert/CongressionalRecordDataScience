Chairman and Members, I am pleased to offer this amendment regarding additional resources for environmental justice on behalf of our esteemed colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who had to return to Texas this evening on very important official business.  The amendment is on page 26 of the 60-page bill, and it reprograms funding for the Department of Energy's departmental administration to increase support for environmental justice program activities by $1 million, offset by a reduction of like amount in funding for departmental corporate information technology programs. The amendment increases funding for the Department, and the program is an essential tool in the Department's effort to improve the lives of low-income and minority communities, as well as the environment at large.  Twenty years ago, when President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 that directed Federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income populations, America walked toward a new horizon, and we began to understand that a healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community which fosters personal and economic growth.  Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting sustainability and growth of the community and environment. The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environment and the continued preservation of their homes.  It is amazing to go through some of these communities and neighborhoods across our country and to look at issues like lead-based paint or, importantly, dumps from prior decades that have been covered over but are leaching everything from low-level radioactive waste to toxic pollutants that have been buried there for years and people are living right next door, sometimes on top of these situations. It is unbelievable.  In Ohio, it is amazing how many toxic sites have to be cleaned up, and it is not the only place. If you look at maps across our country of unattended environmental cleanups, it is staggering, and it is important to see who lives on top of or next door to these places.  Through education about the importance of environmental sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and how citizens can improve their own surroundings. America has to behave differently in 2014 than we did in 1900 or 1950 or 1980.  Funds that would be awarded to this important cause would increase youth involvement in STEM fields and also promote clean energy, weatherization, cleanup, and asset revitalization. These improvements would provide protections to our most vulnerable groups.  This program provides better access to technology for underserved communities and, together, the Departments of Energy and Agriculture have distributed over 5,000 computers to many of these low-income populations.  The Community Leaders Institute is another vital component of the environmental justice program. It ensures those in leadership positions understand what is happening in their communities and can, therefore, make informed decisions.  These programs have been expanded to better serve Native Americans and Alaska Natives, creating a prime example of how various other minority groups can be assisted as well.  Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also benefited by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management, and other related subjects.  The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, and the Department also works to increase low-income and minority access to STEM fields and help students attain graduate degrees, as well as find employment.                              {time}  1945  Since 2002, the tribal energy program has also funded 175 energy projects, amounting to over $41.8 million in order to help tribes invest in renewable sources of energy.  With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can provide clean energy options to our most underserved communities and help improve their environments, yielding better health outcomes and greater public awareness.  In fiscal year 2013, the environmental justice program was not funded. For fiscal year 2014, we ask that money be appropriated for the continuation of this vital initiative. We must help our low-income and minority communities, and ensure equality for those who are the most vulnerable.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Kaptur amendment, which actually is the Jackson Lee amendment, to improve the environmental justice program.  I yield back the balance of my time.
