President, I rise in recognition of the students of West Warwick Senior High School for representing the State of Rhode Island in the national competition for the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program. This year's national competition took place on May 4 to 6, 2002.  The We the People program and the competition is administered by the Center for Civic Education. The competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress and consists of oral presentations by high school studentsbefore a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.  It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and principles of our government. These are the ideals that bind us together as a nation. It is important for our next generation to understand these values and principles which we hold as standards in our endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional democracy.  On behalf of all Rhode Islanders, I would like to congratulate Najiya Abdul-Hakim, Janice Abueg, Peter Calci III, Kristin Capaldo, Elizabeth Champagne, Tara Cooney, Tara Czop, Paul DiMartino, Thomas Driscoll, Christopher Ellis, Tinisha Goldson, Kenneth Halpern, Sarah Johnson, Alyssa Lavallee, Robert Martin, Michael Muschiano, Lindsay Nagel, Michael Ouellette, Anthony Politelli, Michael Ryan, Kendall Silva, Sarah Smith, Corey St. Sauveur, Kate Studley, Erin Watson, Shane Wilcox, and their teacher Marc Leblanc. I would also like to acknowledge Rhode Island State Coordinator Henry Cote and District Coordinators Carlo Gamba and Michael Trofi for their dedication to this program over the years. These students truly represent the future leaders of our Nation.                          ____________________
