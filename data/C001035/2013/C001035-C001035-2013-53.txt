 I wish to point out that we have worked very hard to clear this list of amendments, and they include amendments from Members on both sides of the aisle. It is a fair list, and I had hoped we would be able to proceed tonight.  Regrettably, there is an objection on our side from Senator Coburn.  I am, however, optimistic that with further work we will be able to deal with that objection. My hope is that in the morning we will have an agreement that will allow me to agree, as the manager on our side, to this list. Unfortunately, at this time, I do need to object.
