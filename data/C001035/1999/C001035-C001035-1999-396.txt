NICKLES. I certain concur with my colleague from Maine that turning the responsibility over to HCFA won't make any improvement. It will make it worse.  I might qualify part of the Senator's statement. I am not sure that States are doing an excellent job in every area. I think they will do a much better job than they would be if it is turned it over to the Federal Government. I think they would be much closer to fixing the problem, and they could fix the problem of the absence of quality. I think they can fix that much, much better than we can by dictating it from Washington, DC.
