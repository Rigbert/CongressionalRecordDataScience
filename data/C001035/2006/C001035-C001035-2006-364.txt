President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable woman in Bangor, ME, the city I am proud to call home.  Her name is Katherine Lebowitz, but her friends call her Kay. And she has lots of friends: the citizens of Maine she represented so well in the State legislature, the residents of Bangor she served as mayor, the countless people who benefit from her tireless volunteer work for educational, cultural, and charitable causes.  Also among her close circle of friends are the more than 260,000 members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have passed through Bangor International Airport during the last 3 years of conflict. Whether Bangor is their last stop before going overseas or the first American soil they touch on the way home, Kay Lebowitz and the wonderful Bangor Troop Greeters are there. Nearly 1,500 military flights have landed in Bangor since 2003, and the Troop Greeters have met every one day or night with cookies, homemade fudge, cell phones to call loved ones back home, cheers of gratitude, and hearty handshakes.  At the age of 90 soon to be 91 Kay has arthritis that prevents her from shaking hands, so she hugs. She hugs until her arms ache, but there is a hug for everyone. To the returning troops, she says, ``Welcome home.'' To those headed out, it is ``See you on the way back.'' And she will.  Today K-I-S-S radio in Bangor is holding a roast in honor of Kay Lebowitz. This event will include the ceremonial ``retirement'' of a pair of her trademark eyeglasses very stylish eyeglasses into the Troop Greeters Hall of Fame at Bangor International Airport. This is precisely the kind of lighthearted gesture Kay enjoys most, and it is fully in keeping with her generous spirit.  I am sure my Senate colleagues join me and all Americans in thanking the Bangor Troop Greeters for their extraordinary efforts in expressing the gratitude we all share, and in wishing the very best on this special day to Kay Lebowitz. She is a remarkable woman and a great patriot.                          ____________________[Page S2597]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO KAY LEBOWITZ
