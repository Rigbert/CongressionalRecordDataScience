President, last year I said that this Nation of immigrants requires an official language. An overwhelming majority of the Senate agreed with me on my amendment to that effect on the immigration bill. I am convinced that official English will command another majority should it receive a rollcall vote in this session. That is why today I am introducing S. 1335 to make English the official language of our Nation.  The English language has played a critical role in establishing the unity of this Nation from its beginning. As I have said before, a common means of communication has created one giant market for goods and labor in our Nation, from Maine to California. A resident of Tulsa can seek work in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Georgia without having to learn a second language. A company based in Oklahoma City can readily sell its products from Portland, ME, to Los Angeles.  In Europe, by contrast, a resident of Berlin cannot look for work in Paris or Warsaw without surmounting considerable language barriers. A German company cannot usually sell its product in Madrid, again, in part, because of language barriers. The European Union is an effort to create a U.S.-like common market in Western Europe. Among other things, Europeans are spending billions of euros to try to replicate what we in America have enjoyed for free these past 230 years.  Recognizing that English is necessary for successful business and a growing economy, the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce recently announced that it is spearheading a multimillion dollar campaign to help about 50,000 of its residents to learn the language. I regret to report that we have spent the last few decades giving away this priceless linguistic unity.  Clinton Executive Order No. 13166 demands that all recipients of Federal funds function in any language anyone speaks at any time, burdening taxpayers with extraneous costs of an enabling policy while providing incentives for immigrants to circumvent learning English and, regretfully, hurt their chances at effective assimilation.  My constituents agree that foreign language ballots deserve no place in an American election. My bill will eliminate these foreign language voting materials and multilingual voting mandates imposed on Oklahoma and other States. Only citizens are allowed to vote in our Nation, and one of the requirements to become a good citizen is to show an understanding of English. Money to provide foreign language ballots would be better spent on such constructive activities as simply teaching people how to speak English.  Not only does my bill repeal foreign language ballots, it is aimed at the entire forest of mandatory multilingualism. My legislation basically recognizes the practical reality of the role of English as our official language and states explicitly that English is our official language and provides English a status in law it has not held before. Making English the official language will clarify that there is no entitlement to receive Federal documents and services in languages other than English and will end the practice of providing translation entitlements at taxpayer expense.  My bill declares that any rights of a person, as well as services or materials in languages other than English, must be authorized or provided by law. It recognizes the decades of unbroken court opinions that civil rights laws protecting against national origin and discrimination do not create rights to government service and materials in languages other than English. While my bill will end federally mandated and funded foreign language entitlement, it certainly still allows for Democratic and Republican activists to offer palm cards and sample ballots in any language they wish--from Cherokee to Chinese--on election day and for individuals to bring along their own translaters to any Federal Government office.  It is important to note that my bill only affects the language spoken by the Government, not the language choices of people speaking among themselves.  Official English is popular even among Hispanics. As I have cited before on the floor of the Senate, in 2006, a Zogby poll found 84 percent of Americans, including 71 percent of Hispanics,believe that English should be the national language of government operations. According to a 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, a poll of 91 percent of foreign-born Latino immigrants agreed that learning English is essential to succeed in the United States.  Allow me to conclude by remembering the founder of the official English movement, U.S. Senator S.I. Hayakawa. The son of Asian immigrants, S.I. Hayakawa became a professor of English, a college president, and, in 1976, a U.S. Senator. Senator Hayakawa became the leader of the official English effort in this Chamber when he introduced an official English bill on April 27, 1981. Senator Hayakawa used to say ``bilingualism for the individual is fine but not for a country.'' While I never served with Senator Hayakawa, I would like to honor his efforts and continue his important work by offering the S.I. Hayakawa Official English Act of 2007, which is S. 1335.  Let me say, it seems so ridiculous that as we travel around the world, there are some 51 countries that have English as their official language, and yet the United States doesn't. I was recently in Ghana, West Africa. They have English as their official language. We don't have it in the United States.  Zambia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have English as their official language but not the United States. This is something that should be a no-brainer. Of the 80-some percent of the people polled, up to 91 percent want English as the official language, and yet, for some unknown reason, people seem to be catering to some maybe small, radical group that doesn't want it. I think it is time for the majority of the American people to realize this could very well be the reality.  Let me also say, when I had this amendment on the floor before, there were all kinds of objections that came down that didn't have any credibility at all. One of them that came down said: Well, you have all these flags of the various States that have foreign languages; you would have to do away with State flags. This has nothing to do with that. One came down that said: You would no longer be able to use Spanish on the floor of the Senate. It has nothing to do with that. They said: You would be drowning Hispanics. I said: Explain that to me. They said: Well, we have ``no swimming'' signs in the Potomac where the currents are very strong, so people would go in there and they would drown. This is how desperate people are to find something objectionable about something that 90 percent of the people in America want.  So we are very serious about this. We are going to carry on the works of the good Senator from California and hopefully respond to 90 percent of Americans who want English as an official language.                                 ______                                       By
