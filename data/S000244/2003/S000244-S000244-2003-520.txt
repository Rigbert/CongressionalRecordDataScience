Armey. Representative Armey recently retired following 18 years of distinguished service in the House of Representatives, including eight years as the Majority Leader.  From his humble roots in Cando, North Dakota, to his rise in Washington, Dick Armey never drifted from his principles of honesty and integrity. He made life better not only for his constituents in Texas, but for Americans all across this great land. His work in Congress saved taxpayers millions of dollars annually. His sound conservative values renewed America's commitment to the principles of personal freedom and limited government.  As a loyal and dedicated conservative, Dick Armey advocated welfare reform, personal retirement accounts for Social Security, and fundamental reform of the tax code. He specifically supported implementing a flat tax. His persistence to this cause gave it a national platform. This cause continues in his new career at Citizens for a Sound Economy as its Co-Chairman.  It has been a great honor to spend most of my tenure in Congress working with Representative Armey, a fine Southern gentleman and true fiscal conservative. The naming of Room 236 in the U.S. Capitol as the Richard K. Armey room is a deserving tribute for a committed public servant. I will miss my good friend Grumpy, and I wish him and his wife Susan all the best in the future.                          ____________________
