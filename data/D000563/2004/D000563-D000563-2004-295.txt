I have a feeling of embarrassment and also sadness, sadness for the thousands of men and women in uniform risking their lives today, serving us so nobly in Iraq, who are going to be swept into this vortex. We have to make certain the soldiers who are responsible for this as well as their leaders in command are brought out and held accountable so that our fine men and women who are fighting in the military in Iraq do not have to bear this burden.
