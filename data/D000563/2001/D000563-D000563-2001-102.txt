 Madam President, several years ago Congress decided to pass a law which was revolutionary. It said that in the United States of America, if you had a child who needed special educational assistance, we were going to try to help that child. It really was a commitment that had never been made before.  I can recall, as a child growing up in my small hometown, that it was rare to see kids with learning disabilities and physical disabilities in my classroom. I do not know where those kids were. They were certainly here on Earth, but they were not in the classroom.  So Congress said: We are going to change that. We are going to open the doors of education in the schools across America to children with special needs--kids who are disabled, mentally and physically, kids who have learning disabilities. We are going to give them a chance.  That bill passed with an overwhelming, bipartisan vote because it sounded so right and so American for us to stand up and say: That is why America will be different.  We knew, when we passed that bill, it would not be easy because many of these children really need special attention. I have seen it in classrooms across Illinois and people have seen it across the Nation. But the success stories are so gratifying, that children, who would have been tossed in the trash heap just a few years ago, are given a chance. With special education and special assistance, they can become productive citizens in America and have a good, wholesome, and happy life.  Democrats and Republicans said: This is a good thing for us to do. But what are we going to do about school districts that turn these kids down, that will not give them the chance to go into the schools, where the parents are distraught, where they have no place to turn? What are we going to do in that situation?  The law said, if it comes to that, if the school district will not accept the child who needs special education, there may have to be a hearing. Of course, hearings involve attorneys. An attorney would have to stand up for that child and that child's family and try to give that child the chance the parents want.  Who will pay for that attorney, because some of these kids are from the poorest families in America. They are not all rich families and rich kids. The law said, when it comes to that issue, the court will decide. If the attorney representing that disabled child--a child with a learning problem--prevailsin the lawsuit, the court can award attorney fees to the attorney who represented the child, and the school district that resisted bringing the child in for special education will have to pay the attorney fees.  I have just stated the law in America. Through her amendment, the Senator from Texas wants to change what I have just described in one city--the District of Columbia--to say that in this, the Nation's Capital, we will not play by the same rules that Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, and every other State, including Alabama, plays by. No. In the District of Columbia we are going to do it differently. We are going to say, in the District of Columbia, no matter how complicated the case, no matter how many problems that child might have, no matter how many hearings might be necessary, no matter how much effort is put up by the school board to stop this child from coming into special education, no matter how much is involved in it, no attorney is paid more than $3,000, period--none, not a penny.  That $3,000 limit does not apply in Texas, does not apply in Illinois, Washington State, Alabama, or any other State. The Senator from Texas would have us apply that here in the District of Columbia.  So when you put a limit on the attorney's fees in complicated and difficult cases, how easy is it for a person, a family, a mother and a father, to find an attorney to represent their son or daughter? It becomes increasingly difficult.  What the Hutchison amendment does is to close the courthouse door, close the opportunity for administrative hearings for children who are seeking special education in the District of Columbia.  Need I remind my colleagues, the District of Columbia is one of the poorest cities in America. There are children in this city who, through no fault of their own, came to the Earth in the usual way--as Harry Chapin used to sing in a song--who came to the Earth in the usual way with a lot of problems, disabilities. These kids, through no fault of their own, will find the schoolhouse door is closed to them because of the Hutchison amendment.  She has said these kids cannot have the same legal representation as children all across America who are asking for an opportunity for special education. Her war is against trial lawyers. I used to be one. I plead guilty as charged, Your Honor. But I can tell you, to say that no lawyer will spend more than 20 hours on any case involving special education is just terrible. It is terrible when you consider the outcome. The losers here won't be the trial lawyers. They will find other work. The losers be will be the children and their families who do not want to give up hope for these kids.  Senator Hutchison says it is a matter of dollars and cents: Either give it to the trial lawyers or give it to the school district. Certainly, the schools of D.C. and schools across America need more money. But does this meet the test of fairness and justice? Does it meet the test of those who proudly voted for the IDEA legislation and said they really cared about special education? It does not meet that test.  Let me tell you something else that is unintended perhaps but has to be said: When Senator Hutchison limits the amount the District of Columbia can pay to any lawyer representing any child, no matter how complicated the case, to $3,000, do you know what the D.C. courts have said? They have said: We reject that. We are going to award to these attorneys the fees to which they are reasonably entitled. We understand the D.C. appropriations bill passed by Congress may limit how much Congress can pay out to those lawyers, but that is not going to limit our right under the IDEA bill to award these attorney's fees.  So what has happened?  Let's assume in a case that an attorney works long and hard for many years on a special education case and the court says, you are entitled to $10,000 in attorney's fees. The Hutchison amendment says, no, D.C. can only pay $3,000. What happens to the difference; what happens to the $7,000? The $7,000 is still an obligation of the District of Columbia. Senator Hutchison is not doing the District any favor.  What is happening is all of these awards in court above the Hutchison payment level continue to build up in the District of Columbia, and interest is running on them. This mountain of debt for the District of Columbia is going to be there whether Senator Hutchison or Senator Durbin like it or not. It is a reality. In every city and school district across America, they face their legal obligation--in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and in Illinois. But Senator Hutchison would say we won't face that legal obligation when it comes to the District of Columbia.  The root problem is the weakness and poor performance of the D.C. public school system. They come racing to us now and say, we don't want the attorneys who want children to come in as special education children to be paid what they are entitled to be paid by the court.  Litigation is merely a symptom of a larger problem. Fifteen percent of the kids in the D.C. public school system are special needs children, 10,500 children. The appropriate way to reduce the burden of litigation on the D.C. public school system is for the system to comply with the law and provide the services and education that children with special needs deserve in every State in the Union, and every school district in America plays by those rules. But not under the Hutchison amendment. She has said there will be one exception: the District of Columbia, one of the poorest cities in America with children suffering from learning disabilities. That system, those children, those families will not have the same legal representation as kids across America.  Singling out the District of Columbia is just plain wrong. This isn't a war against trial lawyers. This is a war against poor children who need a helping hand. That is just not fair.  I asked before in the earlier debate, why is it when this appropriations bill comes to the floor, every Member of the Senate and House wants to turn into a mayor or a member of the city council? Time and again we defer these judgments to the city council and mayor. In Springfield, IL, and Chicago, IL, we say: It is your call. When it comes to the District of Columbia, no, we want to superimpose our decision, our judgment. It is not fair for the District of Columbia public school system to be standing here begging to be treated as a home rule unit and then say to Congress: Make sure you carve out a little exception for D.C. when it comes to special education students. They want to have it both ways.  The mayor, whom I respect very much, has talked out of both sides of his mouth on this issue. I don't know where he stands on this issue. I can't follow it. I really respect this man. But eight members of the D.C. city council have written a letter, a compelling letter. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the D.C. council of September 24 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    Council of the                                         District of Columbia,                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2001.     Re: special education attorney fees.     Hon. Mary Landrieu,     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, Senate          Committee on Appropriations, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Landrieu: As the Congress considers the      District's appropriation for fiscal year 2002 we understand      that the House has dropped any provision limiting attorney      fees in special education cases. We hope and urge that the      Senate agree.       As you know, the federal Individuals with Disabilities      Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) mandates special      education for children with learning disabilities, and      provides that where a child must go to court to effect his or      her right that child (if he wins) is entitled to have his      attorney's fees paid by the government. That the District has      been singled out for the last three years with a limit on the      fees has been a matter of great controversy.       The position of the Council and Mayor is quite clear: we      adopted a proposed budget that contains no cap on attorneys      fees. Our objections to a fee cap include:       A cap makes it more difficult for children to obtain      special education to which they are entitled. It is a simple      fact: a cap on fees reduces the number of attorneys willing      to take such cases and, therefore, reduces access to counsel.       A cap discriminates against low income children. Affluent      families can afford legal representation; the cap affects      them but they still have an economic ability to help their      children.       The effect of the cap is to treat the children of the      District of Columbia differently--and less favorably--than      any other child in any other state in the nation. District      children have fewer rights with the cap.       The way to improve special education in the District of      Columbia must be programmatic--improve the programs rather      than limit the advocacy for special needs children.       We want public school children to obtain the best possible      education. Reforms must be done in a way that does not      disadvantage children. It is our strongly held view that the      cap on attorney fees places already vulnerable children at an      even greater disadvantage. For all of these reasons we ask      that the Senate follow the House and eschew any provision      limiting attorneys fees for prevailing parties under the      federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.           Sincerely,     Sharon Ambrose,       Ward 6.     David Catania,       At-Large.     Kevin Chavous,       Chairman Comm. on Education & Libraries.     Adrian Fenty,       Ward 4.
