Speaker, this morning I would like to share a few stories with you that I think are appropriate when you look at the debate which we are facing here in Washington, not only this week but for the next several weeks.  They are about some children. They are kids that I remember but I do not know their names. Let me tell you why.  The first child I remember was in St. John's Hospital in Springfield, IL in my district. I was invited to come to the unit there where premature infants are being cared for and of course you put on a gown and a mask and walk in with the nurse and the doctor. And they pointed to a tiny little isolette with a little baby in there, no larger than the size of my hand, a baby that had its eyes taped shut and had more tubes and monitors in its small body than were imaginable.  The story of course was that that baby was born too soon and as a result would be in this intensive care unit for at least a month and maybe longer with the hopes that when she did come out at the end, she would then be able to grow like a normal baby and lead a normal life.  The heroic efforts that were being undertaken for that infant are repeated every day across America. Unfortunately, repeated too many times.  Several years ago we took a look at the incidence of low-birth-weight babies in our country and found some shocking results. It turns out that the infant death rate in America was higher several years ago than in most industrialized countries in the world. Think about it. Our country, with the best medical resources, was still having children born of low birth weight with problems that really haunted them, many of them for the rest of their lives. When I talked to the head of the medical school, Dr. Richard Moy in Springfield, IL at the SIU Medical School, he said, ``Congressman, the saddest part of it, this is entirely preventable; this is entirely preventable. If we can bring mothers in early in their regular pregnancy, give them prenatal care, we have the medical knowledge to deliver a healthy baby in virtually every case.''  So the Federal Government, which is often the butt boy and the target of so many criticisms, decided to really invest money to reduce the number of low birth weight babies. The program we chose is one that has been around for awhile. It is called the WIC Program, the Women, Infants and Children's Supplemental Feeding Program. And we decided to take some of our precious Federal tax dollars and put it into our most precious asset, these children who will be tomorrow's leaders, our kids.  And you know what, it is working. It is working because now 40 percent of the infants in America are being brought into the WIC Program, kids especially vulnerable from low income families. I am proud to tell you that we are seeing the infant death rate in this country go down. Surely we still have low-birth-weight kids but not as many as we would without the WIC Program.  The reason I tell you this story and tell you the story about this little infant is that we are now debating whether or not to cut the money for that WIC Program. That is right, whether or not we are going to cut the money for the program that is trying to keep fewer low-birth-weight babies being born in America. In the name of a balanced budget, in the name of cutting spending, in the name of reducing the Federal role, we are going to cut this program.  My friends, the Republicans on the other side say it is the way to save money. Do you really save money with a low-birth-weight baby? Do you know how much it cost at St. John's Hospital several years ago for that low-birth-weight baby? At least $1,000 a day. So a pregnancy, which ordinarily would cost $1,500 to $2,000 under normal circumstances ended up with a baby that costs us, as taxpayers, $30,000 a month with the hopes that that little girl would come out of that experience and lead a normal life and not need more care afterward.  What a false economy. Yet the Republicans argue that reducing the money for WIC is what America really needs and really wants for its future.  Let me shift to another child, a child I saw in my own hometown again, at a school breakfast program. A happy child, a kid who was having fun, who got to school early so that she could get that little lunch or little breakfast, rather, and have her day ahead of her. She was happy and bouncing around and having a good time of it. I talked to a teacher about the school breakfast program and school lunch program. I said, what do they mean to you? And she said they mean everything. Did you ever consider the chore that faces a teacher trying to teach a child who is hungry? That child is listless, stares at its hands, stares at the floor, cannot concentrate. I do not have a chance, she said, in terms of teaching that child.  So we invest each year in the basics of providing nutrition for school lunch programs and school breakfasts so that kids can go through that learning experience and come out happy, healthy, and learning. The Republicans have told us we need to cut that program, too. I hope we keep those images in mind as we get into this budget debate. We certainly cannot have a strong America without strong children. It is a false economy for us to cut programs for children, and I hope that the Gingrich Republicans will think twice before they make these cuts.                          ____________________
