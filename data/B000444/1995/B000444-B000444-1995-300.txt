 BAUCUS. Just a second. We cannot do that on this bill. We cannot provide that amendment on this bill because that is a revenue measure, and it will be blue-slipped by the House of Representatives. That is, they will just not consider it, because as a revenue bill, it did not originate in the House. When we get to reconciliation, we then have an opportunity to include this provision in reconciliation, which I think is the way to solve the Amtrak problem. The deficit in Amtrak is about $1 billion a year. We have to make a lot of changes in Amtrak, spruce it up, and make it more efficient and so forth. But here is a way to provide $600 million a year without increasing taxes, and because Amtrak is so important to our country--it is vitally important throughout America. There are only two or three States that do not have Amtrak service, but the rest do. I suggest that the better way to handle this whole problem is to pursue the alternative I am suggesting, which solves the Amtrak problem, rather than the amendment before us which I think will cause a lot of headaches and heartaches and will not even begin to solve the problems that we have to deal with regarding Amtrak.  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.
