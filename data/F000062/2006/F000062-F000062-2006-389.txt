 Boxer) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:                               S. Res 468       Whereas Channel Islands National Monument was designated in      1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt under the authority      of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 note);       Whereas the Monument was expanded to include additional      islands and redesignated as Channel Islands National Park in      1980 to protect the nationally significant natural, scenic,      wildlife, marine, ecological, archaeological, cultural, and      scientific values of the Channel Islands in California;       Whereas Santa Rosa Island was acquired by the United States      in 1986 for approximately $29,500,000 for the purpose of      restoring the native ecology of the Island and making the      Island available to the public for recreational uses;       Whereas Santa Rosa Island contains numerous prehistoric and      historic artifacts and provides important habitat for several      threatened and endangered species;       Whereas under a court-approved settlement, the nonnative      elk and deer populations are scheduled to be removed from the      Park by 2011 and the Island is to be restored to management      consistent with other National Parks; and       Whereas there have been recent proposals to remove Santa      Rosa Island from the administration of the National Park      Service or to direct the management of the Island in a manner      inconsistent with existing legal requirements and the sound      management of Park resources: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) Channel Islands National Park, including Santa Rosa      Island, should continue to be administered by the National      Park Service in accordance with the National Park Service      Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) and other applicable laws;       (2) the National Park Service should manage Santa Rosa      Island in a manner that ensures that--       (A) the natural, scenic, and cultural resources of the      Island are properly protected, restored, and interpreted for      the public; and       (B) visitors to the Park are provided with a safe and      enjoyable Park experience; and       (3) the National Park Service should not be directed to      manage Santa Rosa Island in a manner--       (A) that would result in the public being denied access to      significant portions of the Island; or       (B) that is inconsistent with the responsibility of the      National Park Service to protect native resources within the      Park, including threatened and endangered species.
