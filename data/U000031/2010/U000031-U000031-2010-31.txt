MacPhee of Schoolcraft, Michigan, who will become Chairman of the Independent Community Bankers of America, ICBA, on Thursday, March 18, 2010.  Mr. MacPhee's long association and dedication to the ICBA has unquestionably qualified him for this position. He has served as chairman of the ICBA Membership/Marketing Committee and is this year's ICBPAC auction chairman. He has served as vice-chairman and an at-large member of the ICBA Executive Committee and represented the State of Michigan on the ICBA Board of Directors.  Southwest Michigan has greatly benefited from Mr. MacPhee's career in the community banking industry.

Mr.MacPhee's dedication to Michiganders has been evident in both his career and his long history of community involvement.
