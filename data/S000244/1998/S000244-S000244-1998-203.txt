(a) In General.--Section 504 of title 17, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new      subsection:       ``(d) Performing Rights Societies; Binding Arbitration.--       ``(1) Arbitration of disputes prior to court action.--       ``(A) Arbitration.--(i) If a general music user and a      performing rights society are unable to agree on the      appropriate rate or fee to be paid for the user's past or      future performance of musical works in the repertoire of the      performing rights society, the general music user shall, in      lieu of any other dispute-resolution mechanism established by      any judgment or decree governing the operation of the      performing rights society, be entitled to binding arbitration      of such disagreement pursuant to the rules of the American      Arbitration Association. The music user may initiate such      arbitration.       ``(ii) The arbitrator in such binding arbitration shall      determine a fair and reasonable rate or fee for the general      music user's past and future performance of musical works in      such society's repertoire and shall determine whether the      user's past performances of such musical works, if any,      infringed the copyrights of works in the society's      repertoire. If the arbitrator determines that the general      music user's past performances of such musical works      infringed the copyrights of works in the society's      repertoire, the arbitrator shall impose a penalty for such      infringement. Such penalty shall not exceed the arbitrator's      determination of the fair and reasonable license fee for the      performances at issue.       ``(B) Definitions.--(i) For purposes of this paragraph, a      `general music user' is any person who performs musical works      publicly but is not engaged in the transmission of musical      works to the general public or to subscribers through      broadcast, cable, satellite, or other transmission.       ``(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, transmissions within      a single commercial establishment or within establishments      under common ownership or control are not transmissions to      the general public.       ``(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), an `establishment' is      a retail business, restaurant, bar, inn, tavern, or any other      place of business in which the public may assemble.       ``(C) Enforcement of arbitrator's determinations.--An      arbitrator's determination under this paragraph is binding on      the parties and may be enforced pursuant to sections 9      through 13 of title 9.       ``(2) Court-annexed arbitration.--(A) In any civil action      brought against a general music user, as defined in paragraph      (1) for infringement of the right granted in section 106(4)      involving a musical work that is in the repertoire of a      performing rights society, if the general music user admits      the prior public performance of one or more works in the      repertoire of the performing rights society but contests the      rate or the amount of the license fee demanded by such      society for such performance, the dispute shall, if requested      by the general music user, be submitted to arbitration under      section 652(e) of title 28. In such arbitration proceeding,      the arbitrator shall determine the appropriate rate and      amount owed by the music user to the performing rights      society for all past public performances of musical works in      the society's repertoire. The amount of the license fee shall      not exceed two times the amount of the blanket license fee      that would be applied by the society to the music user for      the year or years in which the performances occurred. In      addition, the arbitrator shall, if requested by the music      user, determine a fair and reasonable rate or license fee for      the music user's future public performances of the musical      works in such society's repertoire.       ``(B) As used in this paragraph, the term `blanket license'      means a license provided by a performing rights society that      authorizes the unlimited performance of musical works in the      society's repertoire, for a fee that does not vary with the      quantity or type of performances of musical works in the      society's repertoire.       ``(3) Term of license fee determination.--In any      arbitration proceeding initiated under this subsection, the      arbitrator's determination of a fair and reasonable rate or      license fee for the performance of the music in the      repertoire of the performing rights society concerned shall      apply for a period of not less than 3 years nor more than 5      years after the date of the arbitrator's determination.''.       (b) Actions That Shall Be Referred to Arbitration.--Section      652 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at      the end the following:       ``(e) Actions That Shall Be Referred to Arbitration.--In      any civil action against a general music user for      infringement of the right granted in section 106(4) of title      17 involving a musical work that is in the repertoire of a      performing rights society, if the general music user admits      the public performance of any musical work in the repertoire      of the performing rights society but contests the rate or the      amount of the license fee demanded by the society for such      performance, the district court shall, if requested by the      general music user, refer the dispute to arbitration, which      shall be conducted in accordance with section 504(d)(2) of      title 17. Each district court shall establish procedures by      local rule authorizing the use of arbitration under this      subsection. The definitions set forth in title 17 apply to      the terms used in this subsection.''.     SEC. 204. VICARIOUS LIABILITY PROHIBITED.       Section 501 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by      adding at the end the following:       ``(f) A landlord, an organizer or sponsor of a convention,      exposition, or meeting, a facility owner, or any other person      making space available to another party by contract, shall      not be liable under any theory of vicarious or contributory      infringement with respect to an infringing public performance      of a copyrighted work by a tenant, lessee, subtenant,      sublessee, licensee, exhibitor, or other user of such space      on the ground that--       ``(1) a contract for such space provides the landlord,      organizer or sponsor, facility owner, or other person a right      or ability to control such space and compensation for the use      of such space; or       ``(2) the landlord, organizer or sponsor, facility owner,      or other person has or had at the time of the infringing      performance actual control over some aspects of the use of      such space, if the contract for the use of such space      prohibits infringing public performances and the landlord,      organizer or sponsor, facility owner, or other person does      not exercise control over the selection of works      performed.''.     SEC. 205. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.       Section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by      inserting after the undesignated paragraph relating to the      definition of ``perform'' the following:       ``A `performing rights society' is an association,      corporation, or other entity that licenses the public      performance of nondramatic musical works on behalf of      copyright owners of such works, such as the American Society      of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc.,      and SESAC, Inc. The `repertoire' of a performing rights      society consists of those works for which the society      provides licenses on behalf of the owners of copyright in the      works.''.     SEC. 206.
