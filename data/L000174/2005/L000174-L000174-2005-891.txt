President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to commend a longtime friend and adviser who has spent his career in service to Vermont and American agriculture, Harold J. Howrigan of Fairfield, VT.  Harold has served the dairy industry long and well, bringing his farmer's ingenuity, common sense and perseverance to his efforts. He has served on the St. Albans Co-operative Board of Directors since 1981 and at the upcoming 2005 Annual Meeting he will be stepping down to enjoy time with his family on their home farm in Fairfield.  Harold, his wife Anne and their sons operate two farms comprised of over 500 head of cattle, some 1,800 acres of cropland and forest, including a significant maple sugaring operation. Harold and Anne have opened their home and the farm to many dairy industry leaders, international dignitaries, government officials, co-op customers and, I daresay, even a campaign commercial or two along the way. Anyone who has had the good fortune to visit the Howrigans enjoys the beautiful views and witnesses the hard work and pride that Harold and his family take in the stewardship of their farming operations.  As much as he loves that line of Fairfield hills, Harold has spent considerable time away from his farming operation serving his community andVermont agriculture. Locally, Harold is active in the St. Patrick's Church and the Franklin County Maple Producers Co-op. On the State level, he has served as president of the Green Mountain Dairy Farmers Federation of Cooperatives and as a director with both the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association and the Vermont Dairy Promotion Council.  Regionally, Harold was the chairperson of the Vermont Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission. In fact, Harold's tireless efforts were a key force in the establishment and successful implementation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The long-standing relationship between Harold and the Cooperative with the Vermont Congressional Delegation was critical in the passage of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact at the national level which provided stability to dairy farmer income without adverse effects on consumers. He has also served as Chair of the Council of Northeast Farmer Cooperatives.  In addition to championing the Compact, Harold has been active in other national dairy industry organizations serving the interests of dairy farmers beyond Vermont on the U.S. Dairy Export Council, and the National Milk Producers Federation. As Chair of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, he was awarded the Richard E. Ling Award for the distinguished service in January of 2001.  The St. Albans Cooperative Creamery was most fortunate to benefit from Harold's leadership over his years as Director beginning in 1981, and as board president since 1988. In his 24 years with the Cooperative, Harold has seen the Cooperative increase in yearly milk volume to over a billion pounds, build a partnership with Ben & Jerry's ice cream, expand its territory into New York State, acquire the Independent Dairymen's Association and develop a strategic relationship with Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services.  Throughout his distinguished career, Harold has remained among my most trusted advisers on farm policy. I know that I can always count on him to provide the unvarnished truth, based on experience forged on a Vermont dairy farm with its tradition of hard work, common sense, simplicity, love of family and service to community, state and country. I join countless Vermonters and Americans as we all thank Harold for his years of service and consider myself fortunate to call him my friend.                          ____________________[Pages S1113-S1114]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           RETIREMENT OF HAROLD J.
