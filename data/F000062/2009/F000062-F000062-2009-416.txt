 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Cornyn to introduce legislation that will address one of the most serious problems facing our Nation--the long-term health of Social Security and Medicare.  Today we propose a bipartisan, independent and permanent commission to return these essential programs to solid financial footing for generations to come.  Our legislation mandates the periodic, comprehensive review of Social Security and Medicare to ensure their present and future solvency.  By a year from the date of enactment, it requires the Commission to devise and recommend to Congress and the President a benefit and revenue structure that allows Social Security and Medicare to become, once again, stable and effective over the long-term.  The problem we face is astronomical. President-elect Barack Obama is well aware of this, and said so on the front page of today's Washington Post.  He recognizes the growing threat this problem represents to the long-term health of our economy, and to the American people. So I look forward to working with him to find ways to ensure the long-term health of these great American institutions.  He recognizes, as Senator Cornyn and I do, that inaction is dangerous.  The Congressional Budget Office announced last week that the fiscal year 2009 deficit is projected to reach $1.2 trillion, a new record.  The three largest entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare, andMedicaid, are expected to grow by at least 8 percent this year.  Meanwhile, the Social Security funding shortfall has ballooned to roughly $4.3 trillion--the amount necessary to continue full benefits being paid past 2083.  Medicare is in far worse shape, needing $12.4 trillion over the next 75 years to close the gap and remain in balance.  The numbers tell the story: growing cash flow deficits will exhaust the Medicare trust fund in 2019, and Social Security reserves will be overcome in 2041, according to the most recent Trustees report.  Our legislation takes a new approach and is bipartisan to the core.  Fifteen experts, some of whom are Members of Congress from the committees of jurisdiction, are appointed. They take a full year to conduct town hall meetings nationwide, assess these trillion dollar programs from top to bottom, and rationalize their cost structure through intensive evaluation.  We advocate an open and transparent process, where all American voices can be heard.  Too often during my time in the Senate I have seen approaches that rely strictly on elected officials meeting privately and out of the public view fail. A workable solution to these problems must be transparent.  In the 110th Congress alone, there were no less than six proposals to reform Social Security. The Commission we propose would not be offering one-time solutions that get tossed aside and collect dust.  Far from it: the Commission's detailed analysis, nonpartisan recommendations and findings are provided in writing and take the form of legislation that Congress formally considers.  The Senate and House, in turn, through expedited legislative procedures, will hopefully be poised to amend if need be and then enact the changes into law. To be clear, this legislation will not prevent our colleagues from the opportunity to improve the Commission's proposals.  We do not hold out, today, certain ideas that we believe the members of the commission ought to consider.  We rely on their independent expertise and motivation to derive what is best for the Nation. Then we let the chips fall where they may from there.  President-elect Obama's choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Peter Orszag, agrees that Social Security is one of America's most successful Government programs.  But failure to act on real reform, in his words, ``merely exacerbates the painful choices that will ultimately be necessary.''  While such reforms will be difficult, he ultimately argues that, ``Social Security can be mended in a safe, realistic way, while protecting the most vulnerable beneficiaries.''  I believe Mr. Orszag is correct. It will be only a matter of time before we must implement real Social Security reform.  That's because 51 million people, or 1 out of every 6 Americans, depend on it.  And by 2034, an astounding 74 million Americans will receive this guaranteed benefit. At that time there will be only 2.1 workers for every one beneficiary.  For more than 20 percent of retirees, Social Security is it: their only source of income.  For half of those 51 million, Social Security keeps them out of poverty. And for almost two-thirds, Social Security makes up more than half of their total income.  Six and one half million widows and widowers rely on Social Security, as do 7.5 million disabled workers and their 1.6 million children.  The long-term challenges are significant. It's not a crisis; we have time to implement gradual reform over time, but we need to get started.  However, the current economic crisis leads me to believe that nothing is for certain.  While the projected shortfall for Social Security amounts to about $4.3 trillion, the fact of the matter is that 100 percent of benefits can be paid until 2041 by some estimates, Social Security Administration, or 2049 by others, CBO. Beyond that time horizon, 78 percent of benefits can be paid.  So the bottom line is that there is the time, the know-how, and the resources to, be able to maintain the current system, with phased adjustments occurring over many years to the Social Security Trust Fund.  The key, of course, is coming to a rational consensus--Democrats and Republicans united--in the effort to to make Social Security solvent from this day forward.  Most budget experts agree that the Social Security problem pales in comparison to the enormous shortfall facing Medicare Trust Fund, Part A--over the next 75 years a total of $12.4 trillion. The various technical estimates are that Medicare is projected to become insolvent far sooner than Social Security.  In fact, the most recent Medicare Trustees report confirms that the trust fund will be exhausted in 2019.  Closing the trust fund gap demands action.  Pressure on Medicare will only grow as the Baby Boom generation ages yet the number of beneficiaries skyrockets upwards--from 44 million now, a number which will double by 2030--as the Baby Boom generation ages.  Compounding the problem, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare spending will rise to 10.8 percent of the gross domestic product by 2082, up from 3.2 percent of GDP today.  Because the program is financed through payroll taxes and general tax revenue, the pressure is building now on working Americans given the huge demographic changes we expect as Baby Boomers retire.  The plain truth is that surging health care costs exceed economy growth. This health care spending must be controlled or Medicare faces a dire situation.  In closing, I should note that Congress is debating a historic stimulus initiative, designed to pull our economy out of this current downturn. While these investments are likely necessary, I strongly believe that they should be coupled with the framework to return to long-term fiscal sanity.  I know the incoming administration recognizes the gravity of this situation.  I look forward to working with the new President, and my colleagues, to advance positive solutions to address the looming entitlement crisis.                                 ______                                       By
