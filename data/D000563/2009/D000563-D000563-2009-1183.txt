President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for acknowledging Earth Day. All of us are conscious of the fact that, at least over the last 30 years or so, we have begun to realize the importance of our environment and the important responsibility we have toward our environment. I am troubled by the fact that only a few weeks ago on this very Senate floor as we debated the budget resolution, amendment after amendment was offered to try to stop us from dealing with the issue of global warming. I think it is a sad commentary that still too many Senators of both political parties are looking for excuses to do nothing. We give our speeches, we acknowledge to student groups and others that we face a challenge. Yet when we have an opportunity, as we do in the Senate, to deal with that, too many of my colleagues race away. We cannot do that any longer. We owe it to future generations to make important, albeit difficult, decisions which will lead us to the point where we are resolving the challenge of global warming and climate change. These are realities. We owe nothing less to the next generation but to come up with responsible approaches to those.  The budget resolution debate of a few weeks ago was a discouraging chapter in this saga. I hope many of my colleagues will come to realize that we must accept this responsibility.                          ____________________
