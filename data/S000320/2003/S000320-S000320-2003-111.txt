 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, Jean Elizabeth Rodgers Sutton, of Linden, AL. Jean Sutton died on Tuesday, September 16, at the age of 62.  Jean was born in Jackson, MS, and attended Hinds Junior College in Raymond, MS. She received a Junior College Press Association Scholarship to continue her education at the University of Southern Mississippi.  It was at the University of Southern Mississippi that she met her husband, Goodloe Sutton, and they were married in 1964 after Jean had graduated and worked for a year as editor of the Tylertown Times in Tylertown, MS.  After moving to Linden, Jean worked as a reporter for the award-winning Democrat Reporter, the weekly newspaper owned by her husband. She also taught girls physical education and journalism at Linden High School.After teaching at Linden High School for two years, she began working full time for the Democrat Reporter where she served as managing editor.  Together, Jean and Goodloe worked as a husband-and-wife reporting team. In the 1990s, they successfully exposed corruption and a drug ring involving the Marengo County Sheriff's office, amid death threats and intense pressure throughout their community. Their investigative reporting led to an FBI investigation and the conviction of the county's sheriff in 1997.  Jean also found time to raise a family. She and Goodloe raised two exceptional sons. Their son, Howard Goodloe, is a graduate of Auburn University and I am pleased to have him as a member of my staff. He has served as my State Director since 2000. And, William Robert Sutton attends Southern Union Community College.  Jean Sutton was a good friend, a leader in the Linden community, and a role model for investigative journalists. Her tremendous courage, her hard work and sacrifices on behalf of her readers, and her dedication to her family serve as an example of excellence for every reporter, parent and citizen. She will be greatly missed by many.                          ____________________
