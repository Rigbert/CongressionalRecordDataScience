Speaker, when you start wondering where all the jobs in America have gone, just read the labels on what you buy. You will know the answer. What's happened to the proud logo, ``Made in America''?  Our jobs have gotten shipped out by the millions and millions by the multinationals. They offshored them to places where people who labor in sweatshops can't afford to buy what they make. America will create jobs here again when we start making products here again. We have been amassing a trillion dollars of trade deficit year after year. That means more imports coming in here than our imports going out.  So read labels carefully. Maytag washing machines used to be made in Newton, Iowa. Now they are made in Monterrey, Mexico. You know what? The people down there can't afford to buy what they make. Then those machines are shipped back here. And did you notice the price for us didn't go down? Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions of our jobs were outsourced to places where some of our students can't even spell the names.  Did you know 10 percent of the exports out of China go to one company? Wal-Mart, you guessed it--clothing, tools, gloves, even frozen fish.  When you start wondering where all the jobs have gone, just read the labels on what you buy. You will find the right answer. It's time to make goods in America again.                          ____________________
