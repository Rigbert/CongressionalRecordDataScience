 Every week, Matt has been a staple in our living rooms, helping us forget about Michigan's challenges for a little while as he sang the hits in his own impressive style.  A life-long Michigan resident, Matt grew up in Ypsilanti, Michigan where he began his musical career by playing drums at his local church. As time passed, Matt became more serious about music. He taught himself how to play the piano and began singing at the age of sixteen. Matt spent his college years in Kalamazoo and attended Western Michigan University, where he studied organizational communication and was a member of the jazz ensemble Gold Company II. After graduating from Western, Matt decided to make Kalamazoo his home and became a regular performer at Monaco Bay and Zazio's lounge, building quite a local following--including me and my staff.  Matt was a performer on American Idol this season, wowing us time and time again with his polished performances. The State of Michigan has been rooting for him from the beginning and we in Kalamazoo are proud to call Matt Giraud our home town idol. Matt, congratulations on your success and we look forward to watching you succeed in the years ahead.  Although Matt's run is over on American Idol, a brilliant career is just beginning.                          ____________________
