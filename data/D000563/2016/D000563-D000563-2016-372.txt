 For more than 50 years, Congress has recognized February as American Heart Month. During this time, we have seen many advances in reducing congenital heart defects, heart disease, stroke, and other forms of cardiovascular disease through improvements in research, education, prevention, and treatment.  Over 1 million cardiovascular disease deaths are now averted each year thanks to advances in biomedical research, prevention programs, and the development of new drugs and therapies; yet every 15 minutes, a child is born with a heart defect, and nearly 86 million adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, and heart disease alone remains our Nation's leading cause of death.  For millions of families across the country, including mine, the impact of heart defects and disease can be overwhelmingly painful.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, parents can now afford health insurance, and coverage can no longer be denied for a preexisting condition. Also, insurers cannot set arbitrary lifetime or annual limits on care. These protections can be lifesaving, literally, when dealing with congenital heart conditions.  And while I am so proud of what we did in health reform to improve access to care, we must do more to improve quality of care--and that means finding ways to better treat and even prevent these diseases.  Thankfully, there is hope for patients and families across the country. Breakthroughs in research are getting us closer to understanding the risk factors and causes of these diseases. We are developing new drugs and therapies to help those who are suffering, and we are improving standards of care for those living with and managing these diseases.  Increases in funding for the NIH and CDC in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill will support these critical efforts in prevention, research, and treatment. We provided a historic funding increase of $2 billion for the NIH, and the CDC's budget was increased by nearly 5 percent. These increases will support leading research efforts at the NIH on the causes of cardiovascular diseases and possible treatments; community prevention programs at the CDC; as well as initiatives to gather data and track the incidence of congenital heart disease. These cannot be onetime increases. We must commit to sustained long-term investments in our Federal health agencies--that means ensuring robust funding increases above inflation year after year. That is why I will again fight for funding equal to five percent real growth in the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills for NIH, CDC, and seven other research agencies that contribute to medical and scientific advancements consistent with two bills I have introduced.  The American Cures Act would provide annual budget increases of five percent over inflation every year for 10 years at American's top four biomedical research agencies: the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Department of Defense health programs; and the VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research Program, its biomedical research arm.  The American Innovations Act would invest an additional $110 billion over 10 years in the critically important basic science research at America's top research agencies: the National Science Foundation; the Department of Energy Office of Science; the Department of Defense Science and Technology Programs; the National Institute of Standards and Technology Scientific and Technical Research; and the NASA Science Directorate.  We can't afford not to invest in the work these critical agencies are doing. And let me tell you why.  A few weeks ago, I was in Peoria, IL, touring the OSF Hospital there. Researchers from the University of Illinois Medical School are teaming up with the engineering department in joint efforts to bring new technologies to medical breakthroughs. They showed me a model of an infant's heart. It was an exact 3-D printed replica of an actual infant heart with serious congenital defects that would be operated on. The model was producedthrough MRIs and CAT scans. This allows surgeons to look at the heart, open it, and prepare for the procedures that they are about to conduct. It meant less time on the heart-lung machine, and it improves the odds of a positive recovery. These medical breakthroughs--made possible by Federal, State, and private contributions--are giving millions of Americans hope.  In early January, surgeons at Prairie Heart Institute in my hometown of Springfield, IL, operated on a local woman from Decatur. The doctors replaced two diseased heart valves with artificial valves that were threaded into position inside catheters, smaller than the width of a pencil. This procedure is known as a double trans-catheter valve replacement. This successful surgery was only the fourth of its kind in the United States, and the first in the world to use the latest generation of artificial valves. The lead surgeons were from Prairie and Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. Had the valve not been replaced, the patient would have faced a substantially higher risk for death from congestive heart failure.  As co-chair of the Senate NIH Caucus, and co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, I want to thank my colleagues for their commitment to lifesaving research for all Americans. I also want to thank the researchers, advocates, public health professionals, families, and patients for their leadership and tireless support for advancements in the science and treatment of heart diseases.  There is more work to be done, but I am optimistic for breakthroughs in the near future.  Thank you.                          ____________________
