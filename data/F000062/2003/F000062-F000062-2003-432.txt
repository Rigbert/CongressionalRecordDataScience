 President, I am pleased to support the nomination of Judge Cormac Carney for the Central District of California.  Judge Carney is a bright, young judge with truly impressive credentials. Judge Carney graduated cum laude from UCLA, where he earned All-American honors as a wide receiver. He attended Harvard Law School, worked as a partner for the prestigious law firm of O'Melveny & Myers, and has served with distinction as a Los Angeles Superior Court judge.  I am confident he will prove a valuable addition to the bench in the Southern District of California.  Today's vote on Judge Carney marks a milestone event for California's bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee, which Senator Barbara Boxer and I set up with the White House.  Judge Carney is the eighth judge to come out of the advisory committee. Nearly every one of these judges has passed out of the committee by a unanimous vote.  With Judge Carney's confirmation, the committee will have filled all the current district court vacancies in California.  This if the first time in recent memory that all of California's authorized district court judgeships are filled.  I would like to give credit to Jerry Parsky and the White House for working constructively with the California Senate delegation in a bipartisan manner to get these judgeships filled.  The results of the committee's efforts speak for themselves. On average, these eight California judges have received Senate confirmation within 114 days of their nomination.  In contrast, during the last year of the Clinton administration, district court nominees took an average of 196 days to get confirmed.  We have confirmed these nominees efficiently and without rancor. This process has enabled the best and the brightest legal minds of our state to gain admission to the Federal bench.  I hope the Senate sees our efforts in California as a model of how the judicial nominations process could work.
