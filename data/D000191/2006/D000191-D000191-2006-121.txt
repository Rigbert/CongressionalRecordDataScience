Speaker, Lee Raymond, $400 million. He was not at ExxonMobil all that long. So it figuresout to $135,000 a day in his pension payoff.  Now, remember, he can get a huge lump sum because he is an executive. But a worker cannot, because there is different standards that apply. For the execs, if they have funded 60 percent of their liability for their pension plan, big bonuses, $400 million. For a line worker, nah, sorry, you are not at 80 percent. You cannot get it. That is the way it is at ExxonMobil.  Let me give another example, what happens when the companies do go belly up. United Airlines. Talking to a flight attendant. She did not meet the cut. She was not age 50, although she had worked at the airline 28 years. So she did not meet the cut for the people to get a more generous accommodation. She is now 49 years old. If she works until age 65, at which point she will have 45 years in with the airline, 45 years, she will get $12,000 a year, $1,000 a month. But those execs who guided United into bankruptcy and then guided United back out of bankruptcy by shedding things like pension obligations get very huge bonuses. Is that not a great world?  Now, I just kind of figured it out. For her, you know, she will have worked about 17,000 days. And so if she lives 20 years, at $12,000 a year, she is going to get somewhere around a buck and a half a day pension.  Now this guy gets $135,000 a day for the time he put in. Is that fair? I do not think the American people think that is fair. It is not right. It has got to stop. And if you cannot vote for this, shame on you.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the important thing is not all of the talk, the important thing is the action. As I said earlier, the Republicans have led the action in bringing this bill to the floor. We are leading the action in getting the conference report done. We do not want to do anything to hold up that process.  It is important that we vote ``no'' on this motion to instruct and that we move forward on bringing this final pension conference to the bill so that we can save workers' pensions.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
