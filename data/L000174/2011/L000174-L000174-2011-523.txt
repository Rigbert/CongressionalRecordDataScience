I hate to put in another quorum call and then hear from Senators calling they want some time to speak about amendments. I know sometimes we follow the ``Dracula'' rule, being that we do not legislate until it is dark and Dracula comes out. Maybe, since the days are getting longer, we could do some things during daytime hours. I send out a call, a pleading call: If people want their amendments, come forward, let's have a vote up or down on them and be done with it.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
