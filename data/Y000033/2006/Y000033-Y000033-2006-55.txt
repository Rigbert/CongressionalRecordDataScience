Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1087 designates room H-139 of the United States Capitol as the Henry J. Hyde Room. This designation will become effective January 3, 2007. It is an honor to speak today on this resolution, which is a tribute to one of the finest Members of this Chamber, Congressman Henry Hyde.  Congressman Hyde has served this country well. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving in combat in the Philippines. When he retired, he held the rank of commander. He attended Loyola School of Law in 1949 and was a successful attorney in Illinois. He became a State legislator in 1966 and was eventually elected to be the majority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives. In 1975, he was elected to this Chamber by the good people of the Sixth District of Illinois and has served them well over the past 32 years.  Congressman Hyde has been a true champion and hero during his time in Congress. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and International Relations Committee, Congressman Hyde has authored ground-breaking and effective legislation and has pushed for the promotion of democracy around the world.  Over the past 32 years, Congressman Hyde has served in this building with honor, respect, and prestige. It is only fitting that we name H-139 in his honor as a lasting tribute to his accomplishments and his steadfast dedication to his constituents and the American people.  I support this legislation and encourage all my colleagues to do the same.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).
