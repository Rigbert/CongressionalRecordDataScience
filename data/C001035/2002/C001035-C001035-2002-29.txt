President, I rise in strong support of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, which will make prescription drugs more affordable by promoting more competition in the pharmaceutical industry and increasing access to lower priced generic drugs.  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with my colleague, the Senator from North Carolina, in offering this compromise in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where it was approved by a strong bipartisan vote. I also recognize the leadership and hard work of the Senators from New York and Arizona on this critical issue.  Prescription drug spending in the United States has increased by 92 percent over the past 5 years to almost $120 billion. These soaring costs are a particular burden for the millions of uninsured Americans, as well as for those seniors on Medicare who lack prescription drug coverage. Many of these individuals are simply priced out of the market or forced to choose between paying the bills or buying the pills they need to remain healthy.  Skyrocketing prescription drug costs are also putting the squeeze on our Nation's employers who are struggling in the face of double-digit increases in their insurance premiums. They are finding it increasingly difficult to continue to provide health care coverage for their employees.  Soaring costs are also exacerbating the Medicaid funding crisis that all of us are hearing about from our Governors back home who are struggling to bridge shortfalls in the States' budgets.  In 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Act made significant changes in our patent laws that were intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make the investments necessary to develop new drug products while simultaneously enabling their competitors to bring lower cost, generic equivalents to the market. We should acknowledge that, to a large extent, the original Hatch-Waxman Act succeeded. The law has speeded access to generic drugs in the market. As a consequence, consumers are saving anywhere between $8 and $10 billion a year by purchasing lower priced generic drugs.  Moreover, there are even greater potential savings on the horizon. Within the next 4 years, the patents on brand name drugs with combined sales of $20 billion are set to expire. If Hatch-Waxman were to work as it was intended, consumers could expect to save between 50 and 60 percent on these drugs as lower-cost generic alternatives becomes available after these patents expire.  But despite the past successes of this law, it has become increasingly evident that the Hatch-Waxman Act has been subject to abuse. While many pharmaceutical companies have acted in good faith, there is mounting evidence that others have attempted to game the system by exploiting legal loopholes in the current law. The result is, too many pharmaceutical companies have maximized their profits at the expense of consumers by filing frivolous lawsuits that have delayed access to lower priced generic drugs.  Just yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission released its long-awaited study that found that brand name drug manufacturers have, indeed, misused the law to delay the entry of lower cost generics into the market. The FTC found that these tactics have led to delays of between 4 and 40 months--over and above the first 30-month stay provided under Hatch-Waxman--for generic competitors of at least eight drugs--eight very popular drugs--since 1992. Moreover, six of these eight delays have occurred since 1998.  The FTC report identifies two specific provisions of the current law--the automatic 30-month stay and the 180-day market exclusivity provision--as being susceptible to challenges and strategies that delay the entry of lower cost generic alternatives into the market. According to the FTC report, these loopholes ``continue to have the potential for abuse'' and, if left unchanged, ``may have [even] more significance [for consumers] in the future.'' I am pleased to say that theseare the very loopholes that our bill would close.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that our legislation would cut our Nation's drug costs by an astounding $60 billion over the next 10 years. It is no wonder that our proposal is supported by coalitions representing the Governors, employers, insurers, organized labor, seniors groups, and individual consumers who are footing the bill for these expensive drugs and whose costs for many popular drugs could be cut in half if generic alternatives were more readily available.  I would like to pause for a moment to discuss some of the details of the underlying Edwards-Collins bill. Some of my colleagues have argued that certain provisions of the bill are unconstitutional or that the bill will lead to more litigation. But no amendments have been offered to change any of the provisions of the Edwards-Collins bill. Moreover, the bill itself is the product of months of work and represents a broad, bipartisan compromise that incorporates the views and concerns of a wide spectrum of interests.  I worked particularly hard on carefully wording the cause of action created by the bill, and believe that criticisms of it spurring increased litigation are not well-founded. Our bill creates a new civil action that offers a remedy if companies incorrectly or frivolously listed patents in the Orange Book, so that these patents do not delay the ability of a generic drug to come to market. The bottom line is, the cause of action will help to reduce both the cost of prescription drugs and the cost of prescription drug litigation. It does so by allowing generic drug makers, for the first time, to directly challenge a patent that has been frivolously or incorrectly listed.  I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues who are leery of creating new causes of action. But I would reply that, in many cases, litigating through narrowly-targeted suits can be quicker and less expensive than aggregating a number of claims in one, massive proceeding. Moreover, I have worked to target the new provision as carefully as possible. In Committee, I offered a common sense amendment to tailor the new cause of action in a way that will help minimize unintended consequences while, at the same time, ensuring that it still serves its intended purpose of policing frivolous or incorrectly listed patents. My amendment made it clear that the delisting cause of action is for injunctive relief only and cannot result in monetary damages. It also limited the new cause of actions to patents listed in the Orange Book up to 30 days after a New Drug Application's approval. In doing so, my amendment harmonized the 30-month stay provision and the cause of action, as it should be.  The original Hatch-Waxman Act was a carefully constructed compromise that balanced an expedited FDA approval process to speed the entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market with additional patent protections to ensure continuing innovation that brings us these wonderful lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs.  The bipartisan compromise bill before us restores that balance by closing the loopholes that have reduced the original law's intent and its effectiveness in bringing lower cost generic drugs to market more quickly. I am very pleased we are going to pass this legislation. It really will make a difference for millions of Americans who are struggling to afford the high cost of prescription drugs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from various groups that are supporting this legislation and worked very closely with us in drafting it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Business for                                          Affordable Medicine,                                     Washington, DC July 23, 2002.     Hon. Susan Collins,     US Senate,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Collins: The Business for Affordable Medicine      coalition encourages you to vote for the Hatch-Waxman reform      measures in S. 812. By closing loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman      Act, Congress will ensure that more affordable prescription      drugs reach the market without delays, which will provide      prescription drug purchasers with significant cost savings.       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that closing      Hatch-Waxman loopholes would reduce the nation's drug costs      by $60 billion over the next 10 years. Preventing delays in      the availability of generics would also reduce federal      spending for prescription drugs by $6 billion while      increasing federal revenues by $2.2 billion.       Consumers and institutional purchasers (including      employers, and federal and state governments) can no longer      afford the anti-competitive practices that are made possible      by loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman Act. Please be assured that      BAM supports strong intellectual property protections, and we      do not believe they are undermined by provisions of S. 812.       BAM corporate members include Ahold USA, Albertsons,      Constellation Energy Group, General Motors, Georgia-Pacific,      Kellogg Company, Kmart, Kodak, Motorola, Sysco Corporation,      United Parcel Service, Wal-Mart, Weyerhaeuser, and Woodgrain      Millwork. BAM also includes governors and a number of state      labor leaders.       Together, we urge you to support these limited and targeted      Hatch-Waxman reform provisions in S. 812 to make timely      access to lower-cost generics a reality.           Sincerly,                                                  Jody Hunter,                                     Director, Health and Welfare,     Georgia-Pacific Corporation.                                  ____                                       Coalition for a Competitive                                        Pharmaceutical Market,                                                    July 17, 2002.       Dear Senator: As a broad-based coalition of large      employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers,      insurers, labor unions, and others, we are writing to advise      you of our strong support for the S. 812, the Greater Access      to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, as reported out of the      Senate HELP Committee on July 11, 2002. We believe it is      critical that Congress act this year to pass legislation that      would eliminate barriers to generic drug entry into the      marketplace. This legislation would accomplish this long-     overdue need.       Prescription drug costs are increasing at double-digit      rates and clearly are unsustainable. Current pharmaceutical      cost trends are increasing premiums, raising copayments,      pressuring reductions in benefits, and undermining the      ability of businesses to compete. We believe that a major      contributor to the pharmaceutical cost crisis is the use of      the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of      1984 in ways clearly unanticipated by Congress and which      effectively block generic entry into the marketplace. The      repeated use of the 30-month generic drug marketing      prohibition provision and other legal barriers have resulted      in increasingly unpredictable and unaffordable pharmaceutical      cost increases.       Although the legislation as reported out of the Senate HELP      Committee does not totally eliminate the 30-month marketing      prohibition provision, as would be our preference, it does      make important process changes that will lead to a more      predictable, rational pharmaceutical marketplace. We      recognize that compromises were necessary to garner the      support of a bipartisan majority of the Members of the      Committee. However, we would strongly oppose any additional      amendments that would undermine the intent of this      legislation by further delaying generic access or reducing      competition and increasing costs to purchasers. We also      remain opposed to legislation that would increase costs to      purchasers either through extended monopolies or unnecessary      and costly litigation.       We are convinced that the legislation currently pending      before the full Senate will make a major difference in      increasing competition in the marketplace and enhancing      access to more affordable, high quality prescription drugs.      We look forward to working with you and other Members of the      Senate to ensure that this important legislation is enacted      this year.                                  ____                                       Coalition for a Competitive                                        Pharmaceutical Market,                                                    July 30, 2002.       Dear Senator: As a broad-based coalition of large      employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers,      insurers, and others, we are writing to urge you to vote for      cloture on the bipartisan Greater Access to Affordable      Pharmaceuticals Act (S. 812). We believe it is critical that      Congress act this year to pass legislation that would      eliminate barriers to generic drug entry into the      marketplace. This legislation would accomplish this key      policy objective.       Prescription drug costs continue to skyrocket--adversely      impacting consumers by increasing premiums, raising      copayments, pressuring reductions in benefits, and      undermining the ability of businesses to compete. We believe      that a major contributor to the pharmaceutical cost crisis is      the use of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term      Restoration Act of 1984 in ways clearly unanticipated by      Congress and which effectively block entry of equivalent      generic drugs into the marketplace.       Today's report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)      supports the kind of reforms contained in S. 812. For      example, the report supports limiting the availability of the      automatic 30-month marketing prohibition to just one per      product, per generic drug application. It also recognizes the      value of     having a mechanism that would allow a generic company to      remove or correct the listing of a frivolous patent with the      FDA. According to the report, the lack of a mechanism to      delist an improperly listed patent ``may have real world      consequences'' given the FTC's knowledge of ``instances in      which a 30-month stay was generated solely by a patent that      raised legitimate listability questions.''       The Coalition believes that S. 812 makes important process      changes that will lead to a more predictable, rational      pharmaceutical marketplace. CCPM members would strongly      oppose any additional amendments that would undermine the      intent of this legislation by further delaying generic access      or reducing competition and increasing costs to purchasers.      We also remain opposed to legislation that would increase      costs to purchasers either through extended monopolies or      unnecessary and costly litigation.       We are convinced that the legislation currently pending      before the full Senate will make a major difference in      increasing competition in the marketplace and enhancing      access to more affordable, high quality prescription drugs.      We look forward to working with you and other Members of the      Senate to ensure that this important legislation is enacted      this year.                                  ____
