Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 37) concerning anti-Semitic statements made by members of the Duma of the Russian Federation, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 37       Whereas the world has seen in the 20th century the      disastrous results of ethnic, religious, and racial      intolerance;       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation is on      record, through obligations freely accepted as a      participating state of the Organization on Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as pledging to ``clearly and      equivocally condemn totalitarianism, racial and ethnic      hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and discrimination against      anyone . . .'';       Whereas at two public rallies in October 1998, Communist      Party member of the Duma, Albert Makashov, blamed ``the      Yids'' for Russia's current problems;       Whereas in November 1998, attempts by members of the      Russian Duma to formally censure Albert Makashov were blocked      by members of the Communist Party;       Whereas in December 1998, the chairman of the Duma Security      Committee and Communist Party member, Viktor Ilyukhin, blamed      President Yeltsin's ``Jewish entourage'' for alleged      ``genocide against the Russian people'';       Whereas in response to the public outcry over the above-     noted anti-Semitic statements, Communist Party chairman      Gennadi Zyuganov claimed in December 1998 that such      statements were a result of ``confusion'' between Zionism and      ``the Jewish question''; and       Whereas during the Soviet era, the Communist Party      leadership regularly used ``anti-Zionist campaigns'' as an      excuse to persecute and discriminate against Jews in the      Soviet Union: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) condemns anti-Semitic statements made by members of the      Russian Duma;       (2) commends actions taken by members of the Russian Duma      to condemn anti-Semitic statements made by Duma members;       (3) commends President Yeltsin and other members of the      Russian Government for condemning anti-Semitic statements      made by Duma members; and       (4) reiterates its firm belief that peace and justice      cannot be achieved as long as governments and legislatures      promote policies based upon anti-Semitism, racism, and      xenophobia.
