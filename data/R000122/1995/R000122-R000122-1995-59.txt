Speaker, on March 25, 1821, Greek patriots declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire. The 174 years that have passed since that important day have tested the Greek people, as the whole world has also been tested by those who seek to dominate free men and women and crush the human spirit.  However, throughout the centuries it could always be said that the valor, courage, and love of freedom by the Greek people has never waned.  The defense of independence by Greeks has always been a constant in the world, but in the years since the Founding of America, another truth has emerged in the history of Greek people. * * * and that is the special relationship between the United States and Greece.  There are an estimated 3 million Greek-Americans living in the United States today. From the boardroom, to the operating room, from the halls of Government to the halls of academia, Greek-Americans have made a significant contribution to all aspects of American culture. The positive contribution made by Greek-Americans to American society has been especially true in my home State of Rhode Island, where a proud and prosperous Greek-American community has helped enrich the lives of all the citizens of our State.  In recognition of Greek Independence Day, I wish to extend my deepest respect and warmest congratulations to all Greek-Americans and all the citizens of Greece.
