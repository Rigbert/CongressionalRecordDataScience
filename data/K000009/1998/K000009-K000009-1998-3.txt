Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps) for taking time to join us this evening and also to say if we could put some of the partisanship aside, and we intend to do that in this working group, we can do so much for America.  It seems to me that too much effort is wasted here in Washington in trying to find out why we are different from one another rather than what we can do to work together on important issues like this that affect millions and millions and millions of our fellow citizens.  I would also note that the energy for this comes largely from the women in this body. It would be so easy for the leadership of this institution to make this happen with merely a snap of the fingers and yet it has not. That says a lot about this institution, but it also says a lot about the women here who on a bipartisan basis are trying to do what is right for this country.  We know that with persistence and with goodwill and with bipartisanship, we can achieve real, lasting changes for the better for people in our country who suffer every day under these extremely difficult diseases; their families, their communities. We know, we understand what needs to be done.  I also want to acknowledge the leadership in past years, First Lady Rosalyn Carter who came to this Congress and testified when it was not so popular to do so over 20 years ago, and also Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president, who has also been supportive of our efforts.                          ____________________
