President, I am somewhat surprised by this because I understood I had an agreement with the Senator from Georgia. I understand now he does not want to follow through with that agreement. I have already told our side that we would not request a rollcall. I will stick to my agreement. We will not request one.  But I simply say there was a better way that would not have taken the money away from Bolivia fighting drugs. But we will just take this matter up when we get to conference. I will keep to my commitment to the leaders not to ask for a rollcall.
