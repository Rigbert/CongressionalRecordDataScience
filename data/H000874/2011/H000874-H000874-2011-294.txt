 I want to thank, at the outset, not only the gentleman but the Speaker as well for the respect and consideration they have given during this current tragic situation that confronted us in Tucson and the critical injuries sustained by our colleague, Gabby Giffords. I want to thank Mr. Cantor in particular for his very strong statement, as well as the Speaker's very strong statement, that an attack on any individual who serves is an attack on all of us irrespective of party or philosophy. I think we all have raised prayers for the victims who lost their lives, their families, prayers for those who are either in the process of recovering or are now out of danger, and of course for our beloved colleague, Congresswoman Giffords, as well.  So I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership and the Speaker's leadership in joining with our leader and myself in leading the House in what I thought was a very appropriate and united response to that tragedy.  We are heartened by the progress that Congresswoman Giffords is making, and we look forward to her quick return.  Now, Mr. Cantor, if I can, next week we are scheduled to leave on Wednesday. I know there has been an articulation of an intent to try to get out by noon on the days that we leave. Would you expect that to be the case this next week?  I yield to the gentleman.
