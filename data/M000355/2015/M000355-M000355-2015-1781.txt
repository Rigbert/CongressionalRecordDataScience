  Kathie Alvarez, the Senate's legislative clerk, is a bit of a celebrity. Every C-SPAN aficionado knows her voice. All she has to say is ``Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte . . .'' and it is instantly recognizable.  Kathie has been calling the roll around here for quite a while. In 1991, she became the first woman to ever call the roll in the Senate. In 1999, with Senator Collins in the chair, Kathie became a member of the first all-female team to preside over this body, and in 2009 she became the Senate's first female legislative clerk.  So Kathie Alvarez has been making a lot of history since she first arrived here in 1984.  And you will notice, Madam President, that every female floor staffer is paying tribute to her today. They are each wearing something with Kathie's favorite design--animal print.  Along with the love of Cajun food, sartorial distinction is one thing this Louisianan has become known for, a passion for perfection is another.  Kathie has maintained a laser-like focus for three decades. That is good news for the Senate because we rely on her--and the American people rely on her--to ensure that every bill, every amendment, and every message from the House is processed perfectly. That is a lot of pressure.  So we can't blame Kathie for wanting to retire. I know she is looking forward to spending more time with her husband John, and I know Kathie wants to see more of her daughter Georgia.  It will not be as though Kathie is leaving us entirely. We will still be able to hear her voice on the film every tourist watches when they come to visit the Capitol.  So the Senate thanks Kathie Alvarez, its history-making celebrity, for her many years of service, and we wish the very best to her deputy, John Merlino, as he steps into Kathie's role as the Senate's new legislative clerk.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
