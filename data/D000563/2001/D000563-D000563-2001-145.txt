. attorneys who were moved in that hearing in the back room, under extraordinary circumstances.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, is he aware of the fact the Judiciary Committee, under Senator Leahy's leadership, has held seven nomination hearings thus far this year?  In 1989 and 1993, when the Republicans were in control of the same committee, it was November before they held their fifth hearing. So Senator Leahy has held more hearings, even though we have not been in control for the full calendar year, than Republicans did when they had control of the same committee under a Democrat President, and after that seventh hearing the committee will have held multiple hearings in the same month on three separate occasions, something the Republicans in the Judiciary Committee managed to do only 12 times in 6\1/2\ years of leadership.  For those who are complaining about Senator Leahy's dispatch in dealing with those nominees, I might also say this: The Judiciary Committee has already confirmed eight judges, four for the Federal courts of appeals with several more in the pipeline. This afternoon we will have some district judges considered. That is more appellate judges confirmed in the last 4 months than the Senate confirmed during the entire first year of President Clinton's administration.  Senator Leahy has brought more Republican nominees for Federal judgeships to the floor in the first 4 months than the Republicans did in an entire calendar year. And they are stopping legislation to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan refugees because it is not fast enough? Is that what I understand?
