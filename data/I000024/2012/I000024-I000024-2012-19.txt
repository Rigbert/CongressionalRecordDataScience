It is a request by all the associations, the veterans and all the others. It is something I wasn't familiar with until fairly recently, and that is, in July of 1862, following the Seven Days Battles, Union GEN Daniel Butterfield and bugler Oliver Wilcox Norton created ``Taps'' at Berkeley Plantation in Virginia.  This is something we are all familiar with, those of us who served in the military. We know what ``Taps'' is. It is a big deal to a lot of people, but it has never had an official designation. We have an amendment now that would be a sense-of-the-Senate that would designate the bugle call commonly known as ``Taps'' to be designated as a national military song of military remembrance.
