President, I rise today to discuss America's national security and the need for American independence from Middle Eastern oil.  America's chronic dependence on foreign oil is a critical national security issue. It not only affects citizens and businesses nationwide, but also has a direct impact on our Nation's ability to fight and win wars. As we prepare to engage in military operations in Iraq, it is important to understand that our forces are highly dependent on foreign oil, much of which comes directly from Iraq. In other words, we are dependent on oil from Iraq to fight a war against Iraq.  During the 1970s energy crisis, America was 36 percent dependent on foreign oil. Today we are 56 percent dependent, and by 2010, we are headed for well more than 60 percent. For the military, it now takes eight times as much oil to meet the needs of each U.S. soldier as it did during World War II.
