President, today I rise to introduce a package of legislation--two bills--designed to put us back on track for improved fuel efficiency among automobiles.  I support a balanced, forward-looking energy policy, which should include a strong provision to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. In 2002, the Senate spent several weeks debating energy policy, including fuel efficiency. Unfortunately, a strong bill on this topic was not enacted into law last year.  Both chambers of Congress are currently crafting a national energy policy. As the challenging times we currently face demonstrates, we cannot delay in addressing our national energy policy, including oil consumption.  Throughout the debate on energy policy, I have emphasized that the best way to lessen our Nation's dependence on foreign oil is to improve the fuel efficiency of our automobiles. Transportation as a sector is the largest user of petroleum. If we are truly committed to crafting a forward-thinking energy policy, automobile fuel efficiency is the place to start.  In 1975 the United States Congress had a vision: to double the fuel efficiency of our Nation's passenger vehicles in ten years. By 1985 the automotive industry achieved the goal that Congress set. As of 2001, thanks to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, law, oil consumption was about 2.8 million barrels per day lower than it otherwise would be.  Unfortunately, progress is now at a stand-still, and in fact, the average fuel economy in the United States has slipped since 1985. Since peaking at 22.1 mpg in 1987 and 1998, average fuel economy declined nearly eight percent to 20.4 in 2001, lower than it had been at any time since 1980. Average fuel economy for automobiles 8,500 pounds and fewer continues to decline. One major factor in this regression is the fact that passenger standards have not increased since 1985. While the Bush Administration has recently increased non-passenger standards by a modest 1.5 mpg, this is not enough to compensate for the progress we have failed to achieve for more than a decade.  Another reason why we are losing ground in terms of fuel efficiency is the exploitation of the ``non-passenger vehicle'' category. Originally intended to cover trucks used for business-oriented purposes, such as farming and construction, this category soon was seriously abused, so that it now includes minivans, sport utility vehicles, SUVs, and cross-over utility vehicles, CUVs.  In addition, out-dated provisions of our tax code have encouraged increased manufacturing and purchasing of non-passenger vehicles. For example, the Federal gas guzzler excise tax, enacted in 1978, exempted non-passenger vehicles. At the time, few non-passenger vehicles existed, aside from heavy duty trucks and vans. But today, sales of SUVs, minivans, and CUVs make up over 30 percent of new vehicle purchases. As these sales have grown, these vehicles have enjoyed increasing subsidies by the Federal Government. In 1999, the SUV loophole in the gas guzzler tax cost the government $5.6 billion in uncollected taxes.  For those in America who want to make a difference in terms of energy policy: take a look at the parking lots across America. Take a look at the inefficient vehicles we are driving on the road today, because this Congress and country have not shown the leadership to spur development of more efficient cars and trucks in America.  We can improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. We have done it in the past, and we can do it again. A panel at the National Academy of Sciences, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other reputable organizations have documented the myriad technologies available today, and emerging technologies, that will reduce or eliminate the need for oil in our vehicles.  Today we squarely face the question and challenge of energy security. I believe American families are ready to do their part for their country by purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles. And I believe the auto manufacturers, scientists and engineers of this country are ready to step up to the plate and produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. By supporting improved fuel economy, we can lead and demonstrate to future generations that we are prepared to make a sacrifice for our national security, environment, and public health.  Many have already voiced their support for decreasing our dependence on oil. I am submitting for the record several editorials, which are just a sample of the many public calls for enacting an energy policy that includes a way to conserve oil. I also am submitting letters from national organizations calling for more fuel efficient vehicles. I ask that these documents be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.  Today I am introducing two bills to get us back on the track of progress, to increase fuel efficiency for both passenger and non-passenger vehicles.  The Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act will increase the fuel economy standard for both types of vehicles. It will increase the CAFE standard of passenger automobiles to 40 miles a gallon by 2015, a 60 percent increase above the current average of 25 miles a gallon, with the first increase required in model year 2006. The bill also will increase the fuel economy of non-passenger automobiles to 27.5 miles a gallon by 2015, a 60 percent increase above the current average of 17.5 miles a gallon, with the first increase required in model year 2006. Through the CAFE standards required this bill, we will save a cumulative 123 billion gallons of gasoline, and over 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, by 2015.  This bill also will close the loopholes in the non-passenger vehicle definition. It will update the weight cut-off forpassenger and non-passenger automobiles, to reflect changing trends in vehicle weight. Many vehicles, such as the new SUV called the Hummer, weigh more than 8,500 pounds, the current weight cut-off for regulation under CAFE. This bill will regulate vehicles up to 12,000 pounds, in order to prevent large passenger vehicles from circumventing the system. In addition, SUVs, minivans, and CUVs would be considered passenger vehicles under this bill.  Another provision of this bill would establish a Federal procurement requirement for the purchase of vehicles that exceed CAFE standards. The bill also requires a study to improve the accuracy of the EPA test for fuel economy, and would implement necessary changes to the test, so that we can better account for improvements in fuel efficiency based on how vehicles are truly performing on the roads. Finally, this bill would update the civil penalties for violating CAFE laws, to adjust the amounts for inflation.  The second bill I am introducing today, the Tax Incentives for Fuel Efficient Vehicles Act, would modify the tax code. First, this bill would create a new tax credit for purchasers of passenger and non-passenger vehicles that exceed CAFE standards by at least 5 miles a gallon. Second, this bill would modify the gas guzzler tax, effective at the beginning of Model Year 2006, so that SUVs and other passenger vehicles currently escaping the tax through an existing loophole would be included. Heavy-duty trucks and vans would continue to be excluded.  Modifying the gas guzzler tax to include SUVs, minivans, and CUVs will help us advance the policy goal of discouraging vehicles that are especially inefficient in terms of energy consumption, while at the same time raising revenues that can be used to provide an incentive for vehicles that are especially fuel-efficient. This approach will help spawn investment in automobiles that are better for our environment, energy security and consumers.  I would ask my colleagues to note that it is my intention that the Tax Incentives for Fuel Efficient Vehicles Act will have virtually no cost to the Federal Government. If the revenues raised by the expansion of the gas guzzler tax do not adequately compensate for the cost of the credit, I will adjust the size of the credit accordingly.  I am proud to have the support of Senators Nelson, FL, Jeffords, Corzine, Reed and Kennedy in introducing the Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act. Also I am pleased that the following organizations are supporting the Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act: Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, U.S. PIRG, National Environmental Trust, Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen, The Wilderness Society, Citizen Action Illinois, Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, National Council of Churches, Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, American Jewish Committee, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Central Conference of American Rabbis, MoveOn, and Chesapeake Climate Action Network.  For the benefit of our children and future generations, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                                  Sierra Club,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2003.       Dear Congress Member: Protecting our environment and the      health and safety of our families are values that are clearly      and consistently supported by the majority of Americans. As      the nation's oldest and largest grassroots environmental      organization, the Sierra Club looks forward to working with      you and your staff to keep America's promise to leave a      cleaner planet to future generations.       The challenge facing the 108th Congress is not merely to      maintain existing protections, but to take common-sense steps      to protect our communities from environmental hazards and to      safeguard our natural heritage. Poll after poll confirms that      Americans--regardless of demographics or political      persuasion--care about protecting our special places,      restoring our forests, promoting smart growth, and improving      the safety or our clean air and water.       However, public support alone is not enough. It is for this      reason that the Sierra Club works with our more than 750,000      members nationwide to educate their neighbors about      environmental threats and opportunities, mobilize their      communities to demand environmental protection, and to hold      public officials accountable for their actions.       Sierra Club members are looking to their elected      representatives to continue progress on protecting our      communities, improving the quality of our air and water, and      ensuring a natural heritage of wilderness, parks and open      spaces for future generations. As the 108th Congress begins,      I would like to inform you about the particular issues on      which the Sierra Club's members will be seeking your support:       Oppose efforts to weaken the framework of existing laws      that safeguard public health and the environment and improve      the quality of our air and water, and protect our communities      from toxic pollution;       Support measures that safeguard America's wildlife and      unique natural heritage from Alaska's Arctic National      Wildlife Refuge to the wildlands of Utah and California;       Provide adequate funding for the enforcement of      environmental protection programs;       In reauthorizing TEA-21, give priority to maintaining      existing roads and bridges over new construction, and defend      the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Air      Conformity laws from attack;       Push for policies that reduce global warming pollution,      reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and increase our energy      security by increasing our fuel economy, energy efficiency      and reliance on clean renewable sources of energy;       Protect the health and integrity of National Forests along      with the public's right to participate in the management of      our public lands;       Fully fund international and domestic family planning      programs that are critically important to stabilizing      population;       Ensure tough environmental standards in future US trade      agreements, and the personal safety and civil liberties of      those on the front lines of environmental protection around      the world.       Many of your constituents are also our members, which is      why we would like to work together in Washington and in your      district to protect the land we all love. Attached is a      contact sheet of our issue experts in several policy areas.      If you have any questions about upcoming legislation, would      like to find out more about Sierra Club positions, or would      like to get in touch with our members in your district,      please do not hesitate to contact us.       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your      staff to protect America's environment, for our families, for      our future.           Sincerely,                                                     Debbie Sease,     Legislative Director.                                  ____                            Natural Resources Defense Council,                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2003.     [Re Boxer/Chafee amendment to the Senate budget resolution.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the over 550,000 members      of Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), I thank you for      supporting the Boxer/Chafee amendment to the Senate budget      resolution preventing oil and gas development in the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge.       You have voted to insure the continued protection of the      Arctic Refuge's ``biological heart,'' critical to nearly 200      species of wildlife. This area known as America's Serengeti      serves as a denning area for polar bears in the winter, a      nesting and/or feeding area for millions of migratory birds,      and the calving grounds for the 130,000 member Porcupine      caribou herd which returns every summer to calf and feed.      This herd has supported the Gwich'in Indian's way of life for      thousands of generations. The American public overwhelmingly      agrees with you that the coastal plain--one of our nation's      most spectacular wilderness areas--is too precious to      destroy.       Drilling in the Arctic Refuge makes no sense. It won't      lower gasoline prices and, it won't give us energy      independence or security. The best estimate is that there is      less than a six-month supply equivalency of oil that can be      economically produced from the Refuge--a mere drop in the      bucket--and, we won't get it for ten years.       Improving fuel efficiency of our automobiles is the      cheapest, fastest and cleanest energy solution. Efficiency      savings can be tapped immediately and would cost less than      half as much as producing oil from the Arctic Refuge.      Improving the fuel efficiency of America's automobile fleet      by just one percent per year would save more than 10 times as      much oil as is likely to be available in the Arctic Refuge.      Advanced hybrid electric vehicles announced by Ford and      already being produced by Honda and Toyota achieve about a      50% improvement in fuel economy. In contrast to drilling in      the Arctic Refuge, increasing fuel efficiency will help slow      down global warming.       We thank you for your leadership to save this irreplaceable      natural treasure. We salute your dedication to the protection      of this great crown jewel.           Sincerely yours,                                                    John H. Adams,     President, Natural Resources Defense Council.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 2003]                      The Missing Energy Strategy       The Senate struck a blow for the environment and for common      sense last week, defeating President Bush's second attempt in      less than a year to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge      to oil exploration. Credit goes to the Democrats, who mainly      held firm     in a close 52-to-48 vote, and to a small, sturdy group of      moderate Republicans, which now includes Norm Coleman, a      Minnesota freshman who wisely chose not to renege on his      campaign promise to protect the refuge despite an aggressive      sales pitch from senior Republicans and the White House.       The pitch included the usual hyperbole from the Alaska      delegation, which typically inflates official estimates of      economically recoverable oil in the refuge by a factor of      four. It also included a new but equally spurious argument      minted for the occasion, namely that rising gas prices and      the war in Iraq made drilling more urgent than ever. In      truth, Arctic oil will have no influence on gas prices until      it actually comes out of the ground, and even then it is      likely to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by only a      few percentage points.       Nevertheless it is much too soon for the environmental      community or its Senate champions, like Joseph Lieberman,      John McCain and James Jeffords, to rest on their well-earned      laurels. Drilling proposals will almost certainly resurface,      most likely in energy bills now on the drawing boards in both      the House and Senate. Beyond that, neither the White House      nor the Republican leadership shows any appetite for      developing what America really needs: innovative policies      that point toward a cleaner, more efficient and less oil-     dependent energy future. Instead, the White House and its      Congressional allies continue to push a retrograde strategy--     of which Arctic drilling was just one component--that      faithfully caters to President Bush's friends in the oil, gas      and coal industries and remains heavily biased toward the      production of fossil fuels.       On this score, the energy bills now being drawn up on      Capitol Hill offer no more hope than the 2002 models. Last      year's energy plan, which mercifully expired in a conference      committee, was top-heavy with subsidies for industry and      light on incentives for energy efficiency, alternative fuels      and other forms of conservation. The news from the relevant      Congressional committees suggests more of the same. Just last      week, Edward Markey of Massachusetts offered his colleagues      on the House energy committee a proposal to increase fuel      economy standards for cars and light trucks, including      S.U.V.'s, by about 20 percent by 2010. This is not an      unreasonable goal, given Detroit's technological      capabilities, and would save 1.6 million barrels a day, more      than double the recent imports from Iraq and far more than      the Arctic refuge could produce in the same time frame. The      committee crushed the idea.       The last two years have given the country plenty of reasons      to re-examine its energy policies: a power crisis in      California, the attacks of 9/11 and now a war in the very      heart of the biggest oil patch in the world. It is plainly      time to move forward in a systematic way with new ideas. But      the best we can do, it appears, is to beat back bad ones.                                  ____           [From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Nov. 8, 2002]                            More Per Gallon       Standards: Congress must approve higher vehicle mileage      requirements in order to reverse a troubling trend.       Body: Each year the Environmental Protection Agency trots      out mileage ratings for new car models. And year after year,      the news is depressing.       On Oct. 29, the EPA reported that the average fuel economy      for all 2003-model cars and passenger trucks is a paltry 20.8      miles per gallon.       That's down slightly from last year. But more notably, it's      6 percent below the peak for passenger vehicle efficiency of      22.1 mpg set 15 years ago.       In the past decade and a half, automakers have made      technological improvements that have increased engine      efficiency significantly. But those gains have been offset by      millions of Americans buying ever-larger gas guzzlers.       Much of the blame lies in Washington, where the Bush      administration and Congress haven't been able to come to a      consensus on energy policy and apparently lack the will to      mandate even a modest increase in the Corporate Average Fuel      Economy (CAFE) standards for vehicles.       Those standards--which haven't been changed for 17 years--     require that each automaker's fleet of new cars averages 27.5      mpg. Light trucks (which include pickups, minivans and sport      utility vehicles) must average only 20.7 mpg.       The solution is simple: Congress should raise the CAFE      standards significantly, particularly for light trucks. But      the new standards should be reasonable ones that automakers      can meet.       Continued improvement in engine technology is one key to      meeting higher standards.       Some mileage gains also can be achieved even if automakers      make no further technological improvements and Congress      continues to sit on its hands.       Higher mileage standards would cut fuel consumption, which      in turn would reduce air pollution, decrease America's      dependence on foreign oil, save motorists money at the pump      and increase the chances that metropolitan areas such as      North Texas will be able to attain federal air quality      standards.       Those are compelling reasons for Congress and the White      House to adopt standards that will, for a change, result in      higher annual mileage ratings instead of continued declines.                                  ____             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Nov. 16, 2002]                     More Fuel-Efficiency Is Needed       Americans are getting a confusing message on automobile      mileage. ``By driving a more fuel-efficient vehicle, a      vehicle powered by alternative fuels, or even by driving our      current vehicles more efficiently, we can all do our part to      reduce our Nation's reliance on imported oil and strengthen      our energy security,'' Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham      recently announced.       Good advice. But Abraham chose an odd occasion to make his      appeal. He and Environmental Protection Agency chief Christie      Whitman were announcing the mileage figures for 2003 cars and      passenger trucks. The average of 20.8 MPG continued a      downward trend on fuel efficiency that has continued for the      past decade and a half.       In fact, the percentage of cars getting more than 30 MPG      declined in the new model year to only 4 percent of cars,      down from 6 percent last year. So it is even more difficult      for American drivers to heed Abraham's call to conserve.       If President Bush, who is Abraham's boss, or Congress      really wanted to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, they      would have embraced tougher mileage requirements. Yet, Vice      President Dick Cheney set the tone for the administration by      scorning energy conservation. Congress also backed away from      more stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards,      which have been frozen since 1994. Even pro-environment      Democrats played along with the makers of gas-guzzling SUVs      when the United Auto Workers union opposed improved fuel      efficiency, arguing it would cost jobs (and union members).       Improving mileage isn't that difficult. ``We could be      averaging close to 30 to 40 miles per gallon, and that's with      conventional technology: nonhybrids, better engines, better      transmission, improved aerodynamics,'' said David Friedman, a      senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists.       Instead, our wasteful ways complicate foreign policy in the      Middle East, whose oil fuels not only our cars but also      repressive regimes and terrorism. Soon enough, American      soldiers could be in harm's way in the region. Rather than      winking at the decline in fuel efficiency, our leaders should      set about reversing the troubling trend.       The president and congressional leaders should require      automakers to improve CAFE standards. They also should call      on Americans to share the sacrifices that lie ahead. We are      likely to respond.                                  ____               [From the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8, 2002]         Stop Your Grousing, Auto Makers, and Get the Gases Out                           (By Carl Zichella)       The auto industry howled when Gov. Gray Davis signed      California's landmark global warming control bill. Litigation      to overturn the new law, which restricts automobile emissions      of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, was      threatened before his signature was dry.       For auto industry observers, there was a sense of deja vu      about this hysterical response. Every time the government has      required new safety or efficiency standards, auto makers have      claimed that the result would be financial ruin, the      elimination of thousands of jobs and the loss of consumer      choice.       The truth is that the industry was wrong at every turn, and      it is wrong now. Car makers, instead of suing to overturn      this much-needed law, should get busy complying with it. No      new technology needs to be developed.       This is the industry that fought turn signals, seat belts      and safety glass. Henry Ford II called laminated windshields,      padded interiors and collapsible steering wheels      ``unreasonable, arbitrary and technically unfeasible.''       When Congress required auto manufacturers to build cleaner      cars in 1973, the industry response was hyperbolic. ``If GM      is forced to introduce catalytic converter systems across the      board . . . it is conceivable that complete stoppage of the      entire production could occur,'' warned a GM vice president.      The company easily complied, consumers benefited and GM      suffered no appreciable hardship.       In 1974, a Ford official told a congressional committee      that ``corporate average fuel economy''--CAFE--standards      would ``result in a Ford product line consisting either of      all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles or some mix of vehicles      ranging from sub-sub-compact to perhaps a Maverick.'' That      couldn't have been more wrong.       According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, from 1977 to      1983 American-built cars increased in efficiency by seven      miles per gallon. From 1977 through 1985, the U.S. gross      domestic product rose 27% while oil imports fell by 42%. OPEC      lost an eighth of its market. Few public policies have ever      been such a resounding success. Vehicle choice expanded while      oil prices declined.       The sky isn't falling for auto manufacturers, but the      planet is getting warmer, and the consequences for California      are severe. If the snowpack in the Sierra declines, bitter      competition for water will result since about 70% of      California drinking water originates there.       Further, farmland will become more arid and sea levels will      rise, reducing food production and flooding coastal cities.      Forests will shrink and some of the most valuable wildlife      habitat on Earth will vanish or be altered.       The good news is that some simple solutions are at hand.      This year Ford sponsored a ``Future Truck'' competition for      university engineering students to build more-efficient sport      utility vehicles. If you believe the industry's rhetoric,      you'd think that SUVs will be abolished. But Ford's ``Future      Truck'' contestants showed the ridiculousness of this charge.       Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison this year      modified a Ford Explorer to get the equivalent of 38 mpg.      Others built a GMC Suburban that emits about half the carbon      dioxide of the production version. More-efficient vehicles      mean less CO2 emissions. You don't need to require      mileage standards--something that federal law forbids the      state to do--to get these benefits; all the state needs to do      is require the auto makers use the best technology available.       If university students can do this, why can't the Big      Three? Ford boasts that it plans to introduce a hybrid gas-     electric SUV in 2003. This model would meet the standard far      ahead of the new law's generous 2009 deadline. Instead of      suing California, auto makers should do what is right and      comply with the law.
