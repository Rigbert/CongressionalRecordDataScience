Chairman, I include for the Record letters pertaining to this issue.                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2004.     Secretary Ann W. Veneman,     U.S. Department of Agriculture,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Veneman: We are writing to request      information regarding nearly $4 billion in unpaid credits for      the sale of U.S. agricultural commodities to Iraq. The      Departments of Treasury and Agriculture have failed to      adequately respond to previous requests for this information.       During hearings before the Appropriations Subcommittee on      Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,      and Related Agencies for fiscal 2004, the Foreign      Agricultural Service was asked to provide copies of minutes,      transcripts, and reports from the National Advisory Council      on International Monetary and Financial Policies. Requests      were also made for the date, the amount, and specific votes      by members of the National Advisory Council for each of the      Commodity Credit Corporation Program credit guarantees that      were approved for Iraq.       While USDA did participate in many of these meetings, the      response was that USDA did not have such records, including      the names of its own personnel who may have been involved in      these meetings. Instead, it was suggested that the Department      of Treasury would have these records. In response to these      questions, USDA made a promise a year ago that the Department      would work with Treasury to obtain these records. Despite      this pledge, no information has been provided. (Fiscal 2004      hearing, Part 7, page 641)       In fact, when the issue was raised again earlier this year      in questions presented to Secretary Veneman, the response was      the ``the Department does not have any additional      information.'' (Fiscal 2005 hearings, Part 8, page 327)       Given that the outstanding debt is nearly $4 billion in      combined principle and interest and that this debt is still      carried on the books of CCC, it is very difficult to believe      and harder to accept that more detailed records of how these      credits were approved do not exist. This is a matter that      should be resolved before any additional credit of any kind      is extended to be sure that limited resources are being used      in the most indicious manner.       Additionally, in response to questions presented to the      Foreign Agricultural Service during hearings this year, it      was suggested that an IMF debt sustainability analysis was      expected by early May, a U.S. Government Country Risk      Assessment was expected by early June, and a determination by      the Paris Club on debt treatment was expected as soon as this      month. (Fiscal 2005 hearings, Part 7, page 922) We request      summaries of each of these reports as well.       We ask that you provide the requested documents as soon as      possible.           Sincerely,     Marcy Kaptur,       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Committee on      Appropriations.     Henry A. Waxman,       Ranking Member, Committee on Government, Reform.                                  ____                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2004.     Secretary John Snow,     U.S. Department of Treasury,     Washington, DC.
