I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1129, which will create an ironworking program for Native Americans. The manager for the majority has effectively explained the bill, but I would like to make a few additional comments.  This country is suffering from record unemployment, but few areas are feeling the effects of job loss worse than Indian country. I hope that when Native Americans complete the training available through this program that we're authorizing today in this bill, jobs will be available for them.  Unfortunately, if the Environmental Protection Agency has any say, there will be a lot fewer jobs. One of the first major actions taken by the EPA under the Obama administration was to seek to revoke a key permit issued in 2008 tothe Navajo Nation for the construction of a 1,500-megawatt power plant employing the most advanced clean coal technology available today. This is the Desert Rock project.  Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley said that Desert Rock would create ``500 permanent jobs at union wages on a reservation with an unemployment rate hovering around 50 percent.''  This is an example that every community in America should follow, but it's an example lost on the Democrat leadership of this House. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle consider that job training makes sense only when those jobs are available.  I reserve the balance of my time.
