 President, my intention would be to offer the second amendment on counsel standards required in Federal habeas corpus cases. I think the number is 1226.  Then I will have one more. The most important, from my perspective, of the amendments I have is the one relating to the deference standard that is in the Republican bill.  Senator Graham of Florida has indicated to me that he will not offer his amendment. Senator Levin, I believe, will be ready to offer his amendment shortly.  I would respectfully request that the Presiding Officer, Mr. Kyl, offer his amendment sometime between that. It is my intention to offer my amendment last. I will offer the first three, but the last amendment on habeas I would like very much to be my amendment on deference.  We will by that time have eliminated all Democratic amendments. I understand there is one--unless Mr. Kyl is withdrawing his--there is one amendment on the other side.
