President, Vermont is special in large part because of the dedication and kindness that Vermonters show to neighbors and strangers alike. I would like to recognize a few Vermonters in particular who went out of their way to do what needed to be done to save the lives of others. On July 6, a number of boaters became stranded on the water near the Colchester Causeway Bike Ferry while enjoying themselves on Lake Champlain. Luckily for those in distress, the crew of the Bike Ferry was nearby, and sprang into action.  After quickly rescuing four people, Captain Brian Costello, deckhand and former coastguardsman Frank Malaki, and captain-in-training Richard Schattman were told that there were more people who needed assistance. Before long, all those who had been stranded were safe and sound, with warm clothes, water, and shelter, thanks to the ferry's crew.  Anyone who has enjoyed the beauty of our great Lake Champlain knows that, in bad weather, its calm, rolling waves can quickly turn treacherous. We have always been lucky to have the protection of the Coast Guard on the water in times of emergency, but it should hearten many to hear that there are also professional, courageous, and selfless Vermonters like Captain Costello, Mr. Malaki, and captain-in-training Schattman nearby to lend a hand.  I share the pride of the Coast Guard in this lifesaving effort. I ask unanimous consent that the July 19, 2018, article from ``My Champlain Valley'' entitled ``Bike-ferry crew recognized by Coast Guard for heroic rescue,'' which commemorates the bravery of these men, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From My Champlain Valley, July 19, 2018]      Bike Ferry Crew Recognized by Coast Guard for Heroic Rescue                            (By Devin Bates)       South Hero, VT.--A crew from the Colchester Causeway Bike      Ferry got some special recognition from the U.S. Coast Guard      on Thursday for rescuing seven people in Lake Champlain      earlier this month.       Coast Guard officials were so impressed with the crew's      work that they came down to the causeway to express their      gratitude and thank them for their heroic act.       The rescue happened the afternoon of July 6. Winds were      gusty, reaching 25-30 mph. The ferry crew--Cpt. Brian      Costello, former Coast Guardsman and deckhand Frank Malaki      and Captain-in-training Richard Schattman--tracked down and      rescued four people. Three kayakers--including one in the      water--were rescued a short time later.       All seven of the boaters were wearing life jackets and were      unharmed. The crew gave them warm clothes, shelter from the      wind and bottled water.       The rescue occurred just days after 41 year-old Eric Plett      of Weehawken, New Jersey, went missing after falling out of      his kayak near Shelburne Point. Plett's body was recovered      several days later after a search by the Coast Guard and      state police.       ``Any good Vermonter would respond to people in distress,      whether it's on the water or on land, and we happened to be      the closest,'' Costello said. ``We also happen to have an      experienced and trained crew.''       While the crew members were modest about their efforts,      Sector Commander Brian LeFebvre of the U.S. Coast Guard made      sure to give them the recognition they deserved.       ``I applaud the crew, their dedication and selfless service      to the boating public, and I am truly thankful for the      professional seamanship that you exercised in response to      these potentially grave situations,'' LeFebvre said. ``Bravo      Zulu for a job extremely well-done, and thank you very      much.''       LeFebvre urged boaters to be safe out on the lake.       ``Anything can happen at any given time when you're on the      water, even when you least expect it,'' LeFebvre said. ``It's      always important to be wearing your life jacket, especially      if you're on a paddle-craft or in a kayak.''                          ____________________
