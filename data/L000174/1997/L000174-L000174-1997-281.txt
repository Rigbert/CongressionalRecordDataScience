 I hope Senators will support the Senator from West Virginia on this issue. I have been here for 22 years. Twenty of those years I have served on the Appropriations Committee and proudly so. I know how hard we work to get our 13 appropriations bills through. Sometimes we have not. We have gotten most of them, and the rest have had to be done by a continuing resolution; but usually for just a few weeks, while we finish them up.  If this went through, this automatic continuing resolution, I do not care if it is at 125 percent of funding or at 30 percent of funding, it is poor policy. Basically it says to the Appropriations Committee--actually it says to the House and Senate--go home. We do not need you. We are on automatic pilot.  That is not what we are elected to do. We are elected to make the tough choices, vote for or against them, and do it on time.  So I support, and gladly and proudly support, the Senator from West Virginia on this. Whether we have a Republican President or Democratic President, Republican or Democratic Senate, I would vote exactly the same way. I do not want automatic continuing resolutions because we will not, then, have our feet put to the fire and have to actually cast the tough votes and make the policy decisions the people of America expect us to do.
