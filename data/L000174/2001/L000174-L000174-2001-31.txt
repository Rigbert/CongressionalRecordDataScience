President, this nominee has the support of both Senators from his home State. Blue slips have been returned by both of them. We have had the hearing. He did very well.  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, is a valued member of the Judiciary Committee, and I would like to yield to him, as he is one of those who has proposed and supported this nominee.
