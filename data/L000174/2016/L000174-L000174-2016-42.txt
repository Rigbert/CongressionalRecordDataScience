President, as a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, I strongly believe that we should have regular, yearlong appropriations, not continuing resolutions. I would like to remind my friend from Arizona that, by tradition, appropriations bills begin in the other body, in the House of Representatives. They have not yet sent over regular appropriations bills.  It was just reported in the last few hours that Donald Trump has told them not to have regular appropriations bills, but to have a continuing resolution until the end of March.  Frankly, the Senator from Arizona is right. I agree with him. We should have appropriations bills on all subjects. I am sorry the President-elect has decided that in his spare time he will also run Congress and will not allow full appropriations bills to be passed.                          ____________________
