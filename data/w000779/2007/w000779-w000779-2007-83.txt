President, on a matter of personal privilege, I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Conrad. I will be very brief.  We were in the middle of critical issues. I was asking about a program that is a lifeline to the rural West, the county payments program where the administration is trying to change 100 years of history, and on a bipartisan basis the Senate indicated it wants to oppose that program.  Had I been here, I would have, as Senator Conrad, voted for that measure, strongly supporting efforts to strengthen border security.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed for a few moments as in morning business.
