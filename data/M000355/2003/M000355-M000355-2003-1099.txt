 President, the Cambodia charade continues.  Recent riots in that Southeast Asian country--reportedly sparked by unfounded rumors of Thai slights against Khmer culture and history--caused extensive damage to Thai-owned businesses and property in Phnom Penh and the storming, looting, and destruction of the Thai Embassy. The failure of the Cambodian Government to defend Thai diplomats and the embassy compound from rioters is unacceptable, particularly in the post September 11 security environment. Further, the exploitation of the rumor by Prime Minister Hun Sen is as reckless as it is irresponsible.  In the aftermath of these riots, I have heard credible reports that democratic opposition and human rights activists are being targeted for intimidation and arrest. Given his tendency toward paranoia and violence, I do not doubt for an instant that these riots were staged by Hun Sen as, among other things, a pretext to crackdown on the democratic opposition in the run up to the July parliamentary elections.  Over the next few days, it is imperative that the international community not be duped by Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government into laying blame for the riots on the democratic opposition. It is time to help the Royal Government of Thailand to hold Hun Sen and the Cambodian government accountable for the destruction of property, the violation of democratic principles, and the damage to relations with its western neighbor.  The Cambodian authorities allowed the situation outside the Thai Embassy to escalate out of control. Riot and military police did nothing to maintain law and order until after extensive damage had been done throughout the capital. It is a simple and tragic fact that the Cambodian Government permitted this attack to take place. Their inaction during the riots stands in stark contrast to the brutal treatment illegal logging protesters received at the hands of the police a few short weeks ago.  The riots must serve as a wake-up call to complacent diplomats in Phnom Penh. As there is no law and order in Cambodia, your embassy could be next. I have not forgotten that in the mid-1990s Hun Sen threatened that Cambodians might ``storm'' the American and French embassies; unfortunately his warnings came true for Thailand.  With parliamentary elections scheduled for July, diplomats in Cambodia ought to be scrambling to protect and defend the rights of the democratic opposition to unseat Cambodia's unstable and violent dictator through peaceful and credible polls.  Cambodians can thank Prime Minister Hun Sen for chasing away foreign investors and tourists. This recent charade only underscores that he and the CPP are part of Cambodia's problems, and not part of the solution.                          ____________________
