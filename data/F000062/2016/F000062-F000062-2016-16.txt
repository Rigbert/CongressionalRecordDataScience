 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mike Buchwald, a dedicated member of my staff for over 9 years. Mike has served in my personal office, as my counsel, and finally, as deputy staff director for oversight and policy on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Over this time period, Mike has displayed a work ethic like none other. I have come to rely deeply on his attention to detail and exceptional command of the Nation's intelligence analysis.  Before joining the committee, Mike served an associate at the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers, where he specialized in criminal, congressional, and internal investigations of corporations and nonprofit entities as a member of the white-collar defense and strategic counseling groups. He served as a law clerk for Federal District Judge George P. Schiavelli in California, where he was born and raised. Prior to law school, he worked as a legislative assistant in my personal office for 3 years. Mike earned his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law and his B.A. cum laude with distinction in history from Yale University. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and has been admitted to practice law in California and the District of Columbia.  Mike's accomplishments on the Intelligence committee were extensive, many of which were completed behind the scenes in furtherance of the committee's oversight mandate. Two important public reports on which Mike was involved were the 2010 report on Attempted Terrorist Attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 and the 2013 SSCI Review of Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Facilities in Benghazi. Both reports were critical in helping improve our understanding of these attacks and how the U.S. Government and the intelligence community can prepare for them in the future.  The sheer volume of other committee activities in which Mike was engaged are too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say that he was an integral part of my intelligence team, supporting me and the committee in the enactment of seven consecutive intelligence authorization bills and overseeing the most complex activities undertaken by our government. He has unmatched passion for congressional oversight, for the intelligence community, and for this country's national security. Mike not only served me well, but was the consummate professional with all members and committee staff on both sides of the aisle.  Mike will continue to further his government career by accepting a position within the U.S. Department of Justice's National Security Division. I am certain the Department will find him to be a shining light, committed to protecting this country and its citizens. It is also important for me to acknowledge the support Mike has received from his fiancee and now wife, Jamie Lynn Poslosky. I thank her for allowing Mike to spend many late nights in the office meeting the oversight demands of the Intelligence Committee.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to publicly thank Mike and to wish him the very best in all his future endeavors. I will miss his insights and his ability to always have the right document at hand for any discussion or deliberations. Thank you, Mike, for your many years of service and dedication both to the country and to me personally.                          ____________________
