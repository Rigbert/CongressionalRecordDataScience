President, some supporters of the Edwards rider in its current form suggest that delay is justified because State officials seek it. Nothing could be further from reality. Two years ago, a unanimous resolution of the National Governors Association was passed. It says:       New Source Review requirements should be reformed to      achieve improvements that enhance the environment and      increase energy production capacity, while encouraging energy      efficiency, fuel diversity and the use of renewable      resources.  The Nation's environmental commissioners passed a subsequent amendment, stating:       The Environmental Council of the States adopts the      provisions of the NGA [the National Governors' Association]      policy. The Environmental Council of the States encourages      the United States EPA to reform the New Source Review      Regulations into a workable regulation that is easily      understood and effectively implemented.  These positions reflect the true direction of the majority of States. I think there is a propensity in this body for us to think that wisdom in Washington is greater than that of the States. That is not true. So you have a unanimous resolution from the Governors as well as the Environmental Council of the States.  The bottom line is this: My second-degree amendment allows the EPA and the States to benefit from the wisdom of the National Academy of Sciences on the important issues of clean air policy. However, my amendment does not create potential dangers inherent in delaying the onset of the important and thoughtful administrative reforms of the NSR program.  So I offer a second-degree amendment to the Edwards first-degree amendment No. 67 and ask for its immediate consideration.
