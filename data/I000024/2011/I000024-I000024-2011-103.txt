President, I would like to bring to your attention a bill I am reintroducing that would make permanent the current tax provision that allows capital assets on Indian lands to be depreciated on an accelerated schedule.  For many years, the Federal tax code has provided an incentive for businesses to invest in operations on Indian reservations and lands across the country. According to the law, businesses that purchase capital equipment and use it on Indian lands will be able to depreciate it, on average, more than 40 percent faster than would otherwise be allowed.  This tax provision is important to Oklahoma because of our longstanding history and unique relationship with Indian tribes. In light of the weak and ongoing economic recovery, we need to be doing all that we can to encourage businesses to reinvest in and expand their operations. This alone is what will create sustainable job growth.  The accelerated depreciation schedule helps do that by giving businesses the opportunity to recover investment dollars in capital assets more rapidly. This frees up capital and allows companies to reinvest that money more quickly than would have otherwise been possible. This is money that would have been tied up in the value of their capital assets, things like buildings, equipment, and machinery.  According to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, 96 companies in Oklahoma announced $1.7 billion of investments during the 2009-2010 period, creating an estimated 10,500 jobs. The trickledown effect of these investmentsis strong: 12,000 additional jobs and additional capital stock investments of over $200 million. Companies enjoyed at least $50 million in economic incentives as a direct result of the accelerated depreciation schedule.  The Oklahoma Department of Commerce has also reported that many companies attribute this provision as a key reason for relocating to and expanding within the State. One Oklahoma food processing plant manager recently stated that the credit was a significant factor in the company's decision to expand. Had the credit not been there, the business may not have expanded, and the unemployment rate would be worse than it is today.  The accelerated schedule is currently allowed, but the law states that it will expire at the end of this year. While the provision has typically been renewed each year, many business leaders have expressed concern that it is not permanent. I can understand why. As a former businessman myself, I understand the problem of unpredictability. More and more, unpredictability is the most serious concern I hear of from Oklahoma's business leaders. They are frustrated that many government policies, ranging from environmental regulations to the tax code, are changing so dramatically that they have no way of estimating how the new regulations will impact their businesses. How do you expect anyone to make investment decisions in that kind of environment? Businesses need stability, and this is particularly true during times of economic weakness. We in Congress should take this point seriously, and we can take a step in the right direction by making permanent this important tax provision. I urge swift passage.                          ____________________
