Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. The hour is getting late and it gets more difficult to participate.  I oppose this amendment, as Puerto Rico is not a nation. This bill will enable Puerto Rico to become a nation as a separate sovereignty if a majority of the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico vote to be independent. This provision is potentially confusing and should not be accepted, and I oppose the amendment.
