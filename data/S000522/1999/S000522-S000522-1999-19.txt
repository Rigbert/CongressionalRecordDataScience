Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend the chairman from New York for yielding me this time and thank the ranking member from Pennsylvania for his very kind remarks about all of those great individuals being honored today but also and especially for Mayor Rafferty from Hamilton Township.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of Congress for the past 19 years, I believe there is no one in the entire State of New Jersey more deserving of recognition and praise than Jack Rafferty, a dedicated mayor, community leader, humanitarian and family man.  Thus, Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to recommend passage of H.R. 1374, cosponsored, as the gentleman pointed out, by the entire New Jersey delegation, a bill to designate the U.S. postal building located at 680 U.S. Highway 130 in Hamilton Township, New Jersey as the ``John K. Rafferty Hamilton Post Office Building.'' Mayor Rafferty, who will be retiring from office in the next few months, has served the people of Hamilton with extraordinary distinction and honor as their mayor since 1976, and for 6 years prior to that time, he served on the Township Committee. Additionally, in 1986 and in 1987, Jack Rafferty served in the New Jersey State Assembly from the 14th District.  It is worth noting, Mr. Speaker, that in 1996, Jack Rafferty was inducted into the New Jersey Mayors' Hall of Fame. In 1997, the next year, the New Jersey Conference of Mayors selected him as the Mayor of the Year, another well-deserved accolade and honor. During his 30 years of dedicated public service, Mayor Rafferty has always been committed to the residents of Hamilton Township for whom he has worked tirelessly and effectively. His caring and commitment to the people of Hamilton never wavered during that service.  Mr. Speaker, Hamilton is a very large community. It is comprised of approximately 90,000 people, covering 39 square miles. Amazingly, Jack knows just about everybody in town and, significantly, he has always treated everyone, friend, acquaintance, stranger,even political opponents, with respect and dignity. He has always had a kind word for everybody and nobody has a better sense of humor than Jack Rafferty.  Mr. Speaker, as Hamilton's first full-time mayor, Jack has blazed a trail unsurpassed in accomplishment while he significantly improved the quality of life in the township, making it an example for other communities in New Jersey and around the country. And he always did it with style, good humor and class. Jack Rafferty was a mayor ahead of his time. In fact he was forging ahead with action items like preserving open space years before other politicians discovered the benefit of this enlightened initiative.  Almost everywhere you look in Hamilton Township, you will recognize Jack Rafferty's legacy and handiwork. From Hamilton's 310-acre Veterans Park, which Mayor Rafferty made a reality soon after being elected, to the botanical beauty of Sayen Gardens, Hamilton today is an oasis in New Jersey, a place set apart, a wonderful community to live and to raise a family.  Mr. Speaker, like other lawmakers at the County, State, and Federal level, I have worked very closely with Mayor Rafferty for years on joint Federal and local project initiatives to improve Hamilton's enviable quality of life. These initiatives include his determined effort to establish a single postal identity for his community to unite its various neighborhoods. In 1992, Mayor Rafferty accomplished this goal when the U.S. Postal Service finally recognized Hamilton as the name to be used when addressing letters to people and businesses. Mr. Speaker, that is why it is so fitting to name this postal facility on Route 130 in Hamilton after the mayor, if it were not for Jack, this postal identity, like scores of other things, would never have become a reality.  Most recently, Jack worked to bring a Northeast Corridor line train station to Hamilton. During the dedication ceremony for the station, Mayor Rafferty spoke with pride about meeting the needs of the growing number of commuters who live in our area, not just in Hamilton but in surrounding communities as well, and he also talked about the big landscaped hedge sign along the Northeast Corridor route that lets people know that they are in Hamilton Township. Quite literally, he put Hamilton on the map.  Mayor Rafferty worked hard, effectively and with a can-do type of vision to develop Hamilton's infrastructure, including its award-winning water pollution control system which has attracted ecology students and teachers from universities along with officials from other municipalities. He knows that a well-built, forward-thinking and properly maintained infrastructure is the key to balancing development, environmental protection and local prosperity.  While Mayor Rafferty realized the importance of roads, highways, and mass transit, he never forgot the life-enhancing advantages that open space and recreation bring to a community. Hamilton now operates several major parks, along with 25 baseball fields, 19 soccer fields, 38 tennis courts, 41 basketball courts and 39 neighborhood playgrounds to serve its residents. Veterans Park itself contains the State's largest municipal playground and the largest public tennis facility and it is the site of the annual SeptemberFest celebration to which over 100,000 people a year visit to enjoy the community of Hamilton. These things do not happen by accident. They are the result of careful planning and careful execution. We have our mayor to thank for it.  Keeping Hamilton beautiful, bursting with trees, shrubs and flowers and fostering a high standard of living has been another Jack Rafferty hallmark. Hamilton has planted 4,000 shade trees since Mayor Rafferty took office and the township continues to plant about 300 per year. Overall, Hamilton now has 3,500 acres of parkland. The infrastructure and open space improvements made by Mayor Rafferty have sparked important nonpolluting commercial growth and provide for a diverse and stable economy in Hamilton.                              {time}  1600  Along with serving as Hamilton's mayor, Jack has always found the time to be active in numerous civic associations as well, the township's VFW post, the Knights of Columbus, the YMCA, and the Grange Society. Mayor Rafferty also served as president of the New Jersey Conference of Mayors from 1984 to 1986, and as I indicated earlier, was the conference Mayor of the Year in 1997.  Mayor Rafferty received more awards than time permits me to mention on the floor today during his service to Hamilton, but just to name a few: the Young Mens Christian Association Man of the Year in 1992, the Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen Award in 1996, and Project Freedom's Angel Award in 1998.  Mr. Speaker, finally just let me say that I have known Jack Rafferty and his wife Doris and their children, Megan and Daniel, for many years. They have been and are today a great first family. They are caring people. They epitomize what is good and honorable about public service, and they are class personified.  As mayor, Jack will be missed, but always appreciated. I believe that designating the post office on Route 130 as the John K. Rafferty Hamilton Post Office is the least that our citizens can do to say ``thank you'' to someone who has done so much for so many.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time but yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine any way in which I can add to the eloquence and the depth of the very appropriate comments by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), and with that I would simply urge all of our colleagues to join with the ranking member and myself and all of the committee members in sponsoring the gentleman from New Jersey's very worthy initiative.
