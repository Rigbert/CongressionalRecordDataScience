 President, today, Senator Kennedy and I are introducing legislation that would prohibit, for a period of ten years, any person from attempting to clone a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.  The reason for this legislation is simple: the cloning of a human being today remains scientifically dangerous, morally unacceptable, and ethically flawed.  Let me be clear about the intent of this legislation right at the outset: I am opposed to human cloning. I do not believe it is, or will ever be, morally acceptable to clone human beings.  This legislation was carefully drafted so that it would not prevent or interfere with vital biomedical research into cancer and other diseases, birth defects, infertility, and the mass production of drugs and vaccines.  The Bill authorizes the continuation of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, and requires the Commission to report to the President and the Congress in 4\1/2\ years and 9\1/2\ years on the science and ethical issues associated with this technology.  The Commission's reports to Congress will also include a recommendation as to whether the moratorium should be continued beyond the ten years set by this legislation.                   technology outpaces public policy  The successful cloning of a sheep in Scotland last year, using a procedure known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, was hailed as an amazing scientific success.  But it also ignited a fierce international debate about the potential use of this technique to clone human beings, and the ethical, legal and religious questions raised by such a possibility.  Chicago-area physicist Dr. Richard Seed stirred that debate into full force last month when he told the media that he intends to clone human beings.  He said that there were ten clinics in the United States interested in offering cloning services and that he believes the demand will be for over 200,000 cases per year, according to the American Medical News.  Setting aside the fact that Dr. Seed's claims are somewhat implausible at the moment given the rudimentary state of cloning technology, he did hit a nerve.  This is a classic example, in my view, of how the lightening speed with which we are able to develop new technologies can sometimes get ahead of society's ability to handle these advances.  I do not believe that, today, we know enough to permit human cloning, or to make a permanent determination about the use of this technology.  But, when writing laws that would have such an enormous impact on an entire field of science--science that includes the development of lifesaving new therapies for disease, the prevention of birth defects, and fertility--Congress has a responsibility to be prudent and judicious in drafting legislation.  In preparing this legislation, Senator Kennedy and I, and our staffs, met with representatives from: The National Bioethics Advisory Commission; The National Institutes of Health; The American Society for Reproductive Medicine; The Biotech Industry Association; The Department of Health and Human Services; The Food and Drug Administration.  Included in the National Bioethics Advisory Commission were members of the religious and medical ethics communities.  This bill is carefully drafted to prohibit attempts to clone a human being, while not impeding other important research involving somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, and the cloning of cells, tissues, DNA and animals.                          procedure is unsafe  One compelling reason to prohibit attempts to clone human beings at this time is the fact that the technology is so new that it is unsafe even in animals.  Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, was the only success out of 277 attempts, and the procedure has not been repeated successfully (although there are reports of the pending birth of at least one calf using the same cloning procedure).  The National Bioethics Advisory Commission concluded that attempting to use this process to clone humans would involve unacceptable risks to the fetus or potential children, possibly resulting in multiple miscarriages, developmental abnormalities, and unknown risks to the mother.  Even if and when concerns about safety are resolved, the ethical concerns of cloning humans still remain.  This 10-year moratorium will allow us the time to study and debate this issue fully--which we as a society need to do because the science is not going to go away, and we will have to have a greater understanding of it to make informed decisions on its use.                must not impede other important research  The term ``cloning'' is used by scientists to describe various techniques that involve duplication of biological material, both animal and human.  A blanket ban on cloning, or on use of the nuclear cell transplant technique to clone, would be too broad, and would deprive the United States--and the world--of invaluable biological research.  The cloning technique that was used to produce Dolly, somatic cell nuclear transfer, was an extension of experiments carried out over 40 years to facilitate understanding of how development of an animal from a single fertilized egg is carried out.  The agricultural industry has been using nuclear transplantation research to try to improve livestock breeding.  Biotechnology companies are exploring ways to use cloning to improve the production of therapeutic drugs.  And health researchers are hoping that a greater understanding of nuclear transplantation cloning can lead to new treatment for human disease.                                 cancer  A report issued by the National Institutes of Health, dated January 29, indicates that cloned tissue culture cells have allowed scientists to test potential chemotherapies on cancerous cells, to study the cellular events leading to cancer, and to mass-produce drugs and vaccines.                                diabetes  Cloning technology, using somatic cell nuclear transfer, could teach scientists how to augment the insulin-producing cells in diabetics using cells from their own bodies.  Not only could cloning technology revolutionize the treatment for diabetes--it could potentially provide a cure for this debilitating disease.                              skin grafts  Somatic cell nuclear transfer might also be used in the future to create skin grafts for people who are severely burned.  In severe burn cases, many times there is not enough healthy skin on the victim to perform a skin graft, so doctors are forced to use skin from cadavers or skin cells grown in tissue culture.  In both cases, the skin is genetically different from the burn victim, and while it provides material for emergency grafting, this skin is ultimately rejected and the patient must undergo numerous grafting.  Somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning could allow skin to be generated from virtually any of the burn victim's cells, which would be genetically identical and therefore should not be rejected.  The life-saving possibilities for this technology are enormous:  The creation of nerve stem cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and to help repair injuries of the spinal cord.  Bone marrow stem cells, for the treatment of leukemia, sickle cell or other blood diseases.  Liver cells to treat liver damage.  Muscle cells to treat muscular dystrophy and heart disease.  Cartilage-forming cells to reconstruct joints damaged by injury or arthritis.  The cloning of cells in culture has reduced the use of live animals in research and has allowed studies of human cells that could not be done otherwise.  As scientists from NIH clearly warn, without future research exploring this cloning technology, these and other potential life-saving possibilities will be unrealized.  NIH scientists also make clear that all of these possibilities can be accomplished without using this technology to create, or attempt to create, a human being.  A letter signed by more than 50 medical and patient organizations sent to Members of Congress last week warning very clearly of the danger in drafting legislation to ban cloning.  In the letter they say:       Poorly crafted legislation to ban the cloning of human      beings may put at risk biomedical research, such as the use      of cloning techniques on human cells, genes and tissues,      which is vital to finding the cures to the diseases and      ailments which our organizations champion.             the differences with the president's proposal  The bill we are introducing today is very similar to the President's bill which he sent to Congress on June 10, 1997. But it differs from the President's in five important aspects.  First, it adds additional provisions to prevent anyone from cloning or even attempting to clone a human being. In addition to the outright prohibition on cloning a human being, the bill prohibits the use of Federal funds for such a purpose. Furthermore, the bill prohibits shipping the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of attempting to clone a human being. This provision will ensure that no one may attempt to evade the law by shipping the product of somatic nuclear cell transfer overseas for the purpose of cloning a human being.  Second, it stiffens already tough penalties in the President's bill to deter any attempt at cloning a human being. The bill provides a penalty of $1,000,000 or three times the gross gain or loss from such a violation, whichever is greater. In addition, the bill provides that any property used in an attempt to violate the act, as well as any property traceable to such an attempted violation, will be forfeited. Furthermore, the Attorney General, who is solely empowered to enforce the act, is granted the power of injunction to immediately enjoin violations.  Third, the bill preempts state laws that prohibit or restrict research regarding, or practices of, somatic cell nuclear transfer, mitochondrial or cytoplasmic therapy, or the cloning of molecules, DNA, cells, tissues, organs, plants, animals, or humans.  This provision is important because I believe we need a consistent national policy and we should discourage the practice of ``forum shopping'' from state to state for lenient laws.  This bill is not intended to preempt state laws such as California Penal Code Title 9, Chapter 12, Section 367g, and California Business and Professions Code Division 2, Chapter 5, Article 12, Section 2260, which require that physicians and other medical personnel obtain signed written consent from patients before sperm, ova, or embryos are used for any purpose other than reimplantation in the same patient or in their spouse, and require that any useof sperm, ova, or embryos of donors comply with the written intent of the donor.  The California statues were passed in order to address serious allegations by at least 60 California families, that medical personnel at fertility clinics at the University of California at Irvine and the University of California at San Diego transferred donors' sperm, ova, or embryos to researchers or implanted them in other women, without donors' knowledge or consent. These allegations raise grave concerns about serious violations of personal integrity and privacy. This legislation is in no way intended to preempt or interfere in any way with these California statutes, or with related statutes that would have a similar effect.  Fourth, the bill we are introducing urges the President to cooperate with foreign countries to enforce restrictions on human cloning. Other countries are moving to ban human cloning and we should join them so that scientists cannot evade our laws by moving their operations offshore.  Finally, our bill establishes a 10-year ban, as opposed to the 5-year ban in the President's recommended legislation.  It is conceivable that there could be incredible scientific breakthroughs with cloning technology over the next 3 to 5 years.  But developing a legal and moral framework for understanding of the potential use and abuse of this technology will take much longer.  This legislation sunsets after 10 years, during which time the National Bioethics Advisory Commission must keep Congress and the President informed on the status of the science, its potential uses for society, and make recommendations on whether to continue the prohibition.  Congress can extend the ban temporarily or permanently at any time during or after the ten year period if it so chooses.                               conclusion  Creating life outside of the normal reproductive process has challenged many of our basic beliefs--never more so than with the notion of cloning a human being.  It is important that we as a society engage in a rigorous public debate to fully understand the science, the dangers, the potential benefits, and the moral and legal implications of this technology.  Throughout history, science has empowered humankind to achieve things never before believed possible. Our challenge is to harness this power without losing control over our own lives, or the moral compass that guides us.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record the letter to which I referred.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 2, 1998.         Regarding: Legislation to Ban Cloning of Human Beings       Dear Member: We are writing to express our concern about      legislation pending in the Congress to ban the cloning of      entire human beings.       Let us be clear. We oppose the cloning of a human being. We      see no ethical or medical justification for the cloning of a      human being and agree with the conclusions of the National      Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) that it is unacceptable      at this time for anyone in the public or private sector,      whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human      child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. We      recognize that this application of the technology raises      fundamental ethical and social issues. This technology is not      currently safe to use in humans.       The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the      Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Federation of      American Societies of Experimental Biology have all stated      that their members will not seek to clone a human being.      These three associations include essentially every researcher      or practitioner in the United States who has the scientific      capability to clone a human being.       We agree with NBAC in its report on cloning that: ``It is      notoriously difficult to draft legislation at any particular      moment that can serve to both exploit and govern the rapid      and unpredictable advances of science.'' Poorly crafted      legislation to ban the cloning of human beings may put at      risk biomedical research, such as the use of cloning      techniques on human cells, genes and tissues, which is vital      to finding the cures to the diseases and ailments which our      organizations champion. Cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma,      HIV/AIDS, eye diseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre      syndrome, Gaucher disease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney      cancer, Alzheimer's disease, tuberous sclerosis, tourette      syndrome, alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis,      Parkinson's disease, infertility, heart disease, diseases of      aging, ataxia telangiectasia and many other types of research      will benefit from the advances achieved by biomedical      researchers.       We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution and      adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, ``first do no      harm.'' We believe that there are two distinct issues here,      cloning of a human being and the healing which comes from      biomedical research. Congress must be sure that any      legislation which it considers does no harm to biomedical      research which can heal those with deadly and debilitating      diseases.       Please keep patients' concerns in mind as you proceed in      analyzing this very complicated issue.
