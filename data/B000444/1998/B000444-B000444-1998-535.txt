 President, with the end of the Cold War, the terrible threat of nuclear holocaust has been substantially reduced. But the world is far from trouble-free. The threat of the 90's, perhaps to become the threat of the coming decade, is that posed by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of lesser powers--like Iraq or Iran--or even terrorist groups.  My esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Indiana, has written a sobering article in today's issue of The Hill. His conclusion is one to which we should all pay attention:       Absent congressional support of a U.S. response to this      threat as focused, serious and vigorous as America's Cold War      strategy, Americans may have every reason to anticipate      domestic or international acts of nuclear, chemical and      biological terrorism against American targets before another      decade is out.  The Nunn-Lugar and related programs that help countries in the former Soviet Union to guard against diversion of material or technology relating to weapons of mass destruction are an important defense against such terrorism. Last year, I was pleased to co-sponsor Senator Lugar's amendment that restored full funding to these programs. This year, we would all be well advised to seek opportunities to expand these programs, as recommended in a study last year by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.  I commend Senator Lugar's article to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that its text be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From The Hill, Feb. 25, 1998]               The Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction                     (By Senator Richard G. Lugar)       Last week the American people were reminded that terrorism      is not just somebody else's problem. Two men were arrested by      the FBI in Nevada on suspicion of possessing a biological      agent believed to be anthrax. News reports suggested that the      suspects were members of the Aryan Nation, and rumors      abounded that they planned to attack a large metropolitan      area.       This is but the latest instance in a growing series of      incidents in which weapons of mass destruction have been      linked to terrorist plots.       Terrorists of today do not need a Manhattan Project to      construct weapons of mass terror.       Local law enforcement and the FBI responded quickly and      efficiently to the potential threat in Nevada. But this      episode begs the question: What would have happened if we had      not detected this threat? What were the origins of this      material? In this case, the source appears to have been an      American laboratory. But the origins could just as well have      been foreign.       On the day the suspects were arrested in Nevada, the news      media reported on a Russian-made form of deadly anthrax      bacteria that is resistant to penicillin and all current      vaccines. If true, this creates the risk that individual      Russian biologists might illicitly sell samples of their work      to rogue nations, such as Iraq. The U.S. military is      concerned that such an untreatable strain, if it exists,      could show up in Iraq during any military action in the      Persian Gulf.       At home, the terms under which American firms and      laboratories can sell such materials need to be tightened.      One of the suspects arrested in Nevada had pleaded guilty to      fraud after he was accused of illegally obtaining bubonic      plague bacteria from an American laboratory.       The Nevada incident demonstrates that the threat is real      and that we must be prepared. Preparation must take the form      of help to locate ``first responders''--the firemen, police,      emergency management teams, and medical personnel who will be      on the front lines if deterrence and prevention of such      incidents fail.       That is why the 1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici ``Defense Against      Weapons of Mass Destruction'' legislation directed the      professionals from the Department of Defense, Federal Bureau      of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency and      other executive agencies to join in a partnership with local      emergency professionals in cities across the country. To      date, 14 metropolitan areas have received training to deal      with these potential threats. The Pentagon intends to supply      training and equipment to 120 cities across the country over      the next five years.       Preparations at home, however, are insufficient, because      the most dangerous sources of proliferation are abroad where      the threats are more complex and the solutions more      complicated. There are three main lines of defense against      the proliferation of weapons and materials of mass      destruction. Individually, each is insufficient; together,      they help to form the policy fabric of an integrated defense-     in-depth. The first is preventing proliferation at the      sources abroad. The second is deterring and interdicting the      flow of illicit trade in these weapons and materials. The      third line of defense is preparing domestically for a crisis.       As a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian      command and control society, a vast potential supermarket of      weapons and materials of mass destruction has become      increasingly accessible. Religious sects, organized crime and      terrorist organizations can now attempt to buy or steal what      they previously had to produce on their own. The available      technology allows a small number of conspirators to threaten      large populations, something heretofore achievable only by      nation-states.       In attempting to fashion a response to this threat, it is      common sense to attempt to deal with the threat posed by      weapons of mass destruction at as great a distance from our      borders as possible.       The Nunn-Lugar program at the Department of Defense, along      with its companion programs at the Department of Energy, are      the tools the United States is employing to reduce this      threat at the source, the former Soviet Union.       The program seeks to secure weapons-usable materials that      are at risk of falling into the wrong hands. Unfortunately,      much still remains poorly secured.       Americans are still threatened by weapons of mass      destruction. In the United States we are not adequately      equipped to manage the crisis posed by the threatened use of      such weapons or to manage the consequences of their use      against civilian populations, whether weapons production is      foreign or local.       The real question, is whether there exists sufficient      political will in Congress to devote the requisite resources      not only to domestic preparedness but to the first two lines      of defense--namely, prevention and deterrence. Only by      shoring up the lines of defense abroad can we hope to prepare      successfully for the threat at home.       Absent congressional support of a U.S. response to this      threat as focused, serious and vigorous as America's Cold War      strategy, Americans may have every reason to anticipate      domestic or international acts of nuclear, chemical and      biological terrorism against American targets before another      decade is out.                          ____________________
