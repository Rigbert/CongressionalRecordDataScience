Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill permits sole-source contracts between the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Prison Industries. This amendment would extend the sole-source authority to the entire Department of Justice.  Existing law allows a head of any executive agency to make a sole-source contract award, if the agency head makes a determination that such an award is in the ``public interest.'' Following such a determination, Congress must be notified and the contract award suspended for 30 calendar days.  This bill expressly provides the Attorney General to grant a noncompetitive contract whenever it is deemed necessary to maintain prison safety. Additionally, the bill allows the FPI board of directors to exceed the level specified for FPI sales if good cause is shown, which would include maintaining inmate equipment.  DOJ operates a number of agencies, and the cost to the private sector in lost jobs and businesses would be extensive. In addition, the Department of Justice contains several law enforcement agencies, and requiring their personnel to utilize products made by inmates may raise safety concerns.  Finally, the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the government corporations do not take away opportunities from private businesses and to ensure that the taxpayers' money is wisely spent. The amendment would undermine that goal by denying the entire Department of Justice access to the benefits of competitive pricing, thereby forcing the taxpayer to bear the burden of higher prices.  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
