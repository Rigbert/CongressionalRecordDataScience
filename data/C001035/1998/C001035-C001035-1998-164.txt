President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, in introducing the Workplace Information, Readability and Electronic Dissemination (or WIRED) Act, which will significantly improve the ability of both workers and employers to use and understand the Material Safety Data Sheets that accompany potentially hazardous chemicals used in the workplace.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration rightly requires employers to provide information to their employees about hazardous chemicals used in the workplace on Material Safety Data Sheets, or MSDSs. These MSDSs, which are provided by the manufacturer, must be ``readily accessible'' to employees during each work shift and must include information about the manufacturer, the physical properties of the chemical, health precautions that should be taken, and instructions on how to handle spills and other emergencies.  OSHA issued the rule requiring MSDSs in the workplace in the early 1980s, well before computers and fax machines became routine fixtures in virtually every workplace. As a consequence, employers are required to keep huge, loose-leaf notebooks or file cabinets filled with handwritten or printed MSDSs in the workplace at all times. More often than not, the MSDSs are tattered, stained and out-of-date since, in an average inventory, as many as 7 percent will become obsolete within a month. Finding the right MSDS quickly in an emergency under these circumstances can be a real challenge, particularly since they can easily be misfiled.  In this age of electronic communication, there simply are better ways for employers and employees to maintain and access this important safety information. Currently, there are a number of different products on the market such as CD-ROMs and fax-on-demand response systems that provide all the MSDS information an employer or employee might need within minutes of the request. Businesses contend that these services are more efficient, since they allow an independent service to maintain the information and the employees to access the information instantaneously and at will. Not only are computer systems faster, but they also enable employees to cross-reference different chemicals. These electronic systems are certainly better that the current paper system required by OSHA, which requires fumbling through a notebook or file cabinet, hoping that the MSDSs are current and filed correctly.  Unfortunately, OSHA will not allow employers to replace their paper MSDS systems with electronic access. As a consequence, many employers have been reluctant to take advantage of these superior new systems. The legislation we are introducing today will enable employers to bring their MSDS system into the 21st century by clarifying that employers have the option of replacing their paper system with electronic access, as long as the new system is readily available to all employees.  Another problem with the current system is that the information presented on a MSDS is extremely technical and complicated, making it difficult for many employees to understand, particularly when an accident has occurred and time is of the essence. Not only is the information on the MSDS itself technical, but it is also presented in language that is too advanced for the vast majority of manufacturing workers to understand. According to a review of the National Center for Education Statistics 1992 Adult Literacy Survey, the information on a typical MSDS requires a Level 5 reading proficiency, while the same survey shows that manufacturing workers typically read at a Level 2.  This situation is complicated by the fact that there is no standard format for MSDSs and different manufacturers have different formats for presenting the same information. This makes it difficult for employees who must look at more than one MSDS to find the information they need quickly, and quickinformation is particularly important in an emergency. The legislation we are introducing today will therefore require OSHA not only to standardize the format for MSDSs, but also to ensure that they are written at a literacy level that is appropriate for the typical industrial worker.  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today will not only make it easier for employers to comply with important OSHA safety standards, but it will also ensure that their employees have better access to accurate and up-to-date safety information that they can both read and understand. Enactment of the WIRED Act will result in safer, more efficient workplaces, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                          ____________________
