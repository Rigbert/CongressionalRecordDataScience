  Mr. DeFAZIO. I paid $4.01 a gallon at home in Oregon last weekend. There's a lot of people who've got long-term plans, drill now, drill here, drill everywhere, conservation, whatever. Theysay there's nothing we can do in the short-term. Well, there is.  Seventy percent of the oil futures, the supply of oil, is owned by speculators on Wall Street and other places around the world--70 percent. The head of ExxonMobil testified that about $38 a barrel is due to speculation. That's the head of ExxonMobil. He says we're paying 38 bucks a barrel for speculators on Wall Street.  Goldman Sachs says, well, it's only $22 to $28 a barrel. Let's take the lowest number, $22 a barrel. That would lower regular gas by 64 cents a gallon if we got rid of the speculators.  I've proposed a tax of 1/100 of 1 cent per transaction that would drive most of these speculators out of the market and raise some revenues.  It's time to get rid of the speculators, provide price relief to Americans, and then we can talk about a long-term plan for energy self-sufficiency.                          ____________________
