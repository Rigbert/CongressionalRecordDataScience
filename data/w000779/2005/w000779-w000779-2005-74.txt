President, this bipartisan measure will be voted on tomorrow. My sense is that because the day will be very hectic, having to vote on many amendments, that there will not be much time for explanation of this measure. Senator Snowe, Senator Stabenow, and others who spent so much time on this issue are going to want to speak. I will tell the Senate tonight this is one of the most important issues to come up in a long time. This program will be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, expansions of Federal entitlement policy we have ever seen. Why we wouldn't want to go about this right and make the Government a smart shopper, a savvy shopper, why we wouldn't want to do that is beyond me.  What we have is an error of commission. What you saw is, in this legislation, very powerful special interests said we want a unique set of rules to apply to us: We shouldn't have to negotiate, even though everybody else negotiates with the Government and the private sector; give us a free ride; restrict, as a matter of law, the ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make sure that seniors and taxpayers got a square deal.  That is not right. This is about common sense. This is about the Federal Government being a smart shopper. This is about standing up for taxpayers and seniors.  I would like to wrap up tonight by reading a bit from the AARP letter of endorsement for the legislation. Mr. President, I am going to read briefly from this letter, but I ask unanimous consent that the AARP letter endorsing the bipartisan measure to contain the cost of medicine be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         AARP,                                                 November 1, 2005.     The Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: AARP supports your amendment to the      Senate fiscal year 2006 Budget Reconciliation bill to provide      for the ability of the Secretary of Health and Human Services      to participate in the negotiations between pharmaceutical      manufacturers and prescription drug plans under the Medicare      Part D program.       Prescription drug prices continue to rise much faster than      the rate of inflation. AARP's latest Rx Watchdog report      released this week found that prices for nearly 200 of the      most commonly used brand name medications rose 6.1 percent      during the 12 month period from July 2004-June 2005. At the      same time, the rate of general inflation was 3 percent. These      drug price increases particularly hit older Americans, who      use prescription drugs more than any other segment of the      U.S. population.       In two weeks, millions of older and disabled Americans will      have the opportunity to choose prescription drug coverage as      part of their 2006 Medicare benefit options. The new Medicare      prescription drug benefit will help millions of beneficiaries      afford needed medications. Improvements to the Medicare      Modernization Act are necessary to strengthen the benefit and      the Medicare program. We believe the first step is to keep      the drug benefit affordable for beneficiaries as well as      taxpayers.       While the competitive structure already existing in the MMA      may help to bring prescription drug prices down, we believe      that giving the Secretary the authority to participate in      negotiations may also help to make prescription drugs more      affordable for Medicare beneficiaries.       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on      both sides of the aisle to ensure that the new Medicare Part      D benefit remains affordable over time. If you have any      further questions, please feel free to contact me, or have      your staff contact Anna Schwamlein of our Federal Affairs      staff at 202-434-3770.           Sincerely,                                              David P. Sloane,                                            Sr. Managing Director,                                Government Relations and Advocacy.
