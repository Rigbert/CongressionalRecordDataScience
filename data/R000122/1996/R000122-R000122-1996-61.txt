Speaker, the leader of the other body is right, enough is enough. For 19 days much of the Federal Government has been closed through the failure and intransigence of the new House leadership.  Federal workers and their families are the most obvious victims of this hostage mentality. They are not the only ones suffering. At Rhode Island's VA medical center employees are already working with either half or no pay, and now the veterans' benefits are threatened because the VA continuing resolution expires today.  Moreover, by the end of the week Rhode Island will have no funds left to administer its unemployment compensation insurance program, which could mean that no more unemployment compensation would be paid in Rhode Island.  Senior citizens could also expect to be hit hard by this Republican brinksmanship. Indeed, nationally 600,000 seniors will not get Meals on Wheels if Republicans do not bring a continuing resolution to the floor by Friday.  Environmental cleanup has stopped at Superfund sites, small business loans go unprocessed, American business people cannot go overseas without passport renewals, our national parks remain closed, and the list unfortunately continues. Mr. Speaker, it is time for some Members of this House to act like they want to take responsibility.                          ____________________
