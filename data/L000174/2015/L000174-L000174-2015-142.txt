President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for his courtesy.  Very briefly, we worked for 2 years across the aisle and actually across the Capitol. I don't know how many meetings Senator Lee, and others, and I have had. Now the Senate is finally poised to pass our USA FREEDOM Act and send it to the President for his signature. This bill brings much-needed reform to the government's surveillance authorities. It will end the bulk collection of Americans' phone records, increase transparency, improve oversight, and, most importantly, help restore Americans' privacy--all while ensuring that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep us safe.  I am proud to have done this. I have fought to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of Vermonters and all Americans since 1975, when I cast my first-ever vote as a Senator to approve the establishment of the Church Committee. I will continue to fight for Americans' privacy.  I urge Senators to vote to pass the USA FREEDOM Act.
