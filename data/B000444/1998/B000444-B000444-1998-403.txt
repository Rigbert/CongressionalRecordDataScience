 President, I support the confirmation of the nomination of Greg Sleet to be the 22d Federal district court judge in Delaware.  One of the most important duties of any U.S. Senator is the duty of advice and consent to the President's judicial appointments. I have worked hard throughout my career to ensure that the Senate provides the Federal courts with a steady supply of judges to enforce our Federal laws.  But, after serving on the Judiciary Committee for the last 20 years, and after serving as U.S. Senator from Delaware for the last 25 years, this is my first opportunity to recommend a Federal district court judge for Delaware.  I took this responsibility very seriously. And I have no doubt that Greg Sleet is the most qualified and experienced person for this position.  This is the second time President Clinton has put Greg's name through the rigors of Senate confirmation. But this is no surprise--he enjoys a reputation for impeccable integrity in the Delaware legal community.  In 1993, when I recommended Greg as U.S. attorney for Delaware, President Clinton was wise to follow my advice--he could not have nominated a more qualified, well-rounded, experienced Delawarean.  Greg was confirmed unanimously and flawlessly, and for the past 4 years has exceeded even my highest expectations.  And it is not only his distinguished service for Delaware, but also the breadth of Greg's experience that has impressed Delawareans, and convinced me that he will make a distinguished Federal judge.  Greg is a graduate of Rutgers University School of Law and completed his undergraduate work at Hampton University in Virginia.  He began his legal career in 1976 by serving for 7 years as a Philadelphia public defender--arguing before juries and representing indigent defendants at all stages of the criminal process--from pre-trial through the appellate courts.  He than gained experience in civil litigation, civil rights, estates, and criminal defense as an associate in private firms--most recently as a sole practitioner for his own firm. I know how tough--and rewarding--running your own firm can be.  In 1990, Greg began his service as deputy attorney general for the State of Delaware, where he gained experience prosecuting a variety of criminal cases at the State level.  He has practiced corporate and commercial law as well--working as an attorney in the legal department for Hercules Inc., where he helped manage corporate operations and litigation, and provided advice on acquisitions and antitrust matters.  Since Greg became U.S. attorney, he has demonstrated strong leadership as my State's chief Federal law enforcement officer--  He has developed a solid reputation by prosecuting many significant criminal cases, including numerous Federal drug and gun cases.  He has prosecuted hate crimes and fraud cases more aggressively than ever before.  And, in addition to his accomplishments in the criminal court at the Federal level, he has made it a priority to strengthen the civil division in Delaware's U.S. attorney's office.  Mr. President, I will not take up any more time--other than to repeat my ``bottom line'' from Greg's Judiciary Committee hearing:  Greg Sleet's record speaks for itself--the Federal bench needs judges like him. His background makes him exceptionally qualified to service on the Federal bench, and his record shows that he is tough--as we need our Federal judges to be--with the practical abilities and experience to do the job.  I am deeply proud to be associated with Greg's service as Delaware's U.S. attorney, and look forward to his service as a U.S. district court judge.  I commend my colleagues for taking the time to review Greg's record and thank them for their support for the candidacy of this fine nominee.                          ____________________
