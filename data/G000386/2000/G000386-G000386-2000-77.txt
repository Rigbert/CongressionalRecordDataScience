 President, I hope we had a lot of people who were able to listen all afternoon on this debate. I doubt if very many people listened for 4 hours, but they heard a lot of charges against the bill that were partisan early on this afternoon. Then I said how this bill passed 83-14 originally. That would never have happened--that wide of a margin and bipartisan cooperation--except for the early support and continuing support, and you have seen that demonstrated in the recent speech by Senator Torricelli. I thank him for that.  I also thank Senator Biden of Delaware for also helping us get this bill out of committee and to the floor, and also Senator Reid of Nevada, who helped us get through the hundreds of amendments we had filed with this legislation. So this is evidence of just three people on the other side of the aisle who have worked very hard to make this a bipartisan approach, and this legislation, as controversial as it is, would not have gotten as far as it had without that cooperation. I thank Senator Torricelli.                          ____________________
