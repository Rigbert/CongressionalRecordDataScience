 President, I rise today to honor Sharon Darling, the founder and president of the National Center for Family Literacy, in Louisville, KY. Sharon is a recipient of the 2001 National Humanities Medal and I want to offer my congratulations to her on this tremendous honor.  Sharon Darling is a devoted civic leader and a longtime advocate of family literacy. Through hands on experience as an elementary school teacher and an adult reading mentor, Sharon developed an education program that stresses the importance of early childhood education, adult literacy education, and parental involvement in the learning process. In 1989, she used her revolutionary program as a foundation for establishing the National Center for Family Literacy. Under Sharon's leadership the NCFL has grown into a widely respected national organization that promotes family literacy. Today the NCFL has more than 3,000 literacy programs throughout America.  The National Humanities Medal honors individuals whose work has contributed to their community by broadening citizens' access to the humanities. Given the years of service Sharon has dedicated to helping families read, I cannot think of anyone more deserving of this honor. Whether helping them to enjoy classic literature or simply understand written instructions, Sharon's work has improved the lives of countless Americans.  Sharon's commitment to public service does not end with the National Center for Family Literacy. She also actively serves with a number of important national and international organizations such as the International Women's Forum, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, National Coalition for Literacy, the American Indian Education Foundation, and the Heart of America Foundation.  Sharon, my colleagues, and I, join in congratulating you on your fine achievements. We also thank you for the time and effort you have put into the lives of others. I know the people of Kentucky and this great nation will continue to benefit from your contributions for many years to come.                          ____________________
