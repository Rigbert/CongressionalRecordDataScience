It was Attorney General Robert Kennedy. In that meeting, he stressed to us over and over again the professionalism of the Department of Justice and how the professionals had to stay out of any kind of partisan politics and that he would insist upon it.  I was inspired by that meeting. I think it probably shaped my decision to go into public life more than any other single meeting I had.  I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's USA Today by Ronald Goldfarb entitled ``Crossing the Line at Justice'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From USA Today, Wednesday, May 2, 2007]                       Crossing a Line at Justice                          (By Ronald Goldfarb)       The current agonies of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales      call to mind a dramatic moment in the Robert F. Kennedy      Justice Department. Members of his organized crime section      were in RFK's office reviewing our pending investigations and      cases. One of our group advised Kennedy that his grand jury      investigations were about to lead to the indictment of the      then-mayor of a large Midwestern city, one that had voted for      his brother John Kennedy in the close presidential election      of 1960.       When my colleague completed his report about the big scalp      about to be added to our list of political corruption cases,      RFK was quiet. It happened that the scalp in question      belonged to President Kennedy's ambassador-designate to      Greece. The attorney general smiled slightly and facetiously      remarked: ``Well, that's nice. Now my brother's going to have      to put me on the Supreme Court.'' The indictment went forward      and included others in the city's political (Democratic)      machine. All were convicted.       That anecdote is relevant today as the Senate Judiciary      Committee considers the attorney general's recent dismissals      of several U.S. attorneys. When it comes to the proper      administration of justice in the Department of Justice, there      are politics and there are politics.                              the two p's       Capital ``P'' politics--that is, party politics, such as      the partisan personal shenanigans of Gonzales meddling with      the independence of competent prosecutors' discretion in      response to political pressures--are improper and have no      place in the justice system. Small ``p'' politics, the      imposition of discretionary preferences, policies and      priorities in the focus of prosecutorial discretion,      generally are proper. Partisans must accept them, like it or      not. They are not the basis for replacing attorneys general.       The distinction is important. When the Justice Department      that I served in during the Kennedy administration came to      office, ``political'' priorities changed. The internal      security division, active and robust during the Eisenhower      administration when loyalty was a major concern, was de-     emphasized and eventually was deactivated. The organized      crime and the civil rights sections, small and quiet in      earlier years, grew into major centers of departmental work      and were the centerpiece of RFK's regime. That kind of      priority setting is proper.       Administrations come to office offering change. Like these      changes or not, people cannot claim they involve improper      politics. Critics have the right to change administrations      with their votes in subsequent elections. Had Al Gore been      elected, no doubt environmental prosecutions would have taken      front and center in the department's efforts.       After Sept. 11, 2001, homeland security would have been any      attorney general's special interest, RFK's included. So if      one deplores the values and priorities of the John Ashcroft      and Gonzales administrations at Justice, USA Patriot Act      excesses and the like, the recourse will be at the 2008      voting machines.       On the other hand, capital ``P'' party politics have no      place in any Justice Department. That is the unique      indictment of Gonzales, and one that should lead to his      replacement. All attorneys general face political pressure to      act against their parties' political enemies and to protect      their friends. Those are the moments of truth for all      attorneys general, the one that Gonzales failed, to the      embarrassment of even his own party representatives.                              rfk's tests       When RFK was attorney general, two comparable moments stand      out in my memory. In one, his notorious father's long-time      attorney--James Landis, ``a virtual member of the immediate      family,'' according to one biography--was charged with      failing to file his tax returns for five years. Immense      pressures were put on Kennedy to find an excuse not to indict      the aging and prestigious former Harvard law dean. RFK stayed      out of the decision-making process, and Landis pleaded guilty      and received a brief incarceration. But for his close      association with the Kennedys, Landis probably would not have      suffered so. Everyone wanted to help Landis, but they were      super self-conscious about the propriety of doing so.       A similar moment arose when an investigation showed that      the brother of the influential congressman from New York,      Eugene Keogh, had abused his office as a New York state      supreme court judge. Kennedy agonized over the political      pressures on him; he worried that the not open-and-shut case      might not be winnable, after major political embarrassment to      Kennedy loyalists. To his credit, Keogh told Kennedy he knew      he'd do the right and fair thing. The attorney general's      aides pressed him to do what he'd do in any other non-     political case. Judge J. Vincent Keogh was indicted and      convicted. That is the only way an attorney general can keep      the balance of justice even and credible.       Gonzales needed aides who spoke to him with comparable      candor and rectitude. Instead, he is falling on his sword      over the U.S. attorney firings that he administered without      knowing, as he has testified, much about them at the time.      Like former vice presidential aide Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby in      the Valerie Plame leak case, others set the political process      in motion, and the loyal aide did the deed and took the rap.      The Senate should not stop at Gonzales' actions, but should     press to find out who pressured him to take these      unconscionable actions.       Ashcroft supermoralistically draped the body of the      department's statue of justice to hide her contours; Gonzales      amoralistically tore off her blindfold. Both diminished the      prestige of an important government agency.                          ____________________
