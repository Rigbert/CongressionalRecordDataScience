''  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 26, 1998.     Re legislation to ban cloning of human beings.       Dear Member: We are writing to express our concern about      legislation pending in the Congress to ban the cloning of      entire human beings.       Let us be clear. We oppose the cloning of a human being. We      see no ethical or medical justification for the cloning of a      human being and agree with the conclusions of the National      Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) that it is unacceptable      at this time for anyone in the public or private sector,      whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human      child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. We      recognize that this application of the technology raises      fundamental ethical and social issues. This technology is not      currently safe to use in humans.       The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the      Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Federation of      American Societies of Experimental Biology have all stated      that their members will not seek to clone a human being.      These three associations include essentially every researcher      or practitioner in the United States who has the scientific      capability to clone a human being.       We agree with NBAC in its report on cloning that: ``It is      notoriously difficult to draft legislation at any particular      moment that can serve to both exploit and govern the rapid      and unpredictable advances of science.'' Poorly crafted      legislation to ban the cloning of human beings may put at      risk biomedical research, such as the use of cloning      techniques on human cells, genes and tissues, which is vital      to finding the cures to the diseases and ailments which our      organizations champion. Cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma,      HIV/AIDS, eye diseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre      syndrome, Gaucher disease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney      cancer, Alzheimer's disease, tuberous sclerosis, tourette      syndrome, alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis,      Parkinson's disease, infertility, diseases of aging, ataxia      telangiectasia and many other types of research will benefit      from the advances achieved by biomedical researchers.       We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution and      adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, ``first do no      harm.'' We believe that there are two distinct issues here,      cloning of a human being and the healing which comes from      biomedical research.     Congress must be sure that any legislation which it considers      does no harm to biomedical research which can heal those with      deadly and debilitating diseases.       Please keep patients' concerns in mind as you proceed in      analyzing this very complicated issue.           Sincerely,       AIDS Action Council.
