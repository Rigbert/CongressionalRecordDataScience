I want to thank my friend for yielding.  You know by now that we have had a very busy agenda during this break period, including the bills we have already completed: National Water Research and Development Initiative Act, credit card legislation, hate crimes legislation, the budget conference report; and next week, we expect to pass the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act and the Fight Fraud Act of 2009.  I must tell you that in addition before the Memorial Day break, we will need to pass the supplemental appropriation for Iraq and Afghanistan. The President sent his request on April 10 for more than $83 billion. We expect the House and Senate to act on the request before the Memorial Day recess.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, if I may elaborate with the gentleman from Georgia.  You said a war supplemental. I would wonder, would there be any benchmarks in this bill, and would there be any non-war-related spending in this bill as well?
