 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize a group of young ladies who have found great success in their athletic endeavors on the national and international level. The North Laurel High School cheerleaders have represented their county and the Commonwealth of Kentucky well with their hard work, skill, and success. On February 10, the North Laurel High School cheerleaders won both the World School and International Cup at UCA Nationals in Orlando, FL.  The cheerleading squad from North Laurel High School not only reclaimed the title of first place in World School at the UCA, Universal Cheerleaders Association, Nationals in Orlando, but they went on to become champions of the International Cup, beating out teams from Canada, Ecuador, and China. They also went on to win first place in the medium 2A Division representing the 13th Region at the 2013 KHSAA, Kentucky High School Athletic Association, Competitive Cheer State Championship held in Bowling Green, KY on February 23. Team members Autumn Asher, Madison Asher, Machenzie Burns, Raye Lynn Campbell, Taylor Crockett, Channing Ely, Emily Evans, Katlyn Helton, Malari Hoskins, Sara Kaminsky, Peyton Lankford, Katie Mays, Tara McClure, Aubree Oakley, Katelyn Sharp, MaKayla Vaughn, Mary Kate Whitfield, and Maddie Wood as well ascoaches Kimberly B. Wood, Toni Blake Greer, and Jomo K. Thompson saw their dedication and hours of practice pay off with victory. Truly, their efforts reflect well on their community, and they represent to competitors all over the world the unbridled spirit of Kentuckians.  At this time, I would like to publicly declare Kentucky's appreciation for this team, their coaches, and their parents who have received well-deserved recognition and success for their commitments and practice. The North Laurel High School cheerleaders have represented Kentucky well, and we are both grateful and proud. I would ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in acknowledging their achievements, and I ask unanimous consent that an article detailing their success from the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Feb. 14, 2013]              NLHS, E.B. Cheer Teams Win Big at Nationals       Laurel County, Ky.--Laurel County cheer teams received high      honors at the UCA Nationals in Orlando, Fla., this weekend.       The North Laurel High School team earned first place in the      medium varsity division, as well as being named the first-     place winners in world school and international cup      competitions.       This was the first time the team has won first place at      nationals since 2009.       ``We have a very young squad,'' said Kim Wood, coach. ``Our      goal going into this was to hit a solid routine. We told the      girls to focus just on us, not the other teams, and doing the      absolute best we could do.''       Although the team won first in world school last year, this      was the first year they were named as champions of the      international cup against teams from Canada, China, and      Ecuador.       The outcome was a wonderful surprise, she said.       ``It was our best performance at national level. It was      pretty perfect in our eyes,'' Wood continued. ``The awards      were the icing on the cake.''       It was ninth-grader Taylor Crockett's first high-school      nationals. Crockett has competed in cheerleading since the      sixth grade.       ``It took a lot of hard work. At the beginning of the year,      we really didn't know each other,'' she said. ``We just      started bonding as a team. That bond helped us.''       Senior MaKayla Vaughn said this year was both ``amazing''      and ``bittersweet'' because it will be her last.       During competition, Vaughn said the team helped to keep      each other calm, encouraging and supporting one another.       ``We were the first team to go on,'' she said. ``We told      each other to set the bar high.''       The East Bernstadt Tumble Cats also took home a big win      this weekend at UCA Nationals.       The Tumble Cats won first place in the youth rec, or      elementary, division against seven other teams.       In January, the Tumble Cats were named the elementary state      champions for the second year in a row at the Kentucky Middle      School State competition in Richmond.       The elementary team was formed just three years ago.       ``They've gotten progressively better over time,'' said      Coach Cristin Adams. ``They worked really hard this year.      These kids and their parents are very dedicated.''       This was the first year Adams and Coach Darrin Spencer took      the team, comprised of first- to fourth-graders, to UCA      Nationals.       ``We (she and Spencer) saw the potential of this team. Our      goal was to make the top 3 (at nationals). We exceeded that      and got first place.''       Prior to competition, even making the top 3 looked to be a      big feat.       ``One week before we left (for nationals), we had two girls      break their fingers,'' Adams said. ``We had to rework our      routine, and that's not easy, especially at this age, but we      hit the routine solid.''       The team trains at Damar Gymnastics in Lily, who      choreographed their routine.       ``Gymnastics is where the foundation starts,'' Adams said.      ``Technique is very important.''       The majority of the 20-member team are third-graders, and      most, Adams said, have been on the team for three years.       ``Starting young helps feed into the older teams,'' she      said. ``And we want to be a good feeder program for North      Laurel Middle and North Laurel High schools.''       The North Laurel Middle School cheerleading team took      second place in their division at UCA nationals.       NLMS team coaches include Katie Sizemore, Paula Crawford,      and Susan Tolliver.       NLHS team coaches include Wood, Toni Blake Greer, and Jomo      Thompson, who is also the University of Kentucky head      cheerleading coach.                          ____________________
