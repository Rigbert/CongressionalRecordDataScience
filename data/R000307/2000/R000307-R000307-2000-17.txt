President, with all those accolades, the Senator missed one--I had one other line in there.  I commend my good friend for his commonsense approach to our country's future. I thank him. I applaud him for his leadership. He has begun what I think is a trail-blazing initiative. This has been, as he has indicated, a year-long bipartisan foreign policy dialog endeavor. We thank staff and various folks on the floor for their patience. I learned a great deal from the distinguished Senator from Georgia. He said he learned from me. I learned from him.  As the Senator mentioned, we would now like to present our lessons learned from our year-long dialogs, these dialogs that we began because we both felt our foreign policy agenda had run aground. We wanted to start a series of these dialogs, these debates or colloquys, in order to arrive at a consensus concerning the future of our Nation's foreign and defense policies.  We condensed our five dialogs into seven foreign policy principles. These principles are not only a compilation of our dialogs, but also a summary of the lessons learned from the various discussions with colleagues, as the Senator has indicated, foreign policy elites, from academia and the government, and from several consultations with many military leaders. These seven foreign policy principles are simple. They are realistic. They are sustainable. We believe they would support and secure our national interests. We strongly believe the following principles are a step in the right direction.  We urge the next administration of Congress and all of our colleagues in the Congress to begin the process of trying to articulate a coherent national security strategy.  I again yield to the Senator from Georgia.
