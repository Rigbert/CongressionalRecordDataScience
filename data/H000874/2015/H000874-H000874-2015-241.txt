 I thank Representative Sewell for her leadership in making sure Congress honors those who shook the conscience of our Nation through their courageous actions in Selma 50 years ago and in so many other places--where many fought, some were badly injured, and, yes, some died--to redeem the promise of America that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. And certainly in a democracy, one of the most important--if not the most important--rights that we have is to vote, to select our representatives, to select the policies under which we will live.  I thank the Speaker and the majority leader for getting behind this effort. And, again, I thank the gentlelady from Selma. How proud she must be of her hometown and of the history that was made there, not just for African Americans but for all Americans.
