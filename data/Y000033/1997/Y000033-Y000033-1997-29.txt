If the gentleman will continue to yield, I would like to say that I rise in support of this rule and this bill. This is of great interest to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey]. There is a lot in this bill I do not necessarily agree with, either, but this is the work of what I call compromise and working with different factions. I believe this is the best we can do.  There are some parts of it in which I may not agree with the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates], who has done a yeoman's job, but he also has some parts that he does not agree with me. However, this is a good piece of legislation that should be passed.  I urge our colleagues to understand one thing. If this does not pass, a lot of things that are in there will not be available when we go back to the table. I think it is the right thing to do. We should do it. I compliment the gentleman working on it.
