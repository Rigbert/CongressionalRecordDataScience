We have had a degradation in what has happened to our defense. We have great troops, but right now we are operating at roughly one-half the force strength we were during the Persian Gulf war. And that can be quantified.  So often when people stand up politically and say we are stronger now than we were, or as strong as we were back during the Persian Gulf war, that just isn't true. We are approximately 60 percent of where we were in terms of force strength. That can be quantified.  I am talking about 60 percent of the Army divisions, 60 percent of the tactical air wings, 60 percent of the ships floating around, going from a 600-ship Navy to a 300-ship Navy. It is true some of that was from the previous administration. The Bush administration wanted to go down from 600 to 450 ships. But now we are far below that.  I think this administration has done a bad job the last 8 years. We are going to have to turn that around and do a massive rebuilding in the next administration. I think we are probably going to do it. I think we are going to see our Defense authorization committees of the House and the Senate do that. As well the Appropriations Committees are primed and ready, as is evidenced by the bill we are discussing today that we are going to pass. We are going to turn that corner and start rebuilding America's defense again.  With that, I yield the floor.                             Exhibit No. 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 10, 2000]                           Mr. Clinton's Army                           (By Mark Helprin)       Many people have come to believe that thinking about war is      akin to fomenting it, preparing for it is as unjustifiable as      starting it, and fighting it is only unnecessarily prolonging      it. History suggests that as a consequence of these beliefs      they will bear heavy responsibility for the defeat of      American arms on a battlefield and in a theater of war as yet      unknown. Theirs are the kind of illusions that lead to a      nation recoiling in shock and frustration, to the terrible      depression of its spirits, the gratuitous encouragement of      its enemies, and the violent deaths of thousands or tens of      thousands, or more, of those who not long before were its      children.       They will bear this responsibility along with      contemporaries who are so enamored of the particulars of      their well-being that they have made the government a kindly      nurse of households, a concierge and cook, never mind a      resurgent Saddam Hussein or China's rapid development of      nuclear weapons. They will bear it along with the partisans      of feminist and homosexual groups who see the military as a      tool for social transformation. And they will bear it with a      generation of politicians who have been guilty of willful      neglect merely for the sake of office.                               Abject Lie       So many fatuous toadies have been put in place in the      military that they will undoubtedly pop up like toast to      defend Vice President Gore's statement that ``if our      servicemen and women should be called on to risk their lives      for the sake of our freedoms and ideals, they will do so with      the best training and technology the world's richest country      can put at their service.'' This is an abject lie.       To throw light on the vice president's assertion that all      is well, consider that in Kosovo 37,000 aerial sorties were      required to destroy what Gen. Wesley Clark claimed were 93      tanks, 53 armored fighting vehicles, and 389 artillery      pieces; that these comprised, respectively, 8%, 7%, and 4% of      such targets, leaving the Yugoslav army virtually intact; and      that impeccable sources in the Pentagon state that Yugoslav      use of decoys put the actual number of destroyed tanks, for      example, in the single digits.       To achieve with several hundred sorties of $50-million      airplanes the singular splendor of destroying a Yugo, the      United States went without carries in the Western Pacific      during a crisis in Korea, and the Air Force tasked 40% of its      intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets, and      95% of its regular and 65% of its airborne tanker force, in      what the chief of staff called a heavier strain than either      the Gulf War or Vietnam.       One reason for the ``inefficiency'' of Operation Allied      Force is that this very kind of farce is funded by      cannibalizing operations and maintenance accounts. Such a      thing would not by itself be enough to depress the services      as they are now depressed. That has taken eight years of      magnificent neglect. Case in point: The U.S. Navy now focuses      on action in the littorals, and must deal with a burgeoning      inventory of increasingly capable Third World coastal      submarines that find refuge in marine layers and take comfort      from the Navy's near century of inapplicable blue-water      antisubmarine warfare. But our budget for surface-ship      torpedo defense will shortly dip from not even $5 million, to      nothing in 2001.       The reduction of the military budget to two-thirds of what      it was (in constant dollars) in 1985, and almost as great a      cut in force levels, combined with systematic demoralization,      scores of ``operations other than war,'' and the synergistic      breakdown that so often accompanies empires in decline and      bodies wracked by disease, have produced a tidal wave of      anecdotes and statistics. Twenty percent of carrier-deployed      F-     14s do not fly, serving as a source of spare parts instead.      Forty percent of Army helicopters are rated insufficient to      their tasks. Half of the Army's gas masks do not work. Due to      reduced flying time and training opportunities within just a      few years of Bill Clinton's first inauguration, 84% of F-15      pilots had to be waived through 38 categories of flight      training. The pilot of the Osprey in the December 1999 crash      that killed 19 Marines had only 80 hours in the aircraft, and      the pilot who sliced the cables of the Italian aerial tram in      1998, killing 20, had not flown a low-altitude training      flight for seven months. It goes on and on, and as the sorry      state of the military becomes known, the administration      responds by doing what it does best.       In the manner of Gen. Clark presenting as a success the--     exaggerated--claim of having destroyed 8% of the Yugoslav      tank forces in 78 days of bombing, the administration moved      to ``restructure'' the six armored and mechanized divisions      by shrinking force levels 15% and armor 22%, while expanding      the divisional battle sector by 250%, the idea being that by      removing 3,000 men and 115 tanks and Bradley Fighting      Vehicles while vastly expanding the area in which it would      have to fight, a division would somehow be made more      effective.       The two failed Army divisions cited by George W. Bush in      his acceptance speech were returned to readiness with speed      inversely proportional to the time it takes the White House      to produce a subpoenaed document, perhaps because, according      to the Army, ``new planning considerations have enabled      division commanders to make a more accurate assessment,'' and      ``the timelines for deployment . . . have been adjusted to      better enable them to meet contingency requirements.'' In      1995, brigade officials told the General Accounting Office      that they felt pressured to falsify readiness ratings, and      that the rubric ``needs practice'' was applied irrespective      of whether a unit scored 99% or 1% of the minimum passing      grade.       But there is more. Mainly by coincidence but partly by      design, several broader measures exist. The Army rates its      echelons. In 1994, two-thirds of these were judged fully      ready for war. By 1999, not one of them was. More than half      the Army's specialty schools have received the lowest      ratings, as did more than half its combat training centers      (although the chaplains are doing very well). These training      centers serve as an instrument that illuminates the      character of all the units that pass through them. By      examining their ratings it is possible to get a      comprehensive view of the Army's true state.       I have obtained National Training Center trend data that      are the careful measure of unit performance in 60 areas over      three years. Of 200 evaluations, only two were satisfactory.      This 99% negative performance, stunning as it is, is echoed      in the preliminary findings of a RAND study that, according      to sources within the Army, more than 90% of the time rates      mission capability at the battalion and the brigade levels as      insufficient. RAND has voluminous data and doesn't want to      talk about it until all the t's are crossed, long after the      election.       If Gov. Bush becomes president, the armies his father sent      to the Gulf will not be available to him, not after eight      years of degradation at the hands of Bill Clinton. Given that      their parlous condition is an invitation to enemies of the      United States and, therefore, Mr. Bush might need them, and      because the years of the locust are always paid for in blood,      he should take this issue and with it hammer upon the doors      of the White House at dawn.       In the Second World War, Marine Brig. Gen. Robert L. Denig      said, with homely elegance, ``This is a people's war. The      people want to know, need to know, and have a right to know,      what is going on.'' Nothing could be truer, and the vice      president of the United States does not speak the truth when      he characterizes as he does those forces that for two terms      his administrations have mercilessly run down. The American      military does not deserve this. It is not a cash cow for      balancing the budget, a butler-and-travel service for the      president, an instrument of sexual equality, or a gendarmerie      on the model of a French Foreign Legion with a broader      mandate and worse food.                            caesar's legions       If we are, in effect, the enemies of our own fighting men,      what will happen when they go into the field? The military      must be redeemed. Should Gov. Bush win in November he should      bring forward and promote soldiers and civilians who      understand military essentials and the absolute necessity of      readiness and training, people both colorful and drab, but      who would, all of them, understand that these words of Gen.      George S. Patton are the order of the day:       ``In a former geological era when I was a boy studying      latin, I had occasion to translate one of Caesar's remarks      which as nearly as I can remember read something like this:       `` `In the winter time, Caesar so trained his legions in      all that became soldiers and so habituated them in the proper      performance of their duties, that when in the spring he      committed them to battle against the Gauls, it was not      necessary to give them orders, for they knew what to do and      how to do it.'       ``This quotation expresses very exactly the goal we are      seeking in this division. I know that we shall attain it and      when we do, May God have mercy on our enemies; they will need      it.''
