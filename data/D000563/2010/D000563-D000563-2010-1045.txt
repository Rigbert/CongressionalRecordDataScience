I never have. I am very proud of what you have done in your baseball career. But let me tell you, this is a wild pitch you are throwing tonight because this is a pitch that is hitting somebody in the stands, it is hitting an unemployed worker in Illinois. That is a wild pitch that should not have been thrown, Senator.  I believe when you look at what this is going to do across America, this is unforgivable that we would do this to these unemployed people.  For the Senator from Michigan, I yield for the purpose of a question.
