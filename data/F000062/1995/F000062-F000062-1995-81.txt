 Not pursuing it is unthinkable.'' The ad goes on to endorse this legislation explicitly. It reads:       . . . We support the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act,      the United States legislation which enhanced Israel's      security by ensuring compliance by the Palestinians with      their agreements and advancing economic development in the      West Bank and Gaza, to show Palestinians that peace can      improve their lives.  This ad reflects nothing less than the consensus of the organized Jewish community in America. It is signed by 29 Jewish organizations. Such a broad consensus of American Jews, Israel's strongest supporters, should not, in fact, be construed as wrong. I hope we will listen to them.  I did not think we would be in this position where one person would prevent this act from being extended and effectively cut off all aid to the peace process, all economic development assistance that in good faith America has pledged.  On top of what happened last week, when these resolutions and these actions and these nonactions by this body are extrapolated universally and particularly in the Middle East, they very often come to have different meanings.  This body went on record in July supporting this process. How can we today turn it off? How can we say what we supported in July, we do not support enough in October to pass a simple amendment to extend the act? Instead, along with ambassadors, along with other treaties, we will hold it hostage?  I think it is wrong. I think it is overkill. I think it is a redoubtable action at best. I hope that the majority leader would be able to prevail on those who want to hold this hostage to achieving goals that are unrelated to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, and that those parties would reconsider. I think it is very important that they do.  I thank the Chair for the time.                               Exhibit 1               [From the New York Times, Sept. 17, 1995]    Prime Minister Rabin, We Know That Pursuing Peace Is Risky. Not                        Pursuing It Is Unthinkable       Mr. Prime Minister, as you continue the arduous journey to      peace, know that American Jewry stands with the Government of      Israel.       Overwhelmingly, American Jews say ``yes'' to Israel's      current pursuit of peace with security. Every poll reflects      this.       We know there is no alternative to the peace process except      continued violence and continued despair. We support your      government and its vision of two peoples living side by side,      in peace, so that the children of Israel can look forward to      the future without fear.       To bring us closer to this goal, we support MEPFA-the      Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, U.S. legislation which      enhances Israel's security by ensuring compliance by the      Palestinians with their agreements and advancing economic      development in the West Bank and Gaza to show Palestinians      that peace can improve their lives.       To road ahead will be filled with obstacles. But to turn      back would be far more dangerous. It would reward terrorists      by giving them precisely what they want: the death not only      of peace, but of hope.       Mr. Rabin, we say bracha v'hlatzlacha--may you be blessed      with good fortune. On the eve of the Jewish New Year 5756, we      offer you and the people of Israel our steadfast support and      heartfelt prayers in the days ahead.       American Jewish Committee, Robert S.

Never before has so large a cross-section of American      rabbis spoken so clearly about the urgent need to pursue      peace. Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist and Orthodox--     from 47 states and the District of Columbia--they call upon      Congress to demonstrate ``leadership so that peace and      security for Israel can become a reality.''       The rabbis urge the renewal of the Middle East Peace      Facilitation Act (MEPFA), terming it an ``important and      effective diplomatic tool for moving the peace process      forward.''       MEPFA enables the United States to play a constructive role      in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and to provide leadership      in the international effort to assist the Palestinian      Authority. ``Furthermore, it is a key element in the fight      against terror,'' according to the rabbis.       As the new Jewish year 5756 approaches, and Israel      continues its courageous journey to a peace that will endure,      let us pray, with the rabbis, for the peacemakers to succeed.                                                                    ____                                              Rabbinic Support for                                            the Peace Process,                                               September 12, 1995.     See peace and pursue it--Psalms 34:15       To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the      Senate: We are writing to express our strong support for      Israel's efforts to achieve peace with her neighbors and for      the active involvement of the United States in the Middle      East peace process.       Right now, the Congress of the United States has the      opportunity to help maintain the momentum towards peace in      the Middle East and to fight terrorism against Israel. We      call upon you to demonstrate your leadership so that peace      and security for Israel can become a reality.       The Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA) will expire      soon. The act permits the United States to play a      constructive role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and      to provide leadership in the international effort to assist      the Palestinian Authority. As such, MEPFA has been an      important and effective diplomatic tool for moving the peace      process forward. Furthermore, it is a key element in the      fight against terror. As Prime Minister Rabin recently said,      ``The solution between the Palestinians and Israel will      create conditions that will reduce the influence of the      extreme Islamic terrorist groups.''       In its June 1 report, the State Department points out that      ``the United States needs to be in a position to support,      encourage, and facilitate the Israeli-Palestinian dimension      of the [peace] process.'' MEPFA's renewal ensures that the      U.S. will play a key role in advancing peace and in fighting      terror. Like the leaders of Israel, we believe this role to      be essential. We therefore urge you to renew MEPFA in a      manner that both the American and Israeli administrations      believe will help further the talks and strengthen the fight      against terrorism.       We care deeply about Israel. We know that this may be      Israel's one true chance for      peace, and that this opportunity is fragile. We are deeply      concerned about the level of P.L.O. compliance; nevertheless,      we are heartened by the progress that, thanks in part to      MEPFA, has been attained. At the same time, we understand      that reducing our country's involvement or cutting aid to the      Palestinian Authority, which has committed itself to making      peace with Israel, is not now the proper vehicle for      expressing our concern. This is why we call upon you to      support peace and let the negotiations continue unhindered.       In the voice of our tradition we say, ``One does not have      the responsibility to complete the task, but neither is one      free to take leave of it.'' We urge you to play your part in      helping peace grow strong. Thank you.           Sincerely,     (Signed by over 1,000 American rabbis.)                          ____________________
