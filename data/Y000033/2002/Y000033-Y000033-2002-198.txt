Mr. Speaker, I insert for the Record an exchange of letters between the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, which I referred to earlier.         U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on            Transportation and Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.     Hon. Jim Nussle,     Chairman, Committee on Budget, Cannon Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of May 2,      2002, regarding H.R. 3694, the Highway Funding Restoration      Act and for your willingness to waive consideration of      provisions in the bill that fall within your Committee's      jurisdiction under House Rules.       I agree that your waiving consideration of relevant      provisions of H.R. 3694 does not waive your Committee's      jurisdiction over the bill. I also acknowledge your right to      seek conferees on any provisions that are under your      Committee's jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference      on H.R. 3694 or similar legislation, and will support your      request for conferees on such provisions.       As you request, your letter and this response will be      included in the committee report on the legislation as well      the Congressional Record during consideration on the House      Floor.       Thank you for your cooperation in moving this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Budget,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Young: On May 1, 2002 the Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure ordered reported H.R. 3694,      the Highway Funding Restoration Act. At introduction, H.R.      3694 was referred solely to the Committee on Transportation      and Infrastructure. In committee, however, an amendment was      adopted that added three new sections to the bill. Section      four, ``Adjustments to Guarantee Funding Levels,'' and      section five ``Sense of Congress Regarding Revenue Aligned      Budget Authority'' are within the primary jurisdiction of the      Budget committee. I want to thank you for working closely      with me to ensure that those provisions were acceptable to      the Budget Committee.       Because of our close working relationship on this matter      and in order to expedite the consideration of H.R. 3694, I do      not intend to seek a sequential referral of the bill as      ordered reported. In not seeking a sequential referral of      H.R. 3694, the committee does not waive its jurisdiction or      its prerogatives over this legislation. The Budget Committee      also reserves its authority to seek conferees on H.R. 3694 or      a similar Senate bill with respect to provisions that are      within the committee's jurisdiction; and, I ask your      commitment to support any such request by the Budget      Committee.       Finally, I would ask that you include a copy of our      exchange of letters on this matter in your committee report      and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration.      Thank you for your assistance and cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                       Jim Nussle,                                                         Chairman.
