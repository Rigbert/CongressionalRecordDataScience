President, I say, for those on this side of the aisle who may have amendments, it is a good time tobring them forward. Again, I hope, along with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, that we might be able to wrap up relatively soon on this piece of legislation. I mention that, for those who are sitting around wondering if there is anything better to be doing, that now is a good time to do it. Many have called; few are accepted. Now is the time to do it.  With that, Mr. President, and nobody else seeking recognition, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
