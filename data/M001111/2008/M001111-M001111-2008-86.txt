 We believe now, as we did when we passed the act into law, that for training to benefit working families and their communities, it must respond to the skills needs of thriving industries that lead to family-wage jobs. An example of this is the green jobs sector. Innovative States, such as my own State of Washington, are leading the expansion of career opportunities in the green economy, making sure that opportunities are readily available for workers to acquire the skills to qualify for these good jobs. In fact, Washington State set a new goal to increase the number of clean energy jobs to 25,000 in the next 12 years and committed to finance the necessary training. Innovative workforce boards across the country increasingly are providing training for green collar jobs that will be critical in meeting the demands of a low-carbon economy and providing workers with quality jobs. And Congress also is taking action. As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I supported the recent passage the Labor/Health and Human Services bill; we reported that a greater training investment needs to be made in areas such as renewable electric power, biofuels, energy-efficiency assessment and environmentally sustainable manufacturing and directed the Secretary of Labor to competitively award community based job training grants in these areas. All of these programs will be instrumental in developing the skilled domestic workforce necessary to maintain our Nation's competitive edge.
