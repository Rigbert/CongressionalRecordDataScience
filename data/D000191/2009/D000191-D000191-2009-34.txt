Five years ago, an obstinate penny-wise, pound-foolish Bush administration stonewalled a bipartisan proposal in Congress to increase trust fund revenues. They sent us on this path to insolvency. At the same time, they condemned us to a transportation system in America that is headed toward third-world status. On the National Highway System, 150,000 bridges are either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. That means they could fall down. Then we have 40 percent of the pavement on the National Highway System in fair or poor condition. Billions of gallons of fuel wasted in congestion and traffic, Americans wasting their lives sitting, frustrated. Businesses losing tens of billions of dollars because of delayed deliveries in a just-in-time competitive world economy.  We need a 6-year investment in our transportation system with new policies and a new vision to move us toward a competitive 21st century transportation system, not living off the dregs of one that we built in the fifties. But on the way to that new future, we need this infusion of cash. The States are out there in good faith, putting millions of people to work, rebuilding as much as they can with inadequate resources. They're bringing in bills for over $1 billion a week. That's a lot of jobs, folks, out there in America going on today, rebuilding our infrastructure. We need to make good on those obligations with this infusion of money.  I'm willing to pay for the enhanced investment in the coming legislation, and I'd urge my Republican colleagues to keep an open mind. They're either going to deny us the investment we need and condemn us to a transportation system that can't meet America's needs, or they're going to join us in a 6-year bill with adequate investment and funding, fully paid for, investing in the future of America.
