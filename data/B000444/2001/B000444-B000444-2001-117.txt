 President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Kohl and Senator Reed, the Juvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act of 2001. This is a balanced bill that recognizes the need to get tough on juvenile crime and violence, attempts to break the dangerous link between kids and guns, and, most importantly, puts the Federal Government firmly behind the proposition that preventing juvenile violence is the most effective crime fighting measure any of us could craft.  Before I discuss the specifics of the bill, let me give a brief overview of the current state of juvenile crime in America. Juvenile crime, like almost all other categories of crime, is down. Last December, the FBI released statistics that show the homicide arrest rate for juveniles down 68 percent from its 1993 peak. We are now experiencing the lowest rate of juvenile homicide arrests since 1966. Between 1994 and 1999, the arrest rate of juveniles for violent crimes, murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, dropped 36 percent.  These statistics have not eased public concern about the scope and nature of juvenile crime. One 1998 poll showed that 62 percent of those asked believed juvenile crime was increasing. A poll conducted in 1999 revealed that 71 percent thought it likely that a shooting could occur in a school in their community. In the face of these popular perceptions, the Education Department reports that American children face a one in 2 million chance of being killed in their school.  Why the disparity? There are several reasons, in my opinion. First, and probably most importantly, while arrests of juveniles are unquestionably down, juvenile crime is still too high. The incidence of the most common crime committed by juveniles, property offenses, changed little throughout the last two decades. The rate of juvenile violent crime arrests has not yet returned to its 1988 level.  Second, and this cannot be understated, too many of our kids have access to guns, and those guns are finding their way into our Nation's schools at an alarming rate. A report released last year by the Education Department revealed that over 3,500 students were expelled in 1998 and 1999 for bringing guns to school, that's an average of 88 kids per week. The juvenile arrest rate for weapons crimes fell 39 percent from 1993 to 1999, but it too has not yet returned to 1988's low point.  Third, the American people understand that crime cannot stay down forever. I like to say that fighting crime is like mowing the grass, If you don't keep at it, it's going to come back up. We have good, demographic reasons to think this is particularly true in the case of juvenile crime. Today, there are approximately 39 million children younger than age 10. These kids, the children of the baby boom generation, stand on the edge of their teen years, the years when every reliable study reveals they are most at-risk of turning to drugs and crime.  What does this mean for juvenile crime? Even if we do everything right, even if we fund programs that work, put incorrigible juveniles behind bars, crack down on gun crimes, the demographic inevitability of this so-called ``baby boomerang" means there is likely to be a 20 percent increase in juvenile murders by 2005. Such a jump would increase the overall murder rate by 5 percent. Our challenge is to make sure that does not happen.  We need to take another look at the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. That Act expired on September 30, 1996, and, despite the good efforts of several Congresses, Members on both sides of the aisle, and the prior Administration, it has not been reauthorized. We should get that job done in the 107th Congress. The bill I introduce today includes provisions to reauthorize the Act, to fine tune some of its grant provisions, and to make some common sense changes to our firearms laws, changes that respect the rights of gun owners.  My bill reauthorizes the Community Prevention Grant Program, commonly known as Title V. It funds this critical juvenile crime prevention initiative at $250,000,000 per year for the next six years and mandates that no State would receive less than $200,000 in annual prevention grants. These funding levels would more than double juvenile crime prevention funding, enough resources for localities to implement a comprehensive delinquency prevention strategy and then fund smart prevention programs that work. In Delaware, Title V funds have been used to sponsor programs to reduce school violence, provide transition counseling to students returning to their local school from alternative school placement, reduce suspensions, expulsions, truancy, and teen pregnancy, and provide services to the children of incarcerated adult offenders. Prevention is the key to keeping our juvenile crime rate down, and we need to extend Title V to guarantee that these funds continue to flow to States and localities.  The bill also reauthorizes the Formula Grant Program for the next six years at $200,000,000 per year. I have included provisions to expand the permissible uses of these funds so as to make clear that employment training, mental health treatment, and other effective programs that meet the needs of children and youth in the juvenile system could be funded. The bill reauthorizes gang prevention programs and emphasizes the disruption and prosecution of gangs. It extends the juvenile justice mentoring program, and adds a pilot program to encourage and develop mentoring initiatives that focus on entire families. The bill also includes funds for grants to States to upgrade and enhance their juvenile felony criminal record histories.  My bill includes important provisions to continue the core protections for incarcerated youths that were included in the original Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. It continues the Act's function of protecting children from abuse and assault by adults in jails by prohibiting any contact between juveniles and adult inmates. The bill ensures that children are not detained in any jail or lockup for adults, except for very limited periods of time and under very limited circumstances. And it continues current law's requirement that States address the disproportionate number of minority children in confinement.  The bill authorizes $500,000,000 per year over the next six years for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program. Funded for the past three fiscal years, this program has never been authorized. Its purpose is to strengthen State juvenile justice systems. States would receive funds as long as they implement or consider implementing graduated sanctions, though this condition can be met through a reporting requirement. The language I have included in my bill is drawn from H.R. 863, a measure which is currently working its way through the other body. I am supportive of that measure, as it will provide much needed funds for States to hire additional prosecutors, juvenile court judges, probation officers, and court-appointed defenders and special advocates. In years past, my State has used these funds to establisha Serious Juvenile Offender program through the Delaware Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services, which provides an immediate secure placement of violent youth offenders who have violated the terms of their probation. Delaware has also used these funds to expand diversionary programs such as Teen Court and Drug Court, thus reducing the time between arrest and disposition of juvenile offenders, and to add psycho-forensic evaluators in the Delaware Office of the Public Defender to identify and address mental illness as a cause for delinquent conduct. This is a good program and it needs to be authorized.  My bill also reauthorizes the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The Trust Fund, created in the 1994 Crime Bill, has been the key to our successful fight against crime over the past several years. Unfortunately, it expired in 2000. The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund was the vehicle for providing billions of dollars to State and local governments to implement a variety of law enforcement and crime-fighting initiative, from the COPS program to the Violence Against Women Act to youth violence programs. Without the Trust Fund, I fear we may not have the resources necessary to continue our struggle to keep our streets safe. I am pleased to include provisions in this bill that will extend the Fund through fiscal year 2007.  Finally, the bill I am introducing today includes several common sense gun safety provisions. First, it incorporates Senator Reed's Gun Show Background Check Act. This language will ensure that criminals cannot purchase guns at gun shows, and I applaud Senator Reed for his leadership in this area. Second, I have included Senator Kohl's Child Safety Lock Act. This moderate provision would require handguns to be sold with government-certified trigger locks. Studies indicate trigger locks save lives; I was pleased to see the Administration's endorsement of this idea in its budget request for the upcoming fiscal year; and I thank Senator Kohl for including his bill in this larger measure today. Third, the bill would extend the Brady Law to dangerous juvenile offenders. This provision would make it unlawful for any person adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for serious drug offenses or violent felonies to possess firearms. This is an important step toward getting guns out of the hands of criminals, and its enactment will prevent violent juveniles from accessing weapons and thus make it difficult for them to commit gun crimes as adults.  This is not a perfect bill, and I am not wedded to each and every line. I welcome comments from my colleagues, the juvenile justice community, and anyone interested in preventing and controlling juvenile crime. I am committed, however, to renewing our efforts to keep our children and our communities safe from crime and violence. I am committed to protecting our kids through meaningful prevention and intervention programs, to cracking down on drugs and the violence that accompanies them, and to ensuring that meaningful, appropriate and swift punishment is imposed on all juvenile offenders. I believe the Juvenile Crime Prevention and Control Act that I introduce today is an important step toward accomplishing these goals.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1165       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Gun Show Background      Check Act of 2001''.     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually      across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees      per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and      nonlicensed firearms sellers;       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and      other organized events, at which a large number of firearms      are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and      nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the      national firearms market;       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered      for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other      organized events move easily in and substantially affect      interstate commerce;       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered      for sale or exchange at a gun     show, flea market, or other organized event, the gun, its      component parts, ammunition, and the raw materials from which      it is manufactured have moved in interstate commerce;       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at      which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange,      provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at      which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often      without background checks and without records that enable gun      tracing;       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events      at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange,      criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without      background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be      traced to later commit crimes;       (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows,      flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to      attend these events and engage in the interstate      transportation of firearms obtained at these events;       (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is      exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea      markets, and other organized events;       (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been      transferred illegally to residents of another State by      Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers,      and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug      offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal      possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited      persons; and       (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce      clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United      States, to ensure, by enactment of this subtitle, that      criminals and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms      at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events.
