  Madam President, in a moment I am going to review the committee's safety recommendations in detail. But first I want to address the issue of compliance with NAFTA because it has been an issue that we have been talking about for some time.  I have heard it alleged in this Chamber that the provision that was adopted unanimously by the committee is in violation of NAFTA. I want the Senators in this Chamber to understand that nothing could be further from the truth.  I voted for NAFTA. I support free trade. My goal in this bill has always been to ensure that free trade and public safety progress side by side.  Rather than take my opinion on this issue or that of another Senator, we have a written decision by an arbitration panel that was charged with settling this very issue.  That arbitration panel was established under the NAFTA treaty. That panel's rulings decide what does and does not violate NAFTA.  I have heard many Senators say that provisions violate NAFTA or that the President should decide what violates NAFTA. In fact, I believe the amendment that is pending before the Senate says the President should decide what violates NAFTA. We do not decide that here.
