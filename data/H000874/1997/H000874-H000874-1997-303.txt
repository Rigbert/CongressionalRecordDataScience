Speaker, I rise today not to praise the men and women who have served our Nation's Armed Forces, nor enumerate the deeds and sacrifices they have made for this country. I stand today to offer my most sincere gratitude and thanks to these ordinary citizens who have been called to do extraordinary things. As Veterans Day nears, we must ask ourselves what meaning this day has for us all.  This day, formerly known as Armistice Day, was conceived to honor those brave Americans who fought and died in the First World War. In 1938, the Congress passed a law officially making November 11th a national holiday. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 16 years later in 1954, would sign legislation stating, ``to honor Veterans on the 11th day of November each year . . . a day dedicated to world peace,'' formally recognizing this day as a time to honor those who have served this country.  The 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, was the precise time which ended the First World War in 1918. That time marked the sacrifice of over 116,000 Americans who lost their lives on the battlefields of Northern France. This global war amassed more than 37 million military casualties, in addition to 10 million deaths among the civilian population. Although the horrors of war had been demonstrated to the world, an ill conceived peace from the Versailles conference, provided the impetus for a repeat of this madness with even deadlier consequences.  This day however, directly challenges those forces in the world that would break the fragile peace we now hold. And as each Veterans Day is celebrated, the fragility of that peace is strengthened and nurtured and allowed to grow; to grow with the hope that the flower it bears is not a poppy of sorrow, but rather a brilliant white rose celebrating peace.  Mr. Speaker, this day causes us all to think and reflect on the reasons why so many of our young men and women have served in our Armed Forces. For me, that answer is simple, to ensure the peace and domestic tranquility of this country. Though these words ring within the Constitution, it is that cause and that sentiment which these dedicated men and women have sworn to uphold. It is for that reason why this Nation in its vigil to maintain the peace, has helped to ensure the peace for the world and for generations of Americans to come.  War may glorify those human qualities which we hold high and dear but how much braver is the soldier standing on guard in 10 degree weather along the DMZ in Korea? How much more courageous is that maintenance personnel servicing vehicles in a lonely, isolated desert depot, or how dedicated is that medical assistant, routinely tending patients at the base health center, than their predecessors who served during wartime conditions. The sacrifices of our service members today cannot be divorced from those men and women who served in the past.  It is this common thread which holds the very fabric of the peace which shrouds our democracy and our way of life. To forget these links is to weaken the purpose and meaning of this auspicious day. The bright torch of freedom has been handed from our combat veterans to our present day service members. That torch burns brightly as a beacon to the rest of the world that we as a Nation stand ready to defend our hard earned peace.  No Nation can survive alone on the assurances of its technology or economic prowess. The willingness of our common citizenry to commit themselves to the causes of freedom and democracy are the assurances that have ensured the survival and existence of this country.  And so I ask you, Mr. Speaker, and my fellow colleagues, to join with me in not just recognizing but thanking those who have served this Nation. Our gratitude for those servicemen and women of yesterday and today is immeasurable. My simple thanks, is the sincerest form I have, to offer a group of Americans whose service has yielded us the full fruits of freedom. God bless our veterans.                          ____________________
