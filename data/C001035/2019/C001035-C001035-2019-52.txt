President, I am about to offer the managers' package for the four appropriations bills currently before us: Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Interior and the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development bill. This managers' package includes 45 amendments, many of which--indeed, most of which--have been offered on a bipartisan basis. They have been cleared by both sides.  The Appropriations Committee has worked very hard with Members to accommodate as many amendments as possible. For the T-HUD appropriations bill, for example, both Senator Jack Reed and I worked to review, approve, and clear managers' amendments in our part of the bill.  This package reflects a positive step forward as we move toward final passage of this appropriations bill. It is imperative that we move these bills and go to conference with the House. Therefore, I urge all Members to support this managers' package.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer the following amendments: Lee amendment No. 1209 and Jones amendment No. 1141, as modified. I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order to these amendments prior to the votes, and that at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, October 31, the Senate vote in relation to these amendments in the order listed.  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that upon resumption of the bill on Thursday, October 31, the following amendments be called up and agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953; Smith amendment No. 1023; Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown amendment No. 1088, as modified; Baldwin amendment No. 1099; Whitehouse amendment No. 1121; Thune amendment No. 1133; Jones amendment No. 1143; Smith amendment No. 1149; Rosen =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S6293, October 30, 2019, third column, the following appears: Finally, I ask unanimous consent that upon resumption of the bill on Thursday, October 31, the following amendments be called up and agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953; Smith amendment No. 1023; Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown amendment No. 1088, as modified; Baldwin amendment No. 1099; Murkowski amendment No. 1121; Thune amendment No. 1133; Capito amendment No. 1143; Smith amendment No. 1149; Rosen    The online Record has been corrected to read: Finally, I ask unanimous consent that upon resumption of the bill on Thursday, October 31, the following amendments be called up and agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table: Tester amendment No. 953; Smith amendment No. 1023; Hirono amendment No. 1037; Brown amendment No. 1088, as modified; Baldwin amendment No. 1099; Whitehouse amendment No. 1121; Thune amendment No. 1133; Jones amendment No. 1143; Smith amendment No. 1149; Rosen ========================= END NOTE =========================   amendment No. 1161; McSally amendment No. 1163; Reed amendment No.  1217; Stabenow amendment No. 1223; Cornyn amendment No. 1224; Warner  amendment No. 951; Capito amendment No. 1077; Cantwell amendment No.   1094; Toomey amendment No. 1129; Durbin amendment No. 1146; Gardner  amendment No. 1150; McSally amendment No. 1234; Sinema amendment No.    1025; Ernst amendment No. 1079; Ernst amendment No. 1081; Cornyn   amendment No. 1151; Cardin amendment No. 1159; Rosen amendment No.    1160; Thune amendment No. 1162; Peters amendment No. 1182; Cornyn  amendment No. 1193; Menendez amendment No. 1199; Blunt amendment No.  1211; McSally amendment No. 1215; Collins amendment No. 1220; Schumer   amendment No. 1227; Hassan amendment No. 956; Collins amendment No.   1002; Shaheen amendment No. 1005; Kaine amendment No. 1010; Cortez   Masto amendment No. 1061; Cortez Masto amendment No. 1062; Heinrich  amendment No. 1114; Shaheen amendment No. 1130; Hoeven amendment No.                  1214; and Portman amendment No. 1235.
