Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, and I shall not object, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this resolution up. This is in recognition of Senator Ted Stevens, who yesterday we laid to rest in Arlington Cemetery, for his service to the United States of America; and the Air Force at that time, flying for the Flying Tigers; receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross; serving in the Senate for 40 years; and serving this Nation with great honor. This is just a small tribute to his service to the great State of Alaska by naming a mountain and actually a glacier field after Ted Stevens and the great efforts he did for the State of Alaska.  It is an honor to have this done tonight, and I thank the gentleman for bringing this legislation up, and I thank the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
