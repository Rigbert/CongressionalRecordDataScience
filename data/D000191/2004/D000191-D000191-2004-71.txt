Speaker, last week the independent 9/11 Commission said it found ``no credible evidence to substantiate the charge that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Iraq and 9/11. We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States.'' Yet, 2 days later, Vice President Cheney said that, in fact, that was not true, that there were long established ties with al Qaeda.  Now, of course, Vice President Cheney has quite a distinguished record as Vice President. He was the gentleman of 3 years ago said during the energy crisis in the western United States that those of us who thought there was market manipulation were really pretty stupid, and this was just market forces at work and there was no manipulation of the market. And Enron was a wonderful and upstanding company. Of course, now Enron officials, one after another, are going to jail, and hopefully Ken Lay will be criminally indicted this week. But the Vice President waxed eloquent there as he did here.  He also has said that deficits do not matter despite the fact we will borrow $700 billion against our future and obligate Americans for generations to pay that money back. He says that does not matter perhaps because his tax policy that he and the President envision says that only wage earners and salary earners will repay that and the wealthy and those that you normally associate with and corporations will not pay. But, nonetheless, he said again trying to raise the old saw about this relationship perhaps because although he told us that he knew exactly where the weapons of mass destruction were, he failed to point any of the U.S. troops, the inspectors or anybody who has been in Iraq for the last year and a half to that exact spot where he knew those weapons were located.  So it is a continuing attempt at obfuscation. The one thing they point to does have a kernel of truth, and they point to terrorist Abu Musab Zarqawi. He is a really bad guy. He has been behind more than 700 terrorist killings in Iraq it is estimated, a mastermind.  In June 2002, the United States intelligence service located Mr. Zarqawi and they said he had set up a weapons lab in Kirma, in northern Iraq. He was producing ricin and cyanide. The Pentagon drafted plans and asked the Bush administration to take out Mr. Zarqawi. The Bush administration said no.  Then we went 4 months later, and this is all from a report by Jim Miklaszewski, a correspondent for NBC news. Four months later, Intelligence showed that Zarqawi was planning to use the ricin in attacks in Europe. The Pentagon drew up a second strike plan. The White House again killed it. This is a quote from a former national security member, ``People were more obsessed with developing the coalition to overthrow Saddam than to execute the President's policy of preemption against terrorists.''  Then finally the threat turned real in January. Mr. Zarqawi's group, a number of them were arrested in London and they had a ricin lab which was directly connected to the lab in northern Iraq. This was a part of the country Saddam Hussein did not control. The Kurds controlled that area undercover of U.S. air power. So Saddam Hussein did not control this area. And, again, the United States flew over it every day. In fact, we might remember that Colin Powell famously pointed to it when he made his presentation to the National Security Council and said there are terrorists in this camp training in an area where we control the air space and we fly over it every day. But we did not take it out.  And because the Bush administration was more obsessed with building its coalition of the willing, worried that countries some of those the new Europe might fall off from our coalition, those who sent five, ten, or 15 troops to the coalition, if we took out this terrorist camp, they did not do it. And U.S. troops and many others have died because this administration failed to take out that terrorist camp on the three occasions when the Pentagon asked them to do it because they were so obsessed with pursuing a war against Saddam Hussein and his non existent weapons of mass destruction. Now, he was a bad guy in the world and we are well quit of him, hopefully permanently quit of him soon.  But the point is when this administration turned its eyes away from al Qaeda, and turned its eyes away from the terrorists, and refused to take out Zarqawi, they were making a grave error and people have died because of that error.                          ____________________
