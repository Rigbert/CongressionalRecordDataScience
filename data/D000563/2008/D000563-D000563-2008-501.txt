President, in my brief period of time, I wish to address two issues. One relates to a topic that is important across America. Another relates to the pending legislation.  The first topic is the issue of the price of gasoline. I don't need to show this chart to people to remind them what is happening. Beginning with the Bush administration when the President was sworn into office, the average price for a gallon of gasoline was $1.47. As of June 9, the average price across America was $4.04, the most dramatic increase in the price of gasoline in our history. It is a situation which has called for analysis and attention because no matter where we go--in Illinois, Ohio, in any State--people say: Senator, what are you going to do about these gas prices? They are killing us.  They go to the gasoline stations, the service stations, pull out their credit cards and cash, and cannot believe how much it costs. It is not just an inconvenience for many people, it is a hardship. For some, they have had to make family budget decisions because they cannot afford to keep the tank full, and many do not have an option. If they are from my part of the world in downstate Illinois, there are not that many buses outside the cities. There is no mass transit. What are you going to do? You moved out into the country to get a home you can afford. You commute to a job spending an hour each way to work. And now filling that gas tank takes so much of your paycheck, so you have to cut back in other areas or borrow more deeply, finding your credit card balance growing and your ability to reckon with it diminishing. That is the reality of where we are today.  Obviously, people across America say: Well, Senators, what are you going to do about it? You were elected, weren't you, to do something about the issues and challenges facing our country?  So this week we came to the floor and said: Let's debate it. Let's put our best efforts to work. Let's debate a bill that may help and amend it and try to come up with some way to deal with the energy crisis facing America.  On Tuesday, we took this vote. We needed 60 out of 100 Senators to vote to start the debate--60 out of 100. When the final count was in, all the Democrats voted for it, six or seven Republicans joined us, and we were still about nine votes short of what we needed. The motion to proceed failed.  At that point, we couldn't even debate the most serious issue facing families and businesses across America. That is unfortunate. All we needed were nine more Republicans to join us to start the debate. That is all we wanted to do--start the debate. Maybe we would have agreed on something. Wouldn't that be newsworthy.  But as it stands, we had two votes on Tuesday, we tried to proceed to bills, and in both instances, the Republican minority said: No, we don't want to debate anything on the floor of the Senate this week. And that is exactly what we have done. We have debated nothing.  If Members of the Senate were paid for the votes they cast, this Senate this week has not earned a minimum wage. I don't know how we can continue to do this in what is euphemistically called the world's greatest deliberative body. Mr. President, do you know what the problem was? One of the provisions in our bill angered the Republicans. We suggested that the oil companies, if they are going to charge these outrageous amounts for their products, should be subject to a higher tax for windfall profits. I support that. I think it is the right thing to do, to discourage the profit taking that is going on. Many Republicans oppose it, and I don't question their motives on it. Isn't it worth debating? Isn't it worth a vote? At the end of the day somebody wins and somebody loses. That is what happens on the floor of the Senate. But on the Republican side, they stopped us from even going to that debate over the oil companies.  Surely, they must hear from their voters at home how bad the situation is. I know they hear from the oil company lobbyists who are roaming these hallways that they need to be protected.  Let's take a look and see how the oil companies have been doing. Not bad. Starting in 2001 when President Bush arrived on the scene, this is an indication of the profits of the oil companies. Profits of the oil companies under this administration have gone up 400 percent.  Some of the numbers are startling. In 2006, profits reported by ExxonMobil were $39.5 billion, the largest recorded profit in U.S. history. Listen to that. Not the largest recorded profit by an oil company; the largest reported profit by any business in the history of the United States of America.  Come 2007, ExxonMobil broke its own record. Profits went up to $40.6 billion; the annual salary for their CEO, $21.7 million. A retirement package for ExxonMobil's previous CEO--job well done--no gold watch for this man, a gold mine, $400 million as his farewell gift. What a great party that must have been to say thanks for all the good work you have done for ExxonMobil. Here is $400 million. Have a nice day.  People across America are not having a nice day. When they pull into an Exxon station, when they fill up theirgas tank, it is a bad day, it is a tough day for a lot of American families.  The total combined net profits of the big five oil companies under this administration are $556 billion. How much money did they invest back into more oil wells, more production? About an 80-percent increase in their capital investment, a 300-percent increase in the cash they held back to buy back stock and improve their profitability--not improve their productivity, their profitability.  Investments in alternative fuels by these big five oil companies? Negligible. That is the reality.  I think that is worth a debate, don't you? Isn't that what the Senate is supposed to be about? We come in and say it is time for this to end, it is time for Americans to stop being taken to the cleaners by the oil companies, and it is time for them to pay higher taxes to discourage them from profit taking. I support that position. Others oppose it.  On Tuesday, the Republicans said: No, there will be no debate. And that is the end of the story, at least for this week. We will go home and the voters will ask the same question: What did the Senate do about oil prices, gas prices this week? And the honest answer is nothing.  This is not the first time we faced this filibuster. The Republican filibusters so far in this 2-year session, 75 Republican filibusters and still counting--75. To put it in perspective, a filibuster is when you delay or stop debate on an issue, delay or stop a bill, an amendment, a nomination. It is your right in the Senate to do that. But people were careful not to abuse it in the past.  In the history of the Senate, the largest number of filibusters in any 2-year period of time was 57. So far in this session, with another 6 or 7 months to go, the Republicans have initiated 75 filibusters, 75 attempts to stop progress in the Senate, to stop debate in the Senate, to stop us from moving forward on bills related to everything under the Sun. They even went so far as to filibuster a technical corrections bill. These are the bills that go in and take a hard look and see, oh, we forgot the punctuation or there is a reference that needs to be changed slightly. It is the kind of housekeeping you do when you have huge pieces of legislation, where even though staff works hard and the Members work hard, they miss something. So the technical corrections bill came up, we thought this would be easy, so let's get this over with, but it took a week because we faced a filibuster on it. They wanted to filibuster a technical corrections bill. That doesn't take us to where we need to go as a nation.  We at least owe the American people a healthy, spirited, fair, and open debate on the issue when it comes to this energy crisis. We can't get it in this Senate. We have been stopped. A 51-to-49 Senate does not allow us to come up with the 60 votes we need to move the debate forward. Well, the final vote will be in the hands of the voters of America on November 4. They will decide whether they want change in this town and change in this Chamber; whether they want to elect some people who will come, roll up their sleeves, and get down to work.  We have a lot of things to do in this country--an energy crisis, global warming, carbon pollution, a health care crisis, two wars, a looming recession, and the bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. We don't need more filibusters. We need more work right here in the Senate. I hope we can return to that after the next election, or maybe, if there is a miracle, even next week, if the minority party decides that is what will happen.                                Medicare  Mr. President, we are debating a motion to proceed, once again, to a bipartisan bill to help Medicare. It has the support of AARP, the American Medical Association, and lots of others. It picks up where we left off in December, when we passed a bill that was a short-term fix. We bought 6 months then, and we are back again.  The bill we are considering prevents physicians from facing a 10.6-percent cut in Medicare payments on July 1, and gives them a 1.1-percent payment increase for 2009. The physicians who work under Medicare will also receive a 2-percent bonus, if they participate in a program to reduce the number of errors and improve the quality of their service, called the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. It is a responsible way to avoid a severe cut in payments to physicians and to ensure payments are adequate for the next 18 months.  As important as it is to ensure that our physicians are paid adequately for the good work they do for millions of Americans--some 40 million Americans covered by Medicare--we didn't want this bill to just be a doctor fix. The bill contains a lot of changes in Medicare that will help beneficiaries.  The Medicare Savings Programs provide financial assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries who can't afford Medicare's premiums, copayments, and deductibles. Many low-income beneficiaries are excluded from this assistance because they have accumulated modest savings. These are retired people, by and large.  Today, if you have assets of more than $4,000, $6,000 for couples, you can't qualify for Medicare Savings Programs. We haven't changed that number for almost 20 years--$4,000. Under the bill before us, the asset limit will roughly double, providing real assistance to those who don't have much money and still need Medicare.  This bill, which the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus, brings to us, also makes an important move toward mental health parity. It is hard to imagine it has been more than 5 years, almost 6 years since Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash. What a great guy. What a great Senator. His heart was there for so many issues but especially when it came to mental health issues because his family was touched by this challenge. Paul Wellstone used to ask: Why don't we treat mental illness like an illness, instead of a curse? Why don't we treat mental illness like a physical illness when it comes to health insurance? He worked on us and worked on the issue and Senator Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, joined him to make it a bipartisan effort.  I am sorry to say that some 6 years later, we haven't passed that Wellstone-Domenici bill. Senator Kennedy was working on it before he had his problems. I hope we can return to it. This bill takes a modest step forward in that debate.  Over the years, our understanding of mental health and the ways to treat it have grown, but Medicare continues to discriminate against services for those who are mentally ill by imposing a 50-percent cost-sharing requirement compared to 20 percent for most other services. This bill phases out that higher copayment over 6 years. It is a step in the right direction.  We have made some progress in recent years, adding preventive health services to Medicare, such as screenings for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, but it literally requires an act of Congress to add a new preventive benefit. The Baucus bill will make it easier to add preventive services to Medicare. It would create a process for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to add them, if recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  We also address market abuses in this bill. There is a program called Medicare Advantage. Private health insurance companies love it. You know why. They make a bundle off these programs. They sell them to seniors, and they charge more than 12 percent over basic Medicare premiums. Frankly, I happen to believe they do not show the results for their effort, and they are involved in some marketing practices which we have to try our best to curb.  Seniors are vulnerable. You know as well as I do that many people who reach their elderly years don't have someone at hand to give them good advice, and many times, frankly, they sign up for things they shouldn't. This bill addresses disturbing reports of abusive and fraudulent sales-and-marketing practices by Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare drug plans. Medicare beneficiaries have been enrolling in private plans they didn't understand, and many of them have faced outright fraud and exploitation by these Medicare Advantage companies. This bill will rein that in.  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a man I respect and like, is going to offer an alternative to our bill, which I have described, but it doesn't provide assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. It doesn't deal with mental health parity, and it doesn't ease the process of adding preventive services.  There are many other provisions in this bill. It has been long overdue, and a lot of people have asked us to take up this bill because Medicare is so important at a time when people are losing their health insurance coverage. For the seniors and disabled who count on Medicare, this bill is important. But we need 60 votes. I hope we will get 60 votes. I hope we don't face another filibuster on this critically important bill.  This is something that should pass. This bill is balanced, it provides needed improvements to Medicare, but it is responsible. We fully offset any cost to the Treasury, primarily by reducing overpayments in the private Medicare Advantage plans, which are paid 13 percent--I said 12 percent earlier, but it is 13 percent--more than it would cost to cover someone in traditional Medicare.  I think it is responsible. Rather than adding new costs to Medicare and to the deficit, we pay for it. Pay as you go. In the old days, that used to be called being a fiscal conservative. The other side of the aisle used to be very proud to say they were fiscally conservative. Now, ironically, the table is turned. In fact, it is turned upside down. The Democrats are calling for fiscal conservatism--pay as you go, don't add to the deficit, be responsible--and the Republicans--some--are saying no. I hope they do not prevail. I hope we can prevail with a paid-for bill.  It is a bipartisan bill. Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Smith have joined Senator Baucus. I am going to support it, and I hope all my colleagues do when it comes up for a vote later this afternoon.  I yield the floor.
