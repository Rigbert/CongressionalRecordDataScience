President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative United States postage stamp should be issued to promote public awareness of Down syndrome and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued. I am honored to be joined by Senator Cornyn in this effort.  Down syndrome is a genetic condition usually caused by an error in cell division called non-disjunction. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person may have, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of the number 21 chromosome present in all, or some, of their cells. This additional genetic material alters the course of development and causes the characteristics associated with the syndrome.  Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality, occurring once out of every 800 to 1,000 births. In the United States, more than 350,000 people have Down syndrome. Nearly 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each year. Because the mortality rate connected with Down syndrome is decreasing, the number of individuals with Down syndrome in our society is increasing. Some experts predict that the prevalence of individuals with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 years, further increasing the need for public acceptance and education about this genetic condition.  I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this meaningful resolution and assist our efforts to convince the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to recommend the issuance of a postage stamp promoting public awareness of Down syndrome.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1508       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senate Campaign Disclosure      Parity Act''.     SEC. 2.

(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to any designation, statement, or report required      to be filed after the date of enactment of this Act.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I am proud to join my friend Senator Feingold as a co-sponsor of legislation that will require Senate candidates to file campaign finance reports in electronic form. This bill will finally remove the exemption the Senate has given itself from an important requirement of campaign finance disclosure laws that apply to everyone else, including candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and Political Action Committees (PACs).  Political committees active in Federal elections must submit their quarterly financial reports for disclosure by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Anyone interested can nearly instantaneously download the reports from the FEC website and conduct computer searches to learn about the contributions and expenditures of individual candidates for the House, non-Senate national party committees and PACs. The current problem is that they cannot do the same for Senate candidates and parties because of the Senate's insistence on paper rather than electronic filing. The FEC must do more processing of Senate paper reports than of House electronic ones. This involves printing or copying the Senate reports, up to 10,000 pages a day at times, hand-coding transactions that cannot be automatically processed, the keypunching the data into the electronic database. House electronic reports do not need the same treatment. The end result is that in contrast to the House, information from the Senate paper reports are often not available until well after the election has occurred.  Because of this problem, it is impossible for voters to be well-informed about the campaign finance information of their Senators and Senate candidates. If a voter wants to consider the nature of the campaign finance support received by a Senate candidate and compare that support to Senate legislative votes as a factor in deciding for whom they will cast a vote, they simply cannot do so due to the antiquated nature of the reporting system.  To address this problem, our legislation requires Senate candidates to file their campaign finance reports electronically with the Secretary of the Senate. Within 24 hours of receipt of those reports, the Secretary is required to forward those reports to the FEC. The FEC, in turn is required to make those reports available on the Internet within 24 hours as they do other reports. Therefore, electronic versions of Senate reports will be available to the public within 48 hours of their filing.  Electronic reports are not only transmitted instantly but are more accurate than paper submissions because software can easily correct mistakes. On the other hand, hand entering of data is always prone to error. Furthermore, the data in electronic reports can be rapidly searched via the Internet for answers to specific questions. Voters will no longer have to go through the time consuming process of reading pages and pages filed by Senate candidates or Senate party committees to figure out the major donors and their employers, and the major recipients of campaign spending. Instead, they can downlown a filed report from the FEC website onto their personal computers and quickly locate the information they need. This creates effective public disclosure.  The Senate's current failure to provide its constituents with electronically disclosed, timely information is unconscionable. Senate filings should follow the same criteria as other campaign finance reports. There must not be a separate standard for the Senate. Ironically, while they do not currently file electronically, Senators and Senate candidates already use electronic software in compiling their paper reports. If Senators and Senate candidates can use technology to run their offices and websites, why can't they use it to better inform their own constituents about how their campaigns are funded? Our constituents have a right to that information.                                 ______                                       By
