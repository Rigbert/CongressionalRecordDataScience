 President, today I rise to commemorate my very dear friend, Mr. Bill Swope of Elizabethtown, KY, for his many successes in business and in life. Mr. Swope has made many contributions to philanthropy and his local community, and has affirmed a commitment to public service on behalf of the Commonwealth while setting an example for his family and others of what it means to be a distinguished citizen.  I have been very closely acquainted with Bill Swope, his brother Sam, and the rest of their family for quite some time. Bill was born in 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford, OH, with a degree in business administration. Bill served in the U.S. Army during World War II as a sergeant specializing in artillery. He recently received the French Legion of Honor in 2009, and is now considered a knight of the French Republic.  His wife Betty was a lieutenant, junior grade, in the Navy WAVES before she married Bill on July 26, 1945. According to Bill, the couple's long-lasting relationship is because Bill has always remembered who holds the higher rank--and it isn't him.  The first business venture of Mr. Swope was established in 1952 in Winchester, KY; it was called Swope Motor Company Plymouth-Dodge. There were many doubts about the future of the young company in its beginnings, but the Swope family business survived and thrives. This year marks the 60th year of the family business. Bill is now retired has left the running of the business to his three sons Carl, Bob, and Dick.  The first generation of Swopes laid the foundation of the business. The second generation is now in charge and makes sure the business runs smoothly. One thing both generations can agree on is that the company needs to remain a local, family-run enterprise. Bill is excited about the next 60 years in the automotive industry, and he is the first to tell you how proud he is of the three generations of Swopes' leadership.  Mr. Swope has been involved in a tremendous amount of volunteer activities, charities, and leadership roles throughout the years. He has been an active member of the Lion's Club since 1952, a deacon, elder and trustee of First Presbyterian Church in Elizabethtown, KY, and the past presidentof the Fort Knox Chapter, Association of the United States Army in Fort Knox, KY. As a former member of the Elizabethtown City Council, he holds his community very dear to his heart. He has made sure to give back to the place he calls home in just about every way possible.  If you ever have the chance to sit down and talk with Bill Swope, you would quickly learn his passion for cars. Starting a company that has sold over 500,000 automobiles is just the beginning of his immersion in the industry. Bill likes to collect and restore antique and classic cars. Over the years he has become so good at this that in 1999, he opened Swope's Cars of Yesteryear Museum in Elizabethtown, KY. The museum is open Monday through Saturday, and admission is free. The attraction houses every type of classic car you could imagine, and people from around the world have made a trip to the Commonwealth just to take a look.  Bill is very proud of his accomplishments in the business world, not because of the success he himself acquired, but for the opportunities he has helped to provide for so many other Kentuckians. Bill is a sensitive and thoughtful individual, and a natural-born leader. And he is first and foremost a loyal family man, a husband, father, foster-father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.  Bill is a joy to be around, he has a great sense of humor, and he always knows how to make you smile. He is an instrumental part of the economy of Hardin County, he is a vital part of the success of the State of Kentucky, and I am proud to say he is my good friend. I extend to him my heartiest congratulations on his lifetime of accomplishments, and I look forward to his future endeavors, wherever they may lie.  I would like to ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in paying tribute to all Bill Swope has achieved for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  An article was recently published in Hardin County's local newspaper, the News-Enterprise, which highlights the life of Mr. Bill Swope, and also follows Bill as he looks back on over 60 years of success in the private sector. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:               [From the News-Enterprise, Jan. 29, 2012]                 Swopes Celebrate 60 Years in Business                           (By Sarah Bennet)       Nearly 60 years ago in March of 1952, Swope Dodge-Plymouth      was celebrating its grand opening at the corner of College      and Mulberry streets. The dealership already had been open      for a couple months, but people crammed into the one-car      showroom for the event.       As Bill Swope remembers, two competitors, Buick and Pontiac      dealers, were there that day and were overheard to make the      following exchange: ``I'll give them six months,'' one dealer      said about Bill Swope and his brother Sam.       The other replied, ``I think you're being pretty      generous.''       This year marks 60 years in business for Elizabethtown's      Swope Family of Dealerships and Louisville's Sam Swope Auto      Group.       Combined, the two Swope businesses have sold more than      500,000 automobiles, Bill said.       ``We're kind of proud of that,'' the 89-year-old said      during a phone interview.       ``We think the 60 years have given us pretty good practice,      and we're pretty well set for the next 60 years,'' he said.       Today, Bill is retired and his sons are managing the family      business. Bob, 64, is president of Bob Swope Ford, while      Carl, 54, is president and CEO of Swope Family of      Dealerships. Their brother, Dick, is CEO of Sam Swope Auto      Group.       As the second generation closes out the family's first 60      years, Carl said the ``dynamic third generation'' is getting      involved with the business, which will continue to be a      local, family-owned company.       ``As the successive generations get involved, there's more      of them,'' Carl Swope said. ``There's certainly an increased      capacity to do things. We're very excited about the next 60      years and think that the growth of the family business will      be even more fantastic than what we've seen.''       ``I think that's very important,'' Bill added about keeping      the Swope Family of Dealerships both local and family-owned.      ``We're very proud of our family. Our family seems to be      well-adapted to the automobile industry. We're very proud of      the products that we're selling and certainly of the people      that we have, our associates, that help make our business      successful.''       But as the Swope men point out, the 60 years in business      hasn't been a cake walk. The automobile industry has had its      ups and downs throughout the years, and in January 1966, the      Swope's second location at the corner of St. John Road and      U.S. 31W burned down.       The building was a total loss, and the Elizabethtown Swope      dealership was without a home for nearly 12 months.       ``We ran an ad in the paper at the time--a picture of the      building totally destroyed,'' Bill said. ``Here it is, winter      time. I'm standing in the rubble of the building and there's      still smoke billowing up from the ashes. We ran a full-page      ad and the headline of that ad was, Low overhead? We have no      overhead.'''       But, somehow, with help from some competitors and their      hard-working employees, the Swope family stayed in business,      he said, and they began building where the Swope Chrysler-     Dodge-Jeep-Ram building is today.       ``January to December 1966, we were kind of operating out      of the backseat of our cars and out of briefcases and various      stalls that were loaned to our technicians,'' Bill said. ``We      moved out to what was then out in the country, and we dubbed      that part of Dixie `The Miracle Mile.' It wasn't much of a      miracle at the time, but we thought it would be. Certainly it      has turned out that way.''       Asked about the recent downturn in the automobile industry,      the Swopes stay optimistic.       Americans love their automobiles and will always need a way      to travel from Point A to Point B, they say. That fact always      will remain true regardless of how cars evolve in the future.       ``Over that 60 years, we've seen a number of ups and downs      in our industry,'' Bob Swope said, ``and we certainly learned      to make adjustments that were necessary for getting through      those slow periods. It seems like each time we've experienced      slow periods, the industry then comes back very robust.''       The recent downturn was difficult for the entire industry,      Carl said, but the Swope family made it through without      making any layoffs.       ``I would give a lot of credit to our associates for how      they responded to (the downturn),'' he said. ``Our people      rose to the occasion. They became more efficient and      effective in what they do.''       Bob said over the years the Swope Family of Dealerships has      developed a culture in its stores that values its associates      and makes them part of the family, a business practice that      has contributed to the company's longevity.       ``One of the things that we learned very early on was to      make sure our associates were also very happy with their      working experience,'' he said. ``So we work very hard to try      to make sure that they feel like they're just an extended      part of the family.''       In 2011, the Swopes were up 20 percent compared to the      previous year, Carl said, partially because of activity at      Fort Knox. The Hardin County locations sold 4,538 retail      vehicles, which was ``a pretty steady mix'' of both used and      new cars.       Combined, the Elizabethtown and Louisville locations sold      more than 22,000 vehicles in 2011, he said.       As they celebrate 60 years in business, the Swope family is      expanding. Later this year, the business will hold grand      openings for a new Nissan dealership as well as the expansion      of its museum, which is one of Bill's projects.       Bill referred to it as a tribute to the Hardin County      community and the customers who have supported the Swope      family over the years. Open each Monday through Saturday,      admission is free.       Reminiscing about the early years in the business, Bill      recalled one of the first business deals he and Sam made in      January 1952, not long after they opened the Swope Dodge-     Plymouth doors for the first time. An Elizabethtown cab      company, Dixie Cab, wanted to increase its fleet.       ``So one of the first orders we got was a big order,'' he      said. ``They increased their fleet from two cabs to three,      which is 50 percent. That was one of our first sales, and it      was a Plymouth Cranbrook for Dixie Cab.''       Bill recently located a 1952 Plymouth Cranbrook with some      15,000 miles on it which he plans to detail.       ``You don't see many of those anymore,'' he said. ``You      will see that car parked out in front of the museum when it      is completed.''                          ____________________
