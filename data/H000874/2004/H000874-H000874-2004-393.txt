 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 for morning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and a final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. We plan to consider H.R. 339, the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act. In addition, we plan to consider H.R. 3717, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do not plan to have votes next Friday, March 12. I will be happy to answer any questions that the gentleman from Maryland has.
