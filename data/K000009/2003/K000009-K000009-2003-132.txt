Speaker, tonight I wish to place on the record my deepening concerns about America's global alliances. A few weeks ago, it was with shock and dismay that I observed our President purposely fail to extend congratulations to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on his reelection. The President's behavior was inappropriate and damaging. Germany has stood as our Nation's most cooperative ally for over 50 years as our nations rebuilt Europe, weathered the Cold War and linked our economies with shared democratic values and a rule of law.  NATO has stood as the bulwark against the most awful forms of tyranny and repression. NATO is not the ``Old Europe,'' in Secretary Rumsfeld's poorly chosen words. It is the democratic, dependable Europe that has withstood the test of time. It is the modern Europe that has always stood at America's side.  I have been blessed to live through an era when President John F. Kennedy stood at the Brandenburg Gate, when Berlin was a divided city between the forces of freedom and repression, to proclaim for freedom-loving people everywhere, ``Ich bin ein Berliner.''  For the vast majority of Americans of this post-World War II period, we express to the German people and their government profound gratitude for your alliance with America, your sister Republic.                              {time}  1915  Never before in my 20 years in Congress have I felt compelled to place a call to the German Embassy to offer my congratulations to the German Chancellor, as well as the congratulations of all Americans of goodwill to the Chancellor. Indeed, it is no secret that Germany has dispatched its own peacekeeping forces to Afghanistan to help secure the first bloody tranche of peace, a most dangerous and difficult assignment.  So, tonight, I want again to formally thank the Chancellor, the members of the Bundestag, and the German people for their resolve and enduring friendship with America. I thank the Bundestag, as well, for their ongoing exchange with our Congress.  Despite reckless White House rhetoric, Germany's ties to America are deep and growing. Then this past month, we witnessed the Bush administration publicly humiliate France. France too has suffered and suffers as a result of terrorism. They know a great deal about terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, let me remind the American people how essential France was to the establishment of our own independent Nation. During the Revolutionary War, the French forces allied with our Continental revolutionaries, and they were indispensable to our victory over the British crown. French General Marquis de Lafayette was dispatched by General George Washington to rout out the British forces. About 5,500 French soldiers, led by Lieutenant Jean Rochambeau, drove the British from New York; and ultimately, the French and American forces were victorious at Yorktown. Mr. Speaker, 5,500 French troops in those days was a huge commitment by the nation of France. Our Republic owes much to France and the people of France, and I wish to thank them tonight in their own words.  Donc, ce soir je voudrais exprimer mon gratitude profonde envers le President Chirac et envers le parlement francais de leur alliance durable avec notre pays et avec l'OTAN. Je voudrais aussi offrir de respect au ministre de l'Etranger de la France, Dominique de Villipin--je ne veux absolument pas le chatier. Le monde civilise ne peut pas encore savoir la meilleure methode pour endiguer le terrorisme grandissant qui est engendre par la ferveur revolutionnaire trouvee au Moyen-Orient et a l'Asie Centrale. Mais je suis certaine d'une chose: nous ne reussirons pas sans nos allies historiques et valables en l'Europe--ni face a leur opposition. La guerre doit etre la derniere ressource, apres que les inspections raisonnables executees par les agents de l'ONU auront epuise.  Je veu parler des rapports entre les gouvernements de la France et des Etats-Unis et entre les citoyens de nos pays. Notre amitie est importante et historique, et date des jours ou le general Lafayette nous aidait pendant notre guerre de l'independance. Meme notre capitale, la ville de Washington, a ete dessine par un francais, Pierre L'Enfant, et a pris modele sur la ville de Paris. Les mots de la revolution francaise--liberte, egalite, fraternite--restent vrais aujourd'hui et dans notre congres, ils sont vraiment graves pour toujours.       (English translation of the above statement is as follows:)  Our friendship is important and historic, and dates from the days when General Lafayette helped us during our war for independence. Even our capital, the city of Washington, was designed by a Frenchman, Pierre L'Enfant, and was modeled after Paris. The words of the French revolution--liberty, equality, brotherhood--remain true today and in our Congress, they are truly carved for all time. U.S. President and U.S. ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson wrote,  ``I do not believe war the most certain means of enforcing principles. Those peaceable coercions which are in the power of every nation, if undertaken in concert and in time of peace, are more likely to produce the desired effect.''--Thomas Jefferson to Robert Livingston, 1801.
