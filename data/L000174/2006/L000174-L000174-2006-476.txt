President, I would note to the distinguished chairman, one of the reasons I agreed to this schedule, to come here and do this debate now, was that there would be a vote now. I am going to be off the Hill for a period of time around dinnertime, and I would like to be here to vote on my own amendment. Could we agree on a time certain, like 5:30, for the tabling motion on the Leahy-Coleman-Sununu amendment?
