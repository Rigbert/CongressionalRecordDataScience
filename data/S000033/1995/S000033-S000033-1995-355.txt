 As both the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Bonior] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens] have said, it is very clear we need to raise the minimum wage; $4.25 does not make it. We need to raise the minimum wage.  The President has come out with a proposal raising it 90 cents over 2 years. I think that is the minimum we should do, but we have to move quickly and raise the minimum wage.  The gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens] has been talking about a very, very important issue. He points out we have billions of people who are unemployed. We have an infrastructure in this country that is crumbling. It makes no sense at all not to invest in our infrastructure, put over a million people to work rebuilding our physical and human infrastructure through a federally funded jobs program. We need to move in that direction.  I think we four are in agreement that one of the reasons that the standard of living of working people is in decline has to do with our trade policy, which seems to be exporting jobs rather than product. We now have $150 billion in trade deficits this year which could equate to some 3 million jobs. Many of us in Congress are concerned about the impact of the NAFTA, GATT, most-favored-nation status with China. We want a fair trade policy, one that does not force American workers to compete against Chinese workers who make 20 cents an hour or the desperate people of Mexico who make $1 an hour.                              {time}  2300  Further, at a time when there are some people who are talking about cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid, most of us believe that it is absolutely insane now that the cold war is over to be talking about a $50 billion increase in military spending. We are now spending $100 billion a year defending Europe and Asia, and many of the countries in Europe are now wealthier than we are. Against whom? Whom? One hundred billion dollars a year. We must cut military spending, reinvest in America.  And I think the last two points that I would make, and this chart deals with one of them, the Republicans have been very successful in making everybody antitax. The real question that we should be asking is, who is paying the taxes, who gets the tax breaks?  Many of us support a tax cut for middle-income people. But we do think that the wealthiest people in this country who have gotten wealthier, we think that in terms of the corporate income tax, what you can see from this chart is that the percentage, the contribution, the corporations are making to the Federal coffers have declined precipitously over the last 50 years, and that means middle-income people are making up the difference. We want to make a progressive tax.
