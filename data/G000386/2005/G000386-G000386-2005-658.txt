 President, today I want to pay tribute to the life of Jesse Nichols, Sr., who passed away on February 22, 2005. Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., faithfully served the U.S. Senate for over 30 years. He was the first African American Clerk employed by the U.S. Senate.  Jesse Nichols was born on June 14, 1909, in Clarksdale, MS. He began his service when the late Pat Harrison of Mississippi was the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee--the committee I am now privileged to chair.  Jesse was appointed as a messenger for the Finance Committee in 1936, and was elevated about 6 months later to assistant clerk of the Committee. At that time, the staff of the Finance Committee numbered only three.  In 1967, on the occasion of his thirtieth anniversary on the Senate staff, several members of the Finance Committee, led by Delaware Republican John J. Williams, rose in the Senate chamber to pay tribute to Jesse Nichols who had ``earned the respect of those former giants of the Senate, each of whom was proud to call him a friend.''  Senator Williams added that:       It is refreshing to meet a man who throughout the years has      served the Senate and his country with but one thought in      mind, and that is, to do his job to the best of his ability,      always remembering that as a Government employee he is a      servant of the people.  Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen added his endorsement, noting that:       Thirty years of faithful and devoted service certainly      deserves to be taken account of in the proceedings of this      body.  An oral history interview conducted by the Senate Historical Office from March 26 to April 12, 1994, is available on the Senate Web site.
