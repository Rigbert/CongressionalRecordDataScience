 I would like to comment on a couple of other things. In addition to the letter that was sent by the Joint Chiefs, here is a letter that was sent to thePresident last July by 24 of the Nation's most distinguished retired four-star ground combatant commanders, including a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former supreme allied commander, Secretary of State, six former combatants of the Marine Corps, two former Chiefs of Staff of the Army, two recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor and four service Vice Chiefs of Staff.  This is what they said. A month ago this letter was received by the President:       Studies suggest that U.S. allied casualties may be      increased by as much as 35 percent if self-destructing mines      are unavailable, particularly in the halting phase--  The halting phase, we are talking about should the North Koreans come down south of the DMZ, we would have a phase where we would not be as prepared.  They said:       --particularly in the halting phase of operations against      aggressors. Such a cost is especially unsupportable since the      type of mines utilized by U.S. forces and the manner in which      they are employed by those forces do not contribute to the      humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative      initiatives to ban APLs.  I find it difficult right now in light of what happened this last week, in terms of the missiles that were launched from North Korea and the accuracy of those missiles with two phases, that we can question whether or not there is a threat out there.  These are the words that came from 24 of the Nation's most distinguished retired four-star ground combatant officers.  They went on to say:       Unfortunately, a ban on future deployment of APLs will in      no way diminish the danger imposed by tens of millions of      dumb landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where they      inflict terror and devastation on civilian populations. Only      the United States military and those of other law-abiding      nations will be denied a means through the use of marked or      monitored mine fields of reducing the costs and increasing      the probability of victory in future conflicts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the letter from the retired generals dated July 21, 1997, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  An Open Letter to President Clinton                                                    July 21, 1997.     Hon. William Clinton,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our strong      opposition to U.S. participation in any international      agreement that would prohibit the defensive use by American      forces of modern, self-destructing anti-personnel landmines      (APLs) and/or the use of so-called ``dumb mines'' in the      Korean demilitarized zone. In our experience, such      responsible use of APLs is not only consistent with the      Nation's humanitarian responsibilities; it is indispensable      to the safety of our troops in many combat and peacekeeping      situations.       We are also concerned about the implications of legislation      that would unilaterally deny the U.S. military the ability to      deploy any kind of anti-personnel landmines (except command-     detonated Claymores and, provisionally, those in the Korean      DMZ). We agree with the Joint Chiefs of Staff who have--as      stated by their Chairman, General John Shalikashvili--     declared that a legislatively imposed moratorium on APL use:      ``. . . constitutes an increased risk to the lives of U.S.      forces, particularly in Korea and Southwest Asia, and      threatens mission accomplishment. It is the professional      military judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the      geographic Combatant Commanders that the loss of APL which      occurs as a result of this moratorium, without a credible      offset, will result in unacceptable military risk to U.S.      forces.'' In fact, studies suggest that U.S./allied      casualties may be increased by as much as 35% if self-     destructing mines are unavailable--particularly in the      ``halting phase'' of operations against aggressors. Such a      cost is especially unsupportable since the type of mines      utilized by U.S. forces and the manner in which they are      employed by those forces do not contribute to the      humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative      initiatives to ban APLs.       Unfortunately, a ban on future deployments of APLs will in      no way diminish the danger posed by tens of millions of      ``dumb'' landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where      they will inflict terror and devastation on civilian      populations. Detecting and clearing such mines should      continue to receive urgent attention from our government and      others. The unverifiability and unenforceability of a ban on      production of such devices, however, virtually ensures that      this practice will continue in the future. Only the U.S.      military--and those of other law-abiding nations--will be      denied a means, through the use of marked and monitored      minefields, of reducing the costs and increasing the      probability of victory in future conflicts.       Mr. President, we have fought our Nation's wars and our      battlefield experience causes us to urge you to resist all      efforts to impose a moratorium on the future use of self-     destructing anti-personnel landmines by combat forces of the      United States.
