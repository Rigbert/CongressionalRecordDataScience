 President, I want to get into something else you have been reading about what happened in my State of Alabama yesterday. I offer my condolences to the families and friends of the victims killed in Samson, AL.  Yesterday, my State of Alabama suffered the worst mass shooting in our State's history. As this tragedy unfolded, our law enforcement responded bravely. I commend them for their actions and efforts. I also offer my sincere sympathies to the victims, their families, and the community. This is a tragedy that did not have to happen.  I yield the floor.
