 Even though my friend has just said they are filling the doughnut hole, I would quickly say it is being filled in a way that the big pharmaceutical companies are going to make sure they are selling prescription drugs, prescribed drugs, for a long period of time and not have the savings that ought to come from using generics to a greater extent. This $50 billion--actually $54 billion--that CBO says we would save with medical malpractice reform would be a better way of filling that doughnut hole.  I have a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair.
