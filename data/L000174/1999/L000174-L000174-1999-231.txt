President, I take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of Amy Burke Wright on the occasion of her departure from the Lake Champlain Housing Development Corporation, LCHDC.  For 22 years Amy has been working to provide affordable housing to low income and disabled families in Vermont, and she has done it in such a way as to build respect and self-esteem among those she has helped. Amy has been the lead developer for twenty-five housing developments in eleven Vermont communities. I don't know of a single one of those projects that fit the stereotype for ``low-income'' housing. More than once in attended the ground-breaking or ribbon cutting for one of the housing developments Amy has managed, I have wished I could live there. From her ground breaking work on the Thelma Maples and Flynn Avenue Co-ops in Burlington to the wonderful redevelopment of an old school at the Marshall Center in St. Albans, Amy has changed the face of affordable housing in Vermont. For that, I and the hundreds of people who have benefitted from her work, thank her.  And it is not just that Amy has brought affordable housing into the mainstream, it is how she has done it--with a creativity and determination to go where no affordable housing provider has gone before. If a project utilizes an innovative approach to ownership, or an organization forms to address affordable housing in new and exciting ways, more likely than not, Amy was there. She established and directed the first congregate housing project in Vermont, was a founding member of the Burlington Community Land Trust, the first non-profit in the state to actively promote long term affordability and community control of housing, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Richmond Housing Inc. which recently sponsored the first project in Vermont to provide home office space to support resident economic development. And these examples only scratch the surface of her work.  During one event to celebrate the opening of yet another affordable housing project she had shepherded to completion, Amy gave me a wand for, she said, the magic I had done in bringing some federal financing to the project. For all that Amy has done to bring quality affordable housing within reach for countless Vermont families, she deserves a super hero cape.                          ____________________
