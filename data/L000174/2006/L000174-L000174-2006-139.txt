President, in my 32 years as a U.S. Senator, I have met many extraordinary people. They have included Presidents, Kings and Nobel laureates, artists, soldiers, nurses, activists, and ordinary Americans who are doing any number of wonderful, selfless, and courageous things for their families, their communities, and their country. Some of these people chose careers in public service. Others were leading normal, uneventful lives when they were unexpectedly confronted with circumstances that caused them to become leaders. Many have simply lived inconspicuous lives caring for others. And then there are those who have struggled to overcome unfair and seemingly impossible hurdles and in doing so have shown a force of character and spirit that breaks barriers and inspires awe among everyone they meet.  Ben Chater, a Vermonter who interned in my office several years ago during the summer after his sophomore year at the University of California at Berkeley, is in the latter category. Born with cerebral palsy, Ben has faced obstacles from birth that the rest of us could not even imagine, much less overcome. He has done so with amazing grace, courage, and good humor, and his accomplishments are nothing short of awe inspiring. Ben's refusal to let his disability prevent him from taking on practically any challenge has been an example for me and my wife Marcelle, for my staff, and for virtually everyone who has come into contact with him.  I have little doubt that Ben will continue to set ambitious goals and in reaching them he will demonstrate even further the incredible capacity of the human spirit to overcome adversity. He will also continue to erase the stereotypes and misconceptions about the potential of people with disabilities.  Ben was recently the subject of an article in the Vermont Sunday Magazine by Tom Slayton, who is also the editor of Vermont Life, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record so others can be inspired by Ben's life and accomplishments.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the Vermont Sunday Magazine, September 10, 2006].   ``In Awe of Ben''--Ben Chater, 23, with cerebral palsy, finishes               Berkeley, prepares for life's next challenge                            (By Tom Slayton)       This is the story of a fine mind living in a body that      won't cooperate.       Ben Chater, 23, of Montpelier has had cerebral palsy since      birth. Due to a difficult birth, Ben's brain was deprived of      oxygen for a few moments. As a result, he has a major      disability--he has limited control over movements of his      limbs, or the rest of his body.       He requires assistance with everyday living--getting      dressed in the morning, eating a meal, taking a shower. He      speaks with some difficulty and requires a motorized      wheelchair to get around.       However, Ben's mind is complete and undamaged. In fact, he      is extremely bright.     He graduated this year, with honors, from the University of      California at Berkeley with degrees in English and      linguistics, the study of language--how it works, how sounds      combine to make meaning, how the language we use shapes our      thinking and our experience.       Linguistics is not for the faint of heart. Or mind. But Ben      is neither.       For his work in that field, Ben received the Departmental      Citation for Excellence in Linguistics, awarded by the      faculty of the department to an outstanding student. He was      the only student at Berkeley to receive that award this year.       Ben is not only an outstanding student; he is an      outstanding person.       After talking with him for even a few minutes, one forgets      the fact that he is in a powered chair and has some      difficulty forming words. What remains is the lasting      impression of an intelligent, positive, hopeful young man.       ``I'm frankly in awe of Ben,'' says his mother, Maude      Chater. ``There's a grace about him that I don't understand--     nor do I need to.''       Maude and her husband, Mike, have worked long and hard to      help Ben achieve an independent life. Perhaps the hardest      thing for them to do, in recent years, has been to stand back      and get out of Ben's way.       ``It's very hard for families to resist their protective      instincts,'' she notes quietly.       In addition to academic success that would be remarkable in      a person with normal abilities, Ben has served as an intern      in the office of U.S. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, living in      Washington while working for the senator. And he recently      took--and aced--the LSAT exams--the qualifying exam for law      school.       However, all that success does not eliminate the fact that      he has difficulties the rest of us cannot imagine.       Recently, Ben went outside into the back yard to check on a      blueberry patch, alone, while family members were out and      about, as usual. He drove his motorized chair uphill      toward some trees--and got mired in a soft spot in the      yard.       Two hours later, when his mother arrived back home, she      found Ben, still mired, still in his chair, stuck in front of      one of the trees. When she went to assist him, Ben's only wry      comment was:       ``It's a nice tree . . . really!''       Early on--when Ben was a junior at Montpelier High School,      to be exact--his special qualities became apparent to all of      his classmates.       For Ben, as for most kids, it was a time of change,      uncertainty and social stress. Many of the young people he      had grown up with had begun to change their interests, and      old friends drifted away and new ones didn't appear to take      their places. More than most kids, Ben felt isolated.       Unlike most kids, though, he decided to do something about      it. He received permission from the school administration to      call a school-wide assembly, and at it he spoke to his fellow      students about what he saw and felt. He spoke about what it      was like to be Ben Chater, teenager, confused and lonely. ``I      felt I needed to do something,'' Ben says, remembering the      assembly.       What he discovered that day was that he was not alone. Many      of his classmates and other students approached him afterward      and said they felt exactly the same way--and they thanked him      for putting their feelings into words along with his own.       ``I don't know a single kid who loved every minute of high      school,'' he says.       With his parents' backing and encouragement, he has always      tried to join in the activities and share the interests of      his peers. If a school field trip involved climbing a      mountain, Ben's first thought was not: ``I can't go,'' but      ``How can I climb the mountain, too?''       (Answer: ``We need to get a really strong guy to carry me      up the mountain on his back.'' And that's the way it      happened.)       But college presented a whole new set of challenges.       How could Ben get by without the assistance of his parents?      (Answer: Hire and manage assistants. There are some Social      Security funds for just that purpose.)       How could he do the immense amount of work that college      typically demands? What about lengthy term papers, for      example?       (Answer: The world of electronic communication--computers,      e-mail, the Web, blogging and so on--has actually been very      helpful to Ben. True, his hands and fingers won't obey his      mental commands, but he makes expert use of a headset that      enables him to type by tapping with a pointer attached to      his head.       When ``translated'' into computer strokes and electronic      impulses, Ben's words and ideas can be communicated freely.      And the excellence of his ideas and scholarship stands out.)       How would Ben get to classes in a multi-story building,      meet with professors, register, even accomplish something as      basic as going to the bathroom in a standard multi-story      academic building? (Answer: Attend a university that prides      itself on integrating disabled students into all its classes      and activities.)       After considerable research and a couple of visits, Ben      decided to apply and was accepted at Berkeley, one of the      nation's most competitive universities.       ``Going to Berkeley expanded my horizons in just about      every way imaginable,'' he says of the school, which is      located across the bay from San Francisco.       As Ben explains the situation at Berkeley, he smiles and      mentions the school's diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural      student body.       ``In most cities, `diversity,' means there are a lot of      different sections of town, each with its own different      ethnicity or whatever,'' he said. ``But in Berkeley,      everybody--all the different kinds of people--lives together.      . . . And that creates a kind of social comfort I had never      seen before.''       People in the Bay area--in California generally, according      to Ben--prefer to make life easy and non-confrontational.      They tend to be more accepting of different kinds of people      because there are a lot of different kinds of people living      close together. That means acceptance is the rule, not the      exception.       ``People with disabilities are just another element in that      kind of melting pot,'' Ben said. ``There are a lot of folks      in chairs out there--so it's easy to get around.''       And people with significant disabilities are more accepted,      more worked into the everyday mix of society, he noted.       That doesn't mean that bad things, never happen.       Ben tells the story of the time he went into San Francisco      to a concert. His plan was to meet friends in the city and go      to the Fillmore, one of the city's main event venues. Then      his friends would help him take the Bay Area Rapid Transit      train back across the Bay to his apartment.       But things began to go wrong as soon as he reached San      Francisco. He couldn't find his friends at all, and by the      time the concert got out, he realized that he had to return      home on his own.       Unfortunately, by the time he worked all that out, the BART      trains had stopped for the night, so Ben had to go home by      bus--a much longer and more circuitous route. He found his      way to the Trans-Bay Bus terminal, and got a bus part-way      home, to Oakland. It was late at night by then, and Ben had      to wait in downtown Oakland for a bus to Berkeley.       The bus finally arrived and Ben drove his motorized chair      onto the special lift that buses in the Bay area carry for      passengers with disabilities. At that moment, the lift broke      down.       And so at 3 a.m. Ben sat suspended over the street, waiting      for 45 minutes for a mechanic to come and repair the lift.       Eventually the mechanic fixed the lift, the bus rolled out      of the Oakland station, and Ben got home--as the sun was      rising at about 5 a.m. He passed out in his chair and was      later helped to bed by his roommate.       Such experiences have not cramped Ben's spirit. Now, with      his degree in linguistics, a high score on the LSATs, and      college behind him, he's taking a bit of a break, letting      things settle, thinking about his next move.       There is an employment possibility at Berkeley that he's      considering, but he's also visiting law schools--he and his      father, Mike Chater, checked out Yale last week; and Ben      would also like to visit Columbia and New York University.      Eventually, he plans to apply to several law schools, choose      one, and start next year. He's also thinking about traveling.       Like many young men and women his age, he also doesn't know      precisely what career he wants to follow.       ``The thought of being a lawyer . . . working in an office      for the rest of my life is not all that exciting,'' he said.      ``But going to law school gives you a lot of options--you can      do a lot of things with a law degree.''       His dad, Ben notes, has counseled him to keep as many      options open as he can.       Ben obviously has some things going for him. One is the      steady, strong support of his parents.       ``Our family was definitely oriented around Ben in his      early years,'' Maude Chater says, ``When he got into high      school, he directed us to back off a bit.''       Vacations and trips have occasionally been challenging.      ``We travel, but we don't travel light,'' Maude quips.       Independence has been Maude and Mike's goal for Ben since      his birth, and they realize that to foster independence in a      person you have to let them be independent.       But there are moments--especially when Ben wants to take a      significant step forward, like foreign travel or learning to      drive--that can cause the mental brakes to go on in a      parent's head. The difficulties Ben faces with daily living      are probably at least as stressful on his parents as on Ben      himself. But they have learned to stand back. They have      learned to learn.       And they are regularly amazed by their son's courage.       For his part, Ben doesn't waste any time at all on self-     pity. Not a moment.       ``I've never spent a lot of time thinking about what life      would be like if I weren't disabled,'' he said recently. ``I      believe that everyone's dealt a set of cards, and it doesn't      matter which cards you're dealt--it's how you play them.''       Interestingly, although he is well aware of the inequities      that people with disabilities face in society, he said      recently, ``There are a lot of things about our society that      aren't right, and that aren't fair.''       But he said he doesn't want to spend his life worrying      about that.       What he said he has learned, and is still learning, is that      the more comfortable people can be with themselves, the more      power they have over their lives--and by extension, the      conditions around them.       Ben doesn't think of himself as a teacher, but he is one.      Those who know him say he has taught them about the dignity      and deep value inherent in every person, no matter     what their circumstances. At Berkeley, one of his nicknames      was ``The Rabbi,'' because of the wise counsel he would offer      his classmates, when asked.       He remains modest about his achievements, the long learning      process he has come through and the long road that remains      ahead. ``I'm definitely in the middle of a lengthy process of      figuring out which end is up,'' he said. ``It's a process      that everyone has to figure out for themselves.''       And what are his parents' hopes?       ``Our hope for Ben is that he is able to live      independently, support himself, and be happy,'' Maude says      ``. . . that he finds his place in the world.''                          ____________________
