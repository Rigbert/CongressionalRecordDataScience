Bill Clinton vetoed it because he said it will take 10 years to produce it; ANWR, 10 years. That was 13 years ago. If we had built it then, we would have it pumping today over 1 million barrels a day, but no, he didn't do that.  Let me stress again, ANWR is, in fact, 74 miles away from the existing pipeline, 800 miles long, a terminus point and all the infrastructure in place, and we built that in 3 years. And if you don't think we can build a pipeline 74 miles away and drill the oil andget it to that pipeline in 3 years, you're not studying this fact. It can be done for the American people.  I'm asking you on both sides, let's drill, let's develop our domestic sources for the good of America, the good of the Nation, and make sure we can go forth.
