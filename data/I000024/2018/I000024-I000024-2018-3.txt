President, I have a message to deliver this morning, but after sitting here and listening through and enjoying the comments that were made, I wanted to at least make one comment about the Senator from Texas.  In my real life, for a number of years, I was a builder and developer in South Texas. I know South Texas very well. I know the border well. That is why I have been down there so much and am so interested in, of course, the border wall, which we are going to have. But we have a wonderful friend and a person who has been a good friend. You would think he is dead, but he is not. He is very much alive, and he is back doing his full-time job.  I want to say that the time I spent with him down there in Texas long before he was even in the position he is in today--he has been a great hero down there not just to the people in Texas but people all over the country.                            Border Security  Mr. President, as far as the comments that were made by the minority leader from New York, it is easy to stand here and talk about this. Yes, I know the Democrats--they have all gotten together, and they don't want to have a wall, but they are going to have a wall. Walls work.  Look at the record of having walls. San Diego built their wall in 1992, and illegal traffic dropped 92 percent after that. Ninety-two percent. El Paso built their wall--I remember when that was built--in 1993, and illegal traffic dropped 72 percent. Tucson built their wall in 2000, and illegal traffic dropped 90 percent. Yuma, in Arizona, built theirs in 2005, and illegal traffic dropped. It has happened everywhere. Just look at Israel and the successes they have had and how many Israelis would be dead today if it weren't for the wall they have.  We are one of the few countries without a wall. We are going to have a wall, and it is going to be funded. So if anyone is listening to what is going on down here, just be assured that we are going to have our wall.                      Remembering George H.W. Bush  Mr. President, I want to make one comment on something that happened 3 or 4 weeks ago, when we lost an American hero. Everyone talked about George H.W. Bush, and they talked about their experiences. The reason I wanted to wait a while before making any comments on that is because I have known George H.W. Bush for many, many years, before I was actually in politics. My wife Kay and I are praying for the entire Bush family as the Nation mourns and honors one of America's loyal sons.  George H.W. Bush was one of the only men I have ever known who could truly love someone into changing his mind. He loved God. He loved his family. He loved his country and served it tirelessly with passion.  Listen to all of the things he has done. He was a naval aviator, an Ambassador, Director of the CIA, President of the United States, and Vice President of the United States. He has done it all.  George H.W. Bush put service to his Nation and love for his family above all else. Kay and I have known the Bush family for a long time, dating back to their time in the Texas oil fields. He would go back and forth to what he referred to as his second home, which is Tulsa, OK. We were friends before we were in politics, and I am grateful for that friendship. I will always remember that friendship.  This portrays him very well. Back when I was mayor of Tulsa and George Bush was Vice President, he came to Tulsa, OK, to do a fundraising event. Itwas a fundraising event. My wife, in spite of her reputation to the contrary, is a pretty shy person. At these events, she always insists, if we are going to be at the head table, that she be seated next to me at that table. She is not insecure or any of that stuff, but nonetheless this is something she got in her head a long time ago, and she has always wanted that.  So on this occasion--this is when George Bush came to Tulsa, OK, to participate in a fundraiser--she snuck up there and looked at the table and the name tags and looked at me and said: You can't do that. You are not seated next to me. I have to be seated next to you.  I said: Who are you seated next to? She said: George Bush.  Well, apparently, one of the security guys or someone went back and told George Bush about that. So he came up behind her--I will always remember--and he put his arm around her and said: I don't bite. He said further: I will take care of you; don't worry about a thing.  Now, during her conversation up there--she conceded, of course, to sit next to George Bush--he said: You don't happen to know someone named Marian Bovard, do you?  And she said: Well, of course, she is a good friend.  He said: I haven't seen her in a long time.  Kay said: Well, she is sitting right over there. You can see her from here.  So he sent one of his Secret Service people over there to bring Marian Bovard, an old friend, to visit.  It turned out that my wife and George H.W. Bush found out that they both had many mutual friends. Every time he would bring someone up, it happened that that person was there. So he would come over and remind her. She became George Bush's social director, I think, for the remainder of the fundraiser. I think she even ate his broccoli for him.  Now, before I got to Congress, I was a builder and developer in South Texas for many years. Of course, Bush was from Texas. We knew each other at that time. He came to see me a few times when I was working down there, and, somehow, it always happened to be on days when I was fishing, because I fish every day down there. That is one of the many hobbies I have, and I enjoy doing that.  One day he said to me, after he was President: You know, I envy you.  This is kind of strange to have the President of the United States say: I envy you. The reason he said that is because he always enjoyed fishing, and he knows I have a whole bunch of kids and grandkids who all like to fish, and he doesn't. So he envies me.  There is a fishing guide, who my old chief of staff, Richard Soudriette--who, incidentally, is one who is very similar to George Bush in that I have never heard him be mad at anyone or dislike anyone or talk in a profane way about anyone, and that is the same as we have heard so many people say about George Bush. So Richard Soudriette, who also likes to go fishing with me, knew this fishing guide. Not many people are aware of this. Bush had this fishing guide here in Washington, who would sneak in early in the morning, and they would go fishing. His name was Angus. He went to the White House early one morning to go fishing with the President. He was there so early that the Secret Service escorted him up to the residence where he had coffee with the Bushes, who were still in their pajamas.  This is a good story. You should read the whole thing. It was in the Washington Post, and it is on my website.  But President Bush was restless and sometimes impatient, which are not usually characteristics that make a really good fisherman. But because he was steady and dedicated to the task at hand, he did OK, and he even got a few fish, they told me, on that day.  When he was running for President, he came to Tulsa for a fundraising function at the Mayo Hotel. He knew everyone in Tulsa. We did the normal routine we always do. We greeted supporters, gave remarks, and then opened it up for questions. I will never forget this. Ellen McGuire, who is a person who is kind of a party regular in the Republican Party, stood up and said: Are you part of the international communist conspiracy?  George Bush didn't even blink. He looked over at the organizer and said: Where do you find these nuts? Next question.  When he was Vice President, he and Barbara came to Tulsa another time, and I went with a group who was in charge of picking them up at the airport. I was mayor at that time. So we had a guy on my staff named Charlie Burris, also a security guy. So we thought he would be the perfect person to pick up Barbara and George Bush and take them into town.  So we get there, and Charlie goes and picks up the luggage and hands it to the person behind him, thinking it was me, and said: Take this to the hotel.  He turned around and saw that instead of it being me, it was Barbara Bush. She looked a little stunned, but she took the bags and took them and off she went. The cars that came to pick him up were the cars we always used when we had somebody coming to Tulsa. Why invest in limousines down there? They were funeral home limousines. Vice President Bush took one look at them, looked in the back, which I think still had a wreath that said ``Rest in Peace'' on it, and said: You must have a cheap mayor. Well, that mayor was me. I told him I preferred the word ``frugal.''  George Bush knew Oklahoma better than any President in history. Before that date, he was even telling reporters that he wanted this to be his turf, his State. He frequently called Tulsa, OK, his second home. Bush regularly held up Oklahoma as an example of ``points of light,'' a State that knew how to use public-private partnerships to do all of the right things and thrive and be successful.  These are just a few stories about a man who strived to make every man, every woman, every child whom he met feel valuable in his eyes.  George Bush saw life as a series of missions, and he completed those missions with fervor and grace. He never wasted a minute, and for that, I am grateful.  As the Nation continues to mourn one of her most loyal sons, let us find solace in the fact that he is holding hands, reunited with Barbara again.  President Bush, you are a true American hero. Mission complete. God bless you.  One more thing, today, December 19, Kay and I are celebrating our 59th wedding anniversary. I just want to say: Kay, I still love you.  I yield the floor.
