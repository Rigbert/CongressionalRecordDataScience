WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to say that this gentlewoman supports public education. I am not against private schools, I have no problem with religious schools; but our public schools are underfunded, and to take anything away from the funding of public schools at this time is a huge, grave mistake. If we vote on this later today, on H.R. 4271, I urge my colleagues who care about public education in America to do the same and vote against this bill.
