President, before he leaves the floor, let me just commend the Senator from Rhode Island. He has made a number of important points this afternoon, but I am particularly pleased my colleague has laid out, in such a thoughtful way, the implications of the Pope's encyclical. This was very important as a major new focus of the debate, and I really commend my colleague.  I suspect we are now on 101 or 102--oh, 104. I was there for 100, so I must have missed one along the way. But Icommend my colleague and thank him for his commitment. He knows I share many of his views with respect to creating a fresh set of approaches to deal with this climate change question, and I look forward to working with him.
