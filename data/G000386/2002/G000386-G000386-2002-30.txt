 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have requested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement before the Senate proceeds to the consideration of H.R. 5472 or any other legislation extending chapter 12 bankruptcy. While I am a strong supporter of chapter 12--in fact I was the author of chapter 12--I believe that these changes should be enacted as part of the comprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report, which includes provisions making permanent chapter 12 and extending other important family farmer protections in bankruptcy. Chapter 12 will be in effect until the end of this year, and I expect that the comprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report will be passed by the House and Senate by then. Consequently, an extension is not necessary at this time. So I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to pass the comprehensive bankruptcy reform conference report as soon as possible to extend these protections to our family farmers.                          ____________________
