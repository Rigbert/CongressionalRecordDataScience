President, I am joined by my Oregon colleague, Senator Smith, in offering an amendment to S. 2513. My amendment will provide the critical final step to enable Deschutes County, Oregon, in the completion of more than three years of intense work that they have done to find an effective way to protect their groundwater and wetlands from inappropriate residential development.  Deschutes County has completed several years collaborative work to resolve a number of extraordinarily difficult land use problems in that county. In particular, the County faces the prospect of development of more than 13,000 subdivided lots in the vicinity of the Deschutes River in the southern half of the county. More than half of these lots have not yet been developed, and the county now knows that if it does not prevent the further development of these lands, they are going to have major, intractable pollution of the groundwater and of the Deschutes River.  The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality tells us that at present rates of growth, this area faces serious ground water quality problems over the next decade. Further, these lands constitute the most important wildlife and wetlands habitat in the area.  After several years of working with federal and state agencies and local citizens, under the authority of Oregon's Regional Problem Solving initiative, the County has come up with a plan to use incentives to shift development from these sensitive lands, over on to Bureau of Land Management lands that are not nearly so sensitive. Under this plan, the County will sell parcels of this land to prospective residential developers. However, before a developer may acquire a tract, the developer must have purchased ``development rights'' to lands in environmentally sensitive areas. Once these rights are acquired, the land will be rezoned so as to prevent any future development in the undesirable area.  In fact, the BLM lands have already been logged. The BLM lands are easily served by a wastewater collection system and have other features that make the location far more appropriate for development. Local BLM officials have been deeply involved in this effort and tell us that if it fails, the damage to the natural environment of the area will be substantial, and far more expensive to deal with later.  I particularly want to thank Senator Smith, Senator Bumpers, and Chairman Murkowski for working with me at this late date to work out this provision. I want to express my deep appreciation to Governor John Kitzhaber, whose Regional Problem Solving initiative paved the way for this effort. And finally, I want to thank the staff at the Bureau of Land Management here in Washington, in Portland, and at the Prineville District for approaching this matter from the distinct perspective of the greater benefit to the environment that this legislation will achieve.  I also note the very active participation of Deschutes County Commissioner Linda Swearingen, Assistant County Attorney Bruce White, and Community Development Director George Read. They have provided critical help to get this measure approved, and certainly it is their vision for the future of Deschutes County that has gotten us where we are today.  The amendment (No. 3802) was agreed to.  The bill (S. 2513), as amended, was considered read the third time and passed, as follows:                                S. 2513       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
