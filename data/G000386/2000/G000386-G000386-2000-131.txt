 President, I am introducing a bill today entitled the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000.'' Every few years, the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, contacts Congress regarding changes to the law the Judicial Conference believes are necessary to improve the functions of the courts. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I have the responsibility to review the operation of the federal court process and procedures. In the past, I have also been in the forefront of advocating that the federal judicial system be administered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible while maintaining a high level of quality in the administration of justice. The bill I am introducing, along with Senator Torricelli, the Ranking Member of my subcommittee, is a consensus bill that includes many of the recommendations made by the Judicial Conference.  The Judicial Conference has noted a problem that continues to plague the Federal judicial system is the lack of up-to-date technologies that would reduce costs while at the same time improve the efficiency of its administration along with a wide range of judicial branch programs. The ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' attempts to addresses this problem. In accordance with federal policy to defray the cost of providing services by assessing a fee for their use, sections of this bill provide the judiciary with the authority to set, collect, and retain fees to be used to acquire information technologies, such as electronic filing, video conferencing, and electronic evidence presentation devices. This section requires that the fees collected are to be deposited into the Judiciary Information Technology Fund and used for reinvestment in information technology. I feel that granting the judiciary the authority to collect and retain these fees will go a long way toward improving the efficiency of the judicial system while providing substantial savings for litigants and attorneys.  This bill addresses two areas in which I have taken a personal interest, over the years: reducing unnecessary expenses and improving the efficiency of the judicial system. This bill would help achieve both. Traditionally, the safeguards applicable to criminal defendants charged with more serious crimes have not been applicable to petty offense cases because the burdens were deemed undesirable and impractical in dealing with such minor offenses. Currently, U.S. Magistrate Judges may preside over petty offense cases charging a motor vehicle offense and infractions, without the consent of the defendant. This bill removes the consent requirement in all other petty cases--a position repeatedly supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Additionally, this bill authorizes magistrate judges to try misdemeanor cases involving juveniles currently tried in district court. Removing the consent requirement from these petty offense cases and authorizing magistrate judges to preside over all juvenile misdemeanors would free-up valuable district court resources that could be used to deal with more serious crimes and offenders while reducing the time and expense necessary in dealing with these offenses.  Another section of the bill also contains provisions that would free up district court resources and allow federal judges more time to deal with their civil and criminal dockets. These provisions raise the maximum compensation level paid to federal or community defenders representing defendants appearing before United States magistrates or the district courts before they must seek a waiver for payment in excess of the prescribed maximum. Payment in excess of the maximum currently requires the approval of both the judge who presided over the case and the chief judge of the circuit. This procedure in turn increases the amount of time judges must devote to non-judicial matters. The last increase was instituted fourteen years ago. During this time, the effects of inflation have significantly eroded the compensation paid to federal and community defenders.  The Judicial Conference has expressed to me their concern over a growing trend of ``Criminal Justice Act'' (CJA) panel attorneys being subject to unfounded suits by the defendants they previously represented and the financial damage these attorneys have to deal with when they must pay to defend themselves in these actions. These unfair costs have the potential of having a chilling effect on the willingness of attorneys to participate as panel attorneys and will only make it more difficult to obtain adequate representation for defendants. Currently, the CJA authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide representation and indemnify federal and community defender organizations for malpractice claims that arise as a result of furnishing representational services. Panel attorneys are the only component of the appointed counsel program who are not permitted to receive CJA-funded coverage for any costs associated with defending against a malpractice claim by a CJA client. Our bill rectifies this oversight in the CJA, and provides CJA panel attorneys the same protection as other federal defenders.Provisions in our bill authorize the judge who presides over a case, at his discretion, to reimburse panel attorneys for out-of-pocket expenses for civil claims arising for their CJA services. The judge would exercise his discretion limiting the amount of reimbursement available for a panel attorney as he views appropriate under the circumstances, as has been the practice with respect to malpractice claims against other federal defenders.  In addition, the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' also contains provisions designed to assist handicapped employees working for the federal judiciary. These provisions bring the federal judicial system in-line with the Executive Branch and other governmental bodies.  The bill also contains a number of other provisions that we believe are necessary to improve the Federal Courts' administration, judicial process and matters relating to public defenders, as well as other items that enhance the operation of the Federal judiciary. I urge my colleagues to join us and support these improvements to our Federal Court system.                                 ______                                       By
