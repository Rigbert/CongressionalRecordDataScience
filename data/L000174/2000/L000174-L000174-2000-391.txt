I have the privilege, as I said earlier, of being the 21st Member of the Senate, in all its history, to cast 10,000 votes. Some votes were important; a lot were not important. But I thought it was pretty impressive--10,000 votes. Even with all the unimportant ones, even after all of them, I did not vote enough to have voted on all the proposed constitutional amendments. There have been 11,000.  Our highly respected and beloved two most senior Members of this body, Senator Thurmond and Senator Byrd, have cast 15,000 votes. They are about the only ones who might have cast enough votes. But those votes encompassed all kinds of things.  Here we are talking about changing the Constitution at the drop of a hat. Some of us--Republicans and Democrats alike, conservatives and liberals--ought to stand up and say: We will pass statutes; we will experiment. If we are wrong, we will change the statutes; we will change the law. But we will not amend the Constitution. No matter that the proposal comes from the left or the right, no matter what it is, we should not pass it unless it is, as the Constitution says, necessary.  This resolution is not necessary for the security and for the continuation of the world's greatest democracy.
