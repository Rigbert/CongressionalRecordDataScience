(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) America's capital markets are a foundation of our      Nation's economic well being and security.       (2) Healthy capital markets foster investment in the United      States economy, helping to sustain and create jobs.       (3) The American economy is fundamentally strong, but a      correction in the residential housing market, credit turmoil,      and high oil prices are hampering economic growth.       (4) American businesses and investors face ever increasing      competition from international competitors and markets.       (5) Economic policies that maintain low tax rates on      capital gains and dividends have historically fostered      sustained growth in the American economy.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that--       (1) Congress should not pass legislation that would create      new or greater uncertainty in the financial markets;       (2) Congress should not pass legislation that would serve      to further constrict liquidity in the marketplace;       (3) Congress should not pass legislation that would make      credit more expensive and less accessible in the United      States than in other world markets;       (4) Congress should not pass legislation that would inhibit      or impair capital formation and long-term investments;       (5) Congress should maintain existing tax policy regarding      capital formation and long-term investment, except in the      case of illegitimate tax shelter activity;       (6) Congress should pass legislation to extend permanently      the 2001 and 2003 tax rate cuts, including the 15 percent      capital gains and dividend rates, and to simplify and lower      corporate tax rates; and       (7) Congress should promote the entrepreneurship and      economic development fostered by long-term, private      investment.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) companies listed on United States securities exchanges      face the potential of extraordinary litigation costs that      companies listed abroad do not;       (2) securities class action settlements in the United      States for 2006 totaled $10,600,000,000 (not counting the      Enron-related settlements of approximately $7,100,000,000),      reflecting an increase of--       (A) 255 percent from 2004;       (B) more than 500 percent from 2000 (not including the      $3,100,000,000 Cendant settlement); and       (C) an astonishing 7,000 percent from 1995;       (3) while many such claims are legitimate, the sheer number      of cases and the staggering settlement amounts illustrate the      growing impact of the tort system on the United States      economy; and       (4) by contrast, such private shareholder class action      suits do not exist in the United Kingdom and other European      Union countries.       (b) Public Hearing.--Not later than 60 days after the date      of enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Securities and      Exchange Commission (in this section referred to as the      ``Commission'') shall convene a public hearing on the impact      of excessive litigation on the competitiveness of companies      listed on United States securities exchanges.

(a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to      Congress a study of its existing processes and procedures for      conducting cost-benefit analyses of proposed and existing      rules and regulations, and shall report to Congress on ways      in which the Commission could perform more rigorous and      informed cost-benefit analyses of such rules and regulations.

(2) Certain content required.--At a minimum, processes and      procedures proposed by the Commission under this subsection      shall include provisions directing the Commission--       (A) to assess all costs and benefits of available      regulatory alternatives, including both quantifiable measures      (to the extent that such measures can be usefully estimated)      and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are      difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to      consider;       (B) to design its rules and regulations in the most cost-     effective manner to achieve the regulatory objective,      considering incentives for innovation, consistency,      predictability, the costs of enforcement and compliance, and      flexibility;       (C) to assess both the costs and the benefits of the      intended rule or regulation and propose or adopt a rule or      regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the      benefits of the intended rule or regulation justify its      costs;       (D) to base its decisions on the best reasonably obtainable      economic and other information concerning the need for, and      consequences of, the intended rule or regulation;       (E) to tailor its rules and regulations to impose the least      possible burden on individuals, businesses of differing      sizes, and other entities, consistent with obtaining the      regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other      things, and to the extent practicable, the cumulative costs;      and       (F) to establish a process for reexamining existing rules      and regulations, or, at a minimum, those rules and      regulations that the Commission, industry participants, or      others identify as imposing unjustifiable costs or      competitive burdens, that shall be designed to determine      whether the rules and regulations are working as intended,      whether there are satisfactory alternatives of a less      burdensome nature, and whether changes should be made.       (3) Periodic review.--Each rule and regulation of the      Commission that is subject to review pursuant to paragraph      (2)(F) shall be reviewed not less frequently than 2 years      after the date of its issuance in final form, and once every      10 years thereafter.     SEC. 204. DIRECTING THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE ``SMALLER PUBLIC                    COMPANY'' TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO ISSUERS.       (a) Rule Revision Required.--Not later than 90 days after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission, pursuant      to its authority to amend rules of the Public Company      Accounting Oversight Board under section 107 of the Sarbanes-     Oxley Act of 2002, shall revise Auditing Standard No. 5 of      the Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of enactment of      this Act, to include a definition of the term ``smaller      public company''.       (b) Definition of Smaller Public Company.--For purposes of      the rule revision required under subsection (a), the term      ``smaller public company'' shall mean an issuer for which an      annual report is required by section 13(a) or 15(d) of the      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d))      that--       (1) has a total market capitalization at the beginning of      the relevant reporting period of less than $700,000,000; and       (2) has total revenues for that reporting period of less      than $250,000,000.     SEC. 205. MUTUAL RECOGNITION.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) there is an ongoing and pressing need to update the      United States financial regulatory structure to address the      increasingly global nature of the financial marketplace;       (2) existing regulations on cross-border activities are      outdated, and predate the revolution in communications      technology and the accompanying transformations in global      markets;       (3) existing regulations on cross-border activities are      complex, inefficient, not flexible enough to meet modern      market needs, and have the effect of chilling innovation and      imposing significant and unnecessary burdens on United States      investors;       (4) the Commission has delayed the timetable for Commission      action on key elements of reexamining and developing new      approaches to cross-border regulation, including much needed      reform to Commission rule 240.15a-6 of title 17, Code of      Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of      this Act, and potential recognition of foreign regulatory      regimes; and       (5) such delay postpones the regulatory changes needed to      eliminate unnecessary inefficiencies from international      financial transactions, and poses an increasingly significant      risk to the effective modernization and competitiveness of      United States capital markets.       (b) Modernization of Cross-Border Rules Applicable to      Brokers and Dealers.--       (1) In general.--The Commission shall, by rule, exempt any      foreign broker or dealer from the registration requirements      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and any other      regulation applicable to registered or unregistered brokers      or dealers, to the extent that the foreign broker or dealer      effects transactions in securities with or for, or induces or      attempts to induce the purchase or sale of any security by--       (A) a qualified investor, as defined in section 3(a)(54) of      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;       (B) an investor that is a resident outside of the United      States; and       (C) any person described in Commission rule 240.15a-6(a)(4)      of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the      date of enactment of this Act.       (2) Definition of foreign broker or dealer.--As used in      this section, the term ``Foreign broker or dealer'' has the      same meaning as in section 240.15a-6(b)(3) of title 17, Code      of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment      of this Act.       (3) Regulatory authority.--The Commission may, upon a      finding that such action is necessary to protect United      States investors and consistent with this section, require a      foreign broker or dealer and its associated persons--       (A) to file documentation to establish that the foreign      broker or dealer and its associated persons are not subject      to statutory disqualification;       (B) to consent to service of process for any civil action      brought by or proceeding before the Commission or a self-     regulatory organization; and       (C) to agree to provide any information or documents that      the Commission reasonably requests, relating to effecting      transactions in securities with or for, or inducing or      attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any security by      persons described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of      paragraph (1), subject to limitations recognizing potential      conflicts with applicable foreign laws or regulations.       (4) Limitation on state action.--No State or political      subdivision thereof, or any self-regulatory organization, may      impose any registration, licensing, qualification, or other      legal requirement applicable to a foreign broker or dealer or      associated person thereof that is exempt from Commission      registration and regulation pursuant to this subsection,      except that the State or political subdivision thereof, or      such self-regulatory organization, may require the foreign      broker or dealer to provide copies of any documents filed      with the Commission, as described in this subsection.       (5) Timing of regulations.--Final regulations to carry out      this subsection shall be issued by the Commission, and such      regulations shall become effective, not later than 180 days      after the date of enactment of this Act.       (c) Mutual Recognition Rules.--       (1) In general.--The Commission shall issue regulations      designed to provide for a framework for mutual recognition of      foreign regulatory regimes, so that foreign brokers, dealers,      and exchanges shall be regulated based on regulation in their      home country, and shall not be subject to duplicative      regulatory requirements, except to the extent that the      Commission finds necessary to protect United States      investors.       (2) Implementation.--The Commission shall adopt regulations      that provide an expeditious and transparent implementation      mechanism for this section, based on objective qualification      criteria and fixed timelines, that is designed to enable      foreign brokers, dealers, and exchanges to operate in the      United States and abroad based on regulation in their home      country.       (3) Limitation.--The regulations required by this      subsection--       (A) shall not require individualized review and approval      process for foreign brokers, dealers, and exchanges to be      eligible to rely on regulation in their home country, but      shall permit such brokers, dealers, and exchanges to make a      supplemental showing, on an individual exemptive basis, to      demonstrate their qualifications to do business with relevant      classes of investors; and       (B) may not create regulatory distinctions that limit      trading of portfolios containing both United States and non-     United States securities or impose other requirements that      are inconsistent with the business objectives of investors.       (4) Timing.--The Commission shall issue proposed      regulations to carry out this subsection not later than 90      days after the date of enactment of this Act, and shall make      such regulations effective reasonably promptly thereafter.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) United States capital markets are evolving quickly, and      United States equity exchanges face increasing competition,      both domestically and internationally;       (2) the Commission has recognized this transformation in      the competitive landscape and announced a project to redesign      the rule approval process for exchanges to make it more      efficient;       (3) rather than approving rule filings by self regulatory      organizations within the 35-day period prescribed under the      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Commission has routinely      requested that exchanges agree to extend deadlines while      rules are weighed and considered within the agency,      potentially resulting in years before exchange rule filings      are finally approved;       (4) this antiquated and overly rigid regulatory model does      not recognize the new realities of international competition      among exchanges or new competition from innovative products      that compete with traditional asset classes; and       (5) competitors to United States equity exchanges operate      under different regulatory regimes, which can allow such      competitors to adapt to rapidly changing business      environments while United States exchanges are frozen in rule      approval process review by the Commission for months or      years.       (b) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall promulgate rules      under section 19 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to      speed the process of rulemaking to enable self-regulatory      organizations to respond to competitive inequities and better      meet customer needs. Such rules and other actions should be      completed not later than 180 days after the date of enactment      of this Act, and should predate or be coterminous with any      foreign exchange mutual recognition regime established under      this Act.

Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.      77r(b)(1)) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A)--       (A) by striking ``or the American Stock Exchange, or      listed, or authorized for listing,     on the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or      any successor to such entities)'' and inserting ``, the      American Stock Exchange, or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any      successor to such entities)''; and       (B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the      following: ``, except that a security listed, or authorized      for listing, on the New York Stock Exchange, the American      Stock Exchange, or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor      to any such entity) shall not be a covered security if the      exchange adopts listing standards pursuant to section 19(b)      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78s(b))      that designates a tier or segment of such securities as      securities that are not covered securities for purposes of      this section and such security is listed, or authorized for      listing, on such tier or segment''; and       (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``covered'' after      ``applicable to''.     SEC. 208. DIRECTING THE COMMISSION TO ACCELERATE FULL                    CONVERSION OF IFRS AND UNITED STATES GAAP.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the accounting framework applied in more than 100      countries around the world is the International Financial      Reporting Standard (in this section referred to as ``IFRS'');       (2) a number of additional important United States trading      partners, including Canada, Brazil, Chile, India, and South      Korea, have announced dates to shift to IFRS; and       (3) the difficulty and expense of reconciling IFRS with      generally accepted accounting principles employed in the      United States (in this section referred to as ``GAAP''), the      accounting framework within which companies whose shares are      listed on United States exchanges must report their financial      information, is among the highest hurdles for foreign      companies considering a United States listing, and one of the      most compelling incentives for foreign-based businesses to      list their shares on exchanges based somewhere other than the      United States.       (b) Acceleration of Effort.--The Commission shall--       (1) accelerate efforts to offer to both United States- and      foreign-based companies the option of reporting financial      information using either IFRS or GAAP; and       (2) accelerate efforts with the Commission's foreign      counterparts to achieve full conversion of IFRS and GAAP.     SEC. 209. PROMOTING MARKET ACCESS FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) there is a need to consistently monitor and increase      Government advocacy for United States financial services      firms' attempts to gain overseas financial market access;       (2) the presence of foreign financial services firms in the      United States and their activities should be documented to      find which countries' firms enjoy full market access in the      United States, while their home governments deny national      treatment to American financial services firms; and       (3) an analysis of the results achieved from the U.S.-China      Strategic Economic Dialogue (referred to as ``SED'') and how      such results specifically apply to United States financial      services firms, including benchmarks and timeframes for      future improvements, should be compiled to assess the      efficacy of the negotiations.       (b) Amendments to Financial Reports Act.--The Financial      Reports Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5351 et seq.) is amended--       (1) in section 3602--       (A) in the section heading, by striking ``QUADRENNIAL'' and      inserting ``ANNUAL'';       (B) by striking ``Not less frequently than every 4 years,      beginning December 1, 1990'' and inserting ``Beginning July      1, 2008, and annually thereafter,''; and       (C) by striking ``to the Congress'' and inserting ``to the      Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the      Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House      of Representatives''; and       (2) in section 3603--       (A) by redesignating subsections (b), (c), and (d) as      subsections (c), (d), and (e), respectively; and       (B) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:       ``(b) Report on SED.--       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall include in the      initial report required under section 3602, a summary of the      results of the most recent United States-China Strategic      Economic Dialogue (in this subsection referred to as `SED')      and the results of the SED as it relates to promoting market      access for financial institutions.       ``(2) Progress report.--The reports required under section      3602 shall include a progress report on the implementation of      any agreements resulting from the SED, a description of the      remaining challenges, if any, in improving market access for      financial institutions, and a plan, including benchmarks and      time frames, for dealing with the remaining challenges.       ``(3) Specific content.--Each report described in this      subsection shall specifically address issues regarding--       ``(A) foreign investment rules;       ``(B) the problems of a dual-share stock market;       ``(C) the openness of the derivatives market;       ``(D) restrictions on foreign bank branching;       ``(E) the ability to offer insurance (including innovative      products); and       ``(F) regulatory and procedural transparency.''.
