 President, the last time a broad energy bill was signed into law was back in 2007. It may as well have been a lifetime ago as far as America's energy situation is concerned. While we were once living in an era of energy scarcity, we are now living in an era of higher energy production and lower technology costs. It is change that represents many opportunities but also challenges--aging infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles, outdated policies, and needless redtape. These are the kinds of challenges we will need to address if we want to support America's rise as one of the world's preeminent energy superpowers and if we want to support the accompanying potential for jobs, for growth, and for increased energy independence. That is why the Senate is considering the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It is broad, bipartisan legislation that will modernize our energy policies to keep pace with a changing world. It will help Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It will help Americans save energy.  This bipartisan bill builds on technological progress in order to strengthen and sustain America's energy advances while protecting our environment at the same time, all without raising taxes or adding to the deficit. It is the latest reminder of what is possible with cooperation in this Senate.  A huge majority of the Senate energy committee supported the bill when it came to a vote. The top Republican on the committee supported it and the top Democrat on the committee supported it. They are the managers of this bill today. They have worked with Members of both parties and have lined up amendments already. They are working with Members of both parties to schedule even more. If you have an amendment you would like considered, please work with them. Let's get this process moving. Let's get this bill passed so we can support more jobs, more growth, and more energy independence for our country.                          ____________________
