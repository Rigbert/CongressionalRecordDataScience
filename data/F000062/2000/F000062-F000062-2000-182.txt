 President, I draw the attention of the Senate to a timely Opinion-Editorial, written by former Ambassador Leonard Woodcock, that appeared in the March 9, 2000 Los Angeles Times. Long a champion of workers' welfare and workers' rights, Ambassador Woodcock was also the first United States Ambassador's to the People's Republic of China.  Ambassador Woodcock lays out, in a clear and well-reasoned manner, powerful arguments showing how the United States will benefit from establishing permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, and why it is in our interest to see China in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Equally important, the author forces those who profess a concern for Chinese workers' rights to take a realistic look at how our decision concerning China PNTR will help or harm workers in China.  I comment Ambassador Woodcock's thought-provoking commentary to all my colleagues in the Congress and, even more, to all persons interested in understanding the basics of the U.S.-China PNTR debate. I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Woodcock's Opinion-Editorial be printed in the Congressional Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Evolution Doesn't Occur Overnight     WTO agreement: Organized labor should support it. It's in          both U.S. and Chinese interests.                         (By Leonard Woodcock)       The recent U.S.-China World Trade Organization bilateral      accession agreement appears to be good for workers in both      countries. I was privileged, as U.S. ambassador to China, to      sign the 1979 trade agreement that provided for most-favored-     nation trade status to China and have, as a private citizen,      been involved with this issue for many years.       American labor has a tremendous interest in China's trading      on fair terms with the U.S. The agreement we signed with      China this past November marks the largest single step ever      taken toward achieving that goal. The agreement expands      American jobs. And while China already enjoys WTO-based      access to our economy, this agreement will open China's      economy to unprecedented levels of American exports, many of      which are high-quality goods produced by high-paying jobs.       There is reason to fear unfair trade practices. Yet this      agreement actually provides better protections than our      existing laws allow. It stipulates 12 years of protections      against market surges and provides unusually strong anti-     dumping laws--which aim to counter unfairly priced imports--     for 15 years.       I have, therefore, been startled by organized labor's      vociferous negative reaction to this agreement. The reality      is that the U.S. as a whole benefits mightily from this      historic accord. The AFL-CIO argues that nothing in this      agreement demands that free trade unions be formed in China.      Yet the WTO does not require this of any of its 136 member      countries, and the WTO is the wrong instrument to use to      achieve unionization.       We should, instead, be asking a more important question.      Are Chinese workers better off with or without this      agreement? The answer is that this agreement, in a variety of      ways, will be enormously beneficial to Chinese workers.       On a subtle level, the changes the agreement requires of      China's economic system will work in favor of investment by      Western firms and take away some of the key advantages Asian      firms now enjoy in China. Every survey has demonstrated that      working conditions and environmental standards in plants      run by West European and North American firms are usually      better than those in Asian and in indigenous Chinese      firms.       The greater foreign presence also will expose Chinese      workers to more ideas about organization and rights. That is      perhaps one reason why almost every Chinese political      dissident who has spoken on this issue has called the United      States-China WTO agreement good news for freedom in China.       The trade deficit with China is a troublesome one to the      labor movement. We need to put it in perspective in two ways.      First, if we were to block access of goods from China to the      United States, this would not increase American jobs. That is      because the Chinese exports--mostly toys, tools, apparel,      cheap electronics, etc.--would be produced in other low-wage      countries, not in the United States. Yet if China stopped      buying from us, we would lose about 400,000 jobs, mostly      high-wage.       Second, a large portion of exports from ``China'' are goods      produced in the main in Hong Kong. Taiwan and Southeast Asia.      The major components are then shipped to China for final      assembly and packaging, but the entire cost of the item      (often only 15% of which was contributed in China) is      attributed to China's export ledger. Exports to the United      States from Hong Kong and Taiwan have declined over the past      decade almost as fast as imports from China have increased.      Yet the companies making the profits are in Hong Kong and      Taiwan, and they will simply shift their operations to      Vietnam or elsewhere if we close down exports from China.       Americans are broadly concerned about the rights and      quality of life of Chinese citizens. My perspective on this      serious issue is influenced by my experience in the U.S. In      my lifetime, women were not allowed the vote, and labor was      not allowed to organize. And, in my lifetime, although the      law did     not permit lynching, it was protected and carried out by      legal officeholders. As time passed, we made progress, and I      doubt if lectures or threats from foreigners would have moved      things faster.       Democracy, including rights for workers, is an evolutionary      process. Isolation and containment will not promote improved      rights for a people. Rather, working together and from within      a society will, over time, promote improved conditions. The      United States-China WTO agreement will speed up the      evolutionary process in China. American labor should support      it because it is in our interest, and it is the interests of      Chinese workers too.                          ____________________
