 BENNETT. The amendment deals with activities on the part of corporations every bit as much as on the part of labor.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Utah.  So this is not about organized labor. It is about how you raise money for political action committees.  It has been said on the floor of the Senate that a political action committee cannot get started without expenditures of soft money. We all know that is not true. There are a number of leadership PACs formed by Members of the Senate and the House. We do not spend soft money to get those leadership PACs up and running. You get a few hard money checks. You file with the FEC. You get a few hard money checks and you are up and running.  Believe me, it is possible to start a PAC without the expenditure of soft money, I say to my friend from Utah. Is that correct?
