Speaker, I rise today in support of this vital agreement brokered between the President and Congressional leaders. This is a must pass bill to bring much-needed relief to those devastated by Hurricane Harvey and those who will be hit by Hurricane Irma. Indeed, it allows for a short-term extension of the debt ceiling to avoid default and keeps our government functional at a time of natural disaster and ongoing crisis.  Thank you to the President and our Leadership for pulling the nation back from the brink again. I hope that it will bring a return to bipartisan compromise and regular order. We must move away from the destabilizing cycle of moving from one manufactured crisis to the next, with no adopted budget for FY 2018 resulting in arbitrary spending allocations passed down from the Majority's Leadership.  Congress should provide the American people with a 2018 final budget to assure a government funded at a level that provides stability and security.  Let's put politics aside and pass this bill. Then, let us embark on bipartisan negotiations to develop a new budget agreement which allows for adequate caps for both defense and non-defense spending.  I urge my colleagues to support this package for the benefit of our nation.                          ____________________
