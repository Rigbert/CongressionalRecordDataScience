President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1998       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``International Child Marriage      Prevention and Protection Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Research shows that child marriage in developing      nations is often associated with adverse economic and social      consequences and is dangerous to the health, security, and      well-being of girls and detrimental to the economic      development of communities.       (2) The issue of child marriage is interwoven with broader      social and cultural issues and is most effectively addressed      as a development challenge through integrated, community-     based approaches to promote and support girls' education and      skill-building and healthcare, legal rights, and awareness      for girls and women.       (3) As Charlotte Ponticelli, Senior Coordinator for      International Women's Issues for the Department of State,      stated on September 14, 2005: ``It is unconscionable that in     the 21st century girls as young as 7 or 8 can be sold as      brides. There is no denying that extreme poverty is the      driving factor that has enabled the practice to continue,      even in countries where it has been outlawed . . . We need to      be shining the spotlight on early marriage and its underlying      causes . . . We must continue to do everything we can to      ensure that girls have every opportunity to become agents of      change and to expand the `realm of what is possible' for      their societies and the world at large.''       (4) The severity of the adverse impact of child marriage      increases as the age at marriage and first childbirth      decreases.       (5) A Department of State survey in 2005 found that child      marriage was a concern in 64 out of 182 countries surveyed      and that the practice is especially acute in sub-Saharan      Africa and South Asia.       (6) According to the United Nations Children's Fund, in      Ethiopia and in parts of West Africa marriage at the age of 7      or 8 is not uncommon.       (7) In developing countries, girls aged 10 to 14 who become      pregnant are 5 times more likely to die in pregnancy or      childbirth than women aged 20 to 24.       (8) Girls in sub-Saharan Africa are at much higher risk of      suffering obstetric fistula.       (9) According to the Department of State: ``Pregnancy at an      early age often leads to obstetric fistulae and permanent      incontinence. In Ethiopia, treatment is available at only 1      hospital in Addis Ababa that performs over 1,000 fistula      operations a year. It estimates that for every successful      operation performed, 10 other young women need the treatment.      The maternal mortality rate is extremely high due, in part,      to food taboos for pregnant women, poverty, early marriage,      and birth complications related to FGM [Female Genital      Mutilation], especially infibulation.''.       (10) Adolescents are at greater risk of complications      during childbirth that can lead to fistula because they have      less access to health care and are subject to other      significant risk factors related to the mother's physical      immaturity.       (11) In nearly every case of obstetric fistula, the baby      will be stillborn.       (12) The physical symptoms of obstetric fistula include      incontinence or constant uncontrollable leaking of urine or      feces, frequent bladder infections, infertility, and foul      odor. The condition often leads to the desertion of fistula      sufferers by husbands and family members and extreme social      stigma.       (13) Although data on obstetric fistula are scarce, the      World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are more      than 2,000,000 women living with fistula and 50,000 to      100,000 new cases each year. These figures are based on the      number of women who seek medical care. Many more suffer from      the disabling condition.       (14) Adolescent girls are more susceptible than mature      women to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, due      to both biological and social factors.       (15) Research in several countries with high rates of HIV      infection indicates that married girls are at greater risk      for HIV than their unmarried peers.       (16) Child marriage can have additional long-term      consequences when combined with female genital cutting      because the girls who have undergone that procedure can      experience greater complications during pregnancy, leading to      lasting health problems for themselves and their children.       (17) Child marriage is a leading barrier to girls'      education in certain developing countries.       (18) A high incidence of child marriage undermines the      efforts of developing countries and donor countries,      including the United States, to promote economic and social      development.       (19) The causes of child marriage include poverty, custom,      and the desire to protect girls from violence or premarital      sexual relations.       (20) Child marriage may also be a product of gender      violence in which a man abducts and rapes a girl and then,      sometimes through negotiations with traditional leaders,      negotiates a settlement with the girl's parents, including      marriage to the victim.       (21) The practice of child marriage is considered a      ``harmful traditional practice'' by the United Nations      Children's Fund.       (22) The Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for      Marriage, and Registration of Marriages, adopted at the      United Nations, December 10, 1962, requires the parties to      the Convention to overcome all ``customs, ancient laws, and      practices by ensuring complete freedom in the choice of a      spouse, eliminating completely child marriages and the      betrothal of young girls before the age of puberty''.       (23) The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the      Child, which entered into force in 1990, provides that      ``child marriage and the betrothal of girls and boys shall be      prohibited and effective action, including legislation, shall      be taken to specify the minimum age of marriage to be      eighteen years''.       (24) In Ethiopia, Girls' Activity Committees, community-     based groups formed to support girls in school and advocate      for girls' education, have conducted community awareness and      informational campaigns, enlisted the assistance of      traditional clan and religious leaders, discouraged families      from practicing child marriage, encouraged girls' school      attendance, and taken steps to reduce gender-based violence      and create safer environments for girls en route to or from      school and in the classroom.       (25) Recognizing the importance of the issue and the      effects of child marriage, the Senior Coordinator for      International Women's Issues of the Department of State      initiated an effort in 2005 to collect and assess information      on the incidence of child marriage and on the existence and      effectiveness of initiatives funded by the United States to      reduce the incidence of child marriage or the negative      effects of child marriage and to measure the need for      additional programs.
