Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. The City of Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Donald ``Dale'' Hines is one of these individuals. On June 22, 2005, Dale was the proud recipient of the Congressional Award Gold Medal.  The Congressional Award is the U.S. Congress' award for young Americans that demonstrate a commitment to community service and physical fitness. This non-partisan, voluntary, and noncompetitive program is open to all 14 to 23-year olds. The Congressional Award challenges young adults to meet goals in four program areas: Volunteer Public Service, Personal Development, Physical Fitness, and Expedition/Exploration. The Congressional Award Gold Medal is the highest honor.one can achieve through this program.  To meet this challenge, Dale enrolled himself in an emergency medical technician (EMT) training school and subsequently graduated at the top of his class. In order to meet the physical demands of his work as an EMT, Dale began to regularly go to the gym and lift weights. Additionally, Dale found a way to match his work with his physical activities by serving on a bike-medic team that provides emergency medical care at special events in the community.  As an active participant in the Boy Scouts of America, Dale serves as an Assistant Council Commissioner for the California Inland Empire Council. He is a past recipient of the Venturing Silver Award and an Eagle Scout. Furthermore, Dale is dedicated to sharing his passion for community service with others and became active in the Buckskin Junior Leader Training program. While at Buckskin, he served as a Camp EMT and Associate Course Director for Physical Arrangements.  Dale's sincere commitment to community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call him a fellow community member and a great American. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and I salute him as he receives the Congressional Award Gold Medal.                          ____________________
