Stand up for America's seniors. You know, if you go to any food bank in this country, senior citizens are coming in at an increasing rate of 37 percent. Just look at the lines.  I ask every one of my Republican colleagues this weekend, when you go home, go to your food banks. Look who's in line. Ask yourself what you're going to do to fix the budget for our senior citizens across this country.  Stand up against the coldhearted Republican budget. It's really the forces of darkness at work in here. Open your eyes to what is happening across this country. Vote against this rule and vote against the underlying budget.  Stand up for the seniors of America. In every family in this country, they've earned the right to have a worry-free existence. This budget hurts them.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Ryan budget and vote against this rule.
