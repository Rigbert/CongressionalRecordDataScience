President I am going to come back at 4 o'clock todaybecause there is something going on. With all the people talking about the atrocities in Libya and throughout the Middle East, there is one more atrocity that is taking place right now in a country called Cote D'Ivoire in West Africa. I want to make sure I get on record in that I believe our State Department is wrong in the position they have taken. I think we can right now avert a real tragedy, something maybe comparable to what happened in 1994 in Rwanda with that genocide. I want to come back and talk about that, but I am going to do that sometime around 4 o'clock this afternoon.                          ____________________
