 I thank him deeply for his comments about my work on this first amendment issue. He has been a steadfast ally throughout this debate, and I appreciate very much his being there when we all needed the Senator to be there when we needed to protect the first amendment.  Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming is here patiently waiting to address the body, and I yield the floor.
