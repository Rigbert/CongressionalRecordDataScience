 During his long career with the House, Chuck has been responsible for providing a broad range of technical support for the electronic systems that make the operations of this body possible. His responsibilities have included the Electronic Voting System, the House Publication System, and the daily production of the Congressional Record. He has contributed to the design, configuration, software development, installation, system testing, vendor contracting, operations, maintenance, user assistance, training, and system documentation of these valuable House systems.  Chuck came to the House in 1976 as a Courier and Production Control Specialist in the HIS Computer Center.  In 1977, he became a Computer Operator tasked with supporting the Electronic Voting System, the Member Correspondence System, and the House Publication System.  In 1980, Chuck was named a Computer Programmer and his projects included the House Legislative Information System, the House Committee Meeting Scheduling System, and the Legislative Database System.  In 1984, he was named Senior Systems Specialist for the Electronic Voting System and the House Publication and Communications System.  Chuck joined the Office of the Clerk in 1989 as an Operations Supervisor and, in addition to his EVS responsibilities, became involved in the House Document Management System and the House Floor Audio System. He was named Technical Manager in 1996.  It was in 1999 that Chuck assumed his present position with the Office of Official Reporters as System Analyst. In that role, he has been responsible for the daily transmission of the Congressional Record to the Government Printing Office each evening, often working into the wee hours of the morning to ensure timely publication of the Record. It only seems appropriate that we honor his service in that Record today.  After dedicated service to this House for 33 years, we wish Chuck the very best as he now has the opportunity to spend more time with his wife, Mary, and his beautiful daughter, Kathleen. He will retire to his home near the Chesapeake Bay and will enjoy fishing, boating, camping and, we hope, strumming his guitar.                          ____________________
