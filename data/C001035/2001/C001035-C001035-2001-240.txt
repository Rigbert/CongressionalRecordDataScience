President, I rise today to introduce the Biomass Energy Equity Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Boxer, my colleague from California. This legislation makes a commonsense change to the renewable energy production tax credit by expanding it to include additional types of biomass plants. I would like to take a few minutes now to discuss the need for this important bill and to describe what it would do.  Simply put, biomass energy production uses combustion to turn wood and organic waste into energy in an environmentally sound process. Biomass takes a public liability, organic waste, and converts it into a public asset, energy.  The renewable energy production tax credit enacted in 1992 provides incentives to the solid-fuel biomass and wind energy industry to develop economically viable and environmentally responsible renewable sources of electricity. In enacting that legislation, Congress recognized that biomass energy offers substantial environmental benefits, specifically a reduced dependence on oil and coal, a desirable alternative to open field burnings and the landfilling of organic material, and a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Unfortunately, the 1992 legislation was drafted too narrowly to realize the full benefits of biomass energy production. The 1992 act narrowly defined an eligible biomass facility as including only so-called closed-loop biomass plants. Closed-loop biomass is a hypothetical form of electricity generation where the fuel is planted, grown, and harvested specifically and solely for the fuel of the power plant. This definition rules out the significant environmental benefit of disposal of organic waste otherwise destined for a landfill or field-burning and, therefore, remains unused. Since the biomass tax credit was passed, no taxpayer, not one, has taken advantage of the tax benefit.  Simply put, the closed-loop tax credit is not a sufficient incentive to develop a costly ``fuel plantation,'' which entails large-scale land purchases, property taxes, and growing material for the sole purpose of burning it. By demanding that newly grown material be used rather than organic waste, the closed-loop biomass definition flies in the face of the commonly accepted environmental principle that products should be put to as many ``highest value'' uses as possible.  The legislation that I introduce today would expand the eligibility of the biomass tax credit to include conventional biomass plants. This legislation is designed to encourage a source of energy generation that offers substantial air quality, waste management, and greenhouse gas reduction benefits. The national biomass industry currently uses over 22,000,000 tons of wood waste a year. The waste the biomass industry converts into energy otherwise would be disposed of in one of three ways: burned in an open field, which generates pollution instead of energy; landfilled, where it fills limited landfill space and biodegrades, emitting methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases; or left in the woods or fields, increasing the risk and severity of forest fires.  The air quality benefits of biomass energy are of particular importance. According to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an organization of all the Northeastern States' Air Quality Bureaus, biomass energy produces less nitrogen oxide than alternatives and generates virtually no sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or mercury. Biomass energy production also results in a net reduction of greenhouse gases.  In addition to their environmental benefits, biomass plants contribute to the economy of many rural towns throughout America. Because of their dependence on organic waste, biomass facilities are usually located in rural areas where they are often important engines of economic growth. For example, in the small town of Sherman, Maine, a biomass facility provides 56 percent of the property tax base. It also directly employs 24 individuals and indirectly provides work for hundreds of truck drivers, wood operators, mill workers and maintenance contractors.  In another small town of Maine, Athens, a biomass facility provides a thirdof that small town's tax base and directly employs 20 people, while supporting a local wood operator who, in turn, employs 40 people.  The point is, the economy in many of the small towns in Maine, in towns such as Livermore, Ashland, Greenville, Fort Fairfield, Stratton, and West Enfield benefit considerably from these biomass facilities. In total, there are over 100 biomass facilities in the United States, representing an investment in excess of $7 billion. These facilities contribute jobs, property taxes and a disposal point for waste products. In addition, rural biomass facilities provide ash for use by local farmers, reducing their purchases of lime. I understand there is regularly more demand for the ash produced by these biomass plants than there is supply.  With biomass energy production, nothing is wasted. Biomass turns waste products--the byproducts of timber, paper or farming operations--into needed energy, wasting nothing. Even the ash is returned to the earth to grow organic matter yielding both crops and waste to generate still more electricity.  We in Congress often discuss ways to help rural America. This proposal offers an opportunity to do so in a manner that not only benefits the economy of small towns in rural America but also in a way that generates considerable environmental benefits.  This measure makes both economic and environmental sense. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Boxer and me in supporting this important legislation and working for its passage.                                 ______                                       By
