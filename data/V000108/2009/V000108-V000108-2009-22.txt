Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award each year at this annual banquet.  The Asian American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and they have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's charity ball, the Asian American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Mr. Gary Mitchell, President and CEO of Opportunity Enterprises, Inc., a non-profit organization that serves to create opportunities for individuals with unique challenges and abilities. From the beginning, social work was not only a career choice for Gary but a way of life. Focused on his calling, Gary graduated from Ball State University with a bachelor's degree in social work and went on to receive his master's degree in social work from Indiana University. After college, Gary held many positions in the social service field, and he also has years of experience in business and industry.  In 1986, Gary joined the team at Opportunity Enterprises as the Chief Executive Officer. Opportunity Enterprises has enjoyed unprecedented success under Gary's leadership. The company has continued to grow and expand. In 1986, the organization served 263 individuals with disabilities on a daily basis. Since then, Opportunity Enterprises has shown immense growth and now serves over 1,000 individuals. Gary has made it his goal to provide day services, residential programs, and vocational opportunities for individuals of all ages, whether they have physical, emotional, or developmental disabilities. For the past 15 years, Opportunity Enterprises has received the three-year accreditation for the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), a not-for-profit organization that establishes standards of quality for service to people with disabilities. In addition, for his efforts on behalf of his community, Gary has received numerous honors, including the President's Award in 1992 and the Sagamore of the Wabash in 1993 from then-Governor of Indiana, Evan Bayh. For his selfless and passionate support for helping individuals to re-establish their roles in community life, Gary is to be commended and admired. He is truly an inspiration.  Gary's dedication to the people he serves is matched only by his devotion to his family. Gary has been married to his wife, Paula, for 42 years. They have three children and seven grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Mr. Gary Mitchell, for their outstanding contributions to their communities and beyond. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States is truly inspirational. For these reasons, the Asian American Medical Association, its members, and Mr. Mitchell are to be recognized, and I am proud to serve as their representative in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
