President, last week there was a terrible tragedy affecting the United Nations' World Food Program. This occurred when one of their planes crashed in Kosovo on an errand of mercy.  Since its inception in 1963, the World Food Program has been the United Nations' front line for fighting hunger throughout the world. It is the world's largest food aid organization.  Last year, the World Food Program assisted 75 million people in 80 countries around the world. This summer I observed their operations in Kosovo. In fact, at one point I was invited to fly on the same plane that crashed, to go and see what they were doing.  The World Food Program's mission is to eradicate hunger. I think that in the last seven years it has moved closer and closer to accomplishing this goal under the leadership of Executive Director Catherine Bertini. I was very proud to support Catherine when she was appointed to be executive director in 1992, during the administration of President Bush. She became the first woman to head the World Food Program. I have been a strong supporter for her ever since. She has done a great job as executive director, and I am glad that she continues to lead the World Food Program today.  For many, the World Food Program is known for its emergency response efforts. It was one of the first organizations to move into the Balkan region when the conflict in Kosovo began.  As I mentioned earlier, during the August recess I visited the World Food Program and met with Catherine Bertini and talked to her about how their efforts were going. I believe they are doing a great job. Areas which had previously been empty fields have been transformed into makeshift cities where thousands of people seeking safety, food and shelter have found relief, thanks to the efforts of the World Food Program, Catholic Relief Services and other international organizations.  But emergency relief efforts such as this reflect only a portion of the World Food Program's responsibilities. The World Food Program's Food for Work programs feed millions of chronically hungry people worldwide. They contribute more grants to developing countries than any other United Nations agency. That is why so many people around the world felt the same degree of sadness that I and others in the Senate did when we learned of the plane crash on Friday in which a World Food Program plane, en route from Rome to Pristina, crashed into a mountain ridge just miles from their destination, killing all 24 people aboard the plane.  The passengers aboard this plane were an international group of aid workers. They were all headed to Kosovo to become part of the humanitarian mission there. In a war-torn area, these were 24 people going to bring solace, aid, and help to people who have seen so little of it over the years. They were people who were motivated by the greatest sense of charity and giving to their fellow human beings. They worked for U.N. agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies, all united by a sense of humanitarianism.  The loss of these individuals is going to be felt throughout the world. They were people who demonstrated over and over again that their fellow human beings were the most important things in their lives. Their deaths are a major loss to their families, as well as the organizations, including the World Food Program, for which they worked.  I send my sincere condolences to the families of those killed in this tragic crash, and I hope the world will understand they have lost 24 of their finest people.
