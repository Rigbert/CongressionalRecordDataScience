President, I wish to clarify a few things. The Parliamentarian referred the bill to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was reported favorably by that committee. It was referred to the Senate Banking Committee, but I made a point with Senator Boozman, our colleague on the Republican side, of taking this bill to the Banking Committee, which clearly shows this is not an attempt to go around this committee. I have the greatest respect for the Members of the Banking Committee on both sides and we have done our best to work with them.  Secondly, this argument that we have to get out of the business of having government support for business activity is a naive argument. Let me give just a couple numbers to reflect on, when it comes to the future of our chances of American businesses working successfully to export to Africa.  Right now, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has supplied the support of about $1 trillion in 2011 for all exports to Africa. Some of these are guarantees on loans. Some of them allow for lower interest rates because the guarantees do exist. But let me tell my colleagues what is happening with the Chinese at the same time. While we are putting in $1 trillion in Africa, the Chinese are putting in $12 trillion. Who is going to win that competition? When it is all over, who will win that competition? By a margin of 12 to 1 the Chinese will win it. Many of those who say they support business and new jobs for America basically want to abandon the field and walk away from it. They want to let the Chinese take it away: We are going to play free market, that is all; no government involvement. We are just going to have a flatout arms' length transaction with these countries--and we will end up with fewer jobs in America, fewer exports to Africa, fewer businesses working on that continent.  Some people say: Why did you pick Africa? Of all the places, we could have picked Asia or all these different places. When we take a look at the indicators, the African Continent is undergoing a period of rapid growth and middle-class development that most Americans aren't even aware of. In the year 2000, 6.7 percent of the population of Africa had access to the Internet. Talk about the Dark Ages: 6.7 percent, in 2000. By 2009, it had grown from 6.7 percent to 27.1 percent of the population with access to the Internet. Seventy-eight percent of Africa's rural population now has access to clean water. Our images of a backward continent are just plain wrong. Our opportunities are unlimited but not if we ignore the reality. The Chinese are going to outthink us and outwork us and we are going to lose and we will ultimately say: We are pure of heart. We are not going to have our government in this. The Chinese may want to do it. We will just give up the jobs that could have come to America. We will give up the opportunity for businesses to export to Africa from the United States. What a terrible outcome that is. It truly is shortsighted. It argues for a good economic theory but one that doesn't reflect the reality of the world we live in today.  After all these months of hard work by a bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen, we come down to one objection. That is how the Senate works. I know it and I respect it. Each Senator has a right to make an objection. I wish to applaud my colleague from Pennsylvania for coming to the floor and saying it in his own words. Many times this is done in secrecy without any disclosure of who is behind a hold or an objection, and I salute the Senator from Pennsylvania for his honesty in coming to the floor, even though we obviously disagree on this important issue.                          ____________________
