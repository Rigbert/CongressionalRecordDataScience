President, since the early 1980s, Congress has provided legislative authority for Supreme Court Police to protect Supreme Court Justices, their employees, and guests when they leave the Supreme Court grounds. That authority is set to expire at the end of next month and merits extension. The House voted by an overwhelming majority of 399 to 3 to pass a bipartisan bill which would extend this authority through 2019. All Democrats have cleared this bill for passage. I urge the minority to do the same so the Senate may swiftly pass this extension to ensure the continued safety of our Supreme Court Justices and their employees.                          ____________________
