. Navy Destroyer U.S.S. Cassin Young, DD-793.  The ship today is moored with the U.S.S. Constitution in Charlestown, MA, and has been open to the public under the custody of the National Park Service since 1981.  The Cassin Young was constructed at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyards in San Pedro, CA, and commissioned on December 31, 1943. She was named for Captain Cassin Young, a true naval hero who received the Medal of Honor for valor during the attack on Pearl Harbor and who later lost his life during the great naval battle off Guadalcanal on Friday, November 13, 1942.  From early 1944 until the end of World War II in 1946, the U.S.S. Cassin Young was involved in active combat operations. She suffered strafing off the island of Formosa in 1944 and withstood two Japanese kamikaze attacks, one of them causing heavy damage. Despite this damage, the U.S.S. Cassin Young was repaired locally and returned to the battle line. The ship was the last destroyer to be struck by a kamikaze during the fight for Okinawa, a battle that was so destructive to the U.S. destroyer fleet. The U.S.S. Cassin Young lost 21 crew members and saw approximately 100 others injured in combat.  At war's end, the U.S.S. Cassin Young rested in mothballs until the Korean War brought expansion of the U.S. fleet and she was recommissioned on September 7, 1951, in Long Beach, CA. During her second tour of active duty, the U.S.S. Cassin Young operated with both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Fleets and completed a voyage around the world to the Philippines and Korea. She returned to the western hemisphere via the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in April 1960.  In addition to her many Service Ribbons and Battle Stars, the U.S.S. Cassin Young received the Navy Unit Citation and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for her actions during World War II and also was given the Korean Presidential Unit Citation during the Korean War.  In 1978, the National Park Service acquired the U.S.S. Cassin Young and painstakingly restored her to the configuration under which she sailed in the 1950s. Ceremonies commemorating the second commissioning of the U.S.S. Cassin Young are scheduled to take place on August 18, 2001, when the ship will undertake a towed sea trial of Boston Harbor. Some 500 individuals, including many of the original crew members from both of her tours of duty, will be on board the ship as it tours the waters off Massachusetts' capital city. Former crew members and friends of the ship have created the U.S.S. Cassin Young Association, which counts more than 400 men and women among its members.  Through the U.S.S. Cassin Young, the citizens of this country and visitors from abroad have the opportunity to experience firsthand an heroic vessel that represents the sacrifices of our Naval personnel during not one, but two, wars.  It is my sincere desire that the U.S.S. Cassin Young remain available to the people of this country far into the future so that she and those who served aboard her may continue to receive the honor they so deserve.                          ____________________
