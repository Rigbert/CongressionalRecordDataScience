 President, I have one final question for the chairman of the Commerce Committee for purposes of clarifying that the intent of Congress with the Telecommunications Act is to ensure that the marketplace, not the U.S. Government or a regulatory body, decides who the winners and losers in this industry will be. In the case of the strict financial standard imposed by the FCC for satellite system applicants, it seems to me that rather than making a judgment on what the FCC may feel is a company's financial ability to compete, perhaps the FCC should focus more on technical considerations for licenses, leaving the ultimate success or failure of an applicant to the marketplace where it appropriately belongs. Will the chairman continue to work with me and others to ensure that the FCC implements the law according to our intent, particularly as this relates to small and entrepreneurial ventures and financial standards applicable to these important participants?
