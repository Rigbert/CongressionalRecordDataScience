Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the educational community are exceptional. The University of California at Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their university, and community, a better place to learn, live and work. Charles Louis, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCR, is one of these individuals. After eight years of dedicated service, Charles will be retiring from UCR.  Dr. Louis' biomedical research on the role of calcium as an intracellular signaling molecule, which has been funded by the National Institutes of Health for over 25 years, uses a range of different approaches including cell physiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, and biophysics. His current research program focuses on the role of gap junctions in the development of cataracts in the lens of the eye because an elevation in cytosolic calcium concentration which closes these cell-to-cell channels is one of the critical early steps in the development of lens cataract formation. Dr. Louis is Chair of the Executive Committee of the Council of Research Policy and Graduate Education (CRPGE) of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) serving on the Board of Directors of APLU, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Council on Government Relations (COGR); he has served on many peer-review grant committees as well as the boards of biotech industry associations in both Minnesota and Georgia.  Dr. Louis served as Vice President for Research at Georgia State University from 2000 2004, having previously served on the faculty at the University of Minnesota for over 20 years where he held a number of administrative positions that included Head of the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics from 1998 2000 and Assistant Vice President for Research and Associate Dean of the Graduate School from 1994 1998. He previously held faculty appointments at the University of Connecticut Health Center, and Leeds University in England.  Dr. Louis received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, his Doctorate of Philosophy in Biochemistry from Oxford University, and post-doctoral training at Stanford University.  Dr. Louis' many accomplishments at UCR have included the growth of sponsored funding last year to $115 million, the establishment of a very successful Office of Technology Commercialization, and the management of the ever-increasing compliance demands that have been placed on universities by the federal government. He led the successful accreditation of UCR's human research protection program, and has worked on higher education committees of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities and of the Council of Government Relations. We have benefited from his advocacy and strong voice for ensuring that UCR receive its fair share of research funding available from UCOP VP Research, and for his excellent working relationships with many UCR faculty that have included the establishment of a number of very successful collaborative research programs with Chinese research institutions.  In light of all Dr. Louis has done for the science community and education it is only fitting that we take a moment to thank him for his life's work. Dr. Louis' tireless passion for knowledge, science and education has contributed immensely to academia. Dr. Louis' contributions to his field will continue to resonate and I know that many individuals are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires and moves on toward the next phase in his life.                          ____________________
