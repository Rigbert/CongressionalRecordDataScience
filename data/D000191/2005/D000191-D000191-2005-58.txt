  Mr. DeFAZIO. Republicans hope to jam through a reconciliation the day before Veterans' Day, including $54 billion in cuts. He talked about a helping hand? Doubling the origination fee for student loans, cutting $14 billion in student loans is a helping hand for the next generation of Americans? Cutting foster care, school lunches, Medicaid, not to reduce the budget deficit but to make room for $70 billion of tax cuts for people who earn over $300,000 a year. That is what they are doing.  We should reconcile a few things around here. Let us reconcile their hypocrisy. Let us reconcile their purported support for the troops and our vets with the fact that the budget is inadequate to provide promised benefits, and they are doing nothing about that in the budget reconciliation.  Let's have some reconciliation and do things that are right for America.                          ____________________[Page H9969]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  THE RIGHT RECONCILIATION FOR AMERICA  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
