Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, I am very pleased to offer this commonsense, bipartisan enforcement amendment with my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).  When I became chairman last year, one of the first things I did was to invite the then new chairman of the FCC, Chairman Powell, to appear before the subcommittee to present his vision for that agency. The thing that struck me most was his message that the FCC's current enforcement authority was in fact too weak, and that the FCC's current fines were viewed by many as simply the cost of doing business for many companies.                              {time}  1415  And I heard that from many competitive carriers as well.  In a letter to Congress last year, Chairman Powell specifically wrote that, among other things, Congress should consider increasing the cap on fines to at least $10 million in order to enhance their deterrent effect. The current cap, of course, is at $1.2 million.  Responding to Chairman Powell's recommendation, we are, in fact, offering this bipartisan amendment which will substantially increase the FCC's fines for phone companies which violate the telecommunications law by elevating the current cap from $1.2 million to $10 million and increasing the amount up to which the FCC can impose per violation or each day of a continuing violation from $120,000 to $1 million. We did exactly what Chairman Powell requested.  In addition, for repeat offenders the amendment doubles the increased fines up to $2 million per violation or each day of a continuing violation capped at $20 million.  The amendment also doubles from 1 to 2 years the statute of limitations for the FCC to bring enforcement actions against phone companies, which will give the FCC a better opportunity to thoroughly investigate an alleged violation and bring charges. Chairman Powell also asked for this.  We also give the FCC clear, statutory cease and desist authority to use against phone companies which violate any of the telecommunications laws.  Finally, we direct the FCC to study the impact of the enhanced fines under the bill and report back to us, the Congress, one year after enactment.  The amendment applies to all common carriers. For example, it would affect not only a Bell company's violation of the Telecommunications Act but also a long distance company's slamming as well.  It is important to note that these substantially increased fines would not be the only enforcement mechanisms facing the Bell companies. For example, there is also the existing Section 208 complaint process at which the FCC through which a Bell company could be liable for damages. Moreover, some Bell companies must also pay if they fail to meet performance goals established by the FCC in their merger agreements, that was part of the Rush amendment that we accepted in the committee, not to mention the literally millions of State PUC-enforced performance measures penalties which get assessed as well.  We hope you will support our efforts to greatly enhance the FCC's enforcement authority as we seek to accelerate the deployment of broadband high-speed Internet access to underserved areas in our country through the passage of the underlying bill, H.R. 1542.  I want to thank in particular the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella), obviously, as well as my co-sponsor, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), for their good work on this issue throughout the process. I would urge the passage of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
