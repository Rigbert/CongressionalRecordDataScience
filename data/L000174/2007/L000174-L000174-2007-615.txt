President, William Odom is one of the finest intelligence officers who have served in our military. Retiring at the rank of lieutenant general, his distinguished Army career culminated in his heading up the U.S. Army's intelligence division and the National Security Agency. He has worked tirelessly to help the country understand and deal with the challenges to its security and defense. I have known the general for decades, and, like many of my colleagues, I deeply value his judgment and insight.  That is why I read his opinion piece from last Sunday's Washington Post, ``Victory is Not an Option,'' with great interest.  General Odom lays out the truths and myths of the Nation's involvement in Iraq. Among the clear truths is that the dream of a real democracy gaining roots in that war-torn country is simply that, a dream. He rightly points out, too, that any Iraqi government is likely to be more anti than pro-American at the end of the day.  As for the myths, he sensibly lays out that it is pure fantasy for anyone to think that our presence is actually preventing the horrible carnage from unfolding or holding Iran back from gaining influence with its neighbor. It is similarly a flight of the imagination to think that our military presence is actually stanching--as opposed to encouraging--al-Qaida's involvement in the country. Finally, it is a myth to think that we must stay in Iraq ``to support the troops.'' In fact, he notes, many of our brave men and women in the country understand the cold realities that unfold there every day, and many of them believe that we should get out of Iraq.  General Odom makes some sensible suggestions for a new policy direction, something beyond the absurd ``surge'' that is only the same old repast of stay-the-course with a different seasoning. We should get out of Iraq and recognize that our presence there has become a source of instability for the whole Middle East. He smartly suggests that we should work with our international partners to seek order and stability, which will fundamentally alter the balance against the radicals who want to stir up even more strife.  I ask unanimous consent that General Odom's article, ``Victory Is Not an Option,'' now be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to read this article closely and truly think about what General Odom is saying. The logic is clear and sensible. I think it is incontrovertible.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 2007]                        Victory Is Not an Option                          (By William E. Odom)       The new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq starkly      delineates the gulf that separates President Bush's illusions      from the realities of the war. Victory, as the president sees      it, requires a stable liberal democracy in Iraq that is pro-     American. The NIE describes a war that has no chance of      producing that result. In this critical respect, the NIE, the      consensus judgment of all the U.S. intelligence agencies, is      a declaration of defeat.       Its gloomy implications--hedged, as intelligence agencies      prefer, in rubbery language that cannot soften its impact--     put the intelligence community and the American public on the      same page. The public awakened to the reality of failure in      Iraq last year and turned the Republicans out of control of      Congress to wake it up. But a majority of its members are      still asleep, or only half-awake to their new writ to end the      war soon.       Perhaps this is not surprising. Americans do not warm to      defeat or failure, and our politicians are famously reluctant      to admit their own responsibility for anything resembling      those un-American outcomes. So they beat around the bush,      wringing hands and debating ``nonbinding resolutions'' that      oppose the president's plan to increase the number of U.S.      troops in Iraq.       For the moment, the collision of the public's clarity of      mind, the president's relentless pursuit of defeat and      Congress's anxiety has paralyzed us. We may be doomed to two      more years of chasing the mirage of democracy in Iraq and      possibly widening the war to Iran. But this is not      inevitable. A Congress, or a president, prepared to quit the      game of ``who gets the blame'' could begin to alter American      strategy in ways that will vastly improve the prospects of a      more stable Middle East.       No task is more important to the well-being of the United      States. We face great peril in that troubled region, and      improving our prospects will be difficult. First of all, it      will require, from Congress at least, public acknowledgment      that the president's policy is based on illusions, not      realities. There never has been any right way to invade and      transform Iraq. Most Americans need no further convincing,      but two truths ought to put the matter beyond question:       First, the assumption that the United States could create a      liberal, constitutional democracy in Iraq defies just about      everything known by professional students of the topic. Of      the more than 40 democracies created since World War II,      fewer than 10 can be considered truly ``constitutional''--     meaning that their domestic order is protected by a broadly      accepted rule of law, and has survived for at least a      generation. None is a country with Arabic and Muslim      political cultures. None has deep sectarian and ethnic      fissures like those in Iraq.       Strangely, American political scientists whose business it      is to know these things have been irresponsibly quiet. In the      lead-up to the March 2003 invasion, neoconservative agitators      shouted insults at anyone who dared to mention the many      findings of academic research on how democracies evolve.      They also ignored our own struggles over two centuries to      create the democracy Americans enjoy today. Somehow Iraqis      are now expected to create a constitutional order in a      country with no conditions favoring it.       This is not to say that Arabs cannot become liberal      democrats. When they immigrate to the United States, many do      so quickly. But it is to say that Arab countries, as well as      a large majority of all countries, find creating a stable      constitutional democracy beyond their capacities.       Second, to expect any Iraqi leader who can hold his country      together to be pro-American, or to share American goals, is      to abandon common sense. It took the United States more than      a century to get over its hostility toward British      occupation. (In 1914, a majority of the public favored      supporting Germany against Britain.) Every month of the U.S.      occupation, polls have recorded Iraqis' rising animosity      toward the United States. Even supporters of an American      military presence say that it is acceptable temporarily and      only to prevent either of the warring sides in Iraq from      winning. Today the Iraqi government survives only because its      senior members and their families live within the heavily      guarded Green Zone, which houses the U.S. Embassy and      military command.       As Congress awakens to these realities--and a few members      have bravely pointed them out--will it act on them? Not      necessarily. Too many lawmakers have fallen for the myths      that are invoked to try to sell the president's new war aims.      Let us consider the most pernicious of them.       (1) We must continue the war to prevent the terrible      aftermath that will occur if our forces are withdrawn soon.      Reflect on the double-think of this formulation. We are now      fighting to prevent what our invasion made inevitable!      Undoubtedly we will leave a mess--the mess we created, which      has become worse each year we have remained. Lawmakers      gravely proclaim their opposition to the war, but in the next      breath express fear that quitting it will leave a blood bath,      a civil war, a terrorist haven, a ``failed state,'' or some      other horror. But this ``aftermath'' is already upon us; a      prolonged U.S. occupation cannot prevent what already exists.       (2) We must continue the war to prevent Iran's influence      from growing in Iraq. This is another absurd notion. One of      the president's initial war aims, the creation of a democracy      in Iraq, ensured increased Iranian influence, both in Iraq      and the region. Electoral democracy, predictably, would put      Shiite groups in power--groups supported by Iran since Saddam      Hussein repressed them in 1991. Why are so many members of      Congress swallowing the claim that prolonging the war is now      supposed to prevent precisely what starting the war      inexorably and predictably caused? Fear that Congress will      confront this contradiction helps explain the administration      and neocon drumbeat we now hear for expanding the war to      Iran.       Here we see shades of the Nixon-Kissinger strategy in      Vietnam: widen the war into Cambodia and Laos. Only this      time, the adverse consequences would be far greater. Iran's      ability to hurt U.S. forces in Iraq are not trivial. And the      anti-American backlash in the region would be larger, and      have more lasting consequences.       (3) We must prevent the emergence of a new haven for al-     Qaeda in Iraq. But it was the U.S. invasion that opened      Iraq's doors to al-Qaeda. The longer U.S. forces have      remained there, the stronger al-Qaeda has become. Yet its      strength within the Kurdish     and Shiite areas is trivial. After a U.S. withdrawal, it will      probably play a continuing role in helping the Sunni groups      against the Shiites and the Kurds. Whether such foreign      elements could remain or thrive in Iraq after the resolution      of civil war is open to question. Meanwhile, continuing the      war will not push al-Qaeda outside Iraq. On the contrary, the      American presence is the glue that holds al-Qaeda there now.       (4) We must continue to fight in order to ``support the      troops.'' This argument effectively paralyzes almost all      members of Congress. Lawmakers proclaim in grave tones a      litany of problems in Iraq sufficient to justify a rapid      pullout. Then they reject that logical conclusion, insisting      we cannot do so because we must support the troops. Has      anybody asked the troops?       During their first tours, most may well have favored      ``staying the course''--whatever that meant to them--but now      in their second, third and fourth tours, many are changing      their minds. We see evidence of that in the many news stories      about unhappy troops being sent back to Iraq. Veterans groups      are beginning to make public the case for bringing them home.      Soldiers and officers in Iraq are speaking out critically to      reporters on the ground.       But the strangest aspect of this rationale for continuing      the war is the implication that the troops are somehow      responsible for deciding to continue the president's course.      That political and moral responsibility belongs to the      president, not the troops. Did not President Harry S. Truman      make it clear that ``the buck stops'' in the Oval Office? If      the president keeps dodging it, where does it stop? With      Congress?       Embracing the four myths gives Congress excuses not to      exercise its power of the purse to end the war and open the      way for a strategy that might actually bear fruit.       The first and most critical step is to recognize that      fighting on now simply prolongs our losses and blocks the way      to a new strategy. Getting out of Iraq is the pre-condition      for creating new strategic options. Withdrawal will take away      the conditions that allow our enemies in the region to enjoy      our pain. It will awaken those European states reluctant to      collaborate with us in Iraq and the region.       Second, we must recognize that the United States alone      cannot stabilize the Middle East.       Third, we must acknowledge that most of our policies are      actually destabilizing the region. Spreading democracy, using      sticks to try to prevent nuclear proliferation, threatening      ``regime change,'' using the hysterical rhetoric of the      ``global war on terrorism''--all undermine the stability we      so desperately need in the Middle East.       Fourth, we must redefine our purpose. It must be a stable      region, not primarily a democratic Iraq. We must redirect our      military operations so they enhance rather than undermine      stability. We can write off the war as a ``tactical draw''      and make ``regional stability'' our measure of ``victory.''      That single step would dramatically realign the opposing      forces in the region, where most states want stability. Even      many in the angry mobs of young Arabs shouting profanities      against the United States want predictable order, albeit on      better social and economic terms than they now have.       Realigning our diplomacy and military capabilities to      achieve order will hugely reduce the numbers of our enemies      and gain us new and important allies. This cannot happen,      however, until our forces are moving out of Iraq. Why should      Iran negotiate to relieve our pain as long as we are      increasing its influence in Iraq and beyond? Withdrawal will      awaken most leaders in the region to their own need for U.S.-     led diplomacy to stabilize their neighborhood.       If Bush truly wanted to rescue something of his historical      legacy, he would seize the initiative to implement this kind      of strategy. He would eventually be held up as a leader      capable of reversing direction by turning an imminent, tragic      defeat into strategic recovery.       If he stays on his present course, he will leave Congress      the opportunity to earn the credit for such a turnaround. It      is already too late to wait for some presidential candidate      for 2008 to retrieve the situation. If Congress cannot act,      it, too, will live in infamy.                          ____________________
