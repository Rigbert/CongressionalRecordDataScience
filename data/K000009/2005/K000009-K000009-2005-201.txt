Speaker, I rise today to recognize longtime community resident Robert``Bob'' Burger for his leadership, determination and dedication as a community leader in Toledo, Ohio.  Bob Burger, ``Mr. Neighborhood,'' who recently turned 80 years old, has given unselfishly of his time and ability to help rebuild and revitalize our city, particularly the East Toledo neighborhoods. Beginning in his home community of East Toledo and then extending his reach for community betterment city wide, he started this quest back in 1972 when he founded River East Associates and served as its first president. Mr. Burger also played a major part in the creation of River East Revitalization Corporation in 1974; that organization helped create a comprehensive plan for redevelopment of East Toledo's main business district along Main Street, Front Street and Starr Avenue.  Mr. Burger is particularly well known in our community as a director of the Neighborhood Improvement Foundation of Toledo, Incorporated (NIFTI) from 1978 through 1994. He is also well known in our community as a veterans leader. He is currently commander of the Arthur Daly American Legion Post 334 and he previously served as commander of the Veterans of Foreign War Post 2510 in 1974 and 1975.  No one of us can ask more than to be given the years to do good for others. Bob Burger's patriotic dedications have yielded exactly that--and inspired an entire city to take hold of itself and transform it parcel by parcel, block by block into the Toledo for tomorrow. The power of his gentle personality, his kindness, skill, and vision have helped enlarge and build forward a real ethic of community in Toledo. How fortunate we are.  Such are his contributions to our community that Toledo City Council has begun the process of renaming a portion of Starr Avenue as ``Bob Burger Avenue,'' which is only appropriate because it is located in the heart of the River East Main business district that Mr. Burger has done so much to promote and advance. For his part in revitalizing one of our great communities, I wish to recognize the contributions of Robert Burger and congratulate him on having a street renamed in his honor. It is particularly appropriate to name a major arterial in his home community in his honor for surely he has been a lifeline to the citizens of the community.                          ____________________
