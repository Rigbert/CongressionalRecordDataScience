 National Police Week is a time to thank all those whose service preserves the rule of law, at great risk to themselves.  I wish to pay special tribute to one of those heroes today, Officer Bryan J. Durman. Officer Durman was a 27-year-old, decorated, Lexington, KY, police officer and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. He was, tragically, the first Lexington police officer to die in the line of duty in over 20 years.  This past April 29, he was responding to a noise complaint when he was struck by a car and killed. He leaves behind his wife Brandy and their 4-year-old son Brayden.  Bryan Durman went to Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, where he was on the wrestling team. After graduation in 2001, he enlisted with the Air Force. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant and served in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. More important, it was while serving in the Air Force that Bryan met Brandy, his wife.  Bryan's mother, Margaret Durman, says that from the time her son was a small boy, she knew he would grow up to be a peacemaker. After leaving Air Force service in July 2007, Bryan returned to Lexington to keep the peace here at home and was accepted into the Lexington police academy.  In his 3 years of service with the Lexington metro police department, Bryan earned great respect from his colleagues and the community. ``
