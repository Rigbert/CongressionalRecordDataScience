President, Senator Reid and I would like to offer a few observations at this point. I thank my colleagues for allowing us to proceed before them regarding the general order.  We want to offer a few observations with respect to what I understand is a proposal to remove Federal Judges and Justices from the prohibition on honoraria, a proposal that would also remove the honoraria from the limitation on outside earned income. I strongly oppose that effort.  This seems manifestly a very wrong approach to what may be a very real problem.
