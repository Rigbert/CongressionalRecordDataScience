President, I would like to begin my remarks today speaking about a topic that I have been involved with, along with many of my colleagues for months now. That is LIHEAP funding.  If you look at a weather map, you will see that temperatures across much of the United States are only expected to be in the thirties and forties today. Winter has finally arrived. In Providence, the high is only projected to be 19 degrees. A nor'easter is on its way up the east coast; they forecast snow that will hit here in the DC area tomorrow, all the way up to New England, and so winter has arrived.  I wanted to mention the weather forecast because we are at the end of the second week of February, and there is no new funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and as far as I know, there are no plans by the majority to bring to the Senate a vote on a $2 billion LIHEAP funding proposal. This funding proposal was removed from the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report. It was one of a few items that was stripped out, there were many other nondefense items that were included in the Defense Appropriations conference report in December, but for some reason this was dropped. I think a reason it is adversely affecting thousands and thousands of Americans across the country, ranging from the Northeast into the mid-Atlantic, across the Midwest, out into the far West. People are struggling with rising energy prices, and today, falling temperatures.  On Monday, a bipartisan letter signed by 34 Governors urged Congress to pass $2 billion in immediate additional LIHEAP assistance. These are Governors from across the country, Governors that are of both party affiliations, Governors who are trying to respond to these conditions of both weather and extraordinary price increases.  The letter states:       LIHEAP applications are projected to increase by as much as      25 percent in some States . . . If Congress does not increase      LIHEAP funding in the next few weeks, state programs across      the country could run dry and the number of households unable      to meet their basic heating needs could skyrocket.  I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 6, 2006.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker, House of Representatives.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives.       Dear Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Speaker Hastert, and      Representative Pelosi: For several months this winter, states      have taken steps to help assure that our most vulnerable      residents are not overwhelmed by the sharp rise in home      heating costs. This has often meant significant state      contributions to emergency relief funds or supplementing      existing state-federal programs. Despite these actions by the      states and the record cost of energy nationwide, federal      funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program      (LIHEAP) reflects a net decrease from the previous fiscal      year's total. We urge Congress to join the, states in meeting      the well-documented need for additional home heating      assistance by passing $2 billion in immediate additional      LIHEAP assistance.       Governors supported the progress that was made when LIHEAP      was authorized at $5.1 billion in the Energy Policy Act of      2005, but were disappointed when Congress appropriated only      $2.16 billion for FY 2006. While we appreciate the      President's recent release of an additional $100 million of      emergency LIHEAP funds and Congress' proposal to add $1      billion for FY 2007, urgent action is needed to address the      Energy Information Administration (EIA)'s prediction of a 30      to 70 percent rise in consumer energy costs this winter.       Covering dramatic increases in natural gas and heating oil      prices presents a potential hardship for our citizens. LIHEAP      applications are projected to increase by as much as 25% in      some states. As noted above, many states, energy industry      leaders, and private citizens have done their part by      increasing investments in the program. We are asking     you to join us by sending legislation to the President that      provides enough funding to meet our low-income citizens'      energy needs for 2006. If Congress: does not increase LIHEAP      funding in the next few weeks, state programs across the      country could run dry, and the number of households unable to      meet their basic heating needs could skyrocket.       Our states are in the process of documenting the potential      shortfalls in LIHEAP funding and the supplemental funding      states have already provided. We look forward to sharing that      information with you shortly. Thank you for your      consideration of this request and your continued commitment      to assisting our neediest families. We hope that you will      take this opportunity to actively support the LIHEAP program.           Sincerely,         Governor Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska; Governor Janet            Napolitano, Arizona; Governor M. Jodi Rell,            Connecticut; Governor Ruth Ann Minner, Delaware;            Governor Rod Blagojevich, Illinois; Governor Mitch            Daniels, Indiana; Governor Thomas J.

Kaine, Virginia; Governor Christine            O. Gregoire, Washington; Governor Joe Manchin III, West            Virginia; Governor Jim Doyle, Wisconsin; Governor Dave            Freudenthal, Wyoming.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2006.     Hon. William H. Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Frist: High energy prices are      threatening the health and economic well-being of low-income      households across the United States. No family in our nation      should be forced to choose between heating their home and      putting food on the table for their children. No senior      citizen should have to decide between buying life saving      prescriptions or paying utility bills. Unfortunately, these      stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the      nation. We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help      low-income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that      provides an additional $2.92 billion for the Low-Income Home      Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as supported by the      majority of the Senate.       Since October 5, 2005, the Senate has voted six times to      increase LIHEAP funding to $5.1 billion. Bipartisan      amendments offered to the Department of Defense      Appropriations bill, the Transportation, Treasury and HUD      Appropriations bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services and      Education Appropriations bill, and the Tax Reconciliation      bill received a majority of the Senate's support.      Unfortunately, these amendments were not given the      opportunity for a straight up-or-down vote. In December, 63      Senators supported a successful motion to instruct, which      directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to      provide $2.92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY      2006. Yet, the conference report for the Budget      Reconciliation bill includes only $1 billion, with this      spending designated for FY 2007. Procedural maneuvers are      preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans. These      families and seniors deserve help from the federal      government.       As you know, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations      Conference report originally provided an additional $2      billion for LIHEAP. The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD      conferees was designated as emergency funding. The emergency      designation funding is warranted given the high cost of      energy this winter, and the lack of growth in workers' wages.      Unfortunately, other more controversial matters included in      the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP      money in final action on that bill.       The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households      heating with natural gas will experience an average increase      of 35 percent over last winter. Households heating with oil      will see an increase of 23 percent, and households using      propane can expect an increase of 17 percent. In addition,      wages are not keeping pace with inflation. The Real Earnings      report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the      average hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory      workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December      2005 than they were a year ago, after accounting for      inflation. Working families are continuing to lose ground,      meaning more families also need LlHEAP assistance this      year. Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families      face higher prices for home heating, health care, and      education.       We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the      Senate floor at the end of this month, or at the latest,      early February, that funds LIHEAP at the $5.1 billion level      supported by the Senate. We also urge that these resources be      allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and      ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly.      American families and seniors have been waiting too long for      relief from high energy costs. Thank you for your      consideration for this essential request.           Sincerely,         Jack Reed, Maria Cantwell, Byron L. Dorgan, Paul S.            Sarbanes, Charles E. Schumer, Edward Kennedy, Tom            Harkin, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, Herb Kohl.         John F. Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton,            Daniel K. Akaka, Max Baucus, Barbara A. Mikulski,            Patrick J. Leahy, Debbie Stabenow, Carl Levin, Mark            Dayton, Joseph R. Biden, James M. Jeffords, Patty            Murray, Dick Durbin, Robert Menendez.
