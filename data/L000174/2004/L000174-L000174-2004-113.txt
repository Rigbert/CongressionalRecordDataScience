President, at a hearing Wednesday before the Judiciary Committee, I asked some tough questions about the record of the Department of Justice in prosecuting terrorism cases. Later that day, the Department announced the imminent release of Yaser Esam Hamdi, the so-called ``enemy combatant'' who has been held for nearly 3 years without being formally charged with any crime. During this period, the Bush administration argued that it could deny Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, due process and detain him indefinitely. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the administration's assertion of unchecked executive power, ruling that Hamdi had the right to challenge his detention. Rather than proceed in court, the Justice Department now says that it will release Hamdi, who will renounce his U.S. citizenship and join his family in Saudi Arabia.  The Justice Department has claimed that Hamdi fought with the Taliban and posed a threat to our national security. Hamdi claimed that he was an innocent captured in Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance. We simply do not know the truth. But, as the Rutland Herald correctly points out in its editorial Thursday, that is what trials are for. If Hamdi was a combatant, or a civilian caught up in a combat zone, he should have been treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, which provide for the treatment of soldiers and civilians in wartime. If Hamdi committed a crime, he should have been charged and tried. The timing of his release is curious. Three months after the Supreme Court rejected the administration's refusal to grant Hamdi due process, the Justice Department suddenly determined that Hamdi no longer posed a threat. Now it will release a person it previously claimed was so dangerous that he had to be held for years in a military brig, mainly in solitary confinement.  The Attorney General relied on powerful rhetoric to defend the Department's record. He liked to say that no one had successfully challenged the Government's use of authority under the PATRIOT Act and that no court had found the Government had overreached. Since the Supreme Court decisions on Hamdi and related cases last summer, it has become harder for him to make such claims. Those Court decisions do not stand alone in defining the Department's level of success, however. The list of reversals of this Administration's policies and practices has become extensive. From the Department's involvement in rewriting our country's adherence to the Geneva Convention and the Convention Against Torture, which contributed to the breakdown at the Abu Ghraib prison and elsewhere, to the Supreme Court's rejection of the administration's Guantanamo practices, there is much that needs attention and correction.  Indeed, the Justice Department has accumulated one loss after another in terrorism cases. In recent weeks, we have witnessed the unraveling of the Department's first post-September 11 prosecution of a terrorist sleeper cell in Detroit. This followed on the heels of a growing list of losses and questionable cases, including the wrongful arrest of a Portland attorney based on a fingerprint mismatch; the acquittal ofa Saudi college student who was charged with providing material support to terrorists; the release on bail of two defendants in Albany, NY, after the Government admitted having mistranslated a key piece of evidence--the evidence referred to one defendant as ``brother,'' not ``commander,'' as originally represented; the collapse of all charges against Muslim chaplain, James Yee, an Army Captain who served at Guantanamo and was originally accused of espionage; and the Supreme Court's repudiation of the administration's claim that it can hold citizens indefinitely as ``unlawful combatants,'' without access to counsel or family. In addition to announcing its decision to release Hamdi 2 days ago, the Government also folded its case against Ahmad al Halabi, a Senior Airman who served as a translator at Guantanamo Bay. Al Halabi once faced the death penalty for spying. He ultimately pled guilty to four minor charges, such as photographing a guard tower and taking a classified document to his quarters; other charges were dropped.  The fact is, there have been only a few real victories in cases that have brought terrorism charges since 9/11, and these have been overshadowed by seemingly half-hearted prosecutions. We all remember the antiterrorism sweeps that occurred after 9/11. The Justice Department detained over 5,000 foreign nationals in those sweeps, but, as law professor David Cole points out in an article in the October 4, 2004, edition of The Nation, not a single one of them was charged with terrorism.  Department officials say their record since the 2001 attacks reflects a successful strategy of catching suspected terrorists before they can launch deadly plots, even if that involves charging them with lesser crimes. I certainly will not contest that lesser crimes are being charged. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), of the approximately 184 cases disclosed as ``international terrorism'' matters, 171 received a sentence of one year or less. But is that making us safer? What exactly happens to a suspected terrorist who spends 6 months in prison and then is deported to his country of origin in the midst of a war that has no end in sight? Does it really squelch deadly plots?  The administration has yet to answer pointed questions about the deportation of Nabil al-Marabh to Syria, a nation that is a state sponsor of terrorism. Al-Marabh was at one time Number 27 on the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists, and experienced prosecutors wanted to indict him. Why was he released? According to court records, Al-Marabh shared an address with defendants in the Detroit case who are now facing only document fraud charges. What is going on here?  We still await the resolution of the case against Jose Padilla. The Attorney General made a frightening announcement from Moscow when Jose Padilla was arrested--as if the Government had miraculously averted a radioactive ``dirty bomb'' from being detonated in our heartland. As Deputy Attorney General James Comey represented to the Federal courts a few months ago, the Government no longer even contends that Mr. Padilla was engaged in a ``dirty bomb'' plot. We have yet to see criminal charges against him, but I hope that we will. The Attorney General always finds time to announce allegations and dangers to frighten the American people but never seems to have time to be accountable when those specters prove false, when criminal cases can not be made, or when the Government has overreached or when innocent Americans have been unfairly accused.  We will soon be asked to give the Government more tools, more powers, and even greater authorities. I hope that we will not be asked to add PATRIOT Act-related powers to legislation to implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. The families of 9/11 victims have asked us to focus only on those actions endorsed by the Commission. We should honor this request. Before Congress considers granting the Government more powers to add to the Federal arsenal, we must determine which tools are actually being used, and how are they working? Which tools are subject to abuse, and which need to be modified? I hope that we can start getting some of those answers.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the Rutland Herald editorial and The Nation article I mentioned earlier.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Rutland Herald, Sept. 23, 2004]                         Constitutional Victory       One of the most alarming abuses in President Bush's war on      terrorism has come to a peculiar resolution. On Wednesday the      government announced it would release Yaser Hamdi from      custody.       Hamdi is an American citizen, born in Louisiana, and an      Arab whose family lives in Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces gained      custody of Hamdi when Northern Alliance officials handed him      over during the war in Afghanistan. The U.S. military was      rounding up Taliban fighters, and Hamdi ended up in      Guantanamo, Cuba.       Hamdi said he was wrongfully captured by the Northern      Alliance in northern Afghanistan and was wrongfully      imprisoned by the U.S. military. But the Bush administration      viewed him as an ``enemy combatant,'' a designation that led      to the government's asserted claim that it had the power to      rob Hamdi of all his rights.       It is unknown whether Hamdi is telling the truth when he      says he had nothing to do with the Taliban and was not      involved in the Afghan war. In America that is what trials      are for. Until found guilty of a crime, suspects are presumed      innocent and are protected by an array of constitutional      rights.       These rights ought to be cherished by every American.      Otherwise each person is vulnerable to government abuse.      These include the right to legal representation, the right to      know the charges one is facing, the right to bail, and the      right to a speedy and fair trial. Unrestrained by these      rights, the government could jail any one of us on the      flimsiest of excuses--or with no excuses.       It was a shocking event when the Bush administration      claimed it had the power to deny Hamdi all of those rights.      The claim was not made on the basis of any evidence or      charge. Bush was asserting he had the right to declare anyone      he saw fit to be an enemy combatant and to lock him or her up      with no trial, no charges, no legal representation.       Hamdi was just one man; there is one other, Jose Padilla,      who is being held on similar charges. But the power arrayed      against him was the power of a police state--until the      Supreme Court stepped in.       In June, the court ruled, 8-1, that Bush did not have the      power to discard the Constitution and that Hamdi had the      right to contest his detention. It was a victory celebrated      by civil libertarians of the left and the right. Then on      Wednesday the government announced it would release Hamdi to      Saudi Arabia, where he would rejoin his family, and he would      renounce his U.S. citizenship.       So for nearly three years the U.S. government, on the say      of President Bush, held a U.S. citizen in solitary      confinement on no charges. The Supreme Court has shown that,      in our constitutional system, the judiciary remains an      essential line to protect us against governmental abuse.      Authoritarian regimes frequently cite dangers to civil order      as an excuse to round up and jail people who are out of      favor. In Bush's hands the war on terrorism had become a war      on the Constitution. It appears that, fortunately, this time      the Constitution has won.                                  ____                           [From the Nation]                            Taking Liberties                            (By David Cole)       On September 2, a federal judge in Detroit threw out the      only jury conviction the Justice Department has obtained on a      terrorism charge since 9/11. In October 2001, shortly after      the men were initially arrested, Attorney General John      Ashcroft heralded the case in a national press conference as      evidence of the success of his anti-terror campaign. The      indictment alleged that the defendants were associated with      Al Qaeda and planning terrorist attacks. But Ashcroft held no      news conference in September when the case was dismissed, nor      did he offer any apologies to the defendants who had spent      nearly three years in jail. That wouldn't be good for his      boss's campaign, which rests on the ``war on terrorism.''      Here, as in Iraq, Bush's war is not going a well as he      pretends.       The Detroit case was extremely weak from the outset. The      government could never specify exactly what terrorist      activity was allegedly being planned and never offered any      evidence linking the defendants to Al Qaeda. Its case      consisted almost entirely of a pair of sketches and a      videotape, described by an FBI agent as ``casing materials''      for a terrorist plot, and the testimony of a witness of      highly dubious reliability seeking a generous plea deal. It      now turns out that the prosecution failed to disclose to the      defense evidence that other government experts did not      consider the sketches and videotape to be terrorist casing      materials at all and that the government's key witness had      admitted to lying.       Until that reversal, the Detroit case had marked the only      terrorist conviction obtained from the Justice Department's      detention of more than 5,000 foreign national in      antiterrorism sweeps since 9/11. So Ashcroft's record is 0      for 5,000. When the Attorney General was locking these men up      in the immediate wake of the attacks, he held almost daily      press conferences to announce how many ``suspected      terrorists'' had been     detained. No press conference has been forthcoming to      announce that exactly none of them have turned out be actual      terrorists.       Meanwhile, despite widespread recognition that Abu Ghraib      has done untold damage worldwide to the legitimacy of the      fight against terrorism, the military has still not charged      any higher-ups in the Pentagon, and the Administration has      shown no inclination to appoint an independent commission to      investigate. It prefers to leave the investigation to the      Justice Department and the Pentagon, the two entities that      drafted secret legal memos defending torture.       And in late July, resurrecting the ideological exclusion      practices so familiar form the cold war, the Department of      Homeland Security revoked a work visa for a prominent Swiss      Islamic scholar who had been hired by Notre Dame for an      endowed chair in its International Peace Studies Institute,      DHS invoked a Patriot Act provision that, like the McCarran-     Walter Act of the cold war, authorizes exclusion based purely      on speech. If a person uses his position of prominence to      ``endorse'' terrorism or terrorist organization, the Patriot      Act says, he may not enter the United States. The McCarran-     Walter Act, on the books until its repeal in 1990, was used      to exclude such ``subversives'' as Czeslaw Milosz and Graham      Greene. This time the man whose views are too dangerous for      Americans to hear firsthand is Tariq Ramadan, a highly      respected intellectual and author of more than twenty books      who was named by Time magazine as one of the hundred most      likely innovators of the twenty-first century.       Notre Dame is not known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism--     and Ramadan is no extremist. He argues for a modernized      version of Islam that promotes tolerance and women's rights.      Two days after 9/11 he called on fellow Muslims to condemn      the attacks. In short, Ramadan is precisely the kind of      moderate voice in Islam that the United States should be      courting if it hopes to isolate Al Qaeda. The barring of      Ramadan reinforces the sense that the Administration cannot      or will not distinguish between moderates and extremists and      is simply anti-Muslim.       What is most troubling is that none of these developments--     the revelation of prosecutorial abuse in the interest of      obtaining a ``win'' in the war on terrorism; the continuing      failure to hold accountable those most responsible for the      torture at Abu Ghraib; and the exclusion of a moderate Muslin      as too dangerous for Americans to hear--is an isolated      mistake. Rather, they are symptoms of a deeper problem. The      President thinks he can win this war by ``acting tough'' and      treating the rule of law and constitutional freedoms as      optional. With enough fearmongering, that attitude may win      him the election. But it will lose the war. Bush is playing      right into Al Qaeda's hands by further alienating those we      most need on our side.                          ____________________
