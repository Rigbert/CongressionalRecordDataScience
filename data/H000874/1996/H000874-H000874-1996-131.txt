Chairman, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee concerning the Internal Revenue Service.  Mr. Chairman, both the Secretary of Treasury and I believe that the funding levels provided in this bill for IRS, which are 11 percent below current spending, will adversely affect the 1997 filing season and may in some instances ultimately impede the collection of taxes. I know that this is not the chairman's intention. I also understand that the Senate has a higher spending allocation for the Treasury/Postal Subcommittee. In the event that the subcommittee receives a higher allocation when we go to conference with the Senate, can the chairman share his intentions regarding specific funding levels for IRS?
