Mr. Chairman, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee. The chairman has been a long-time advocate in improving safety standards in our Nation's transportation system. I appreciate his willingness to include report language regarding occupant ejection and motor coach and school bus standards in this legislation.  In March, a horrific accident occurred in my district when a bus carrying the Bluffton University men's baseball team crashed on Interstate 75 in Atlanta, Georgia, en route to a tournament in Florida. Six people were killed and 29 others were injured.  That week, Dr. Jeffrey Solomone from Grady Hospital's trauma center, where most of the victims were treated in Atlanta, called my office outraged. He knew that their deaths could have been prevented if they were simply wearing seat belts. Imagine working to save young lives when you knew their injuries were caused not from impact but from being thrown from the vehicle.  Last year, two teenage girls were killed in a similar accident in Beaumont, Texas. Advocates and family members accurately highlighted that the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration develop a safety standard in 1999.  In 2005, the SAFETEA-LU legislation reiterated this request and called for a national standard to be developed no later than October 1, 2009. I applaud the committee for demanding a status report on these standards. Simply said, it should not take 10 years to figure out a way to save lives. How much longer must we wait until a simple regulation is developed?
