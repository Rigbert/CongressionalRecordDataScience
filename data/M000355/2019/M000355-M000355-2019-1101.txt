 They defended our national values both at home and abroad, and we owe each one of them a tremendous debt of gratitude for their service and sacrifice. Today, I would like to recognize one of these intrepid Americans from my home State of Kentucky. Mary Somers Ballard volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World War II, providing healing care to wounded soldiers across the European theatre. This month, Mary will enjoy her 100th birthday at a celebration with friends and family, and I would like to add my voice to the chorus of those praising her lifetime of achievement.  When war broke out, Mary lived in Boston working as a nurse and attending school. Hearing stories from the front, she was called to leave her studies and put her talents to work for the war effort. At the age of 23, she joined the Army's 811th Air Evacuation Unit and sailed from New York City for Europe. Mary was deployed at a hospital in Manchester, England, where she cared for wounded soldiers flown back from France and Germany. In the aftermath of the invasion of Normandy, Mary traveled to the continent to support the Battle of the Bulge, one of Hitler's last-ditch efforts to stop the Allied advance. After the liberation of Paris, Mary was sent to the city to care for troops there. In her many posts, Mary delivered lifesaving care to many Allied soldiers, often in challenging surroundings.  More than 59,000 Americans joined the Army Nurse Corps during the Second World War, many serving under enemy fire. Their service supported the recovery of countless wounded soldiers at evacuation hospitals like Mary's.  After the war, Mary was stationed in Indiana where she met Al Ballard, a young surgical resident. The couple married and moved to Al's native Kentucky, where Mary has lived ever since. Together, they raised eight children and, like so many other members of the Greatest Generation, continued to contribute to their community and our country.  Through the years, Mary has been honored for her brave service. To celebrate her 95th birthday, for example, she threw out the first pitch at a Lexington Legends minor league baseballgame. I am glad to join her family and friends in marking Mary's 100th birthday. With her lifesaving work in the Army and a longtime commitment to Kentucky, Mary has made a lasting impression on the lives of countless many. With all of them, I would like to wish her a happy birthday and thank her for her remarkable service to the United States. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring this Kentucky hero.                          ____________________
