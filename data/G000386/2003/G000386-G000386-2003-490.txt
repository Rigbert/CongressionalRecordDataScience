 President, once again, albeit good intentions on the part of people offering these amendments, what they are doing in the process of offering their very favorable new program--one on which I have legislation, in fact--they are destroying the growth in our growth package by taking money from the growth portions and the investment portions of our bill to do other good things.  Right now, we are concerned about the economy. We have a balanced bill and want to keep it balanced. We don't want to destroy portions of our bill to create a new program. However, the Senator knows I am very interested in long-term care, and I hope she will work with me and the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, in the hopes that she can join us in advancing long-term care insurance for senior citizens but doing it in a context that doesn't destroy other very important pieces of legislation.  This language is not germane to the measure before us.
