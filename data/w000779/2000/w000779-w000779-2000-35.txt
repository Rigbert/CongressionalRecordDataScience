President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss the possibility that there will be an effort very shortly to override Oregon's assisted suicide law as part of a package that includes legislation that is extremely important to the country, such as legislation that would protect women from domestic violence, such as legislation that would also deal with sex trafficking--an extraordinary scourge that victimizes women and children. I think it would be extremely unfortunate to victimize the victims in that way. It is clearly not in the public interest.  Oregon's assisted suicide law involves a very controversial matter. I happen to be against assisted suicide, against the Oregon law, but the bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee on a 10-8 vote, a very narrow vote, is strongly opposed by the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society believes that legislation will harm those in pain. I am very hopeful that rather than tie this assisted suicide legislation to vitally needed legislation that would protect the victims of domestic violence and women and children from sex trafficking, the Senate would adhere to the agreement that was entered into in August.  In August, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate made it very clear, and I specifically addressed this on the floor of the Senate, that I was open to a fair fight, to an open debate on the assisted suicide question. In fact, I made it very clear that while I intend to use every opportunity to speak on the floor of the Senate and make sure the Members understand, for example, that the American Cancer Society believes this legislation will harm those in pain, I was willing to accept the will of the Senate on any cloture vote that might be scheduled. That was the agreement entered into in August. It provided for a fair fight on this issue.  Tonight we are told that there may be the possibility, as I have touched on, of an effort to override Oregon's assisted suicide law. By the way, Oregon is the only State in the country that has such legislation. It would be linked to the other desperately needed measures, such as the legislation to protect women victimized by domestic violence. I hope that will not be the case. I would have to oppose very strongly that kind of effort. It seems to me it is not in the public interest, and it is particularly regrettable since it runs contrary to the spirit of what was agreed to in August: That there would be an opportunity for both sides on the floor of the Senate to have this debate about assisted suicide; I would have a chance to address the issue in some detail, but if there were an effort to file cloture, I would accept the will of the Senate on that measure.  In addition, we just learned in the last few minutes there is a possibility schoolchildren in 700 rural school districts around the country could also be held hostage because, again, there may be an objection to the county payments bill legislation authored by Senator Craig of Idaho and myself--again, bipartisan. There may be an objection to that bill, again, on the grounds that somehow it should be examined some more and possibly linked again to the assisted suicide question.  I think, again, these issues ought to be considered on the merits. The county payments legislation passed this body by unanimous consent; 100 Senators agreed to make sure that these schoolchildren in 700 rural school districts got a fair shake. We have been working with the House. We have now come up with an agreement among the House, the Senate, and the White House. I think we can pass it 100-0 in the Senate. But we are told someone is going to object to the county payments legislation for the unrelated reason that they are not able to work out an arrangement that allows them to throw the Oregon assisted suicide law in the trash can on an arbitrary basis.  What the Senate worked out in August was fair to all sides. It ensured that we have a chance to discuss the matter of assisted suicide. It is a controversial question. I personally amagainst assisted suicide. I voted against the Oregon law twice. I voted against Federal funding for assisted suicide. But I oppose the legislation being advanced here to overturn Oregon's law for the same reasons that the American Cancer Society does. It will hurt patients in pain.  I felt compelled to come to the floor of the Senate and express my concern. I think it is not in the public interest to link desperately needed legislation such as the bill to protect the victims of domestic violence to the assisted suicide law. It is not appropriate to hold hostage the victims of sex trafficking to the Oregon assisted suicide law. I hope we will not see what has been raised as a possibility in the last few minutes, and that is to hold up the county payments legislation--which has been agreed to by the House and the Senate negotiators and those at the White House--that would provide a lifeline to 700 rural school districts all across the country.  I hope that bill and the other vitally needed legislation will not be held up because a Senator decides he or she wants to throw the assisted suicide override into unrelated legislation that this country needs so greatly. I made it clear last August I was open to being fair to both sides. That is why we entered into an agreement for a fair fight. I said I would respect the will of the Senate on a cloture vote if it came to that. I think we ought to adhere to that August agreement and not link this matter of throwing Oregon's law into the trash can by tucking it into unrelated legislation.  Frankly, those who are trying to tuck this override of Oregon's assisted suicide law into other legislation--such as the bill that would protect the victims of domestic violence--are doing a tremendous disservice to the women victimized by domestic violence, to the victims of sex trafficking, to the schoolchildren who desperately need that county payments legislation. These bills ought to be considered on their merits. That was agreed to back in August with respect to the assisted suicide legislation. I will do everything in my power to insist the Senate adhere to what was agreed on last August.  I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his thoughtfulness.                          ____________________
