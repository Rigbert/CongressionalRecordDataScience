Bob is probably most proud of the fact he led the way for disabled Americans, for our Nation's School Lunch Program, not to mention the World Food Program where food and education combine as the most effective long-term answer in our current fight against terrorism.  I have special memories and a personal perspective of the Bob Dole days in the Senate when I was in the House. Having the privilege of representing Bob's former congressional district, the big first district of Kansas, knowing Bob Dole since his friendship with my father and later during my service as the administrative assistant both for Bob's predecessor in the Senate, Senator Frank Carlson, and his successor in the House, Congressman Keith Sebelius, many assumed that whatever I was for, Bob was for. I would always emphasize that Bob Dole was riding shotgun with me, whether he was or not. That was like having Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Doc Holiday, and Matt Dillon all by your side during any kind of legislative shootout. Of course, if we won, I had to come over to the Senate and let him know. If we lost, I came over to ask for help. Either way, when the chips were down, it was a win-win with Bob on your side.  In Kansas, our State society named Dwight David Eisenhower the Kansan of the 20th century, and we are still proud of and still like Ike. Historians have ensconced our native son as one of our greatest Presidents.
