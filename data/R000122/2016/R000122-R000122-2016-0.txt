President, I join with my fellow Senator from the State of Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, to urge this body to confirm Mary McElroy to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  Ms. McElroy is an eminently qualified and dedicated public servant whose nomination was reported unanimously to this body by the Judiciary Committee in January of this year. She, along with 20 other district court nominees from States represented by Members from both sides of the aisle, has undergone the required rigorous vetting process and passed through committee only to have her nomination stalled on the floor of this body. We should confirm all of these nominees right now before the 114th Congress draws to a close.  I have been proud to support Mary's nomination at every step of this process. Her legal career has spanned more than 20 years from her time as a paralegal in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office while attending law school at night, clerking for Associate Justice Donald F. Shea of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, private practice, and her work in the State and Federal public defender offices. Throughout her career, she has shown the highest levels of integrity and professionalism and earned the respect and support of Rhode Island's law enforcement community.  It is a shame that this Congress may come to a close before Mary can receive what I am sure would be a very strong floor vote in favor of her confirmation. Mary has the full support of her home State and the legal community to assume this role and no assertion to the contrary has been made at any time since her nomination by the President. Should we not take up and pass her nomination this week, as we should have for all these intervening months since the action by the Judiciary Committee, it is my hope that her nomination returns to this body and is given a fair hearing swiftly in the new year.
