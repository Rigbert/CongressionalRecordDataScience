Speaker, is it the proposition of the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) if we did not pass this CR and we still continue another 24 hours, because the CR expires, as the gentleman said 24 hours from now or 36 hours from now, that the agencies, both Social Security and the Veterans Administration, would not go ahead over the next 24 hours or 36 hours and prepare to send out these checks?
