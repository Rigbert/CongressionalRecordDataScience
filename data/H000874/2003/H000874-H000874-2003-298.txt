 Mr. Leader, I do not see Child Tax Credit legislation listed on next week's schedule. I did not hear you talk about that.  We have a bill, as I think you probably know, the Rangel/DeLauro/Davis bill, that will make sure working families and our service members left out of the recently enacted tax bill get the child tax credit they should have. We have sought unanimous consent to bring this bill up, but we have been denied and not successful. There is apparently agreement in the Senate, as we understand it, to take this matter up perhaps today.  When do you expect that we might be able to consider child tax credit legislation on the floor, Mr. Leader?  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman knows that we think we have already done child tax credit in a very meaningful way. Whatever the Senate does, certainly we will take it under consideration, but our schedule and our agenda that has been announced from the first of the year is that we will have several tax relief bills. Of those bills, maybe this provision that the gentleman is talking about could be included. I do not know, but the Committee on Ways and Means would certainly take it under advisement.  We have scheduled certainly an international tax bill for this summer. We have already announced that we would like to see the total repeal of death tax made permanent. There will probably be another tax relief bill, so there is plenty of opportunity for the gentleman to talk about that provision that the Senate may have left out of the bill signed by the President a week ago.
