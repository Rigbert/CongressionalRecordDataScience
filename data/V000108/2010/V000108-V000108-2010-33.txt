The members of the American Legion Auxiliary Unit 238, as well as the Legioneers and the Sons of the American Legion, will be recognizing these individuals at the Installation of Officers Awards Dinner held on Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at the American Legion Post 238 in Roselawn, Indiana.  For many years, Roselawn American Legion Post 238 has been an extraordinary example of the ideals and mission of the American Legion. The American Legion Auxiliary was established in 1919 to assist the American Legion and has quickly become the world's largest women's patriotic service organization. For volunteering many hours to our American veterans and to the community of Roselawn, as well as all of Northwest Indiana, the American Legion Auxiliary Unit 238 and its newly elected officers are to be honored.  Please join me in recognizing the 2010-2011 newly elected officers for the Auxiliary Unit 238: Tina Stevens--President, Elizabeth Albright--First Vice President, Roxanne Hepworth--Second Vice President, Jane Bower--Recording/Corresponding Secretary, Adrian Mandernach--Chaplain, Natalie Haber-Barker--Historian and Parliamentarian, Lupe Hinch--Sergeant-At-Arms, and Jeannette Sutton, Nancy Lanier, and Phyllis Lindley--Executive Board Members.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing the American Legion Auxiliary Unit 238 and its newly elected officers. I also ask that you join me in honoring its membership for their service to their community, its veterans, and their devotion to the ideals of the American Legion.                          ____________________
