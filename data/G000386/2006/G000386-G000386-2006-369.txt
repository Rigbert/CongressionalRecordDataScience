 President, I have some points I would like to make. Before I do that, I will respond to a couple of points that the Senator from Florida made. One was his speaking about the bewilderment among seniors about the program. I would say that a great deal of the bewilderment comes from the confusion that people have because of the rhetoric of people who don't like this plan and have tried to kill it with rhetoric because they didn't have the votes on the floor of the Senate. That has not created a very good environment.  On the other hand, I can say that at my town meetings--I held 16, Monday through Thursday, during our last break--people who came expressed some wonderment about exactly what program to get into. But people who also had already selected a program gave very positive comments about the benefit of the program to them.
