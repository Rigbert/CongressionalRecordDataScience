 In our part of the world, I would say to Senator Stabenow and Senator Casey--in Oregon and Washington--we feel like we have been hit with a wrecking ball with this opioid problem. Again, when Senator Cantwell talks about shifting the costs, she is not talking about something abstract. Thisis going to take away money for opioid treatment.  So I am very pleased that my colleague is making these points, and I look forward to the presentation.
