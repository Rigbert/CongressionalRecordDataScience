President, today I am introducing legislation, along with Congressman Walden in the House of Representatives, that would fight the scourge of negative political campaigns with the simple yet powerful tool of accountability. If candidates choose to run for office by disparaging their opponents rather than standing on their own records and beliefs, they should at least be expected to take responsibility for the ad campaigns that they run. Under this legislation, there would be meaningful financial penalty--in the form of higher advertising rates--for those who fail to do so.  For me, this bill arises out of unpleasant personal experience. I was elected to this body in a special election against the man I am now proud to call my friend and colleague, Gordon Smith. That campaign was the nastiest, most negative, least edifying political season that my state has ever been through. The unabashedly negative ads that both of our campaigns put on the air were a sour departure from Oregon's tradition of responsible, thoughtful politics.  I eventually became so disgusted with what my own campaign had become, that with only a few weeks before the election, I got rid of all my ads, destroyed negative mailings that were about to be sent out, asked others who were airing negative ads on my behalf to desist, and started over with a campaign that was 100 percent positive. I didn't know if it would be a smart campaign strategy or a kind of political suicide, and I didn't much care. Win or lose, I wanted to be proud of the way that I had conducted myself.  What I learned all too well in that campaign is that negative politics corrupts everything that it touches. It harms not only its target, but its sponsor as well. Negative ads are one of the biggest reasons for the cynicism and even disgust that so many Americans feel toward the political process. They cheapen the very institution of democracy.  There's no way, of course, to mandate a sense of shame or legislate an end to negative ads. But in an era when elections are determined more and more by television and radio advertising, it is not too much to ask that candidates be held responsible for the statements they make in their ads.  Under current campaign law, broadcasters are required to give qualified candidates for federal office their lowest price for ads, what is known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. In order to qualify for this rate, candidates must comply with federal campaign finance laws, and include proper disclaimers in the ad, among other regulations. The Political Candidate Personal Responsibility Act would attach two additional requirements to the discounted ad rate. The first requirement is that for both television and radio advertisements, the lowest unit rate will only be available if a candidate, when referring to his or her opponent, makes the reference him or her self. Radio advertisements must also contain a statement by the candidate in which the candidate identifies him or herself and the office for which the person is running. The second requirement is that in any television or radio ad where a candidate makes reference to his or her opponent, the candidate must appear or be heard for at least 75 percent of the broadcast time. If a candidate chooses to air an advertisement that does not comply with these requirements, he or she will be ineligible to receive the lowest unit rate for a period of 45 days in a primary and 60 days in a general election.  In other words, if you want the benefits of discounted broadcast time, you can't make disparaging statements that you aren't willing to say yourself. No more hiding behind grainy photographs, ominous music, and anonymous announcers.  Ultimately, one of our greatest responsibilities as elected officials is to encourage greater public participation in all levels of the political process. Campaign activities should not only represent the views of the candidates, but they should also encourage voters to participate in the democratic process. The growing negative trend of campaign advertisements degrades the process and discourages people from becoming involved.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1135       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Political Candidate Personal      Responsibility Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Local broadcasters are currently required to offer the      ``lowest unit charge'' for advertising to candidates for all      political offices 45 days before a primary election, and 60      days before a general election.       (2) The ``lowest unit charge'' requirement represents a      federally mandated subsidy for political candidates.       (3) Campaigns for Federal office are too frequently      dominated by negative and attack-oriented television and      radio advertising.       (4) The Government should take action to ensure that it      does not subsidize negative and attack oriented advertising      where the candidate fails to demonstrate personal      responsibility for the tenor of the candidate's advertising.
