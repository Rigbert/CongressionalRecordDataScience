DOLE. I would like to accommodate the Senator from Vermont and others by having back-to-back votes and have the Senator out of here by 5 after 3 or 6 or 7 after 3. I do not know whether that accommodates the Senator or not. So if we work it out, if we have back-to-back votes, that will be it for today.
