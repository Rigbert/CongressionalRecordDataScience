Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate Saint George Romanian Orthodox Church as they join together in celebration of their 100th anniversary. The church, formerly of Indiana Harbor and now located in Lansing, Illinois, will be celebrating this exceptional milestone with festivities beginning on September 23, 2006, and continuing through the followmg day.  The cornerstone for Saint George's, laid in Indiana Harbor on November 4, 1906, represented the culmination of the efforts of the first Church Council, led by Father Moise Balea, President. These Council members, realizing the need for a church due to the growing Romanian population in Northwest Indiana, began fundraising efforts that eventually led to the completion of the first Saint George Rumanian Orthodox Church, dedicated on November 23, 1908, by the parish's first priest, the Reverend Father loan Tatu.  The Very Reverend Father Simion Mihaltian took the reins of Saint George's on June 20, 1908, and he remained the church's leader for an astonishing 55 years. Under Father Mihaltian's spirited guidance, Saint George's continued to grow. While fires posed challenges, the church continued to expand, relocating within the Indiana Harbor and adding a dining hall and, eventually, a school. Though he passed away on New Year's Eve in 1963, Father Mihaltian's impact on his parish continues to touch the lives of the members today. Father Mihaltian resonates today as a shining example of selfless service and unwavering commitment to the community.  From their modest beginnings, Saint George's has emerged as a pillar of the Romanian community. In 1976, Saint George's relocated to Lansing, Illinois, where it remains today. The move came under the leadership of the Very Reverend Father John Bugariu, who realized the need for more opportunities for its members and planned the construction of a recreation center. After serving the parish for 16 years, Father Bugariu, who had been named to the esteemed position of Archdiocesan Vicar, retired in 1979.  In 1979, Saint George's current leader, the Very Reverend Father loan Ionita, was named parish priest. A highly educated and esteemed member of the religious community, Father lonita has faithfully served the parish for the past 27 years. A testament to his dedication and to the community's admiration of him, Father Ionita was appointed Vicar of the Archdiocese by Archbishop Nicolae Condrea in 2003.  The celebration of Saint George's 100th anniversary will begin on Saturday, September 23, 2006, with a hospitality night and will continue on Sunday, September 24, with a very special liturgy, presided over by Archbishop Nicolae Condrea. The liturgy will be followed by a gathering at the Wicker Park Social Hall in Highland, Indiana and will conclude with Saint George's Anniversary Banquet at the same location.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Saint George Romanian Orthodox Church on their 100th anniversary. Throughout the years, the clergy and members of Saint George's have dedicated themselves to providing spirituality and guidance through the protection of the Romanian Orthodox faith and traditions.  Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our admiration.                          ____________________
