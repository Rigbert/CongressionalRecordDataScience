Thank you very much, Mr. Pitts. Again, I want to thank you for your leadership both at the State and, now, Federal level, especially as chairman of the committee that deals with health. Thank you so much.  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who has also been an outspoken champion of the right to life.
