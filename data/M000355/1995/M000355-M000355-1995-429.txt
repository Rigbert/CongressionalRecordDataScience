 President, I rise today to honor the memory of former Kentucky First Lady Mildred Watkins ``Mama'' Chandler, who passed away on January 23 at her home in Versailles.  Over the course of her 95 years, Mrs. Chandler's strength of spirit and keen intellect were clearly evident in every facet of her life. For Kentuckians, her legacy begin in 1925 when she wed Mr. Albert B. Chandler and soon became his most accomplished campaigner and political supporter. The grace of Mrs. Chandler's musical talents and attentive demeanor provided invaluable support to her husband Albert's distinguished service as Kentucky's Governor, U.S. Senator, and commissioner of major league baseball.  Politics did not embody her whole life, however. Mrs. Chandler developed strong career interests of her own. She taught piano and voice prior to her marriage. During her husband's term in the U.S. Senate, she worked as a writer for 20th Century Fox in Hollywood. At home in Kentucky, her award-winning weekly column for the Woodford Sun was enjoyed by many. Above all, she most cherished her time as mother and mentor to her children and grandchildren.  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in sending this Chamber's sincere condolences to the family of Mrs. Mildred Watkins ``Mama'' Chandler. Kentucky will remember Mrs. Chandler as one of our most beloved first ladies, and I am confident that her breadth of accomplishment and strength of character will remain a standard of excellence for generations to come.                          ____________________
