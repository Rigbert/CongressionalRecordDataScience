President, I am proud to join with Senator Kassebaum on this. I am sad that it is necessary that we do this. Last week, people around the world were horrified to learn that Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was a respected Nigerian writer, a human rights activist, known not only throughout Nigeria but around the world, was executed, along with others, after a flagrantly unfair trial by a military court.  The legislation we introduce today is a tribute to Mr. Saro-Wiwa and to other Nigerians who have given their lives--and there are others--or languish in prison because of the pursuit of democracy and a better life for the Nigerian people.  On November 10, Mr. Saro-Wiwa, who was a member of the Ogoni Tribe who live in poverty in the rich, oil-producing delta region of southern Nigeria, was hanged with eight of his colleagues. They had been accused of inciting the murder of four other Ogoni leaders.  Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were the latest casualties of one of the most brutal military regimes in the world. Gen. Sani Abacha, who seized power in a 1993 coup, has mimicked the tyrannical rule of his African neighbor, President Mobutu of Zaire, who plundered his country and killed or imprisoned anyone who dared to oppose him.  President Mobutu will go down as one of the great tyrants of this century, one of the greatest robbers of this century, and General Abacha seems to be trying to catch up.  Like Mobutu, General Abacha has become a multimillionaire, while Nigeria, a country with enormous human and economic potential, the most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has been brutalized and impoverished. Saro-Wiwa's execution is part of a countrywide repression of utter brutality, marked by arbitrary arrests, detention without trial, kangaroo courts when trials do take place, and prisons so appalling that death might be preferable.  Despite claims that he is leading Nigeria to democracy and civilian government, there is absolutely no reason to believe that General Abacha will ever willingly give up power. His hands are too bloody to risk the restoration of the rule of law in Nigeria.  Today in Ogoniland, armed troops encircle the cemetery where Saro-Wiwa is buried to prevent access by the public, and anyone caught with a photograph of him is arrested. The Washington Post reports today that there may be even more executions in the coming days.  Mr. President, along with others, I sought clemency for Ken Saro-Wiwa for more than 1 year. I wrote to the Nigerian Foreign Minister, the Nigerian Ambassador, the Secretary of State, and have even appealed to other African leaders on his behalf. All to no avail. While I was not privy to the evidence against Mr. Saro-Wiwa, I believed strongly, like so many others, that the Nigerian Government should have either released him or tried him in a civil court in accordance with due process.  There is no doubt that General Abacha wanted to silence Ken Saro-Wiwa. He had led a popular campaign against the oil companies that have ravaged and poisoned the land of his people. Oil accounts for 90 percent of Nigeria's export earnings, and whoever controls it controls the country's wealth, and controls the Nigerian Army. General Abacha apparently decided that he was better off with Saro-Wiwa dead, rather than as a continuing champion of Ogoni resistance. He probably figured that the rest of the world would forget him.  The world will not soon forget Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was a champion of the rights of his people, and a world leader in the struggle to protect the environment. While our efforts to save his life ultimately failed, his memory inspires us to support the cause for which he and others gave their lives.  This bill aims to support and strenthen the measures already taken by the administration, both before and since Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution. In addition, it prohibits new United States investment in Nigeria, including investment in a liquefied natural gas project that the International Finance Corporation has refused to finance, and which General Abacha reportedly has a personal interest in.  It also freezes the assets of Nigerians who are responsible for or benefit from policies which hinder Nigeria's transition to democracy. The Nigerian Government should think long and hard before it retaliates against American assets in Nigeria, because there is far more that we can do.  Of particular importance, the legislation calls on the President to actively seek multilateral support for these sanctions in the United Nations. We are already hearing of similar steps by the European community, but frankly the response of the international community has been shamefully timid. The United States has even run into resistance at the United Nations to a resolution condemning Nigeria for executing Saro-Wiwa. And Shell Oil, which derives a seventh of its global production of oil from Nigeria, seems to care about nothing but its own profits.  These and other sanctions are modeled on the sanctions we imposed against South Africa in the 1980's. They may be waived by the President if the Nigerian Government releases political prisoners, and demonstrates a commitment to human rights and an unequivocal commitment to democratic government.  We also provide a waiver if the President determines it is important to the national interest. This was included, in part, to encourage the Nigerian Government to increase its cooperation in counternarcotics. Nigeria is a center of drug trafficking and money laundering, and the United States has a strong interest in obtaining the Nigerian Government's cooperation to curtail it.  But the real trigger in this legislation is General Abacha himself. If he continues to imprison and murder his political opponents, the sanctions will get even stronger. We will consider everything including an oil embargo. Nigeria will become even further isolated, and General Abacha will eventually go the way of other African tyrants--forced from power and either shot or imprisoned, or sent into exile overturned in a coup. If, on the other hand, he decides to respect the rights of his people, the sanctions will end.  I am not so naive to believe that General Abacha will comply with the conditions in this legislation. His decision to execute Ken Saro-Wiwa was a sign that he would rather be branded an international pariah, than save his country from ruin. But the choice is his.  Mr. President, I also want to mention the oil companies who were the focus of Ken Saro-Wiwa's campaign. Had it not been for the environmental damage they have caused in Ogoniland, I suspect Ken Saro-Wiwa would be alive today.  We have not included sanctions against the oil companies in this legislation, but we expressly reserve the right to do so if the situation does not improve in Nigeria. Only 10 percent of our oil comes from Nigeria, but that 10 percent comprises 40 percent of Nigeria's total oil exports.  I strongly urge those companies, whether they are American companies   or foreign companies, to reconsider their activities in Nigeria. They are responsible for propping up an extraordinarily brutal and corrupt regime, and for destroying the livelihoods of many of the poorest people in Nigeria, the people who Ken Saro-Wiwa gave his life for. Private business has a responsibility to the betterment of society, not only to accruing profits. If there ever were a place to apply that principle it is in Nigeria today.  Mr. President, we cannot bring Ken Saro-Wiwa back to life, but as he said before he was executed, his words will live on. This legislation aims to carry on the campaign he gave his life for.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's New York Times on the recent arrest of nine Nigerian human rights activists, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 1995]    Rights Group Says Nigeria Seized 9 to Thwart Protest of Hangings       Lagos, Nigeria, November 16.--A Nigerian human rights      organization said today that nine of its members had been      arrested because the military Government feared they were      about to protest publicly against the execution of nine      Government critics last week.       Jiti Ogunye, secretary general of the Committee for the      Defense of Human Rights, said two student union leaders in      the university in Benin were arrested on Wednesday and the      other members of the group were arrested here last week.      ``All of them are detained in the Lagos police headquarters      but we have been denied access to them,'' he said.       There was no official confirmation of the arrests.       Nigeria's military rulers provoked international outrage on      Friday after the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent      Nigerian author, and eight other campaigners for minority      rights. They were sentenced by a tribunal for the murder of      four pro-Government chiefs in the oil-rich Ogoniland region.      They had been campaigning for compensation for the Ogoni      tribe in the southeast for oil produced there for decades by      multinational corporations, principally the Anglo-Dutch oil      giant Shell.       Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's ruler, in his first reaction to      the international furor over the hanging of the rights      activists, accused foreign powers of interference, local      newspapers reported.       Several nations have recalled their ambassadors to protest      the executions, Nigeria has recalled its own envoys in      retaliation.       The United States and Britain--Nigeria's former colonial      ruler--imposed an arms embargo on Lagos and the European      Union froze development aid.       In Strasbourg today, the European Parliament urged the      European Union to impose an oil embargo on Nigeria, but a      European Union diplomat in Brussels said an effective embargo      could only be carried out through the United Nations Security      Council, ``and I don't think the votes are there.''
