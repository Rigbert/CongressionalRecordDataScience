President, on Saturday, at least 29 tornadoes reportedly touched down in Illinois in Cass, Christian, DeWitt, Fulton, Macon, Macoupin, Mason, McDonough, McLean, Montgomery, Pike, Schuyler, and Tazewell Counties in central Illinois. The National Weather Service is still surveying nearby areas but reports this is the biggest December tornado outbreak in the history of Illinois.  One of the touchdowns in Taylorville caused major damage. I spoke with Taylorville mayor Bruce Berry. Thankfully, no fatalities have been reported, but 20 to 30 people were injured and early reports indicate more than 400 homes and buildings were damaged. Several homes have had roofs damaged and torn off, and others were tragically destroyed.  Two days after the storm, 310 households still did not have power, and the schools in Taylorville were closed as a result of the damages. The community is busy cleaning up and utility companies are working to get electricity back on.  I am grateful for the dedication of the local first responders, who rescued residents that were trapped inside their homes due to the tornado damage. These responders still have task forces searching for anyone that might need assistance. Local officials and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency are also working to make sure communities have the resources to protect critical infrastructure and begin to repair damage, a feat that could take months. American Red Cross volunteers are also providing food, shelter, and water to those in need. Across the region, friends and family have stepped up to help those whose homes and businesses were damaged.  The Illinois delegation and I stand ready to assist in any way we can. I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the response efforts so far, and all those who will take part in rebuilding damaged homes, businesses, and schools. Illinoisans always rebuild and endure, as we have done many times before--and we are stronger for it.                          ____________________
