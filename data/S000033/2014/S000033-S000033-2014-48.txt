 President, as chairman of the Senate Committee onVeterans' Affairs, I want to take a few minutes to update Members of the Senate as to where we are on some very important issues that impact veterans all over this country.  The first point I want to make is some good news. The committee had a hearing yesterday to hear testimony regarding the confirmation of Robert McDonald to be the new Secretary of the VA. I think I can speak for the whole committee in saying we were very impressed by what we heard from Mr. McDonald both in terms of his passion for the needs of veterans and also his administrative knowledge, his management skills, as the former head of one of the large corporations in America. I think he left us with a very strong impression. The result was that today, a few hours ago, by a unanimous vote, the Senate committee voted to confirm Robert McDonald as our new Secretary of the VA, and I hope very much his nomination will get to the floor as soon as possible. I think that is good news because the VA needs stable leadership. Sloan Gibson, who has been Acting Secretary, is doing an excellent job. He has already accomplished a lot. But it is important that we have a new permanent Secretary on board, and I hope the Members here see fit to confirm him as soon as we possibly can.  On an additional issue, I think as all Members of the Senate know, about a month or so ago we voted by a vote of 93 to 3, almost unanimously, to make sure the veterans of our country get quality health care in a timely manner, that we bring a new level of accountability to the VA, and I am very proud of the support that legislation, which was introduced by me and Senator John McCain, received. I thank again Senator McCain for his very strong efforts to make that happen and for his continued support of the veterans community.  Senator McCain made a statement the other day--I think it was yesterday--published in CQ, which I personally could not agree with more. He spoke in terms of the conference committee that we are in right now trying to merge the Senate bill and the House bill and come up with something that can pass in both bodies. He said and I quote: ``We've got to sit down and get this done, because we cannot go out for recess in August without having acted on this bill.''  I think he is exactly right.  Let me, picking up on that theme, relay to my colleagues what the VFW, which is having their annual convention in St. Louis, said:       The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States is      demanding that Congress immediately pass a compromise bill to      help fix the Department Of Veterans Affairs before they      adjourn for five weeks at the end of the month. ``Pass a bill      or don't come back from recess,'' said VFW National Commander      William A. Thien of Georgetown, IN. ``America's veterans are      tired of waiting--on secret waiting lists at the VA and on      their elected officials to do their jobs.''  I could not agree with the VFW more on that issue.  There was a bill a month ago that passed here. The CBO said that bill would cost $35 billion, and we voted for that for emergency funding because the Members here understood that taking care of veterans is a cost of war as much as spending money on tanks and guns and missiles--$35 billion in emergency funding. The House passed its bill which was later assessed by the CBO at $44 billion. But here is the good news--and without divulging the kinds of negotiations we are having with Chairman Miller in the House--and Chairman Miller is a serious man. I think he wants to get a bill passed. I don't want to go into all the details here, but I think it is fair to say the cost of that bill will be significantly less than what the CBO originally estimated.  A few minutes ago I and others received a letter from the major veterans organizations on an issue of important consequence. Again, without going into great detail about the nature of the negotiations which the House and Senate are having on the veterans bill, I think it is fair to say one of the stumbling blocks is that I agree and the House agrees it is imperative we pass funding to make sure that veterans who are in long waiting lines right now get the quality care they need now, and that means if the VA cannot accommodate them in a timely manner, they will go out to private doctors, community health centers, or whatever, and the VA will pay that bill. That is what we have to do because it is unacceptable that veterans remain on long waiting periods and not get health care. There is a general agreement on that. There is debate about how much that is going to cost over a 2-year period, but I think we can reach some resolution.  Here is where the difference of opinion lies--without divulging anything, and this has been in the newspapers--Sloan Gibson, the Acting Secretary, came before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee last week and he made it very clear that while we have to deal with the emergency of long waiting periods and get people the contracted care they need, simultaneously, we must make sure the VA has the doctors, the nurses, the medical personnel, the IT, and the space they need in order to deal with this crisis so that 2 years from now we are not back in the same position we are, and he came forward with a proposal that, in fact, costs $17.6 billion. I think we can lower that amount of money, because some of that request is not going to be spent this year or even next year.  But the issue here is we have to strengthen the VA, their capacity, so that veterans do not remain on long waiting periods and that we can get them the quality and timely care they need.  Now, what I wanted to mention was an hour or so ago I received and Chairman Miller, who is chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, got the letter, Richard Burr, who is the ranking member on the Senate committee, Mike Michaud, the ranking member at the House--we received a letter from a variety of veterans organizations, virtually every major veterans organization, and they are the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America, the U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, and many other organizations.  I want to take a moment to read what they say, because this is terribly important. What they are saying in essence is yes, we need emergency funding to make sure that veterans tomorrow get the health care they need from the private sector or anyplace else, but we also need to strengthen the VA so that over the years they can provide the quality and timely care veterans are entitled to. I am going to read this letter because it is important that Members of the Senate and the House understand where the major veterans organizations are coming from.       Last week Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson appeared before the      Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to discuss the progress      made by the Department of Veterans Affairs over the past two      months to address the health care access crisis for thousands      of veterans. Secretary Gibson testified that after re-     examining VA's resource needs in light of the revelations      about secret waiting lists and hidden demand, VA required      supplemental resources totaling $17.6 billion for the      remainder of this fiscal year through the end of FY 2017.       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of      veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need      to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that      veterans can access the health care they have earned either      from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge      Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that      fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary      Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any      compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or      $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred      obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet      both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by      expanding VA's internal capacity.  And I continue. Again, this is a letter from almost every major veterans organization:  Last month, we wrote to you--  They wrote to the chairmen of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees--     we wrote to you to outline the principles and priorities      essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy of which is      attached. The first priority ``must be to ensure that all      veterans currently waiting for treatment must be provided      access to timely, convenient health care as quickly as      medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable to provide      that care directly, ``VA must be involved in the timely      coordination of and fully responsible for prompt payment for      all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress must provide      supplemental funding for this year and additional     funding for next year to pay for the temporary expansion of      non-VA purchased care. Finally, whatever actions VA or      Congress takes to address the current access crisis must also      ``protect, preserve and strengthen the VA health care system      so that it remains capable of providing a full continuum of      high-quality, timely health care to all enrolled veterans.''  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 23, 2014.     Chairman Bernie Sanders,     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.     Ranking Member Richard Burr,     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.     Chairman Jeff Miller,     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.     Ranking Member Mike Michaud,     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.       Chairman Sanders, Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Burr,      Ranking Member Michaud: Last week, Acting Secretary Sloan      Gibson appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee      to discuss the progress made by the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) over the past two months to address the health      care access crisis for thousands of veterans. Secretary      Gibson testified that after re-examining VA's resource needs      in light of the revelations about secret waiting lists and      hidden demand, VA required supplemental resources totaling      $17.6 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year through      the end of FY 2017.       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of      veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need      to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that      veterans can access the health care they have earned, either      from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge      Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that      fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary      Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any      compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or      $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred      obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet      both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by      expanding VA's internal capacity.       Last month, we wrote to you to outlining the principles and      priorities essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy      of which is attached. The first priority ``. . . must be to      ensure that all veterans currently waiting for treatment must      be provided access to timely, convenient health care as      quickly as medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable      to provide that care directly, ``. . . VA must be involved in      the timely coordination of and fully responsible for prompt      payment for all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress      must provide supplemental funding for this year and      additional funding for next year to pay for the temporary      expansion of non-VA purchased care.

In his testimony to the Senate, Secretary Gibson stated      that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has already      reached out to over 160,000 veterans to get them off wait      lists and into clinics. He said that VHA accomplished this by      adding more clinic hours, aggressively recruiting to fill      physician vacancies, deploying mobile medical units, using      temporary staffing resources, and expanding the use of      private sector care. Gibson also testified that VHA made over      543,000 referrals for veterans to receive non-VA care in the      private sector--91,000 more than in the comparable period a      year ago. In a subsequent press release, VA stated that it      had reduced the New Enrollee Appointment Report (NEAR) from      its peak of 46,000 on June 1, 2014 to 2,000 as of July 1,      2014, and that there was also a reduction of over 17,000      veterans on the Electronic Waiting List since May 15, 2014.      We appreciate this progress, but more must be done to ensure      that every enrolled veteran has access to timely care.       The majority of the supplemental funding required by VA,      approximately $8.1 billion, would be used to expand access to      VA health care over the next three fiscal years by hiring up      to 10,000 new clinical staff, including 1,500 new doctors,      nurses and other direct care providers. That funding would      also be used to cover the cost of expanded non-VA purchased      care, with the focus shifting over the three years from non-     VA purchased care to VA-provided care as internal capacity      increased. The next biggest portion would be $6 billion for      VA's physical infrastructure, which according to Secretary      Gibson would include 77 lease projects for outpatient clinics      that would add about two million square feet, as well as      eight major construction projects and 700 minor construction      and non-recurring maintenance projects that together could      add roughly four million appointment slots at VA facilities.      The remainder of the funding would go to IT enhancements,      including scheduling, purchased care and project coordination      systems, as well as a modest increase of $400 million for      additional VBA staff to address the claims and appeals      backlogs.       In reviewing the additional resource requirements      identified by Secretary Gibson, the undersigned find them to      be commensurate with the historical funding shortfalls      identified in recent years by many of our organizations,      including The Independent Budget (IB), which is authored and      endorsed by many of our organizations. For example, in the      prior ten VA budgets, the amount of funding for medical care      requested by the Administration and ultimately provided to VA      by Congress was more than $7.8 billion less than what was      recommended by the IB. Over just the past five years, the IB      recommended $4 billion more than VA requested or Congress      approved and for next year, FY 2015, the IB has recommended      over $2 billion more than VA requested. Further corroboration      of the shortfall in VA's medical care funding came two weeks      ago from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which issued      a revised report on H.R. 3230 estimating that, ``. . . under      current law for 2015 and CBO's baseline projections for 2016,      VA's appropriations for health care are not projected to keep      pace with growth in the patient population or growth in per      capita spending for health care--meaning that waiting times      will tend to increase . . .''       Similarly, over the past decade the amount of funding      requested by VA for major and minor construction, and the      final amount appropriated by Congress, has been more than $9      billion less than what the IB estimated was needed to allow      VA sufficient space to deliver timely, high-quality care.      Over the past five years alone, that shortfall is more than      $6.6 billion and for next year the VA budget request is more      than $2.5 billion less than the IB recommendation. Funding      for nonrecurring maintenance (NRM) has also been woefully      inadequate. Importantly, the IB recommendations closely      mirror VA's Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP), which      VA uses to determine infrastructure needs. According to SCIP,      VA should invest between $56 to $69 billion in facility      improvements over the next ten years, which would require      somewhere between $5 to $7 billion annually. However, the      Administration's budget requests over the past four years      have averaged less than $2 billion annually for major and      minor construction and for NRM, and Congress has not      significantly increased those funding requests in the final      appropriations.       Taking into account the progress achieved by VA over the      past two months, and considering the funding shortfalls our      organizations have identified over the past decade and in      next year's budget, the undersigned believe that Congress      must quickly approve supplemental funding that fully meets      the critical needs identified by Secretary Gibson, and which      fulfills the principles and priorities we laid out a month      ago. Such an approach would be a reasonable and practical way      to expand access now, while building internal capacity to      avoid future access crises in the future. In contrast to the      legislative proposals in the Conference Committee which would      require months to promulgate new regulations, establish new      procedures and set up new offices, the VA proposal could have      an immediate impact on increasing access to care for veterans      today by building upon VA's ongoing expanded access      initiatives and sustaining them over the next three years.      Furthermore, by investing in new staff and treatment space,      VA would be able to continue providing this expanded level of      care, even while increasing its use of purchased care when      and where it is needed.       In our jointly signed letter last month, we applauded both      the House and Senate for working expeditiously and in a      bipartisan manner to move legislation designed to address the      access crisis, and we understand you are continuing to work      towards a compromise bill. As leaders of the nation's major      veterans organization, we now ask that you work in the same      bipartisan spirit to provide VA supplemental funding      addressing the needs outlined by Secretary Gibson to the      floor as quickly as feasible, approve it and send it to the      President so that he can enact it to help ensure that no      veteran waits too long to get the care they earned through      their service. We look forward to your response.           Respectfully,         Garry J. Augustine, Executive Director, Washington            Headquarters, DAV (Disabled American Veterans); Homer            S.
