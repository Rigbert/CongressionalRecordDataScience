President, today I proudly tell my friends in the Senate about an impressive milestone in the history of Vermont business. This winter marked 50 years since IBM President Tom Watson Jr. opened a manufacturing plant in Essex Junction. Today, IBM is Vermont's largest private employer and one of the foundations to a growing technology sector throughout our State.  Many events have and will be planned to celebrate the many achievements IBM and its workforce have made in the Green Mountain State. Most recently, Vermont Business Magazine ran a collection of news pieces and special features in its April 2007 issue about IBM's history in Vermont.  I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed I wrote recognizing the successes that IBM and Vermont have enjoyed during the past 50 years be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From Vermont Business Magazine, Apr. 2007]               IBM's 50 Years of Innovation and Evolution                       (By Senator Patrick Leahy)       In 1957, then IBM President Tom Watson Jr. selected      Vermont's Essex Junction to     build one of his company's key manufacturing facilities. Five      decades later, the technology and family of employees at IBM      Essex have come to define Northern Vermont as much as the      snowy winters, short summers and Yankee ingenuity that lured      Tom Watson to the Green Mountains in the first place.       The Essex Junction plant has been an integral part of IBM's      global strategy since its inception. In what has to be      considered an incredible ``run,'' IBM Essex has been a      worldwide leader in the development, design and manufacture      of semiconductor technology for the past 50 years. That is      quite an achievement in the cyclical and volatile      semiconductor industry and a testament to the tens of      thousands of Vermonters--and newly minted Vermonters--who      have worked tirelessly to maintain this world-class status      for the past five decades. That has meant adroitly adopting      strategies and new manufacturing processes over the years.      The plant has transformed itself from a general semiconductor      manufacturing facility to a high-end specialty logic      semiconductor manufacturing facility. This growth--and this      change--was possible with the vision and dedication of the      designers, engineers, inventors and technicians who work      along the banks of the Winooski River.       IBM, its partners and clients have literally and      figuratively altered the economy of Chittenden County and      Vermont for generations to come. From software companies big      and small, to cutting-edge nano-technology engineering firms,      the businesses attracted to IBM and the companies started by      former IBM employees have created high-paying jobs and a      culture of innovation that are envied across the New England      region.       During my 30 years representing Vermont in the United      States Senate, I have worked frequently with IBM's corporate      leadership, IBM's local leadership and many of the frontline      employees. The federal government recognizes that IBM Essex      is a national asset: a world class domestic production      facility with the highest reputation for ingenuity and      productivity and quality. That is why the Defense Advanced      Research Project Agency (DARPA) invested millions in the mask      house in Vermont. And that is why it made complete sense for      the federal government to select Essex Junction as a      ``Trusted Foundry'' to design and produce critical      semiconductors resulting in orders as high as $600 million      over the next decade.       The innovation at IBM Essex has played an important role in      helping IBM lead the nation in patent creation for more than      a decade. Last year alone, 360 patents came directly from the      IBM Essex Junction facility--making it one of IBM's top five      patent-producing facilities. The fostering and protection of      intellectual property is important not only to Vermont but to      the nation. During my tenure in the Senate I have made      reforms of our patent laws a high priority and I'll continue      to press that cause as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary      Committee.       The technology sector has changed dramatically over the      past five decades. That IBM Essex has successfully maintained      world class leadership despite all of these changes is simply      incredible. IBM Essex designs and manufactures microchips for      some of the world's leading computer, communications and      consumer products companies. Products and technology from IBM      in Vermont have helped make computers and electronic products      smaller, faster, cheaper and more reliable.       I would venture to say that Tom Watson's vision for IBM in      Vermont has turned out to be a great success. On behalf of      all Vermonters, I offer everyone who has made IBM Essex a      success a heartfelt thank you, for job after job, done well.      Congratulations on fifty years of innovation and prosperity.                          ____________________
