 President, today, I am introducing the Excellence in Education Act of 2001.  The purpose of this bill is to 1. reduce the size of schools; 2. reduce the size of classes; and 3. bring accountability to the use of these funds. The bill would create a matching grant program to build new schools to meet the following size requirements:  For kindergarten through 5th grade, not more than 500 students, for grades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students and for grades 9 through 12, not more than 1,500 students.  For kindergarten through grade 6, not more than 20 students per teacher and for grades 7 through 12, not more than 28 students per teacher.  The bill authorizes $1 billion each year for the next five years for theU.S. Department of Education to award grants to local school districts. School districts would have to match federal funds with an equal amount. In addition to making the above reductions, school districts would be required to terminate social promotion, provide remedial education, and require that students be subject to state achievement standards in the core academic curriculum.  This bill will provide a new funding source for school districts or states to match to build new schools and reduce both school size and class size. There is no good estimate of how many schools would be needed to reduce schools and classes to the levels specified in the bill, but we all know that there are too many large schools and large classes in public education today.  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build 6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This estimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school sizes. Consequently, the need for the funds my bill would authorize is huge.  Why do we need this bill?  First, many of our schools are just too big, especially in urban areas. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. Some schools have as many as 4,000 students. In fact, half of American high school students go to schools that have 1,500 students or more.  Equally serious is the fact that our classes are too big. Even though we have begun to reduce class sizes in the lower grades in California, it still has some of the largest class sizes in the United States.  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class sizes are reduced. The Oakland, California, school district plans to open 10 new small schools in the next few years. The Oakland tribune explained it like this on October 18, 2000: ``Small schools are viewed as antidotes to huge, factory-like campuses commonplace in America's inner cities. Research has shown that small schools create intimate learning atmospheres for students and teachers.''  The U.S. Department of Education cites studies that list these benefits of small schools: students have a greater sense of belonging; fewer discipline problems occur; crime, violence and gang activity go down; alcohol and tobacco abuse decline; dropout rates fall and graduation rates rise; and student attendance increases.  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high school size is between 600 and 900 students. Studies show that small schools have higher academic achievement, fewer discipline problems, lower dropout rates, higher levels of student participation, higher graduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's school administrators are calling for smaller, more personalized schools.  A Tennessee study called Project STAR placed 6,500 kindergartners in 330 classes of different sizes. The students stayed in small classes for four years and then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. The test scores and behavior of students in the smaller classes were better than those of children in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that smaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, ask more questions, and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools and smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.  California has some of the largest schools in the country; Los Angeles has some of the largest classes and schools in the world! Here are some examples in the Los Angeles area: Hawaiian Elementary, 1,365 students; South Gate Middle School, 4,442 students; Belmont High School, 4,874 students.  California also has some large classes, even though we have made great progress in reducing teacher-to-pupil ratios in the lower grades. Still today, many middle and high school English and math classes are very large, up to as many as 39 students.  The American public supports increased federal funding for school construction. The Rebuild American Coalition last year found that 82 percent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, up from 74 percent in a 1998 National Education Association poll.  Every parent knows the importance of a small class in which the teacher can give individualized attention to a student. Every parent knows the importance of the sense of a community that can come with attending a small school. And every parent knows that big schools and big classes can be a stressful learning environment.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in passing this important education reform. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 308       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
