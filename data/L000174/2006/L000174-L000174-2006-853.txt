President, there has been some question about--and I think I am fortunate--comments suggesting motivation of veterans who support this legislation. A lot of veterans support this legislation. A lot of veterans have been badly damaged by exposure to asbestos, and they have no way of seeking compensation except in this legislation.  A lot of labor unions feel the same way. These are not the so-called K Street lobbyists, these are not special interests; these are people who care about those they represent, the veterans they represent, the workers they represent.  I ask unanimous consent that these letters of recommendations be printed in the Record, and I will name them:  A letter from the Military Order of the Purple Heart, another signed by the Air Force Sergeant Association, American Ex-Prisoners of War, Blinded American Veterans Foundation, Blinded Veterans Association, Fleet Reserve Association, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, Marine Corps League--my son is a former marine--Military Officers Association of America, National Association of Black Veterans, Noncommissioned Officers Association, National Association of Uniformed Services, National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, Retired Enlisted Association, Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc., Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Women in Military Service for America, Memorial Foundation, Inc., the U.S. Submarine Veterans, Inc., Lockwood Internet Base, U.S. Submarine Veterans of World War II, U.S. Submarine Veterans Base Rhode Island, U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Thames River Chapter, U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Central Connecticut Chapter, the UAW, the Heat & Frost Insulators & Asbestos Workers International, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, the Governors of Alaska, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Utah, and Vermont, and the National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB. Those are among some of those.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            International Union of                                   Painters and Allied Trades,                                  Washington, DC, August 17, 2005.     Re: S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act          of 2005 (FAIR Act)''     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I write you today in      regard to S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury      Resolution Act of 2005 (FAlR Act)''. On behalf of 140,000      families represented by the International Union of Painters      and Allied Trades, IUPAT, I would like to express our strong      support for S. 852 in its current form and your continued      efforts toward a bipartisan bill that will ensure true, just      and fair compensation to current and future victims of      asbestos exposure.       We appreciate all efforts to incorporate a number of key      provisions and safeguards that have been advocated on behalf      of workers who have been harmed by exposure to asbestos and      who have been adversely affecred by a current asbestos      compensation system that is slow, costly, unfair and      arbitrary. However, the IUPAT remains concerned     about potentially hostile amendments that may be offered on      the Senate or House floor that would effectively undermine      key provisions of the bill dealing with funding, medical      criteria, awards, and other issues. We will continue to urge      you, along with other Senate and House members, to reject any      such amendments. Should any amendments be adopted that would      undercut the progress made on this complex issue the IUPAT      will have no other choice but to withdraw our support for the      bill.       We feel the trust fund model is the best solution for      addressing the asbestos comopensation crisis workers and      business currently face. After years of numerous stakeholder      meetings, we are confident that our members' and all affected      workers' interests are best protected by key provisions in      your legislation as presently drafted. Of particular interest      to us are provisions contained within your legislation that      ensures fair compensation to asbestos victims with      mesothelioma, lung cancer, or those victims who have      impairment from asbesotosis or asbestos exposure that      includes objective medical evidence or markers of asbestos      exposure that includes CT scan review; no delay for victims'      access to the tort system in state or federal court if the      trust fund becomes insolvent; protection for victims from      insurance subrogation; a ban of asbestos in the United      States; a medical screening program for high risk workers;      and enforcement provisions to prevent needless exposure to      asbestos by uninformed and unsuspecting workers.       It is our hope that the International Union of Painters and      Allied Trades' support for S. 852, along with other labor      organizations, businesses, employer associations, and      victims' groups, will allow this bipartisan bill to receive      strong backing in the Senate on final passage and will      therefore assure that the Senate passed bill with the      aforementioned key provisions is accepted and passed by the      House of Representatives.       Thank you for your continued efforts in dealing with this      important issue.           Sincerely and fraternally,                                                James A. Williams,     General President.                                  ____                                                  October 7, 2005.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid: On      July 18, the National Governors' Association approved a      revised policy on Asbestos Litigation Reform. This policy      calls for legislative action to address this continuing      problem affecting states in a variety of ways.       America faces a crisis from asbestos litigation that      continues to take its toll on the sick, their families, and      our economy. Today there are hundreds of thousands of      asbestos claims in the courts with tens of thousands of new      claims filed each year. This is a unique legal situation that      requires congressional action to alleviate this logjam of      cases.       In addition to those who have become sick from asbestos      exposure, the impact of the claims also hurts employees,      retirees, shareholders, and customers of defendant companies,      whose jobs and savings are jeopardized or lost. Our national      economy also is hurt in the areas of jobs, pensions, stock      prices, tax revenues, and insurance costs. We believe that      this is truly a national crisis. Without a solution, more      companies will be forced into bankruptcy, delaying and      reducing resources available to pay those who are now sick or      may become sick in the future.       We believe that it is time for Congress to respond to the      Supreme Court's repeated calls for a legislation solution to      this crisis. Congressional enactment of legislation is      imperative to ensure that those ill from exposure to      asbestos-containing products and their facilities are fairly      compensated and that defendant companies are financially      secure so that they can pay present and future claims.       We understand S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury      Resolution Act of 2005,'' was voted out of the Judiciary      Committee with a bipartisan 13-5 majority and is ready for      action on the Senate floor. We urge you to schedule debate on      this critical legislation as soon as possible.           Sincerely,         Governor Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska; Governor Mike            Huckabee, Arkansas; Governor Jennifer M. Granholm,            Michigan; Governor Haley Barbour, Mississippi; Governor            Matt Blunt, Missouri; Governor Brian Schweitzer,            Montana; Governor Bob Taft, Ohio; Governor Jon Huntsman            Jr., Utah; Governor Jim Douglas, Vermont.                                  ____                                               National Federation                                      of Independent Business,                                  Washington, DC, February 6, 2006     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the 600,000 members of      the National Federation of Independent Business, I am writing      to express our support for S. 852, ``The Fairness in Asbestos      Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005.'' The FAIR Act will      help protect innocent small-business owners from the asbestos      litigation crisis that now threatens their business.       Asbestos lawsuits against small businesses are on the rise.      After years of suing large corporations for multi-million      dollar damage awards, ``traditional'' asbestos manufacturers      and defendants are mostly bankrupt. As a result, asbestos      litigation now targets companies far removed from any      potential wrongdoing, including small businesses. This      relatively untapped pool of defendants is an attractive      target for trial lawyers since small-business owners and      their insurers can be forced to pay millions of dollars in      damages. Horrifying for a small-business owner is the      prospect that they can be hauled into court without having      any relationship to asbestos or the plaintiff. Many small      businesses are forced to settle because they don't have the      money or time to be away from their businesses. Not only do      they face the stigma of having to settle, and the loss of      time and money, but they will likely also experience higher      insurance rates.       By creating an alternative compensation system to resolve      asbestos claims, S. 852 will fix a badly broken system that      is not working and, in the process, compensate victims      faster. In addition to lawsuit relief, the legislation      relieves small businesses with either low or no asbestos      liability from having to pay into the compensation fund. No      business that meets the Small Business Administration      description of a small business can be required to pay a      penny into the fund. Nor will any small business that has      carried less than $1 million in asbestos expenditures before      December 31, 2002 have to pay into the fund.       This legislation will help prevent small businesses from      having to spend the time and money to defend themselves in      asbestos lawsuits. It takes a significant step towards fixing      part of our litigation crisis that hurts business, big and      small, and ultimately keeps the victim from receiving      compensation.       Thank you for your support of small business.           Sincerely,                                                   Dan Danner,                                         Executive Vice President,     Public Policy and Political.                                  ____                                             Military Order of the                                                 Purple Heart,                               Springfield, VA, December 13, 2005.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of The Military Order of the      Purple Heart (MOPH), I ask you to join our organization and      roughly a dozen other national veteran service organizations      and support passage of S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos      Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act.       Years after serving in the military, many veterans are now      discovering they suffer from terrible diseases related to the      asbestos they were exposed to during their time in the U.S.      military. The government used asbestos materials in a number      of facilities and crafts, affecting the health of the men and      women serving before and after the Second World War.       The FAIR Act offers sick veterans a way to receive the      compensation they deserve. Right now, it is difficult for      veterans to turn to the courts for help with their asbestos-     related medical costs. Veterans are barred by law from suing      their employer (the federal government) for compensation. But      by taking asbestos claims out of the court system, the FAIR      Act will ensure veterans will have a speedy and just avenue      for receiving compensation.       Senator Bill Frist, with bipartisan support; recently      asserted that he will make the FAIR Act a top priority for      the Senate in January. He clearly understands that the FAIR      Act is the only viable solution for sick veterans. Passage of      this bill would provide immediate and ample aid to veterans      as well as other victims of asbestos exposure.       Please vote yes on the FAIR Act and help relieve the      suffering and financial burden of our veterans.           Respectfully,                                                 James D. Randles,     National Commander.                                  ____                                                 January 31, 2006.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid: Veterans across the country who are      afflicted with asbestos-related diseases would at last get      compensation and relief under the Fairness in Asbestos Injury      Resolution (FAIR) Act. But according to a number recent media      reports, you have labelled the FAIR Act as a bill that caters      to special interests and have informed Majority Leader Frist      in writing that you will oppose this critical legislation. In      all frankness, your words and actions are extremely      disappointing to veterans across this nation--surely you do      not consider sick veterans to be a ``special interest''?       The FAIR Act will provide proper compensation to sick men      and women who volunteered to fight for our country--     compensation they simply can't get under the current system.      The military used asbestos throughout its facilities, bases,      and ships during and after World War II, and countless      veterans were exposed to this deadly material. But because      the U.S. government has asserted sovereign immunity, these      sick veterans are unble to seek compensation from the      government through the courts.       The FAIR Act's victims' trust fund would open a door for      veterans that has been closed for years.       We are disappointed that you are trying to keep that door      closed and stop veterans from receiving the compensation they      deserve. Sick veterans--and indeed, all victims--deserve      better than political gamesmanship on this critical issue. We      urge you not to stand in the way of full Senate consideration      of this vital legislation.       The FAIR Act is more than overdue. The Senate has been      debating these reforms for years. Sick victims, including      sick veterans, shouldn't be forced to wait for help any      longer.

Dear Senator: Next week the Senate is scheduled to take up      the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005      (S. 852), sponsored by Senators Specter and Leahy. The UAW      strongly supports this legislation. We urge you to support      this critically important legislation, and to support cloture      both on the motion to proceed and on the bill itself.       The UAW supports S. 852 because we are firmly convinced it      would be far superior to the current tort system in      compensating the victims of asbestos-related diseases. Under      the existing tort system, many victims receive little or no      compensation because those responsible for the asbestos      exposure are bankrupt, immune from liability or can't be      identified. Even when victims do receive some award, the      litigation takes far too long, and the amounts are highly      unpredictable. Far too much money is wasted on attorney fees      and other litigation costs, or dispersed to individuals who      are not impaired.       The Specter-Leahy bill would solve these problems by      establishing a $140 billion federal trust fund to compensate      the victims of asbestos-related diseases through a stream-     lined, no-fault administrative system. This system will      provide much speedier compensation to victims according to a      predictable schedule of payments for specified disease levels      that focuses compensation on those who have the most serious      impairments. It will also guarantee that victims can receive      adequate compensation, regardless of whether those      responsible for the asbestos exposure are bankrupt or      otherwise immune from liability.       The UAW strongly supports the provision in the Specter-     Leahy bill that does not permit any subrogation against      worker compensation or health care payments received by      asbestos victims. We believe this provision is essential to      ensure that victims receive adequate compensation, and do not      have their awards largely offset by other payments. We      strongly urge you to oppose any amendment that would      undermine victims' compensation by allowing subrogation.       The UAW also urges you to reject any other amendments that      would reduce or restrict eligibility for compensation for the      victims of asbestos-related diseases. This includes any      amendments that would strike medical monitoring or eliminate      Level VI awards.        The UAW supports the provisions in S. 852 that require      broad sections of the business and insurance industries to      make contributions to finance the $140 billion federal trust      fund. We believe this broad-based, predictable financing      mechanism is vastly preferable to the current tort system,      which has already driven many companies into bankruptcy, and      is threatening the economic health of other companies that      used products containing asbestos, including the major auto      manufacturers. Continuation of the existing tort system will      inevitably lead to more bankruptcies, resulting in more lost      jobs and wage and benefit cut backs for workers and retirees.      However, to ensure that the financing mechanism in S. 852      remains equitable and workable, the UAW believes it is      essential that the Senate reject any amendments that would      severely narrow or cap the financing base and jeopardize the      guarantee that $140 billion will be made available to      compensate asbestos victims.       The UAW recognizes that a number of specific concerns have      been raised by other labor organizations about various      provisions in S. 852. We are continuing to work for      improvements in the legislation, and are hopeful that      Senators Specter and Leahy will largely address these      concerns in a manager's amendment.       However, the UAW does not agree with those who have taken      exception to the 5 percent cap on attorney fees for monetary      claimants. This cap ensures that asbestos victims will be      adequately compensated, and not see their awards severely      reduced by exorbitant attorney fees. This cap will not impede      the ability of claimants to get adequate legal      representation. Because S. 852 establishes a non-adversarial,      no-fault administrative system, the difficulties and costs      involved in bringing asbestos claims will be greatly reduced.      Indeed, much of the work can be done by paralegals. We also      believe that labor unions and other groups can help provide      free or lower cost representation for asbestos victims by      hiring staff attorneys and other professionals to process the      claims under the no-fault administrative system. Through such      mechanisms, asbestos victims can receive competent      representation with little or no attorney fees being deducted      from their awards.       Finally, the UAW recognizes that questions have been raised      about the projections for asbestos claims and the solvency of      the trust fund. We would note that most stakeholders agreed      to $140 billion in financing early last year. Although all of      the projections are subject to some element of uncertainty,      the UAW believes that the $140 billion in financing is      sufficient to enable the trust fund to compensate asbestos      victims for a lengthy period of time. It is also important to      remember that S. 852 provides for reversion of asbestos      claims to the tort system in the event the federal trust fund      should ever have insufficient funds to pay all claims. While      we hope these reversion provisions will never be triggered,      they do provide assurance that victims will always have some      recourse for seeking compensation.       It is easy for critics to point out shortcomings in S. 852.      The UAW submits, however, that it is abundantly clear the      asbestos compensation system established by the Specter-Leahy      bill would be far preferable to the existing tort system. It      would do a much better job of providing prompt, equitable      compensation to asbestos victims. And it would finance this      compensation through a rationale system that does not lead to      bankruptcies that threaten the jobs, wages and benefits of      thousands of workers.        For all of these reasons, the UAW strongly supports the      FAIR Act, S. 852. We urge you to vote for this legislation,      and to support efforts to invoke cloture on the motion to      proceed and on the bill itself.       Thank you for considering our views on this vital issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Alan Reuther,     Legislative Director.                                  ____         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators &            Asbestos Workers,                                     Lanham, MD, February 6, 2006.       Dear Senator, We strongly support the courageous and bi-     partisan work of Senator Arlen Specter (R.) and Senator      Patrick Leahy (D.), co-sponsors of the Fairness in Asbestos      Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 (S. 852) which comes to      the Senate Floor this week.       We support the Bill as presently drafted. We ask that you      support the Bill as well.       Our U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal legislation is      necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we      agree. Currently, only 42 cents of every dollar spent in this      broken system goes to victims, their widows and kids.       I recently wrote our membership across the country to      advise them of our support for this Bi1l, and to urge them to      contact you in support of S. 852. I advised our membership      that this Bill is not perfect. But nothing ever is when      problems of this magnitude are addressed.       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair      and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who      have suffered, or will suffer from the devastating effects of      asbestos exposure in decades to come.       We urge you to reject amendments of special interest groups      on either side of the issue that would change the core      provisions of the Bill.       Such amendments can only be hostile to the interests of      fundamental fairness and equity. We have promised our      membership that we would fight vigorously to oppose any      change that would make this Bill unfair or inequitable.           Very truly yours,                                                  James A. Grogan,     General President.                                  ____         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators &            Asbestos Workers,                                     Lanham, MD, January 31, 2006.       Dear Brothers and Sisters: The Fairness in Asbestos Injury      Resolution Act of 2005 (Asbestos Bill S. 852) is scheduled to      be brought to the floor of the United States Senate in early      February of this year.       Bi-Partisan Co-Sponsors of S. 852: Senator Arlen Specter      (R.) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D.): Nobody has worked harder      than Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter (R.) of      Pennsylvania and Ranking Minority     Member Senator Patrick Leahy (D.) of Vermont in trying to get      a fair and equitable and bi-partisan Bill that helps those      who have suffered the devastating effects of exposure to      asbestos. These two courageous Senators have worked      tirelessly during the last three years--to craft changes to      the Bill after listening to reasonable suggestions from      Labor, Business and Insurance negotiators.       Special interest groups on both sides of the issue have      tried to derail their good work. But Senators Specter and      Leahy have stood tall in search of an equitable legislative      solution.       This office has actively participated in the negotiating      process of this Bill over the last three years: Your      International has been actively involved in extended and      complicated negotiations to bring about this legislative      solution. Our U.S. Supreme Court has held that legislation is      necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we      agree.       Let us begin by stating that this Bill is not perfect.      Nothing ever is. For the last 10-20 years the current      asbestos compensation system has produced inequitable and      unfair results. Tens of billions of dollars have gone to      people who are not sick. This is wrong. The current system is      broken, notwithstanding what special interest groups may      claim. We believe this Bill offers the best hope of providing      equitable compensation while expediting the compensation and      review process on a national basis, regardless of where you      live, or who your attorney might be.       Over 300,000 pending or current asbestos claims cry out for      a fair legislative solution from Congress: Currently it is      estimated that there are more than 300,000 pending asbestos-     related claims. In a recent study by RAND, it was determined      that only $0.42 (42 cents) of every dollar spent on      litigation is awarded to the actual victims, their widows and      kids. A majority of the funds is paid to transaction costs,      including lawyers' fees for corporations and claimants.       $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) trust fund for victims of      asbestos induced mesothelioma, lung cancer aud asbestosis      under a no-fault system with set awards based on severity of      disease: This Bill would establish a $140 billion Trust Fund      to compensate victims who are truly sick from asbestos      exposure under a no-fault compensation system administered by      the Department of Labor. Objective medical criteria that will      rule in asbestos induced disease, and will rule out disease      not caused by asbestos exposure has been negotiated and      approved by us and medical experts we have retained. This      legislation will offer the following expedited settlements:        Mesothehoma: $1,100,000 per case: Lung Cancer with      Asbestosis, $600,000-975,000 per case, Lung Cancer with      Asbestos Pleural Markers, $300,000-725,000 per case,      Disabling Asbestosis (not cancerous), $850,000 per case,      Asbestosis with Some Impairment, $100,000-400,000 per case.       Attorneys' fees have been limited to 5 percent under the      legislation. It is to be expected that lawyers who have      received tens of millions of dollars in asbestos fees might      voice some objection to the Bill. Insurance companies who      will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars into the      Trust are likewise objecting to this courageous attempt by      Senators Specter and Leahy to solve the asbestos compensation      crisis.       The Pipefitters, Painters and United Auto Workers have      joined with us: The leadership of the Plumbers and      Pipefitters (the UA), the Painters (IUPAT) and the United      Auto Workers (UAW), have joined with us in supporting this      Asbestos Bill, S. 852. We believe the leadership of other      trade unions will come to join us in the weeks ahead in      support of this Bill.       Funding: We are aware of those who, in good faith, question      whether $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) will be sufficient to      fund the Trust to compensate all American victims of asbestos      induced cancer and asbestosis.We share their good faith      concern.       But there have been too many bankruptcies as a result of      the current asbestos litigation crisis. If funding mandated      under the Bill proves insufficient, the Bill provides that      individuals may return to the court system and pursue a      lawsuit in their State or Federal Court before a jury of      their peers. This was a hard fought and fair compromise.       Let me close by saying that this International Union      remains deeply committed to supporting a meaningful,      comprehensive solution to our national asbestos litigation      crisis. Be assured if we become aware of changes or      amendments to this Bill that will be to the detriment of      workers and their families, we will fight them, and will not      hesitate to change our position if needed.
