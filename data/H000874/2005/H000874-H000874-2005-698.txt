 Now it is my great pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to introduce or to yield to one of the senior members of the House of Representatives, the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts, mayor of his town before he came here, and as a member of the Ways and Means Committee has been in the leadership of opposing complicating the Tax Code, opposing making it less fair and opposing tax legislation which sent jobs overseas. He has been a true giant in the leadership on this effort, and I am pleased to join with him in this effort that we join tonight. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).
