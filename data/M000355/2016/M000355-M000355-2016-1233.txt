 President, I recently joined my good friend fromIowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in writing an opinion piece. We expressed our joint view that the death of Justice Scalia represented a significant loss for our country and that while finding the right person to take the seat he occupied will clearly be a monumental task, it is one we think the American people are more than well equipped to handle. Some disagree and would rather the Senate simply rush through yet another lifetime appointment for a President who is on his way out the door.  Of course, it is within the President's authority to nominate a successor even in this very rare circumstance. Remember, the Senate has not filled a vacancy arising in an election year when there was a divided government since 1888--almost 130 years ago. But we also know that article II, section 2 of the Constitution grants the Senate the right to withhold its consent as it deems necessary.  It is clear that concern over confirming Supreme Court nominations made near the end of a Presidential term is not new. Given that we are in the midst of the Presidential election process, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I believe that today it is the American people who are best positioned to help make this important decision rather than a lameduck President whose priorities and policies they just rejected in the most recent national election.                          ____________________
