If the gentleman will yield, the enactment of H.R. 1420 should not impact these rights-of-way. As the gentleman has noted, rights-of-way on refuges are granted by the Fish and Wildlife Service under provisions of the existing National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, provisions which are not amended by this bill. That act requires the Service to first determine that the proposed right-of-way is compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.  This bill utilizes the same definitions of compatibility that the Service has used administratively for many years. Its enactment will create no higher standard for rights-of-way than exist at present. We are changing the process by which decisions are made, not the standard which is used to make them.  The Fish and Wildlife Service accompanies rights-of-way permits with terms and conditions necessary to ensure that the right-of-way remains compatible. What would be examined under the 10-year review required by this bill is the compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit, not the existence of the right-of-way. The Fish and Wildlife Service does this now. The only change would be in the process by which the review is conducted. There would be no adverse impacts on electrical or other rights-of-way through this review.
