TITLE IV--KOBY MANDELL ACT     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Koby Mandell Act of      2003''.     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Numerous American citizens have been murdered or maimed      by terrorists around the world.       (2) Some American citizens who have been victims of      terrorism overseas have not received from the United States      Government services equal to those received by other such      victims of overseas terrorism.       (3) The United States Government has not devoted adequate      efforts or resources to the apprehension of terrorists who      have harmed American citizens overseas. Monetary rewards for      information leading to the capture of terrorists overseas,      which the government advertises in regions where the      terrorists are believed to be hiding, have not been      advertised adequately.       (4) To remedy these and related problems, an office should      be established within the Department of Justice for the      purpose of ensuring equally vigorous efforts to capture all      terrorists who have harmed American citizens overseas and      equal treatment for all American victims of overseas      terrorism.     SEC. 403. ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF                    JUSTICE TO UNDERTAKE SPECIFIC STEPS TO                    FACILITATE THE CAPTURE OF TERRORISTS WHO HAVE                    HARMED AMERICAN CITIZENS OVERSEAS AND TO ENSURE                    THAT ALL AMERICAN VICTIMS OF OVERSEAS TERRORISM                    ARE TREATED EQUALLY.       The President shall establish within the Department of      Justice an office (hereinafter in this title the ``Office'')      to carry out the following activities:       (1) The Office shall create the Bringing Terrorists to      Justice program, and in so doing will ensure that--       (A) rewards are offered to capture all terrorists involved      in harming American citizens overseas, regardless of the      terrorists' country of origin or residence;       (B) such rewards are prominently advertised in the mass      media and public sites in all countries or regions where such      terrorists reside;       (C) the names and photographs and suspects in all such      cases are included on a web site; and       (D) the names of the specific organizations claiming      responsibility for terrorist attacks mentioned on the site      are included in the descriptions of those attacks.       (2) The Office shall establish and administer a program      which will provide notification for American victims of      overseas terrorism or their immediate family to update them      on the status of efforts to capture the terrorists who harmed      them.       (3) The Office shall work with the other United States      government agencies to expand legal restrictions on the      ability of murderers to reap profits from books or movies      concerning their crimes--the ``Son of Sam'' laws that      currently exist in many States, so as to ensure that      terrorists who harm American citizens overseas are unable to      profit from book or movie sales in the United States.       (4) The Office shall endeavor to determine if terrorists      who have harmed American citizens overseas are serving in      their local police or security forces. Whenever it is found      that terrorists who have harmed American citizens overseas      are serving in their local police or security forces, the      Office shall alert those United States Government agencies      involved in providing assistance, directly or indirectly, to      those forces, and shall request of those agencies that all      such assistance be halted until the aforementioned terrorists      are removed from their positions.       (5) The Office shall undertake a comprehensive assessment      of the pattern of United States indictments and prosecution      of terrorists who have harmed American citizens overseas, in      order to determine the reasons for the absence of indictments      of terrorists residing in some regions. The Office's      assessment shall then be provided to the Attorney General,      together with its recommendations.       (6) The Office shall endeavor to monitor public actions by      governments and regimes overseas pertaining to terrorists who      have harmed American citizens, such as naming of schools,      streets, or other public institutions or sites after such      terrorists. In such instances, the Office shall encourage      other United States Government agencies to halt their      provision of assistance, directly or indirectly, to those      institutions.       (7) In cases where terrorists who have harmed Americans      overseas, and are subsequently released from incarceration      abroad, are eligible for further prosecution in the United      States, the Office shall coordinate with other government      agencies to seek the transfer of those terrorists to the      United States for further prosecution.
