Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I want to take this time to thank the gentleman from California (Chairman Lewis) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), the ranking member, for their assistance in including language in this important bill concerning Beryllium illness and compensation and to make it a part of this defense appropriations measure.  The language in the bill requires the Department of Defense to report to Congress for the first time on the incidence of Beryllium-related diseases amongst Department of Defense current and former employees, contractor employees serving during the Cold War, and vendor employees and to do so by May of next year.  This requirement is a complement to the work already undertaken by the Department of Energy, under the leadership of Secretary Richardson, the difficulty we are having in getting our executive branch to focus on those workers who are ill who have performed work related to Beryllium either in Government-run plants, such as DOE facilities, or plants that were totally 100 percent contract shops for the Department of Defense or their vendors.  The House would have considered the defense authorization bill last month included a sense of Congress resolution stating that Congress and the Federal Government has a responsibility toward people suffering from Chronic Beryllium Disease and other occupational diseases contracted while performing work related to our national security. But, of course, there was no actual compensation or medical benefits even contemplated in that particular measure.  I want to place on the Record, Mr. Chairman, the bill that I have introduced, H.R. 3418, that actually would authorize that compensation and medical assistance for people who served in the line of duty to this country who are dying and who are having the Government of the United States turn its back on them year after year.  Let me also state, for the Record, that Chronic Beryllium Disease is a horrendous illness. It is often debilitating, and it can be a fatal lung condition for a small percentage of people who worked in this industry, 2 percent. But we believe over 1,200 Americans have contracted this disease mostly by working in defense-related plants and some in energy-related facilities.  What essentially happens is that if they have the Beryllium sensitivity, their lungs begin to crystallize over a period of time and they, essentially, are strangled to death.  One of the people who was so injured was a constituent in my district, Mr. Gaylen Lemke, who first came to see me over 5 years ago to tell me about his experience. He worked in a contract shop that was on contract to the Department of Defense. Without question, he contributed his work and his life to this Nation winning the Cold War; and he suffered a slow and cruel death, as the disease slowly sapped his ability to breathe over the years.  Gaylen Lemke is as much a veteran of this country as anyone who has flown an airplane or served on a submarine, and we owe him and his survivors the kind of treatment and compensation we provide for those who have suffered in the service of our Nation, our paralyzed veterans, our disabled veterans.  I really hope that this Congress will find a way to provide the kind of compensation and medical care so these families, at one of the most difficult times in their lives, do not have to worry about the compensation and medical care for the person who has done so much for the Nation.  I just again want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) and the gentleman from California (Chairman Lewis) for including the language in this bill that pushes us forward as a country to understand the true costs of freedom.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the following time line of events on Beryllium disease and what we, as a country, have done thus far:            Chronic Beryllium Disease Background Memorandum     U.S. Beryllium production       Brush Wellman, Inc. in Elmore, Ohio, is currently the only      company in the country that produces beryllium, a strong,      light metal. Beryllium is of strategic interest to the United      States because of its unique applications in the aeronautic      and aerospace fields. It is also an important component in      nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities.       A former Brush facility in Luckey, Ohio, was closed in      1958, and it is currently undergoing remediation by the U.S.      Army Corps of Engineers.       The Brush manufacturing facility in Elmore employs about      600 people and produces both berryllium and beryllium alloy      products.       Brush mines and processes beryllium ore at its facility in      Delta, Utah, and has other facilities in Pennsylvania and      Arizona.       Until the mid-1990's Brush was primarily a defense      dependent industry with the Department of Defense and      Department of Energy being as much as 90% of its customer      base. Since then, the company has made a major transition      toward commercial products, and today those alloy products      represent the majority of the company's production. The      transition has also resulted in the expansion of the Elmore      plant and increased employment there.     Kaptur legislative initiatives relating to beryllium       Defense Strategic Metals Classification and Defense      Conversion: Initiatives in several Defense Authorization      bills to classify beryllium and related strategic metals as a      unique set of defense-related materials requiring special      attention and the transition of defense-related production to      commercial market applications.       Medical Research: Appropriations for scientific and medical      research on prevention and treatment of chronic beryllium      disease (CBD).       Victim Compensation: Compensation for the victims of CBD at      both federal (H.R. 3478) and state levels.     Chronic Beryllium Disease       Chronic Beryllium Disease is a chronic, often debilitating,      and sometimes fatal lung condition. A relatively small      number, perhaps 10% of the general population are uniquely      sensitive to exposures to beryllium. Of these, perhaps 20% (2      percent of the general population) could develop symptoms of      CBD if exposed.       Several 9th District constituents, former and current Brush      Wellman employees suffer from CBD. Some of them have asked      for assistance on a number of issues. The most regular      requests are in three areas:       Screening for beryllium sensitivity,       Improved disability benefits for people suffering from CBD,       Additional federal support for scientific research into      CBD, and       A tightening of the exposure limits for persons working      with beryllium.     Benefits       There is no special program, federal or state, for persons      suffering from CBD, and victims are looking to the federal      government for relief as virtually all persons who have      contracted CBD, at least since WWII, have either worked for      the federal government or for employers contracted to the      federal government. They want a special federal compensation      program for beryllium workers similar to the Brown Lung      program for coal miners.       State Workers Compensation or Occupational Disability laws      are woefully inadequate in providing compensation for CBD      largely because of the latency period of the disease tends to      be longer than the statute of limitations on claims.     Compensation legislation in the 106th Congress, 1st Session       H.R. 675: Introduced February 10, 1999, by Rep. Paul      Kanjorski (D-PA) establishes a federal beryllium disease      trust fund to provide a benefit for some former national      defense workers who suffer from CBD or for their families if      they are deceased:       H.R. 675 establishes the Beryllium Exposure Compensation      Trust Fund in the Department of the Treasury.       The trust fund would pay a one time award of $100,000 to      persons who worked in the beryllium industry between 1930 and      1980, were exposed to significant beryllium hazards in the      course of that employment, and who developed a condition      known to be related to beryllium exposure.       The bill does not make any provision for funding the trust      fund. The trust fund if established would be dependent on      annual appropriations. That is a problem because it would      establish a federal entitlement without a dedicated revenue      source. It makes a promise to CBD sufferers without a      guarantee that the promise will be fulfilled.       H.R. 675 provides no specific definition of covered      diseases.       H.R. 675 is cosponsored by Reps. Brady, Sherrod Brown,      Gilchrest, Gutierrez, Holden, Inslee, Tubbs Jones, Klink,      Kucinich, Lantos, Manzullo, Pastor, Slaughter, Strickland,      Tancredo, Mark Udall, and Tom Udall.       As a solution to the problem of CBD, H.R. 675 is now no      longer under active consideration by the House.       H.R. 3418: Introduced by Rep. Kanjorski on November 17,      1999, on behalf of the Clinton Administration. H.R. 3418      reflected the position of the Department of Energy at the      time.       H.R. 3418 establishes a federal compensation program for      employees of the DOE contractors and vendors who suffer from      CBD providing wage replacement benefits and medical coverage.       H.R. 3418 provides the choice of retroactive compensation      for victims of CBD contracted before the bills enactment or,      at the employee's option, a retroactive lump sum award of      $100,000 to cover previous lost wages and medical expenses.       H.R. 3418 does not provide benefits for contractors or      vendors to the Department of Defense.       H.R. 3418 also provides for a pilot project to examine the      possible relationship between workplace exposures to      radiation, hazardous materials, or both and occupational      illness or other adverse health conditions.       H.R. 3418 also provides a compensation program similar to      the beryllium compensation program for workers exposed to      radiation hazards at the Paducah, Kentucky, gaseous diffusion      plant.       H.R. 3418 is cosponsored by Reps. Biggert, Brady, Sherrod      Brown, DeFazio, Holden, Kaptur, Klink, Phelps, Slaughter,      Thornberry, Mark Udall, Wamp, and Whitfield.       H.R. 3478: Introduced by Rep. Kaptur on November 18, 1999,      provides a more comprehensive beryllium compensation bill.       H.R. 3874 authorizes a federal workers' compensation      program for beryllium workers employed by the Department of      Energy and the Department of Defense, their contractors and      vendors who suffer from CBD.       H.R. 3874 provides for a $200,000 lump sum retroactive      payment option.       H.R. 3874 is cosponsored by Reps. Gillmor, Kanjorski, and      Hansen.       H.R. 3874 does not address diseases other than those      related to beryllium.       S. 1954: Introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) on      November 17, 1999. This bill is essentially identical to Rep.      Kanjorski's H.R. 3418.     Compensation legislation in the 106th Congress, 2nd Session       H.R. 4398: Reps. Strickland and Whitfield also introduced a      compensation bill on May 9, 2000.       H.R. 4398 establishes a beryllium compensation program      administered by the Department of Labor under contract with      the Department of Energy.       H.R. 4398 provides a $200,000 retroactive payment option      with prospective medical benefits.       H.R. 4398 establishes a similar compensation program for      Department of Energy nuclear workers.       H.R. 4398 directs the Secretary of Energy to determine if      similar compensation benefits should be provided to DOE      contractor employees exposed to other toxic materials in the      course of their work.       H.R. 4398 does not provide coverage for construction      subcontractor employees at vendor plants.       S. 2514: Senators Voinovich and DeWine introduced a      beryllium compensation bill, S. 2514, on May 9, 2000, which      is essentially the same as the Strickland/Whitfield bill.       H.R. 4205, Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2001:      Kaptur supported a sense of the Congress amendment on the      House floor stating that Congress should act on legislation      providing compensation for Department of Energy workers with      beryllium disease.       Defense Appropriation Bill for Fiscal 2001: In May 2000,      Kaptur secured bill language requiring the Department of      Defense to report back to Congress by May 2001, on the impact      of beryllium disease on DOD contractors and recommendations      for compensation for these employees.     Research       The federal government had conducted research into the      health effects of beryllium in the past, but by the early      1990's federal support for such research had lagged.       In the fiscal 1998 appropriations process, Rep. Kaptur      raised the issue of the need for further research on CBD with      Dr. Kenneth Olden, Director of the National Institute on      Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). She suggested areas      where additional research might be useful, among them:       The standardization of diagnostic criteria and clinical      pathologic diagnostic modalities for CBD; and       Determination of the physical, chemical, and steric      properties of beryllium in the work place to determine if the      size distribution, the particle number, and/or the particle      morphology are critical factors in the production of CDB in      the worker.       As a result of this inquiry, Rep. Kaptur requested an      increase in the appropriation for the NIEHS to be used for      further research into CBD. The appropriation was increased.       On March 18, 1999, almost solely as a result of Rep.      Kaptur's efforts, NIEHS, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood      Institute, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and      Health, and the Department of Energy announced, a major new      research initiative to the mechanisms of CBD.     Exposure limits       CBD support groups have argued that the current work place      exposure limits for beryllium are too high and result in an      unnecessarily high incidence of CBD among beryllium workers.       The current exposure limit is 2 micrograms per cubic meter      (g/m\3\ ), measured as an 8 hour, time weighted      average.       Rep. Kaptur officially wrote to Charles Jeffress, Assistant      Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health asking      the status of the current review of OSHA's current beryllium      exposure standard. Response received July 21, 1999, saying      that OSHA is reviewing the exposure standard.       In December 1998, the Department of Energy issued a      proposed rule to change the beryllium exposure limits for DOE      employees to a bifurcated standard.       The new DOE standard would establish a new short-term      exposure limit of 10 g/m\3\ for small-scale, short-     duration exposures.       And lower the 8 hour, time weighted exposure limit to 0.5      g/m\3\.       The public comment period for this proposed new rule ended      on March 9, 1999.       On December 8, 1999, the DOE issued a final rule, The      Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program for DOE      facilities. The new regulation retained the 2 g/m\3\      PEL but instituted a new action level of 0.5 g/m\3\      at which a number of engineering and work practice      precautions must be instituted.     Defense conversion and materials research       In 1994, Rep. Kaptur secured $2 million in the fiscal 1995      Defense Appropriations bill to aid in the companies'      conversion from defense-dependent companies to ones that also      produce advanced products for the commercial market. Of this,      Brush received a few hundred thousand dollars which helped in      the development of copper-beryllium alloy products for the      electronics and other high-tech industries Brush Related      Defense Projects:       Because beryllium is such a critical national security      resource, Rep. Kaptur has acted a number of times behalf to      secure our nation's stockpile of strategic metals including      beryllium. She has also worked to insure that important      national defense research development projects related to      beryllium and other aerospace metals are funded.       In May, 1995, Rep. Kaptur requested authorization of $25      million from Subcommittee on Military Research and      Development for the continued development of advanced      strategic aerospace metals and other lightweight structural      materials as a unique subset of the strategic materials      reserve. She also requested a $20 million appropriation for      this same purpose for fiscal 1996.       Aerospace Metals Affordability Consortium: In 1998, Rep.      Kaptur secured in the fiscal 1999 Defense Appropriations bill      $5 million to initiate this applied research project to meet      the national security need for advances in special aerospace      metals and metal alloys for aircraft and space vehicle      structures, propulsion, components, and weapon systems. Ohio      firms are leading participants. The Consortium is funded      through and directed by the Air Force Research Laboratory at      Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton. For fiscal 2000 she secured      an additional $5 million for the Consortium, and for fiscal      2001, she secured $15 million to continue the Consortium's      work. Authorizing language for the Aerospace Metals      Affordability Consortium     was included in the fiscal 2001 Defense Authorization bill.       National Defense Strategic Metals Stockpile: Because      beryllium is an important national security resource, Rep.      Kaptur has on different occasions written to the Armed      Services Committee and to the Pentagon on strategic stockpile      issues.       In May 1997, for instance, she wrote to the Pentagon in the      spring of 1997 regarding the potential sale of beryllium and      beryllium-copper alloy from the National Defense Stockpile.      The DOD responded that such sales were not being contemplated      at that time.     Luckey FUSRAP site       Brush Beryllium, the predecessor company to Brush Wellman,      operated a plant in Luckey, Ohio, as a beryllium production      facility under contract with the Department of Energy between      1949 and 1958.       The site has been included in the Formerly Utilized Site      Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) currently under the      direction of the Army Corps of Engineers. A preliminary      radiological survey at the site showed that several areas      contain radiation, primarily from radium, in excess of      applicable guidelines. In addition, beryllium concentrations      in the soil at the site are well above background levels.       The Corps is presently conducting an assessment of the      project's scope. The site is scheduled to be remediated by      2005.                Amendment No. 11 offered by Mr. Sanders
