President, today I wish to make a short statement on the work of Tom Russo. Mr. Russo is a vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, making his time some of the most valuable time in the world. But, it is precisely what Mr. Russo does with this time that I would like to speak about here today--in particular his work with the Institute of International Education--IIE--and the scholar-rescue program.  Mr. Russo has played a leadership role in working with IIE to establish a program that helps to bring scholars, whose lives are in danger in their home countries, to the United States. Once in the United States, the scholars are matched with host universities according to their academic specialty and the needs of the university. In many ways, this program is a win-win. The scholars, and in some cases their families, are removed from harm's way. Universities in the U.S. get top-rate scholars to teach and conduct research, while IIE helps to defray some of the costs to these institutions.  Of course, everyone would prefer that these scholars were able to remain in their home countries shaping the intellectual culture there, especially the scholars themselves. But, these are cases where there is no other option. It is either leave or be killed. And we have a moral responsibility to help these scholars escape and continue their work, in hopes of one day returning and advancing the knowledge base in their home nations.  One only has to look at the newspaper to see that there is virtually unlimited demand for this program. Let me read a few sentences from an article in last Wednesday's Washington Post, entitled ``Attacks Across Iraq kill 12, Wound Over 60''. The article reads: ``Elsewhere in the capital, masked men shot and killed a professor, Fuad Ibrahim Mohamed Bayati, as he left home for the University of Baghdad, police said.''  Tom Russo and his colleagues, including Henry Jarecki, a board member of IIE, and Alan Goodman, the president of IIE, have worked tirelessly to build this program. I know this because on several different occasions I have met with Henry, Alan, or Tom about the scholar-rescue program. It is abundantly clear from our conversations that they are deeply involved with the program and are passionate about the good work that it is doing around the world. While the scholar-rescue program cannot prevent every tragedy, I can attest it is making a difference. I also know that, instead of resting on their laurels, Mr. Russo, Dr. Jarecki, Dr. Goodman, and others are laboring day and night to expand the program to come to the aid of more scholars and their families.  I appreciate all Mr. Russo is doing and wanted to bring his work to the attention of the Senate. I encourage all of my colleagues to read about Tom Russo and the scholar-rescue program. I ask that an article from the New York Sun on Mr. Russo be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Sun, Apr. 11, 2005]     Lehman's Russo: ``Create a Culture of Doing the Right Thing''                           (By Pranay Gupte)       Thomas Russo, vice chairman of Lehman Brothers Incorporated      and the 155-year-old investment bank's chief legal officer,      had started this day with a meeting at 7:30 a.m. By the time      he came to lunch, he'd had three more meetings, and taken      several overseas and domestic calls in his additional role as      head of Lehman's corporate advisory division, with      responsibility for compliance, internal audit, government      relations, and the documentation group.       There was also some work in connection with Lehman's new      products committee and also the operating exposures      committee, both of which he chairs. There were a couple of      matters related to the Institute of International Education,      which administers the State Department's Fulbright Program,      and whose executive committee he heads.       And yes, there was a one-hour workout at a gym before his      workday started.       Were there enough hours in the clock for him, the      reporter--whose own deadline driven schedule had spawned      portliness, in contrast to his guest's dapper trimness--asked      Mr. Russo,       ``In everything I do, I always ask myself, `Am I doing the      best that I can?' '' Mr. Russo said. ``If you feel good about      what you do, then you can be at peace with yourself.''       He's handsomely compensated for what he does. Lehman gave      him $3 million last year, making him the highest-paid      corporate legal counsel in America after General Electric's      chief lawyer, Benjamin Heineman Jr., who drew $4.3 million,      according to a survey by Corporate Legal Times.       Mr. Russo certainly earns his salary and bonuses,      especially these days when Wall Street is under increased      scrutiny by regulatory institutions on account of assorted      scandals concerning corporate behavior. As Lehman's chief      legal officer, its Mr. Russo's responsibility to ensure      strict compliance with the law--particularly the 2002      Sarbanes-Oxley Act on accounting and governance--on the part      of the firm's 20,300 employees.       Indeed, Mr. Russo was a key player in bringing about the      record $1.4 billion settlement by 10 Wall Street companies in      April 2003. Lehman, which paid $80 million in fines--     Citigroup paid $400 million--was among those accused by the      Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State      Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of conflicts of interest while      aiming to increase their investment-banking business.       ``The whole episode was bad for the industry, it was bad      for business,'' Mr. Russo said. ``It could be cited as an      example of us being our own worst enemy. While some have      accused regulators for being excessively zealous, for the      most part the industry brought this upon itself.''       What about the continuing tensions and torque of his work,      the reporter asked. How does he go about ensuring compliance      with the law in such a large organization as Lehman?       ``The only way to regain investors' trust is to create a      culture of doing the right thing,'' Mr. Russo said. ``I      always say to my colleagues, `If it feels wrong, just don't      do it.' You cannot compromise your integrity. Everyone in      financial services always needs to keep in mind that, first      and foremost, customers must be served to the best of our      ability. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of doing      the right thing.''       Mr. Russo's emphasis on ``doing the right thing,'' and his      probity, has acquired an almost mythic dimension in the      financial services industry. Some 84 million Americans have      invested more than $14 trillion in the equities markets in      the United States; more than 3.2 billion shares are typically      traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq every day.       That emphasis on morality is transmitted by Mr. Russo not      only to his associates at Lehman (which he joined in January      1993). It's a message that he conveys to hundreds of     other professionals, students, and young people with whom he      comes into contact each year through institutions such as the      IIE, the Economic Club of New York, the Foreign Policy      Association, the Fellows of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and      U.S. Council for International Business.       He's not a proselytizer, nor is his style preachy. The      soft-spoken Mr. Russo learned the art of subtlety from his      late father, Lucio, a Staten Island lawyer who was also a      member of the state Assembly for 22 years. He also learned      forthrightness and resourcefulness from his late mother,      Tina, who encouraged him to get summer jobs on the floor of      the American Stock Exchange; it was his mother who elicited      his continuing involvement with the March of Dimes, where      he's vice chairman. (His parents died in a car accident last      year.)       ``I figured out early in life that success is a matter of      focus and energy,'' Mr. Russo said. ``If you find something      that you like to do, then you've got to do it with all your      passion.''       It's an attitude that helped him ace undergraduate studies      at Fordham University, and Cornell University, where he      earned an MBA as well as a law degree. Mr. Russo was also      elected to the honor societies Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa      Phi. It's an attitude that helped him distinguish himself as      a young lawyer at the SEC, which he joined after Cornell.       It's an attitude that helped him become partner and member      of the management committee of the prestigious law firm      Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. And it's an attitude that most      certainly helped land him the job of the first director of      the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Division of      Trading and Markets. (Mr. Russo is also the author of two      books on federal securities and commodities laws, and      frequently writes for trade and mainstream publications on      commodities, securities, banking, and financial market      regulation.)       His career has fetched him numerous honors. The National      Law Journal listed him as one of the ``100 Most Influential      Lawyers in America.'' Not long ago, Mr. Russo was an      inaugural inductee into the Futures Industry Association Hall      of Fame. These honors are to be savored, of course, but Mr.      Russo isn't one to brag about them. During lunch, in fact, he      credited his colleagues and parents, and averred: ``I've been      enormously lucky in my life.''       There's one aspect of his luck that Mr. Russo chooses to      highlight--his wife, Marcy, who helps run a Jewish      educational foundation; and his children: twin daughters      Alexa and Morgan, 15, and son Tyler, 9.       The reporter obtained a sense of how much Mr. Russo's      family shares his dedication to education and cultural      bridge-building--which he said were essential not only for      sustaining America's economic might but also for engendering      enhanced awareness overseas of the homespun values of      tolerance, friendship, and hospitality that serve as      underpinnings of American society.       On the evening after the lunch with Mr. Russo, he'd invited      several young Fulbright scholars from Iraq, India, China,      Syria, and other countries to his Fifth Avenue apartment for      a reception. The view of Central Park was stunning; the food      was scrumptious. But the highlight of the evening was clearly      violin renditions of Bach by Alexa and Morgan, accompanied on      the piano by their fellow student from the Dalton School,      Gennifer Tsoi.       They often give such performances, Mr. Russo said, they      visit senior citizens' homes and hospices to give comfort and      spread good will through their music. The reporter thought:      Like father, like daughters.                          ____________________
