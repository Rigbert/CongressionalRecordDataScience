 President, it is my understanding that Chairman Dodd has asserted that the Shelby consumer protection substitute would lead to additional assessments on community banks. I want to make it clear for the record that this is not true.  But before doing so, I do want to highlight that the basic thrust of Chairman Dodd's assertion is based on the belief that placing the taxpayer on the hook for the costs of regulating Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and J.P. Morgan is the preferential way of proceeding.  Again, Chairman Dodd believes that taxpayers paying the freight for Goldman is the way to go.  But I want to set the record straight about my amendment. First, my provision ensures that any nonbanks that are subject to regulation pay the full cost of that regulation themselves. They get no handouts from the taxpayer.  Secondly, community banks are not presently assessed by the FDIC for the cost of regulation, and my amendment does not provide the FDIC with any new authority to make such assessments.  Funding for the new division will be provided by assessments on nonbank mortgage originators, the other nonbank entities that are subject to regulation and large banking institutions. I would point out that the assessments on large banks will increase considerably following passage of the Tester amendment, which Chairman Dodd supported.  Finally, in an effort to protect deposit insurance, my amendment creates a separate consumer financial protection fund which will ensure that funds for deposit insurance and consumer protection are never comingled.  Mr. President, let's be clear about the differences in the funding sources in the two bills. The Dodd bill uses taxpayer funds to give a free ride to Goldman Sachs and the other big Wall Street Banks while my amendment makes big banks and bad actors cover their own costs.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.  The yeas and nays were ordered.
