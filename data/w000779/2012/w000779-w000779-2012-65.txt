President, I have served on the Intelligence Committee for 11 years now, and I have seen during that time plenty of leaks. I have tried with every bit of my energy to demonstrate how serious an issue this leaking matter is. In fact, I teamed up with Senator Bond--our colleagues remember Senator Bond, of course--and I sponsored legislation to double--double--the criminal penalty for those who leak, for those who expose covert agents. So I don't take a back seat to anybody in terms of recognizing the seriousness of leaks and ensuring that they are dealt with in an extremely prompt and responsive fashion.  What is at issue here is whether we are going to give an opportunity for U.S. attorneys--professionals in their fields--to handle this particular inquiry. I see no evidence that the way the U.S. attorneys are handling this investigation at this time is not with the highest standards of professionalism.  I have disagreed with the Attorney General on plenty of issues. My colleagues know I have been particularly in disagreement with the Attorney General on this issue of secret law. I think there are real questions about whether laws that are written in the Congress are actually the laws that govern their interpretations. So I have disagreed with the Attorney General on plenty of matters. I think I have demonstrated by writing that law with Senator Bond that I want to be as tough as possible on leakers.  But I would now have to object to the request from our colleague from Arizona simply because I believe it is premature. For that reason, Mr. President, I object to the request from the Senator from Arizona.
