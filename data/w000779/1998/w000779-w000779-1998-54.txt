President.                           Amendment No. 3677  Mr. President, Senator McCain and I have 5 minutes to briefly respond to Senator Bumpers' proposal. I will use a couple of those minutes of time.  First, let me say that Senator Bumpers is such an extraordinary person and such a wonderful orator that anyone who comes to the floor to speak after him is sort of in the position of being Tugboat Annie after the Queen Mary has sailed off.  I would like to try to briefly respond to Senator Bumpers' proposal, and to urge my colleagues to strongly oppose it. First, let us be clear about what this legislation says with respect to those mayors and Governors about whom Senator Bumpers is concerned.  This legislation says that if you are liable for a tax today, you are going to be liable if electronic commerce goes forward. You are going to be liable for a tax on an Internet sale just as if it was a traditional sale taking place today.  What the debate is all about is that some States believe that because they cannot collect on mail order today, they want to go out and collect taxes with respect to the Internet because they see the Internet as the cash cow.  Senator McCain and I and others don't feel that the problem in our country is that mail-order sales aren't taxed enough. We think that what we ought to do as we look to the next century and the new economy--the digital economy--is to make sure that we have technological neutrality. This vote that we will be having in just a few moments on the Bumpers amendment is essentially the first substantive recorded vote that we will have had with respect to the Internet.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this. I will oppose it strongly, because I don't think the problem in our country is that mail-order sales aren't taxed enough. I think what we ought to do is go forward with this legislation as it stands now to ensure technological neutrality. I and others would be happy to work with Senator Dorgan and others to address this mail-order problem. But at the end of the day, let's not make the mistake with the Internet that was made with mail order years ago and create the same kind of fight and brawl.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.  The proponents of this amendment say it is not a new tax but proper enforcement of an existing sales tax. This is not the case. With a few exceptions, States do not receive sales taxes from out-of-State mail-order businesses, nor can they expect one under current law since this is a tax that has never been collected in the past.  There is only one way to vote in favor of this amendment. Let's be clear. This amendment represents a very large tax increase on the public.  Mr. President, this amendment permits states to require out-of-state mail order businesses to collect their sales taxes on purchases made by their residents. The Senate Finance Committee, while reviewing the Internet Tax Freedom Act, determined by a bipartisan vote of 13-6 that the Internet Tax Freedom Act is not an appropriate vehicle for the Senate to act on this measure. I agree with the Finance Committee's assessment, and I know that were my colleague and chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, present, he would object to the consideration of this measure by the Senate without a full review of this issue in committee hearings.  Make no mistake, this is not simply the collection of a standardized interstate sales tax, as troubling as that would be. There exist thousands of taxing jurisdictions at the state, county, and local level in the U.S. Combined with the different nuances of each of these jurisdictions, mail order businesses will face an administrative nightmare fulfilling their obligations under this amendment. In fact, it is the large number and complexity of different tax codes which now require the Senate to consider a moratorium on taxation of electronic commerce. Certainly we cannot now say that mail-order businesses can or should have to attempt to deal with the same difficulties electronic commerce faces when it comes to sales taxes.  Mr. President, in addition to representing an administrative burden to industry, this amendment would also place unacceptable burdens on consumers. Mail-order businesses contribute greatly to the quality of life for many Americans. The disabled, the elderly and others rely on mail-order businesses for a variety of products. Should out-of-state mail-order firms be required to collect sales taxes, it is entirely possible that consumers will find themselves having to calculate the proper sales tax to be remitted to the mail-order company. Given the complexity of taxes, it is more than likely that no small number of consumers will find the delivery of their purchases delayed due to insufficient sales tax payments. Not only will this amendment decrease mail order business' ability to cater to these Americans, but it will reduce the convenience of the mail order industry which is at the heart of its success.  Proponents of this amendment have cited fairness for small businesses as support for passing this amendment. The underlying philosophy is that small businesses cannot compete with tax-free products offered by out-of-state mail-order businesses. Mr. President, small businesses have more to fear from retailers in their own communities, such as K-Mart, Target, and Wal-Mart, than from mail-order businesses, yet small business continues to thrive. Most Americans are not spending their time shopping around for good deals on sales taxes, but they will go to a store two blocks away as opposed to a store a block away if they can get a better price on a product.  Mr. President, this amendment is not necessary for states to collect sales taxes on out-of-state mail order purchases as some suggest. Many states have adopted use taxes to make up for supposed losses in sales tax revenue on goods purchased out-of-state, which require residents to send in sales taxes on these purchases on their own. Proponents of this amendment say thatthe public is not aware of these use taxes, and therefore does not pay them. In reality, use taxes have not been effective because many of those states with use taxes are not actively enforcing them. Is this reason enough to place the burden of tax collection for Arkansas on Arizona businesses? Will Arizona businesses be able to take advantage of the sidewalks, roads, or public safety services in Arkansas? If taxing authorities are dissatisfied with their receipts from use taxes, they should work to devise alternative methods for informing the public about their existence.  Mr. President, the Congress has worked hard to balance the federal budget, and we now have a budget surplus. As a result, Congress is working on a tax cut package the American people have every right to expect. This is not the time to consider new taxes on an American public already being nickel and dimed. Proponents of this amendment say it is not a new tax, but merely the proper enforcement of existing sales taxes. This is not the case. With a few exceptions, states do not receive sales taxes from out-of-state mail-order businesses, nor can they expect to under current law. Since this is a tax that has never been collected in the past, there is only one way to view a vote in favor of this amendment. Let us be clear, this amendment represents a huge tax increase on the public.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this new tax.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Wall Street Journal article of December 23, 1992.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 23, 1992]              Mail-Order Taxes, Ghost of Christmas Future                         (By Arthur P. Hall II)       If many states have their way, consumers could lose lots of      shopping flexibility at Christmastime--and all year long. In      their increasingly desperate attempts to collect money      without upsetting voters, certain states want Congress to      help them cash in on their residents' out-of-state mail-order      and direct-marketing purchases. But the results would be      disastrous--disappointing state treasuries, depriving      consumers and ruining many people who depend on mail-order      firms for their livelihood.       The entire direct-marketing industry exceeds $200 billion      annually, and includes charities and political fund-raising      groups. States continue to explore the taxation of consumer      services and advertising, but the tax assault is aimed      primarily at mail-order catalogs, a strong and growing sector      of the U.S. economy.       A study released in October by the Pennsylvania-based WEFA      Group (formerly the Wharton economic consulting group) found      that the catalog industry, with sales of $48.8 billion,      contributed $39.9 billion (0.6%) to 1991's gross domestic      product. (According to Virginia Daly of Daly Direct Marketing      in Bethesda, Md., mail-order gifts account for 20% of all      Christmas shopping.) In 1991, the catalog industry employed      more than 250,000 people and generated a total employment of      1.17 million. The WEFA Group projects that these figures will      grow substantially between 1991 and 1996, with total      employment growing 16.6%                          how to stifle growth       But taxes could stifle this growth if states persuade      Congress to pass legislation enabling them to make out-of-     state firms collect what is called a ``use'' tax. It is like      a sales tax, but it applies to transactions in which a buyer      and seller reside in different states. The U.S. Supreme      Court, in a 1967 decision, frustrated state tax collectors by      ruling that, without congressional approval, they could not      require out-of-state firms to collect the use tax when the      firm's only presence (''nexus'') in a state was the shipment      of catalogs by common carrier or U.S. mail. In sum, the court      required a physical presence within the taxing state.       Ever since, tax collectors have tried to find a way around      the ruling. These efforts increased in intensity about 1986,      and included laws passed by 36 states to broaden the nexus      interpretation from a physical to an economic presence. The      Supreme Court rejected these efforts and upheld the 1967      precedent in its May 1992 decision on Quill Corp. v. North      Dakota. But the court also said that ``Congress is now free      to decide whether, when, and to what extent the States may      burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to collect      use taxes.''       Since 1986, most states--with Bill Clinton's Arkansas being      among the first--have enacted use-tax statutes, enforcing      them with varying degrees of intensity while awaiting clear      direction from Congress. Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas) offered      such legislation in May 1989. The Brooks bill never passed,      but the 1983 political landscape offers promise for revenue-     hungry states.       The problem with use taxes is that they are a compliance      nightmare for everyone--direct marketers, consumers and      states. That's why states want Congress to simplify their      task by allowing them to force mail-order firms to collect      the taxes. But politicians have a bad habit of ignoring the      economic, consumer-choice and administrative costs associated      with revenue-raising measures.       According to a 1986 study by Touche Ross, the accounting      firm (now Deloitte Torche), forcing mail-order firms to      collect state use taxes will raise their operating costs by      10% to 20%. And the costs get more onerous for smaller firms.      That's why the Brooks bill exempted firms with annual      revenues under $12.5 million. But this threshold still leaves      midsize firms ($13 million to $50 million) with huge and      potentially crippling costs); it also erects a serious      obstacle to growth. Firms surpassing the $12.5 million      threshold would have to buy the equipment and hire the staff      to comply with 46 different state tax laws, and absorb or      pass on the cost of collecting use taxes by mail. These costs      would be six times greater than collecting sales taxes at the      point of retail sale.       The fact that more than 50% of mail-order customers still      pay by check means that catalog sellers would have to include      consumers in the use-tax compliance process. Having to      dedicate a page or more of a catalog to reciting state tax      laws would of course be costly. But the problem doesn't stop      there. Picture a dear grandmother who gleefully picks out      Christmas sweaters for her grandchildren, scattered across      several states, and then has to spend the afternoon      calculating her tax bill. Ho-ho-ho.       Consumer choice and jobs, however, would suffer the most      from a federal use-tax law. Midsize mail-order firms      increasingly give greater choice and flexibility to rural and      elderly consumers. And these firms often establish themselves      in market niches, offering unique products that most local      markets couldn't support.       Moreover, mail-order firms tend to proliferate in rural      areas, providing a core economic base. For example, Lands'      End employs 3,700 people in Dodgeville, Wis., more than the      population of the entire town. L.I. Bean, in Freeport, Maine,      employs around 4,000 At both firms, the numbers swell by 25%      in the months leading up to Christmas, Orvis Co. (Roanoke,      Va.) employs 400, the Collin Street Bakery (Corsicana, Texas)      employs 700, and George W. Park Seed Co. (Greenwood, S.C.)      employs 600. If federal use-tax legislation passes, says      Leonard Park of George W. Park Seed, ``our company is going      to get creamed, and a lot of traditional American families      will suffer.''                             A Pitiful Sum       This suffering will occur for the purpose of ``enhancing''      state revenues--but only by a pittance. (With administrative      costs included, some states would even lose money.) Total      state revenues for 1991 equaled $661.4 billion and revenue      from general sales taxes equaled $103.2 billion. The Advisory      Commission on Intergovernmental Relations--a study group that      monitors taxation on federal, state and local levels--     estimated potential 1991 use-tax revenue at only $2.08      billion. And even this estimate is too generous.       One should more rigorously adjust the potential tax base      for lost jobs, lost mail-order sales, use-tax exemptions,      firms that already pay sales taxes because of physical      presence in a state, lost revenue from firms that service the      catalog industry, services, and state administrative costs.      When these adjustments are made, one discovers only about      $500 million in potential revenue, about 0.5% of general      sales tax revenues. Even Scrooge wouldn't try to collect that      pitiful sum.       Taxing the thriving mail-order industry is a thoroughly bad      idea. Let's hope its time has not come.
