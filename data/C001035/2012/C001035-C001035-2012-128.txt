President, today I wish to, with my colleague from Maryland, introduce the Spending Reductions through Innovations in Therapies agenda, or SPRINT, Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill to accelerate the development of treatments and therapies for high-cost diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.  Alzheimer's and other chronic conditions take a tremendous personal and economic toll on millions of Americans and their families. Moreover, in addition to the human suffering they cause, they pose significant challenges to the fiscal health of our Nation.  Alzheimer's disease alone costs the United States $183 billion a year, a figure that will only increase exponentially as the baby-boom generation ages. If nothing is done to slow or stop the disease, Alzheimer's will cost the United States $20 trillion over the next 40 years.  At a time of mounting deficits, the increasing incidence of diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's also has dire implications for our Federal budget. For example, it is estimated that spending on diabetes accounts for one out of three Medicare dollars. The average annual Medicare payment for an individual with Alzheimer's is three times higher than for those without the condition. For Medicaid, average payments for someone with Alzheimer's are nine times higher.  The Federal Government is currently spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year caring for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and other conditions. This pricetag will only increase as our population ages. Left unchecked, these devastating diseases threaten not only to destroy our Nation's health, but also to bankrupt our finances.  The SPRINT Act, which we are introducing today, is intended to speed the development of therapies to significantly modify, cure, or prevent these high-cost, chronic conditions. Among other provisions, the bill authorizes $50 million for a public-private SPRINT program and fund within the Department of Health and Human Services to support advanced research into promising therapies that are most likely to improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.  Modeled after the successful Defense Advance Research Project Agency, DARPA, the SPRINT program and fund will complement the basic research done by the National Institutes of Health. It will work through public-private partnerships to provide modest resources to research institutions and other innovators conducting advanced research into therapies and treatments for Alzheimer's and other high-cost chronic conditions.  Funding provided under the bill will be targeted to chronic conditions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as being among the top 10 causes of death and focused on those that account for high current and projected costs to Federal health programs; reduce a victim's ability to carry out activities of daily living; have a death rate that has increased and is projected to increase significantly in future years; and lack existing therapies to prevent, control, or cure the condition or delay cognitive decline.  Each Federal dollar awarded under the program must be matched by at least $2 in private funding, and the Secretary may modify or terminate funding for projects that fail to meet milestones. Finally, the legislation will expedite review by the Food and Drug Administration of the therapies developed through the program so they can be delivered to patients as quickly as possible.  Chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer cause great suffering and financial hardship for millions of Americans and their families. Given their increasing prevalence as our population ages, they also threaten to bankrupt critically important programs like Medicare and Medicaid.  The SPRINT Act will leverage a relatively small Federal investment to speed the development of therapies that have the potential to prevent, delay, cure, and improve outcomes for these terrible diseases. It also offers us an opportunity to control the costs associated with these devastating conditions. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Alzheimer's Association endorsing our legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Alzheimer's Association,                                         Public Policy Office,                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Alzheimer's      Association, thank you for your leadership on issues      important to Americans with Alzheimer's disease and their      caregivers. As the co-chair of the Congressional Alzheimer's      Task Force you are well-aware of the national and global      epidemic that is Alzheimer's disease. This devastating      disease is the ultimate thief--a thief of memories, thief of      independence, thief of control, thief of time and ultimately,      a thief of life. The Alzheimer's Association is pleased to      support your bill, the Spending Reductions through      Innovations in Therapies Agenda Act of 2012 (SPRINT Act),      which would create a novel mechanism to target research      investments that development of new treatments and reduce      overall spending by Federal health care programs for high-     cost chronic conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.       The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading      voluntary health organization in     Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to      eliminate Alzheimer's disease and other dementias through the      advancement of research, to provide and enhance care and      support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia      through the promotion of brain health. Our vision is a world      without Alzheimer's.       In 2011, the cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's to      American society will total an estimated $183 billion,      according to Alzheimer's Association's 2011 Alzheimer's      Disease Facts and Figures report. This is an $11 billion      increase over last year--a rate of increase more than four      times inflation. According to the Alzheimer's Association      report, Changing the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease: A      National Imperative, unless a treatment is found that can      prevent cure, or even slow the progression, by 2050, as many      as 16 million Americans will have Alzheimer's disease and the      cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's      dollars). This will create an enormous strain on the health      care system, families and the federal budget.       The SPRINT Act aims to speed American innovation in      research and drug development for the leading causes of death      that are the most costly chronic conditions for our Nation,      which includes Alzheimer's disease. The legislation      highlights the growing need for research and the importance      of finding innovative ways to find a cure for Alzheimer's on      behalf of the estimated 5.4 million Americans currently      living with the disease.       The Alzheimer's Association appreciates your continued      leadership on Alzheimer's disease.
