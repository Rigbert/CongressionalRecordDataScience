Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to provide the States of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana with added flexibility in meeting federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) requirements. The Fuel Price Stability Act will simply allow the Governors of each of the states in the Milwaukee-Chicago market to permit the sale of gasoline from other markets if the price of RFG in our area sees a significant rise or if supplies of RFG in our region are especially tight. Presently, only the EPA has the authority to grant any type of waiver from ``boutique'' fuel requirements. The Fuel Price Stability Act would change this by allowing our Governors to make needed short-term adjustments.  Granting this new flexibility to local Governors has the potential to keep gas prices down in our area. In the past two years, when RFG prices in the Milwaukee-Chicago market skyrocketed, prices remained comparatively low in surrounding markets, including some of those on the same pipeline that supplies gasoline to our market. Should such an occurrence happen again, our Governors should have the authority to permit other gasoline types to be sold in the Milwaukee-Chicago region, thereby increasing potential supplies to our area.  I strongly support other reforms in this area, including efforts to reduce the number of ``boutique'' fuels used across the country, but, lacking the implementation of a broader plan, this legislation represents a solid step toward greater flexibility in fuel use. I am hopeful my colleagues will support this legislation and the House will act on this proposal expeditiously.                          ____________________
