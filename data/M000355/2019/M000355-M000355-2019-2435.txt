 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following treaty on today's Executive Calendar No. 7. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having passed through its various parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; that any committee conditions, declarations, or reservations be agreed to as applicable; that any statements be printed in the Congressional Record as if read; further, that when the resolution of ratification is voted upon, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider Treaty Document No. 114-7, U.N. Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for a division vote on the resolution of ratification.
