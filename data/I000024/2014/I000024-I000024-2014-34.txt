President, it is my privilege also to honor the life and sacrifice of Army CPL Jaron D. Holliday, of Tulsa, OK who died with two other servicemembers on August 4, 2007, of wounds suffered from a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Hawr Rajab, Iraq.  Jaron always wanted to be in the Armed Forces and began researching which branch he wanted to go into when he was 11, his mother, Kelly Holliday, said. ``That was always his desire--to go into the military and serve,'' his mother said. ``When 9/11 happened, he was 15, and he said, `If I were old enough to serve, I would.' ''  The oldest of eight siblings--seven boys and one girl--Jaron was home-schooled and graduated through the Christian Home Education Fellowship of Oklahoma in 2004. He joined the Army in 2005 when he was 19 and was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, Fort Richardson, AK.  Funeral services were held August 16, 2010 at Tulsa Bible Church with interment at Memorial Park Cemetery, Tulsa, OK.  Jaron is survived by his parents John and Kelley Holliday and seven siblings.  ``He was a people-watcher,'' his mother said. ``He loved people. He was the kind of person who, if he saw someone sitting by themselves looking depressed or upset, he made it his mission to make them smile before he left, and usually accomplished that goal.''  ``We didn't want to waste time going to an amusement park or sitting in a movie theater because you can't look at each other and talk to each other in those places. We decided to make memories by just being together,'' said his mother.  Today we remember Army CPL Jaron D. Holliday, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                     Specialist Thomas R. Leemhuis
