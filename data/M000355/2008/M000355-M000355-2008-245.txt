 So maybe we can simply extend existing law for 18 months, the 18-month period being the one we had been discussing before the bipartisan talks broke off.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of a Senate bill, which I will send to the desk, and is a clean 18-month extension of the December Medicare bill. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
