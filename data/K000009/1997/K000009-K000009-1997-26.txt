Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro], a distinguished member of the Committee on Appropriations.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the motion to instruct conferees to fully fund the FDA's program to crack down on illegal tobacco sales to minors. I appreciate the assistance of Chairman Skeen and other members of the subcommittee in providing $24 million for this important initiative in the House bill. But I hope that in conference that we can join the Senate and provide the entire $34 million needed to stop our youngsters from taking up smoking and becoming addicted.  Facts of underage tobacco use are undisputed. Every single day 3,000 young people under the age of 18 who cannot even buy tobacco legally, become regular smokers. Selling tobacco to minors is illegal in all 50 States, but studies show that children can buy tobacco 67 percent of the time. What does this teach our children? It teaches them to smoke and it also teaches them that there are no penalties for breaking the law.  The FDA plan will help retailers understand and comply with the law. It enables strict enforcement by checking that stores require people who look younger than age 27 show an ID card before they buy cigarettes. It is a perfectly legitimate practice with regard to the sale of alcohol. It is an enforcement mechanism, it is an outreach mechanism, and it does not set up any, and I repeat, it does not set up any new government bureaucracy.                              {time}  1745  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that 83 percent of the Members of the other body who took tobacco money last year voted against fully funding this provision. I would like to think that Members of this body today will be voting on this motion based on what is best for America's children and not on what is best for their campaign coffers.  Frankly, the tobacco industry has no reason to oppose this motion because this money all goes toward endorsing current law. This is no new law that is being talked about. But perhaps because 90 percent of all smokers start the habit by age 18, the tobacco companies are concerned that cracking down on youth smoking will hurt their businesses.  I would be ashamed if any Member of this body voted against this resolution as payback for a campaign contribution. This motion is about saving lives. Investing a small amount in prevention today is going to yield enormous savings down the road, not only in dollars for reduced medical costs but in the lives of our young people who can be saved.  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to instruct.
