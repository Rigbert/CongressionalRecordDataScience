 President, on August 26, 1999, 13 young women, ages 15 and 16, put the First State on the map again by capturing the Senior League Softball World Series in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  This was a tremendous accomplishment for Delaware and for the country. The Stanton-Newport team completed an undefeated run through the double elimination tournament by winning a come-from-behind victory over a persistent and well seasoned team from the Philippines.  As one reporter put it, eight teams participated in the tournament, but ``only one will have its flag fly over the field for the next year.'' Proudly that will be the flag of the United States of America thanks to the team from the great State of Delaware.  The Stanton-Newport team is an outstanding example of the power of youth sports in America. As I have said many times in the past, young people need a hobby they love, at least one adult who supports them and a good many friends with similar interests. Organized sports provides this much and more.  In competitive sports young people learn responsibility, discipline, and the importance of cooperation and teamwork on and off the field. Later, these same young individuals will be able to apply their hard-earned lessons to everyday life.  The young women of Stanton-Newport epitomize the exceptional athletes and citizens from across the nation who are inspired on a daily basis by their committed parents and coaches.  I am proud to call this team a home-grown product and continue to salute their efforts on behalf of the First State and the rest of our nation. They are indeed World Champions.                          ____________________
