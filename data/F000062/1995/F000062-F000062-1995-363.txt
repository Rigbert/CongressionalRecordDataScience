 President. It is very important to me that this U.S.-flag and crewed and, to the extent we can, built ships be used. I take this commitment from BP, however they are going to do it, that the oil that they transport will be in U.S.-flagged, crewed, and built vessels. I thank them for that.  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                                 BP Oil, Inc.,                                Cleveland, OH, September 30, 1994.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Further to discussions with you      held September 30, 1994, if the ban on Alaska exports is      lifted, BP will commit now and in the future to use only      U.S.-built, U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed ships for such exports. We      will supplement or replace ships required to transport      Alaskan crude oil with U.S.-built ships as existing ships are      phased out under the provisions in the Oil Pollution Act of      1990.       I hope that this commitment satisfies your request that      Alaska oil exports be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flag ships,      manned by U.S. crews.           Yours sincerely,                                                  Steven Benz,                                        President, BP Oil Shipping                                                         Co., USA.
