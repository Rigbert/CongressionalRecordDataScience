President, I am going to just take a second on the rebuttal time, and then I am going to go ahead and yield to the Senator from New Hampshire. But my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from California, several times talked about tax relief. I think it is time that we take this out, look at it, and put this issue to sleep.  At a press conference on June 2, the distinguished Senator said:       Today is the day to say yes to clean energy, yes to green      jobs, yes to science, yes to energy independence, yes to tax      relief.  Later on in the same news conference:       We also have in this bill a very large piece, almost $1      trillion of tax relief so that when we do see some energy      increases in energy costs in the early years, electricity,      for example, we can offset that.  In other words, send that back to those people as tax relief.  This bill has one of the largest tax cuts we have seen around this place in a long time. What does the bill say about this? It says the tax relief in the bill is a nonbinding sense of the Senate that says some funds ``should be'' used to protect consumers from the coming ``increases in energy and other costs.'' Here is the quote:       It is the sense of the Senate that funds deposited in the      Climate Change Consumer Assistance Fund under section 583      should be used to fund a tax initiative to protect consumers,      especially consumers in greatest need, from increases in      energy and other costs.  Now, I only say here that this does not direct any money to be paid. It doesn't authorize any money to be paid. Besides, if it did, it would have to go to the Finance Committee. So there is no tax relief in the bill.  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is the Senator from New Hampshire taking the time of the Senator from Tennessee?
