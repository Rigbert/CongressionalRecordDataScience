Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my soon-to-be colleague, Lois Capps. Lois won an impressive victory in yesterday's special election in California's 22nd Congressional District. She won the election 53 percent to 45 percent with a margin of more than 12,000 votes.  The message from this special election is clear: The Democratic agenda, providing education opportunities, putting 100,000 new teachers in our classrooms, providing affordable and safe child care, access to health care andlivable wages, is striking a responsive note with American voters.  Lois, we look forward to having you here in Congress working on the issues that people in your district and across the Nation really care about. Congratulations, Lois. We will see you soon.                          ____________________
