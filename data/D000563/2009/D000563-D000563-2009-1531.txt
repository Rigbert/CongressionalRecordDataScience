President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This Senator from Louisiana is asking us to prohibit funding for one organization in America, ACORN. It exists in 110 different cities.  What kind of work does it do? Mortgage counseling, weatherization, earned-income tax credit, and volunteer work. In fact, after Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana, hundreds of ACORN volunteers went to the home State of the Senator offering this amendment and literally helped rehabilitate 3,500 homes. This is the show of gratitude they receive for helping him in his home State.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It is unnecessary. Any work they do they will have to compete for under an amendment previously offered and accepted. Please vote no on the Vitter amendment.
