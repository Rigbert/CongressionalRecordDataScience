Terrific grandchildren who followed.  When it came down to it, Al Franken wanted to do more than just entertain and be well known; he wanted to make a difference in the lives of others. More than anyone, as he said this morning, his wife Franni inspired him. As he explained in his book, her family wasn't as lucky as a lot of us. Her dad died when she was a young baby girl. Her mom raised five kids on Social Security survivor benefits and a paycheck from a local supermarket. But every member of Franni's familymade it to the middle class because of Social Security, Pell grants, the GI bill, and title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  Al  writes:       They tell you in this country you have to pull yourself up      by your bootstraps. And we all believe that. But first you've      got to have the boots. And the federal government gave      Franni's family the boots.  ``Opportunity is supposed to be for everyone.'' That is one of the articles of faith animating everything that Al Franken has done or sought to achieve in the Senate.  I am going to miss my friend Al Franken, my colleague, and one of my fellow members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am sorry he is leaving under these circumstances, but he is going to be remembered, and he is going to have an opportunity to use his voice for others in the future.  Every person who has ever lived has had moments they wish they could erase and words they wish they could take back. In this life of both calm and stormy seas, we all draw strength from the healing power of redemption, and we can take heart in the knowledge that tomorrow is another day with new opportunities to offer a helping hand and make our lives count.  I am happy to hear Al Franken say that while he may be giving up the Senate, he is not giving up his voice in public life. I wish Al Franken, Franni, and their great family the very best and thank them again for what they have given to all of us.  Madam President, I yield.
