President, the underlying issue today on this amendment is that the administration has slashed Homeland Security funding. It has mismanaged the grants it has awarded. We would not be in the situation of pitting State against State if the President adequately funded Homeland Security. Grants are being cut from $2.3 billion in 2003 to under $1 billion this year--$1 billion for the wholeyear, this Homeland Security grant. We spend over a billion dollars a week in Iraq. If we can spend money for homeland security in Iraq, we ought to be able to spend a tiny fraction of that here.  I commend Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue.  I yield the floor.
