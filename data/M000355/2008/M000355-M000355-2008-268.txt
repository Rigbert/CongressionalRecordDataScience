 President, a year ago yesterday marked the occasion of the loss of our good friend and colleague, Craig Thomas, who was the senior Senator from Wyoming at the time. He lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 74.  Born and raised in Cody, WY, a town named after Buffalo Bill, Craig was brought up on a ranch. He brought those values of America's western small towns to our Nation's Capital.  So the Senator from America's smallest State by population, home to a rugged and independent-minded people, was one of the Senate's leading advocates for a smaller, more efficient, and more responsive government.  Other Senators who got to know Craig found him to be always polite and courteous. Yet that did not make him a pushover. A Marine captain, who rose to that rank from the rank of private, Craig was a man of discipline and a man of principle. He was a perfect fit for the people and the values of his great State.  As accomplished as he was, Senator Thomas was also not afraid to poke a little fun at himself as well. I know he once displayed a series of pictures in his Senate office of himself trying his hand at roping a horse.
