Chairman, I understand the importance of agencies working together to protect our coastal resources for future generations. We must also ensure that such coordination is done carefully with congressional input to ensure that it does not lead to Federal overreach.                              {time}  1930  When the previous administration created the National Ocean Policy through executive order, the impacts were so broad, so sweeping, that it would have allowed the Federal Government to evaluate everything from agricultural practices, mining, energy production, fishing, and anything else with activities impacting our oceans.  This subcommittee asked the CEQ, DOI, and EPA on a number of occasions to provide estimates of the impact of the policy on their budgets, but the administration failed to work with Congress and provide such information.  How can Congress adequately budget for something without knowing the expected expenditures and implication of the policy?  The bottom line is, if the administration wants to fund the National Ocean Policy with such sweeping implications, it must work with Congress to provide relevant information and allow Congress to provide the necessary oversight to prevent that Federal overreach.  I support the language of the underlying bill, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
