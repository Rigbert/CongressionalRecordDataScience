President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Salazar finishes his remarks, and Senators Thomas and Lautenberg finish, I may speak as in morning business. I will revise that. I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Salazar is done and Senator Thomas is done and Senator Lautenberg is done, that I may speak, unless another Republican comes to the floor, and that if another Republican comes to the floor, that I be allowed to speak after that in morning business.
