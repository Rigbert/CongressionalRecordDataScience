 The gentleman and I have had discussions about highways. We know that next week the highway authorization ends. We are planning on leaving here, if the schedule is kept, on Thursday of next week.  Will the gentleman tell me what he believes is the status of the highway bill?  I know the Senate is discussing a longer term highway bill. Neither the majority leader nor I are very enthusiastic about that bill as I have learned in my discussions with you.  Will you tell me what your plans are with respect to the highway bill so that we don't leave here without some sort of authorization having been passed?  I yield to my friend.                              {time}  1630  Mr. McCARTHY. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his discussions with me regarding highways. Just last week, we passed a bipartisan bill that would ensure critical infrastructure projects continue throughout the year.  I know the Senate has their debate. Our bill goes to the end of the year with a long-term solution. The Senate currently is debating a bill that is not funded long term. I think the best bit of advice is to urge the Senate to accept our bill.
