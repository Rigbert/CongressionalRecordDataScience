Speaker, this chart shows how much money Republicans have already raided from the Social Security trust fund this year. Was the trust fund not supposed to be in a lockbox and off limits to tampering? Well, they have raided it to the tune of over $207 billion as of the first week of this June.  In 1935, not one single Republican on the Committee on Ways and Means voted for the original Social Security Act. They have always had a problem believing in it.  Now they are raiding Social Security to pay for their tax cuts for the super rich, both living and dead! So long as they do, I will be here on this floor clocking their raid from the Social Security Trust Fund with this Debt Clock. I will be here to tell the truth to the American people. And that truth is that Democrats will fight to save your Social Security. For us, it is a compact of trust between generations for all Americans, senior citizens and disabled, not just the super rich.
