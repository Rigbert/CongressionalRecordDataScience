 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicates more than $6 billion to implement key health priorities, such as combating the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic across this country and the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. It also takes steps to improve mental health, including provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force and policies to further modernize the drug approval process. This will mean so much to the researchers across this country who are trying to unlock the mysteries of the human brain and heal.                              {time}  1430  The legislation includes $1 billion over 2 years, including $500 million in fiscal year 2017, to combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic as well. The legislation dedicates support for other key research initiatives with the goal of helping researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.  This legislation includes a much-needed renewed emphasis on evidence-based strategies for treating serious mental illness, improved coordination between primary care and behavioral health services, reauthorization of important programs focused on suicide prevention and other prevention services, and mental health and substance use disorder parity provisions.  I would like to thank Dr. Joseph Calabrese at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and my good friend, Representative Tim Murphy, who came to Ohio and hosted a roundtable on mental health that can be added to this major bill in order to move America forward.  I thank Chairman Fred Upton, knowing the deep commitment that he has to so many Americans who desperately need the help that this bill will provide. Again, to Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey, I want to compliment both men for working together to do something great for this country for so many Americans who are desperate to find answers for those who are ill. I want to thank Congresswoman Diana DeGette of Colorado who has shepherded this to this point.  Although not perfect or complete, this legislation offers advances in health that greatly outweigh any concerns we might have. I am proud to add my strong support for 21st Century Cures Act.
