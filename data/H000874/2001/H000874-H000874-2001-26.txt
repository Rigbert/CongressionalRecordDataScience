Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. I would say to my colleagues that I am very concerned about provisional voting. It needs to be real. That is why I took such care to make sure that the National Voter Registration Act, known as motor voter, was not adversely affected in any way. I appreciate the chairman's assertion.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 30 seconds to my friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert), I might say at the request of my distinguished chairman. I am pleased to accede to his request.
