Speaker, I certainly rise this afternoon in support of this resolution which authorizes the placement of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford in the Capitol Rotunda, with an unveiling ceremony which is set for May 3.  I'm pleased that this resolution has garnered the support of the entire Michigan delegation who have lent their names as original cosponsors. This is a testament to President Ford's high esteem among Michiganders and Americans of all political stripes.  As one who has the honor and privilege of representing some of the verysame people in southwest Michigan that President Ford did during his tenure in the House--and I would note that Mr. Huizenga is going to speak after me, and he represents some of the same areas; certainly Mr. Amash from Michigan has some of that same district and, I believe, Mr. Camp as well--it gives us pleasure to witness this fitting tribute to Michigan's native son.  President Ford is a Michigan original and a model for all those called to public service. A seemingly ordinary American who unexpectedly found himself in the Presidency at one of our Nation's most tumultuous times, President Ford led with honesty and integrity. By standing above the political fray, he allowed a wounded Nation to heal.  And I would just note that before he lay in state in the Capitol, his coffin actually passed through this Chamber on the way to lie in state in the Rotunda, and it is fitting for Michigan to bring his statue here and for us to pass this resolution.
