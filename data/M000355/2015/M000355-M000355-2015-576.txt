 President, yesterday Representative Ed Whitfield announced that he will retire at the end of this term. Ed has served the First District of Kentucky for more than 20 years. He will be missed in the Capitol when he retires. It is clear that his leadership will be missed in Kentucky too. Our troops at Fort Campbell will miss it. The workers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant will miss it. Kentucky's countless coal families--hard-working Kentuckians he never failed to stand up for--will certainly miss it as well.  Ed was rightly considered a western Kentucky trailblazer. He became the first Republican elected to represent that district in 1994. Our party, the Republican Party, never held that district going back to the Civil War. It was an enormous breakthrough. Ed has worked hard and delivered for the Commonwealth in the two decades since. He will leave behind a record of service and accomplishment.                          ____________________
