The way the appeals process is drafted in the Republican legislation, a child who has a serious cancer might be offered the services of an oncologist for adults. In the view of the plan, that would be adequate, sufficient for the purposes of the medical necessity. As a result, the parents of the child, who want access to a pediatric oncologist, may not even get the chance to even protest internally, externally, or in any way.  That is wrong. Frankly, I have been trying to learn as much as I can about pediatric specialties. I, like so many people, once thought an oncologist is an oncologist is an oncologist like a rose is a rose is a rose. It turns out pediatric oncology is a very specialized part of medicine.  I was talking to a specialist recently who pointed out the case of a young child who was discovered with a particular type of cancer and was treated by an adult's oncologist using what is standard procedure for an adult. In fact, using the adult procedure produced additional problems for the child and only further complicated the situation. As a result, the child has to have an additional regime of chemotherapy. All of this could have been avoided, of course, had that child seen a pediatric oncologist immediately.  The provisions in this legislation do not give a fair chance to appeal a denial of access to a specialist like the case I have just outlined. They do not give Americans, but particularly children, a fair chance to get good health care. That is what we want to do and should do.
