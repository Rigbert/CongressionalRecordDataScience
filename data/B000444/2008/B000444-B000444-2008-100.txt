 President, I rise today in opposition to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008. As one of the cosponsors of FISA in 1978, I am fully aware of the importance of giving the administration the surveillance tools it needs to keep us safe. This is a very difficult vote and I do not question the judgment of those who have chosen to support the bill. But because I am concerned that this bill authorizes surveillance that is broader than necessary toprotect national security at the expense of civil liberties and because it gives blanket retroactive immunity to the telephone companies, I have decided not to support it.  One of the defining challenges of our age is to combat international terrorism while maintaining our national values and our commitment to the rule of law and individual rights.
