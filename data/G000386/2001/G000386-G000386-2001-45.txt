 President, this is my annual Defense Department accounting amendment.  I call it my accounting 101 amendment.  I call it accounting 101 because it calls on DOD to apply one of the most elementary accounting procedures in existence.  It request that DOD match disbursements with obligations before making payments.  Accountants and bookkeepers have been using this procedure since the beginning of time. It is an important internal control check. But it is simple and effective. Most people do it when they reconcile their monthly credit card bills.  Before a bill is approved for payment, someone has to check to make sure that the item in question was, in fact, ordered and received; and it can be located in the warehouse or elsewhere. It is a way of detecting and deterring theft and fraud. Today, it can be done electronically with computers.  For unexplained reasons in the past, DOD has not followed this simple procedure. DOD likes to pay the bill first and at some later date--maybe a year or two later--try to match the payment with a bill. In the Pentagon, they call it ``pay and chase.'' In many cases, the bill is never found.  Pay and chase is one big reason why DOD piled up $50 billion in unmatched disbursements in the 1990's.  Sloppy bookkeeping leaves DOD's financial resources vulnerable to fraud and abuse.  Earlier this year, the very distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, raised a series of very troublesome questions about DOD accounting practices. He did it at a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on January on Mr. Rumsfeld's nomination.  Senator Byrd said and I quote: ``The Pentagon's books are in such utter disarray that no one knows what America's military actually owns or spends.''  Senator Byrd also said and I quote: ``The Department of Defense's own auditors say the department cannot account for $2.3 trillion in transactions in one year alone.''  The failure to match disbursements with obligations is a big driver behind the problem identified by Senator Byrd.  Senator Byrd's inquiry set off a firestorm at the Pentagon. It became a catalyst for change. Secretary Rumsfeld and his team are now committed to reform.  As a former chief executive officer with a large corporation, Mr. Rumsfeld understands that he must have accurate, up-to-date information at his fingertips.  He knows that he can't make good decisions with lousy information. But that's all he gets right now--lousy financial information.  Secretary Rumsfeld knows that financial reform is mandatory.  This year I have had the privilege of working with the very distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, to solve this problem.  Our financial reform initiative was accepted by the committee and is now part of the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense authorization bill.  Secretary Rumsfeld's initiatives and the provisions in the Defense authorization bill are part of a long-term effort.  It may take four years or more before the new systems are up and running and producing reliable financial information.  The amendment that I offer today is a short-term, stopgap measure. It will help to maintain pressure and discipline in accounting before the new systems can kick in to action.  Mr. President, the policy embodied in this amendment has been incorporated in the last seven appropriations acts--fiscal years 1995 through 2001.  Under current law, Section 8137 of the act for Fiscal Year 2001, the matching threshold is set at $500,000.00.  By a unanimous vote taken on June 9, 2000, the Senate agreed to keep the threshold at the $500,000.00 level.  Both the General Accounting Office and the inspector general believe that this policy is helping the department avoid ``problem disbursements'' and other related accounting problems.  Secretary Rumsfeld has made a firm commitment to ``clean up'' the books and bring some financial management reform to the process at the Pentagon.  Mr. President, that's half of the battle right there--the will to do it. And the will is there.  Having that kind of attitude at the top gives me a high level of confidence. Maybe we can get the job done this time.  Since Secretary Rumsfeld's proposed reforms are still in the development phase and may be several years down the road, I am recommending that the matching threshold be maintained at the current level of $5,000,000.00.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                           amendment no. 2385   (Purpose: To set aside Army RDT funds for the Three-Dimensional                    Ultrasound Imaging Initiative II)       At the appropriate place in division A, insert the      following:       Sec.  . Of the amount appropriated by title IV of this      division for the Army for research, development, test, and      evaluation, $5,000,000 may be available for the Three-     Dimensional Ultrasound Imaging Initiative II.
