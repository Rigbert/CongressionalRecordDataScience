  Mr. DeFAZIO. Day 111 of this Congress. This Congress has worked 111 days this year. The average American has worked 202 days so far this year. The Republican majority is being held against its will in Washington, D.C. They wanted to adjourn last Saturday after 108 days of work. Because so far as they were concerned, their job was done. They had served the special interests. They had killed insurance industry HMO reform, they had killed for the tobacco industry cessation of teenage smoking, and they had served Wall Street very well.  When they wanted to adjourn last Saturday, there were zero dollars for the after-school programs, zero dollars for the school-to-work program, zero dollars for new teachers. Today because the President and the Democrat minority kept them in town to work just a few more days, they might even put in 115 days this year, those programs are funded and now they want to say, ``Well, it is really about how we want to spend the money, that billion dollars on the new teachers. It is about local control.'' That is not the point. They did not want to spend a penny on these new education programs. It is very clear. You wanted to adjourn without one cent additional for education.                          ____________________
