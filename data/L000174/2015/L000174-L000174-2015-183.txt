 Mr. President, earlier I spoke praising Sally Yates. In my words on the floor, I also spoke about the senior Senator from Georgia, about all the help he has given on this. I want to make sure I also include the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Perdue, who, under our rules, cannot speak from the chair, but I would note for the other Senators how his testimony was so supportive of Sally Yates, and also, in the committee on which he and I serve, he voted for Sally Yates. Thus, both he and his colleague, Senator Isakson, were extremely valuable in this. I do not want anybody to think I was not aware of their support. I would say to both Senators from Georgia that I am deeply appreciative.  I yield to the senior Senator from Georgia.
