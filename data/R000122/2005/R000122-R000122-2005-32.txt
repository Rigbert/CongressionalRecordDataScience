 My amendment would fully fund the LIHEAP program, providing a 1-year temporary windfall profits tax on large oil companies. Previously, a majority of this body has voted to fully fund LIHEAP. We have not had an offset. This would be an offset. The mechanism I propose would be based upon Senator Schumer's proposal. It does not have the problems that were identified by Senator Domenici with respect to the Dorgan and Dodd proposal.  My amendment will tax these companies at an equitable rate. It will raise $2.92 billion. It will fully fund LIHEAP, and it will provide relief to families throughout this country who literally struggle, who either choose to heat or to eat. I think we can do much better to help our families. There has been majority support of this bill. I hope we have sufficient support that we can actually provide the resources to provide help to struggling families this winter.  I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment.  I retain any time I have remaining.
