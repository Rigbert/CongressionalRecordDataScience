 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, a stalwart conservative with a long and colorful career in both the private and public sectors. Senator Thompson has always been a vocal and active proponent of reducing the role of the federal government, lowering the tax burden on Americans and allowing individuals the freedom to make their own choices. His remarkable rise to a position of influence among his fellow lawmakers is a testament to the passion of his beliefs. Senator Thompson has been a valuable member of the Senate, and his presence will be missed when he retires at the end of the 107th Congress. I would like to take this opportunity to commend my fellow Southern colleague for his dedicated work on behalf of the people of Tennessee and wish him the best of luck as he leaves the Senate.  Born in my home state of Alabama, Senator Thompson grew up in Lawrenceburg, TN. He worked his way through undergraduate school at Memphis State University and then law school at Vanderbilt. Two years later, he was named an Assistant United States Attorney in Nashville, where his outstanding record brought him to the attention of then Senator Howard Baker, who tapped him to be the minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. Following two years on the Committee, Senator Thompson continued his high profile law career when he was appointed by incoming Governor Lamar Alexander to investigate outgoing Governor Ray Blanton. Senator Thompson added to his growing reputation by uncovering a cash for clemency scheme that ultimately sent Governor Blanton to jail. Over the next several years, Senator Thompson continued to practice law in Nashville and in Washington. He also continued his work with Congress, working as Special Counsel to the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  With an open election looming to fill the last two years of former Sen. Al Gore's term in 1994, Senator Thompson decided to enter the race. He championed his Tennessee roots, conservative values and desire to reform the Federal Government. His message resonated with the voters, who overwhelmingly supported him in the general election in 1994. In 1996, Senator Thompson was elected to a full term in the Senate, receiving more votes than any previous candidate for any office in Tennessee history.  Since joining the Senate, Senator Thompson has tirelessly worked to promote his conservative values. A fierce critic of federal bureaucracy, he has introduced legislation and held hearings aimed at producing a smaller, more efficient, and more accountable government. Through his work on the Finance Committee, he has focused his energy on reducing taxes, reforming the tax code and restoring Social Security and Medicare programs to long-term solvency. Admirably, he has always remained thoroughly independent and committed to his beliefs.  I have truly enjoyed working with Senator Thompson here in the Senate. He is a tremendous asset to the people of Tennessee and valuable member of the Republican party. I thank him for his many years of service and wish him the best in all future endeavors.                          ____________________
