President, this amendment was offered last night. It is an amendment which I think most Members are conversant with because it is not a new issue. This is an issue which has been literally before Congress for almost 50 years.  It is an issue of rank discrimination. It is an issue of unfairness. It is an issue of inequality. And it goes to the heart of protecting American families.
