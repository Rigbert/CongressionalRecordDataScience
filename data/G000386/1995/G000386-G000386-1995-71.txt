 President, after reading that memo, I want to tell my colleagues that this option was the overwhelming pick among these agencies. Fifteen executive branch agencies supported the option that I just read from Secretary Rubin to President Clinton. Only one agency objected, and that lone agency was the Department of Transportation.  Now, the Defense Department was willing to pay for this option. Yet, the Transportation Department opposed. Why? Why would the Department of Transportation oppose the Defense Department paying for these maritime subsidies, but subsidies limited to meeting our true defense needs, not one ship more than what the Secretary of Defense said we needed?  Now, of course, we all know that the President of the United States is a busy man. And so, in preparing a decision memo, you want to make certain that you put your absolute most important arguments front and center.  The 15 agencies had a number of important arguments in favor of this option. First and foremost in importance is the fact that the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Commander of the Transportation Command said the real defense needs could be met with as few as 20 U.S.-flag ships.  Second, it was argued by these 15 agencies that ``Option one'' would sustain 1,500 seafaring jobs and 750 landside jobs.  And third, they argued against indirect subsidies such as cargo preference by pointing out that ``indirect subsidies come at the expense of other U.S. industries and hinder the missions of other executive branch agencies.''  Mr. President, surely the Department of Transportation had a number of powerful and persuasive arguments against this cost-effective option supported by 15 agencies. Transportation must have been able to argue to the President important meritorious points that our Defense experts are wrong, that we need to subsidize more U.S.-flag vessels to meet our real defense needs.  But what was Transportation's best arguments? Well, first, it must have been good, because Transportation only offered one argument against it.  And since the lone Transportation Department prevailed over 15 other agencies, it must have been a very good argument, you would surmise. After all, President Clinton was convinced, and he is pushing a Merchant Marine Security Act that funds 52 vessels recommended by the Department of Transportation, not the 20 recommended by the Department of Defense. And it must have been good because a House committee and a Senate committee have both approved these new subsidies for 47 to 52 vessels.  So what then was this powerful argument by the Department of Transportation? And here I wish to read again for my colleagues.       Arguments against. Provides less support than is sought by      industry and its supporters.  Mr. President, did my colleagues hear the reason that the President decided to go along with the Department of Transportation as the only one of 16 Government agencies that thought we ought to subsidize 20 ships, and instead the President went along with the agency that wanted to subsidize 52 ships?  The only argument against our top defense officials and 14 other agencies is that the maritime industry--get this--that the maritime industry and its supporters want more!  I will read again from the memo from the Secretary of the Treasury to the President of the United States what these other 15 departments wanted. It says right here, ``Provides less support than is sought by the industry and its supporters.''  And for no more than these flimsy reasons, Congress within just a few minutes is about to give maritime what it wants. So much then for the revolution that was ushered in in the 1994 elections!  This memo to the President is chock full of amazing arguments. Get this. Transportation Secretary Pena strongly argued for the President to squander tax dollars by subsidizing 79 vessels, two to three times what the Defense Department said it needed for sealift requirements.  If President Clinton did not advocate subsidizing 79 vessels, Secretary Pena ``fears that you will lose an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.'' Pena also argued, ``Further delay will generate ill feeling on the Hill.''  Now, Secretary Pena is saying to his own President that you better do what I say and recommend, because if you do not, I fear that you are going to lose an opportunity to demonstrate leadership.  I hope the Secretary is listening and watching because I have a message. Forget about generating ill feelings on the Hill. Voters took care of many of those last November, and you can bet your bottom dollar that your idea of ``losing an opportunity to demonstrate leadership,'' is 180 degrees opposite what the voters and overburdened taxpayers expressed in the last election.  So, Mr. President, the military or national defense arguments in favor of this amendment as well as for the so-called Merchant Marine Security Act are simply bogus. This memo that I have been reading from is absolutely clear evidence that the national defense arguments for merchant marine subsidies are a sham.  That is not just the opinion of the military experts who participated in this 16-agency effort, for during the Bush administration these agencies participated in a similar maritime review. The point person for this effort, representing the Defense Department, was former Defense Assistant Secretary Colin McMillan.  I have a copy of his memo to other task force members. In short, he said back during the Bush administration, ``The issue of U.S. flag companies reflagging if we don't give them more subsidies is not''--I wish to emphasize is not--``a defense issue.''  Assistant Secretary McMillan concluded, ``The issue of two U.S.-flag container ship operators disposing of the U.S.-flag fleets is primarily an economic one and should be treated accordingly.''  Citizens Against Government Waste--we are all familiar with that organization--recently contacted Colin McMillan and included his comments in their May 24, 1995 report entitled  ``Disaster at Sea. It's Time to Deep Six the Maritime Subsidy Programs.''  That is the name of their publication.  For my colleagues, if you are interested in this, this publication is an excellent, well-researched report which I am submitting for the record, but let me share with my colleagues what the former defense Assistant Secretary had to say now that he can speak candidly outside of the Bush administration.  McMillan called the subsidy program in the name of national security ``a big waste of taxpayers' money. These programs should be clear targets for elimination. Here we are talking about cutting programs for children and we're funding so-called defense programs that add nothing''--I wish to emphasize that add nothing--``to the defense of our country.''  Keep in mind that these candid remarks come from the former Defense Department expert on maritime subsidies and sealift needs. He is no longer part of the Defense Department and he is no longer working for an administration. He is not being paid by the maritime lobby, nor is he part of any organization that is being funded by the maritime lobby. So no one can question his motives.  Again, this maritime defense expert concluded that maritime subsidies in the name of national security is a big waste of the taxpayers' money.  He is not the only expert opposing maritime subsidies. I would like to share the ``Quote to Note'' from the August 3, 1995 Journal of Commerce:       Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise      of the U.S. merchant marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more      than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and a      dependence upon Uncle Sam.  Mr. President, that statement was made by Harold E. Shear, who not only served our Nation as a U.S. Navy admiral but also as a Maritime Administrator.  As a memo to President Clinton points out, ``Subsidies for the U.S. flag fleet have always been justified by their role in providing sea lift capacity for us in military emergencies. With the end of the cold war DOD's sealift requirements have declined.''  So you see, Mr. President, no matter what the U.S.-flag merchant marine fleet may have meant to our Nation in the past to help with our defense, the subsidies have not only been unjustified, they have not worked in providing a strong merchant marine to meet our needs in wartime. I argue that subsidies have even been harmful to our maritime and if they have been harmful to our maritime, they have been harmful to our national security.  Well, then, maritime supporters turn the debate away from the issue of defense to that of economic security. This, too, is nonsense, according to Secretary Rubin's memo to the President. The memo reads as follows.       The NEC principals found no evidence that this segment of      the maritime industry was of strategic importance to the      economy. The U.S. has no competitive advantage in the      industry. The industry neither protects nor enhances U.S.      exports. Subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would      leave the administration hard pressed to explain why it      should not also subsidize every other industry that suffers      job losses.  This is amazing. Why have not the House and the Senate committees been able to pry this truth out of those testifying at their hearings on the maritime?  Not only is it no longer based upon the testimony of military experts that have a military need, but the argument, when that wears out, has turned to economic rationale for our own maritime ships. And even the administration principals argue that there is no economic justification for this program.  Well, I think we all know the answer to why this argument was not able to be made at the committees of the Congress this spring. Those testifying are expected to be team players. They are expected to be team players for the President who decided to throw away taxpayers' dollars for unnecessary subsidies for maritime companies and their high-priced executives and their labor unions.  And let us not kid ourselves. The real reason that we need to subsidize U.S.-flag vessels by the tune of $2 to $2.5 million per year is to cover the high costs of their labor unions.  Again, from the memo to President Clinton. Again, this is Secretary Rubin writing to President Clinton.  He says:       Subsidies are needed principally to offset the higher wages      of U.S. mariners. DOT [the Department of Transportation] has      presented no evidence that this program will eliminate the      wage differential between U.S. carriers and their foreign      competition.  Mr. President, I have been arguing this truth for years. Most of my colleagues except the new Members have heard it on the floor of this Congress almost every year. And now we have proof that the maritime experts in 15 executive branch agencies in a Democratic administration agree with my position wholeheartedly.  But I surely was not the first who recognized this. A dozen years ago, Mr. President, the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Commander, V. Adm. Kent Carroll reported why our merchant marine was sinking.  He said 12 years ago:       Why are we in such a mess? . . . one of the reasons is that      U.S. crew costs continue to be the highest in the world.      Monthly crew costs of U.S. flag ships are as much as three      times higher than those of countries with comparable      standards of living, such as Norway.  He did not say three times higher than poor, Third World seafarers. He said, three times higher than seafarers from countries with comparable standards of living such as Norway.  Now, let me be fair to the unions. In a Journal of Commerce article about an MIT study exposing the high cost of America's subsidized seafarers, union officials fought back.  I want to share what they said.       Unions representing officers and seafarers on modern      containerships have criticized many of the underlying      assumptions in the report, saying the authors ignored non-     vessel costs such as high management salaries, and corporate      overhead.  That is coming from our unions.  Does anyone from the Commerce Committee know how much of this $2.5 million per ship annual subsidy is needed to cover these high management salaries? Because I think that everybody in this body ought to know.  Did the committee study the MIT report entitled ``Competitive Manning of U.S.-Flag Vessels'' before passing out a $2.5 million per vessel subsidy?  This report shows how these U.S.-flag vessels can get by with as little as $1.1 million in Government subsidies. Let us go over that. MIT says that our U.S.-flagged vessels can get by with as little as $1.1 million subsidies. But our committee votes out a bill that gives $2.5 million per vessel subsidies.  This means, Mr. President, since the Defense Department needs as few as 20 vessels, and since by making some reasonable reforms such as eliminating abusive featherbedding and overtime practices, Government subsidies can be cut to $1.1 million per vessel, the Merchant Marine Security Act of 1995 should authorize then only $22 million per year. What is currently required? Five times that amount every year for 10 years.  My colleagues need to understand then that the cat is out of the bag. No longer are maritime subsidies and programs hidden in the dark of night.  Perhaps you saw last week's front page article in the Washington Post. Other major publications such as the Wall Street Journal have editorialized against these wasteful maritime subsidies. And I submit both of these for the Record.  Numerous groups have come out this year in opposition to maritime subsidies. The list is long but my colleagues need to know who they are.  The National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group formed by consumer activist Ralph Nader called Essential Information, the Progressive Policy Institute sponsored by the Democratic Leadership Conference, the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. And that is just a partial list.  The point, Mr. President, is simple. Too much information exposing the waste and abuse of maritime programs is out in the public. And the public is demanding the elimination of all this waste.  In fact, a top Transportation Department official, Inspector General Mary Schiavo, has testified that the entire Maritime Administration, together with its programs, including operating subsidies can be eliminated. The Inspector General, Department of Transportation, working for Secretary Pena, who recommended that the President come on board for this fat subsidy, recommends that we can do away with these program operating subsidies entirely.  She is a top transportation official, an expert on all their programs. But she is also an independent voice. And that independent voice does not have to march lockstep with the Clinton administration party line on maritime subsidies.  She has no self-serving motives. She does not have to care about generating ill feelings on the Hill, or about the question of failing to demonstrate leadership that Secretary Rubin said in the memo to the President of the United States if the maritime industry would somehow get less support than sought.  In other words, Mr. President, I think the Inspector General is a credible person. And so is the memo that I have read, supposedly a confidential memo from Secretary Rubin to the President of the United States.  Mr. President, the public knows that maritime subsidies are a waste. There have also been some public reports that show how desperate the merchant marine unions and lobbyists have become. These articles point to the dramatic shift of maritime campaign contributions shifting away from Democrats in the last couple decades to Republicans this year.  And I have seen the reports compiled by some of these public interest groups following closely this shift in campaign spending. I would urge my colleagues to get a copy of an article printed on pages 536 and 537 of the 1977 Congressional Quarterly Almanac. History may very well repeat itself.  Mr. President, it is clear that the amendment offered in this managers' amendment should be defeated. It should not have been sneaked through in this way. I regret that this amendment has been included in the managers' amendment. It should have been withdrawn.  I do not know what sort of deal makings go on to bring this about, but at least I have had an opportunity to tell the public and to tell my colleagues that when this was a debate in the Clinton administration, there were 16 Departments that were asked their opinion. Fifteen of the sixteen said this was a waste of the taxpayers' money, including the Department of Defense. But the Secretary of Transportation, through a memo of Secretary Rubin to the President, said that you better do this because you have to exercise leadership, you have to exercise leadership, not because of the Department of Defense needs, not because of the economic needs, but because the maritime industry and the maritime unions want it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the report and articles to which I referred earlier be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Disaster at Sea!--It's Time to Deep Six the Maritime Subsidy Programs--                              May 24, 1995       Congress has set caps on future spending and put the      country on a glide path toward a balanced budget in seven      years. In doing so, members have set sail into stormy waters.      Working out the details will surely be one of the most      controversial debates in recent history: a clash over exactly      which programs and policies should go, which should stay, and      what to do with savings. As congressional observers,      political pundits, and arm-chair budgeteers (taxpayers, most      of all) observe the debate over the particulars of what      should be included, it will be just as important to take note      of what they're not arguing about.       Even though there have been calls for the elimination of a      variety of corporate subsidy programs--everything from the      U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Market Promotion      Program to targeted tax credits for corporations with friends      in high places--Congress will be missing the boat if it      doesn't move to scuttle wasteful maritime subsidy programs,      cargo preference laws and operating differential subsidies      (ODS), in particular.       Cargo preference laws go way back to the turn of the      century and the 1930's. The Jones Act, which governs only      domestic waterborne commerce, was enacted in 1920. It      mandates that all commercial cargo moving between American      ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships.       International cargo preference laws (the subject of this      report) dictate that all federal agencies--particularly the      Department of Defense (DOD), the USDA, the Department of      Energy, the Agency for International Development (AID), and      the Export-Import Bank--transport 50 to 100 percent of their      international cargo aboard U.S.-flag vessels. In practical      terms, these laws force taxpayers to underwrite monopoly      shipping rates and protect carrier owners from market      competition.       U.S.-flag vessels are those vessels regulated under the      laws of the United States. They must be American-built,      American-owned, and American-crewed.       According to a November, 1994, General Accounting Office      (GAO) report, the DOD alone, which is required by law to ship      100 percent of its goods under the U.S. flag, anted up $350      million a year in additional costs between 1989 and 1993 for      the privilege of transporting equipment and materials to      points abroad on U.S.-flag vessels. The USDA and AID must      transport 75 percent of their international food aid under      the U.S. flag, at an additional yearly cost of $200 million      and $23 million, respectively. About 120 shipping companies      shipped goods under the cargo preference laws in 1993, but      the bulk of the subsidies went to a handful of companies.       The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that      international cargo preference laws will cost federal      government agencies an additional $600 million in fiscal year      (FY) 1996. The November, 1994, GAO report said that cargo      preference policies support at most 6,000 of the 21,000      mariners in the U.S. merchant marine industry. That      translates into an annual cost of $100,000 per seafarer.       As far back as the 1960's the OMB, the GAO, and the Joint      Economic Committee of the Congress tried to do away with      these subsidies. In 1984, the Grace Commission also      recommended elimination of maritime subsidies.       Historically, proponents of cargo preference laws and other      maritime subsidy programs quickly evoke the national security      argument when defending the industry's right to continued      taxpayer largesse. They claim that a healthy U.S.-flag      merchant marine fleet is an essential logistical component      during a war. This argument has powerful resonance with      members of Congress, who harbor nostalgic memories of the      industry's titanic contributions during World War II,      orchestrating massive troop movements and dispatching      millions of tons of U.S. military equipment and supplies to      distant war zones.       The other rationale is that maritime subsidy programs pump      desperately needed revenue into an industry which cannot (or      hasn't been permitted to, depending upon who you talk to)      compete on the global market.       Unfortunately, today's merchant marine bears little      resemblance to its romantic image. Though the amount of      international ocean borne cargo has risen dramatically since      World War II, U.S.-flag vessels carry only four percent of      America's international cargo. Most of the increased cargo      has been picked up by privately owned foreign-flag carriers,      which are not subject to our restrictive ``flag'' laws and      are therefore far more cost-effective. The U.S.-flag fleet      has dwindled from a post-W.W.II peak of 2,000 to 371 ships      today. Of those 371, only 165 are currently engaged in      international trade and, therefore, eligible for either cargo      preference or operating subsidies.       Though those 165 vessels benefit from a billion dollars      annually in direct and indirect federal government subsidies,      the industry continues to sink under the unsustainable weight      of government regulation, outdated and protectionist labor      and management policies which safeguard the well-being of a      small clan of special interest groups, and the fierce      onslaught of global competition in the international shipping      industry. In characterizing U.S. maritime policies,      former U.S. Maritime Commissioner (and outspoken critic of      maritime subsidies) Rob Quartel called them ``a scam, a      taxpayer fraud.''       Cargo preference laws provide one kind of indirect subsidy.      A separate group of 20 to 30 privately owned shipping      companies also get cash subsidies through the Maritime      Administration (MARAD). These subsidies, so-called operating      differential subsidies (ODS), are meant to compensate private      shipping companies for retaining a certain number of their      vessels under a U.S.-flag, a decision which effectively      prices them right out of the world market.       In fact, keeping a ship under the U.S. flag is an      enormously expensive operation. In exchange for ODS, a      company must promise to keep certain international shipping      lines open, and--like companies with cargo preference      contracts--they must make their vessels available to the DoD      in times of national emergency. They must also submit to a      suffocating array of government regulations. Their ships must      be built in U.S. shipyards where construction costs are two      to four times those of foreign shipyards. They must comply      with a laundry list of safety codes and detailed technical      specifications which far exceed the internationally      recognized standards required for comparable foreign-flag      vessels. Most importantly, from the taxpayers' point of view,      they must also be U.S.-manned, with nearly twice the crew      size of comparable foreign vessels.       Ironically, the industry's most stultifying encumbrance,      the one most damaging to its competitive edge is a self-     imposed one: artificially inflated crew costs. But crew costs      are a matter of concern not just for the companies that must      pay seafarers' salaries and benefits. These costs are also of      paramount      importance to taxpayers because the cost of labor is one of the factors      which determines the level of the subsidy!       In 1994, MARAD quietly released a long-delayed study by      researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology      (MIT) on the subject of manning costs abroad U.S.-flag      vessels. The report's conclusions were stunning. The      industry's labor practices amounted to nothing less than good      old-fashioned featherbedding at the taxpayers' expenses.       The report contained billet cost breakdowns for a variety      of U.S-flag vessels. A captain's billet cost was $34,000 per      month, most of which is covered by taxpayers. (In the U.S.      maritime industry, mariners are at sea for six months, and      then go on a six-month hiatus). Therefore, for six month's      work, a captain's billet costs can be about $204,000. U.S.      seafarers are also entitled to and often collect unemployment      benefits during their six-month hiatus, which leads to higher      unemployment taxes for both American carriers and taxpayers.       Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), outraged at the      exorbitant taxpayer-subsidized crew costs, unsuccessfully      offered an amendment to the FY 1994 DoD appropriations bill      aimed at reducing those costs. In a letter to his Senate      colleagues, Grassley wrote:       ``Currently taxpayers are forced to support U.S.-flag      merchant marine seamen billets at a far higher level of pay      and benefits than those provided by billets for the men and      women who serve our nation in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and      Marine Corps.''       Grassley noted that a Navy captain's billet costs $8,422      per month. ``In fact,'' he wrote, ``a U.S.-flag cook's billet      costs more than that of a Navy captain!''       The November, 1994, GAO report bears out this trend when      U.S. crew costs are compared with their European      counterparts. In 1993, for example, the daily cost for a 34-     person crew were between $12,000 and $13,000 a day. The cost      for a 21-person European crew was $2,500 to $4,000 per day.       According to the MIT study, subsidies for U.S.-flag      vessels, should they be of importance to the DoD, could be      reduced from the current $2.5 million per ship to about $1.1      million per ship by reducing crew sizes and salaries and by      allowing crew members to perform duties outside their job      classifications.       Shipping company managers have no incentive to negotiate      lower labor costs with the powerful mariners' unions because      the taxpayers will end up reimbursing them in the end anyway.      This arrangement has resulted in an unusually cozy      relationship between maritime industry labor and management,      who even share a bevy of lobbyists in Washington, D.C.       By brandishing the national security argument, proponents      of cargo preference laws and ODS have been very effective at      keeping the tide of maritime subsidies flowing in spite of      overwhelming evidence that they are a bad deal for taxpayers.      Recently, however, that argument has begun to fray.       The Gulf War may be remembered as the catalyst which caused      the national security argument to unravel in earnest. It      exposed the myth that our current national maritime policy      has any real national security rationale.       The Gulf War was the largest movement of military personnel      and equipment since World War II. But of the hundreds of      ships that delivered supplies and equipment to the theater,      only a handful U.S.-flag vessels actually entered the war      zone to deliver their freight to American troops. There were      about 50 other U.S.-flag merchant ships moving cargo during      the war, but most of them delivered their freight to foreign      ports where it was transferred to foreign-flag vessels with      foreign crews to make the rest of the journey.       In an August, 1991, commentary in Defense News, director of      MIT's Defense and Arms Control Studies Institute Harvey      Sapolsky characterized the U.S.-Flag merchant marine fleet's      Gulf War participation this way:       ``Although more three-quarters of the ships chartered      during the Gulf War flew foreign flats, only 20 percent of      the U.S. military cargo actually rode on these ships. Most of      the amount hauled in a crisis is done by government-owned      standby and reserve ships. Moreover, there is a ready charter      market for commercial cargo vessel when more ships are      needed. The price required for their services in a crisis is      cheaper than the cost of maintaining a large subsidized      commercial fleet for a mobilization that may not happen again      for years. Despite any accompanying rhetoric about national      security, subsidies for the Merchant Marine fulfill the      commonplace desire for obtaining a livelihood without the      burden of having to compete to earn a living'' (emphasis      added).       Use of U.S.-flag ships actually hampered the Pentagon      during the critical surge stage of the Gulf War. When the      Pentagon had to transport cargo quickly, U.S.-flag ships,      which were scattered around the world, had to be called back      for service.       And, though the Pentagon has the option of commandeering      the ships for the war effort, American merchant marine crews      are not compelled by law to serve and must be asked to      volunteer their services. What's more, taxpayers pay once      again because these crews are entitled to hazard pay if they      enter a war zone.       In 1992, Colin McMillan, then-assistant secretary of      defense for production and logistics, was asked to report to      an interagency working group on the impact on military      readiness of two major U.S. container companies reflagging      under foreign flags. McMillian's memorandum, dated December      10, 1992, stated that ``the National Security Sealift Policy      does not support a fleet sized to meet military requirements      while maintaining its essential commercial operations/     commercial viability. Therefore, the issue of two major U.S.-     flag container ship operators disposing of their U.S.-flag      fleets is primarily an economic one and should be treated      accordingly (emphasis added).'' Contacted recently about the      issue, McMillian called the subsidy programs in the name of      national security ``a big waste of taxpayer money. These      programs should be clear targets for elimination. Here we are      talking about cutting programs for children, and we're      funding so-called defense programs that add nothing to the      defense of the country.''       There have been a number of opportunities to sink these      profligate maritime subsidy programs. The most recent was      Vice President Gore's National Performance Review (NPR).      There were indications that some members of the NPR's      transportation task force, charged with rooting out      inefficiency in that area, wanted to deep-six these programs.      However, intense political pressure was brought to bear, and      the promise of a commission to look into maritime issues was      the most that emerged from that effort. Yet, even that has      not come to fruition.       Congressional support for maritime subsidies comes from a      variety of different, but apparently complementary, political      interests. Republicans like Rep. Herb Bateman (R-VA) and      Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott (R-MS), who both hail from      coastal states, must contend with powerful maritime and      shipbuilding constituencies. On the Democratic side of the      aisle, Sen. John Breaux (D-LA) also has a strong maritime      constituency. Much of the political support from the      Democratic members is a natural outgrowth of the party's      traditional relationship with labor unions.       The Clinton administration's support for continued maritime      subsidies seems to be based upon political concerns rather      than sound fiscal policy. In a June 30, 1993, memorandum to      the President obtained by Citizens Against Government Waste      (CAGW), then-Secretary to the President for Economic Policy      Robert Rubin laid out the administration's options on      maritime issues. The memo stated that:       The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs      of Staff, and the Commander of the Transportation Command      have already concluded that future requirement will not      exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DoD will have no need for bulk      vessels. All agencies therefore oppose renewal of direct      subsidies for bulkers (emphasis added).       Further on, Mr. Rubin once again delineated for the      President the arguments against maintaining or increasing      direct or indirect subsidies to maritime interest:       There is no evidence that this segment of the maritime      industry was of strategic importance to the economy . . . and      subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would leave the      administration hard pressed to explain why it should not also      subsidize every other industry that suffers job losses.       Under the heading ``Political Concerns,'' Mr. Rubin      discussed the political climate in Congress and the chances      for getting rid of maritime subsidies:       ``Secretary Pena believes there to be broad, bipartisan      Congressional support for maritime subsidies. The Secretary      believes that maritime supporters have enough votes to pass a      maximalist package without support from the Administration.      If you do not announce such a package now, the Secretary      believes that you will lose an opportunity to demonstrate      leadership (emphasis added).       In other words, if you can't beat them, join them. In the      final analysis, and in spite of the well-documented negative      impact these policies have on taxpayers and the long-term      competitive health of the maritime industry itself, not to      mention the federal budget deficit, the Clinton      administration chose to renew the operating differential      subsidies under a new title, the Maritime Security Act. While      practically every federal government program is coming under      congressional scrutiny, very little attention is being paid      to this ongoing waste of taxpayer money. This new bill, which      is similar to its predecessor, appears to be a politically      motivated stop-gap measure designed purely to pacify      congressional interests.       It is undeniable that the American merchant marine      industry, owing to a complex range of problems, is      floundering. In fact, simply scratching the surface of U.S.      maritime policies reveals a diabolically complicated system,      apparently designed to promote and enrich a handful of      privately owned shipping companies, the seafarers unions, the      shipbuilding companies, some powerful members of Congress,      and the Washington lobbyists who are paid handsomely to keep      all these balls in the air. Everyone, that is, except the      American taxpayers.       There are some voices of reason on Capitol Hill, and the      time may be right to make a serious move to eliminate these      costly leviathans. Sen. Grassley, a veteran critic of      maritime subsidy programs, collected 23 signatures on a      letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-     N. Mex.) calling for the elimination of ``wasteful maritime      programs, particularly cargo preference subsidies.''      Signatories included Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS),      Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD),      chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.       Senator Hank Brown (R-CO) has decried the elitist nature of      the program, saying: ``What we accomplish with cargo      preference is to line the pockets of some very wealthy      people, but we do not accomplish the goal of expanding the      number of U.S.-flag vessels. It has dropped. We do not      accomplish the goal of making U.S. ships more competitive.''      Sen. Brown's office asked the Congressional Budget Office      (CBO) to score the potential savings if maritime subsidies      were eliminated. The CBO estimated that the elimination of      maritime subsidies would save more than $2.8 billion over      five years.       Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) has also crafted some preliminary      legislative language which would effectively eliminate cargo      preference laws in relation to foreign aid food shipments.       Several long-term maritime industry observers interviewed      for this report have come to a common conclusion. It is no      longer a matter of whether the U.S.-flag maritime fleet will      implode under its own weight, it's just a matter of when and      how much more money the taxpayers will surrender      involuntarily in a fruitless endeavor to prop up a failing      industry. Members of Congress should move now to stop this      maritime madness. It's time to scuttle the maritime subsidy      programs.                                                                    ____                            Subsidies Ahoy!       Was there really a revolution in American politics last      November? If so, somebody had better notify Congressman Herb      Bateman--fast. The Virginia Republican has already persuaded      the National Security Committee to approve a new $1 billion      subsidy for the U.S. Merchant Marine, and now he's trying to      get the rest of the House to go along. If he gets his way,      it'll be a strong indication that the Republican tide is      breaking up on the special-interest rocks of Washington.       There is no clearer case than shipping of the harm that      government ``help'' can do. During the past 50 years, the      government has sunk tens of billions of dollars into      protecting commercial shipping. The result? Just in the past      25 years, the U.S. Merchant Marine's share of the U.S.      shipping market has declined from 25% to less than 4%.       Federal interference starts with Coast Guard-enforced      regulations on staffing and work rules. U.S. mariners earn an      average of $125,000 for six months duty, but aren't allowed      to do as much work as lower-paid foreign counterparts. No      wonder it costs several times more to operate a U.S. ship      than a foreign vessel.       To ``compensate'' for these costly rules, U.S. shipping      lines get an annual direct payout of $240 million: this      program will expire soon unless it's renewed. Another handout      comes from the Defense Department, the Agency for      International Development and other government outfits that      have to ship goods on costly U.S. vessels. These ``cargo      preferences'' cost $592 million last year--enough money for      private charities to feed half a million starving children in      Africa for a year.       Throw in millions more for maritime academies that turn out      sailors the U.S. fleet can't employ, and what do you get?      Roughly $1 billion annually in direct government subsidies to      the U.S. Merchant Marine. But that's only part of the      maritime boondoggle. Even bigger costs lurk just beneath the      surface.       Under the 1920 Jones Act, only U.S.-built, -crewed and -     flagged ships can operate between U.S. ports. But since these      vessels are so costly, not a single coastal freighter bigger      than 1,000 tons runs along the East Coast. One result: Many      turkey farmers in North Carolina buy costlier Canadian grain      rather than cheaper U.S. varieties. In all, the International      Trade Commission estimates, the Jones Act costs consumers up      to $10.4 billion a year.       Then there's price fixing. The 1984 Shipping Act gave      shipowners complete anti-trust immunity and allows the      Federal Maritime Commission to enforce international shipping      cartels. The excessive charges of these cartels raise prices      on most imported and exported goods, costing consumers up to      $15 billion annually. Worst of all, 80% of the benefits go to      foreign shipping lines.       Rob Quartel, a former FMC member, figures that all maritime      subsidies together cost at least $375,000 per seagoing      worker. It would be a lot cheaper to pay the sailors not to      work. Eliminating these subsidies would not only force the      maritime industry to become competitive, but also would      contribute to the balanced budget effort. Mr. Quartel      figures, based on dynamic scoring, that eliminating subsidies      would save $7 billion between 1996 and 2002, and generate new      economic activity that would raise an extra $28 billion in      tax revenue. Even in Washington terms, $35 billion is real      money.       The House budget charts a course toward this destination;      it calls for eliminating direct maritime subsidies. But some      Republicans haven't gotten the message yet. Majority Whip      Trent Lott, who has also blocked complete telecom      deregulation, helped keep the Senate Budget Committee from      torpedoing maritime handouts as a favor to his maritime      industry constituents. And when the Senate recently allowed      the export of Alaskan oil, the legislation stipulated that      only costly U.S. ships can carry the crude.       In the House, Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster      is frustrating deregulation efforts, while Congressman      Bateman sails full steam ahead with his subsidies, which he      calls ``The Maritime Security Act of 1995.'' (We guess that      sounds better than the ``Pork Barrel Act of 1995''.) The      congressman dusts off the hoary old argument that the U.S.      needs subsidies to preserve a flag fleet that can carry      Pentagon supplies in wartime as his excuse.       But this claim doesn't hold water. The Defense Department      already spends billions on transport vessels that are on      permanent standby. It doesn't need, and can't use, most of      the merchant ships that Mr. Bateman proposes to subsidize.      During the Gulf War, only 8% of supplies delivered directly      to the Persian Gulf came on U.S. commercial vessels. That's      why the Pentagon has consistently opposed paying for maritime      subsidies.       Stripped of their military justification, Republican      shipping subsidies begin to look a lot like what the      Democrats used to hand out: Favors for one set of campaign      contributors (shipping companies and sailors' unions) at the      expense of the national interest. Mr. Quartel rightly calls      this ``a fraud and a scam.'' Unless the GOP quickly deep      sixes this outrageous proposal, voters will have cause to      wonder whether the Ship of State is being run by the same old      crew that was in charge before Nov. 8.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 1995]              End of Merchant Marine May Be on the Horizon                          (By Bill McAllister)       Portsmouth, Va.--It is 9 a.m. on a Sunday, and sweat is      trickling down Michael P. Ryan's chest.       The temperature has hit 90 degrees in the mint green engine      room of the Sea-Land Performance where Ryan, the 37-year-old      first assistant engineer, has been running last-minute      maintenance checks since before dawn. Later in the day, the      giant commercial ocean liner, three football fields in      length, will maneuver out of port on its way to deliver 1,700      containers of chemicals, auto parts, chocolates and other      merchandise across the Atlantic.       For the six months at sea he will spend tending the ship's      clattering diesel engine, Ryan will earn about $90,000, more      than his counterparts on any commercial ocean liner without a      U.S. flag on its stern. American ship captains and chief      engineers on ships like Ryan's earn even more--as much as      $132,000 to $151,000 for a half-year's work. In the months      off, crew members of the Performance do everything from      collect unemployment to work at a ski resort.       ``I'm not going to say that the money's not good, but I      earn it,'' said Ryan, waving a dirty hand in the sultry air.      ``It's not the life of Riley.''       Whether it's a life that taxpayers should subsidize is      another question--one the Senate may address as early as      today.       Since a fledgling Congress first penalized imports on      foreign ships in 1789, the federal government has protected      shipping interests on the theory that the military needs      American-built, American-manned ships on hand in case of war.      It has proven a costly premise that critics claim no longer      is valid.       In the name of a strong merchant marine, the government      today pays some $214.4 million a year to underwrite the pay      of about 9,000 jobs on 75 private ships and cover the cost of      abiding by U.S. regulations. Those payments have totaled $10      billion since the first checks went out in 1936.       It pays an additional $578 million a year more than it      needs to, by one estimate, to ship millions of tons of      military goods and other government cargo solely on U.S.-     flagged ships like the Performance, even though foreign      vessels are considerably cheaper. Farm state legislators      argue that the government loses millions more each year in      sales of farm commodities to foreign governments because of      higher transportation costs.       And consumers pay a good deal more money--$10 billion a      year, critics charge--for goods that federal law requires be      transported on more expensive American-flagged ships. That      law, called the Jones Act, bars foreign ships from carrying      any cargo shipped between domestic ports.                          a shrinking flotilla       Whether all this is necessary--indeed, whether it is even      good for the industry--has been argued for decades. The raft      of subsidies has not saved the U.S. shipping industry from a      titanic plunge from the top ranks of world shippers. The      number of merchant ships flying the U.S. flag has dropped      from 3,644 in 1948 to 351 this year. Their share of the      world's ocean-shipping trade has plummeted from 42.6 percent      in 1950 to approximately 4 percent today.       Even the industry's military value has vastly diminished.      In recent years, the Pentagon acquired its own fleet of fast      cargo ships, built specially to transport military equipment      and moored more or less permanently in strategic harbors      around the globe.       What's left of the American-flagged ships, according to      critics, is a tiny and costly flotilla of ``welfare queens''      that epitomizes the waste that laces the federal budget.       The very obscurity of the subsidies to shipowners is part      of the secret of their survival. Many legislators see little      percentage in fighting to strike $1 billion or so from a $1.5      trillion federal budget, especially when it might mean      forgoing the political contributions of maritime unions and      shipowners that comprise one of the most politically active      industries in the country.       ``This is a big mess, basically $1 billion a year . . .      going to less than 10,000 people,''      said Rob Quartel, who served as a member of the Federal Maritime      Commission under President George Bush and has emerged as one      of the chief critics of the subsidies. ``The problem with      this industry is that it has been subsidized and regulated to      death.''       To the industry, however, the question is not whether      Congress wants to give the shipping industry a break, but      whether it wants a merchant marine at all. Executives of the      few remaining U.S. shipping lines blame their industry's      decline on foreign competitors who copied American technology      and then undercut American firms with cheaper labor and fewer      regulations.       Unless ``Uncle Sugar'' makes up the difference in costs, as      one shipper puts it, shipping companies will demand that the      government let them re-register their vessels in foreign      countries to take advantage of lower foreign operating costs.      ``We're fighting for our life,'' said Mike Sacco, president      of the Seafarers International Union.       ``America's future as a maritime nation is at stake,''      Albert J. Herberger, President Clinton's maritime      commissioner, recently told Congress. ``This year will make      or break what remains of our U.S.-flag presence on the high      seas.''       The issue before Congress is a simple one, said Christopher      L. Koch, a senior vice president of Sea-Land: ``Give us the      dough or let us go.''       More and more, letting them go seems a viable option.      Groups as diverse as the conservative National Taxpayers      Union and Ralph Nader's Essential Information Group are      pressing the Republican Congress to untie the shipping      industry and see how it floats on its own.       Their champion is a farm-state senator, Charles E. Grassley      (R-Iowa), who foresees savings for the Agriculture Department      in sales and shipments of surplus food overseas if maritime      programs are eliminated. ``We're seeing more light at the end      of the tunnel, but I don't see victory,'' he said in a recent      interview.       Some of the maritime industry's supporters, sensing trouble      at hand, are proposing cutting some of the expense. A      coalition of senators from maritime states may ask for a      floor vote as early as today on a measure that would extract      about $100 million from Radio Free Europe to continue      subsidizing the operating costs of a smaller number of U.S.      ships and provide some other benefits to the dwindling number      of private U.S. shipyards.       ``Yes, it is going to cost a little more to ship on an      American ship,'' said Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), one of the      measure's supporters, at a recent Senate hearing. But, he      said, ``it is all a part of being an American.''                         a call for elimination       Early on, it appeared that the Clinton administration might      try to toss out maritime subsidies in its drive to streamline      government. A task force advising Vice President Gore      described the subsidies as ``a cancer eating away--     unnecessarily--at the general revenues of the U.S.      Treasury.''       A draft of Gore's report on ``reinventing government''      called for eliminating the benefits, according to the task      force members, but that recommendation was deleted after      leaders of the politically powerful maritime unions protested      to Clinton. In a 1993 memo to the president, Robert E. Rubin,      then the director of Clinton's National Economic Council,      noted that maritime benefits already had ``broad bipartisan      support'' on the Hill.       But the support from the Pentagon, which long has provided      the rationale for the expenditures, has faded. In the 1980s      the military decided it was no longer content with the      shipowners' pledges to haul supplies in their vessels in      wartime in exchange for ongoing subsidies. Military planners      concluded it would take too long to commandeer the civilian      ships in a crisis. Besides, most commercial U.S. ships      sailing with U.S. flags were designed to carry standardized-     sized boxes of food and goods, not helicopters.       So the Pentagon invested in so-called roll-on, roll-off      ships--essentially floating garages that can be filled with      tanks and military trucks. Since the Persian Gulf War, the      military has continued to expand its fleet of ``row-rows,''      as the ships are called, with a $6 billion program. Today it      has a reserve fleet of 89 Navy-gray ships, many of them fully      loaded and docked around the world.       Should it need more in a time of crisis, the Pentagon would      ``prefer American ships with American crews,'' said Margaret      B. Holt, a spokeswoman for the Military Sealift Command, the      Washington-based Navy command that charters ships for the      Pentagon. But that's only if another agency pays the      shipowners, said Gen. Robert L. Rutherford, head of the U.S.      Transportation Command, in recent testimony before a Senate      subcommittee.       During the Gulf War, the military found it could rely on      foreign ships to supplement its own fleet. The U.S. Maritime      Administration, part of the Transportation Department,      estimates that about 20 percent of goods arriving in the war      zone came on foreign ships; a Navy estimate places the level      closer to 50 percent, noting many military goods were      transferred from U.S.-flagged ships to smaller feeder ships      at European and Asian ports.       According to Holt, the Sealift command spokeswoman, the      lesson is: ``If there is money to be made, there are ships to      be had.''       The maritime programs are a patchwork of direct and      indirect subsidies and protections that date back largely to      the period between 1904 and 1936.       There are three ways the government subsidizes U.S.-flag      vessels: It pays direct subsidies to vessels engaged in      international trade to help them compete with foreign-flag      vessels. It pays higher rates on shipment of government      goods. It also requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to      be carried by U.S. vessels.       The requirement that government goods be transported in      U.S.-flagged vessels adds $578 million a year to the      government's transportation bills, most of it paid by the      Pentagon, the government's largest shipper, according to the      General Accounting Office. The rule that surplus food be      shipped under U.S. flag has cut the amount of farm      commodities that foreign governments could buy by $131      million in the past three years, according to a March report      by the Agriculture Department's inspector general.       Consumers also pay to protect the industry, according to      critics like Quartel, the former Bush administration      official. Quartel heads a group backed by farm and minerals      interests that hopes to repeal the 1920 Jones Act, the law      that restricts domestic cargo to American-flagged ships. He      cites a U.S. International Trade Commission study that      estimates the law may add as much as $10.4 billion a year to      transportation costs, which are then passed along to      wholesalers and consumers.       The most obvious cost--and perhaps the most vulnerable to      cuts--is the $214.4 million a year the government pays out to      the owners of the 75 U.S.-flagged vessels to cover the cost      of sailing with a U.S. crew, under U.S. regulations.       Unless Congress acts, these so-called ``operating      differential'' payments will cease when the government's 20-     year contracts with the shipowners expire in 1997. Rep.      Herbert H. Bateman (R-Va), a strong maritime advocate who      chairs a subcommittee of the House National Security      Committee, has teamed up with Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) to      propose somewhat reduced benefits: an average of about $2.3      million a year each to about 50 ships, rather than the      roughly $3 million now paid to 75 vessels. The Clinton      administration supports their proposal.       Maritime industry officials say critics exaggerate the      indirect costs and underrate the benefits to the country in      jobs and national security. Although fewer than 10,000 jobs      depend on the direct subsidies, the Jones Act helps protect      as many as 200,000 workers, industry supporters say.       They deride foreign ships as unreliable in wartime, citing      a half-dozen or more vessels that refused to sail or delayed      voyages into the Persian Gulf during the conflict there.       If U.S.-flagged ships are not militarily important, then      their crews certainly are, supporters say. ``You can always      commandeer ships. You can't commandeer people,'' said Thomas      L. Mills, a Washington maritime lawyer and lobbyist.       Sea-Land has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the      maritime programs and, in the company's view, a victim as      well. The company benefits handsomely by flying the U.S.      flag; in fact, its Pentagon contracts make it the country's      largest ocean shipper of military goods.       But the American flag raises its operating costs because it      must pay its crews the higher U.S. union salaries. The firm      is not reimbursed directly for those added costs because it      is barred from drawing operating subsidies at the same time      it holds government shipping contracts.                           flying a new flag       As military shipping declines, Sea-Land wants the option to      switch to operating subsidies. Unless Congress continues the      subsidies, Sea-Land president John P. Clancey has warned, his      company will ask permission to register its remaining 37      U.S.-flagged ships under foreign flags.       It already dropped the Stars and Stripes off five ships in      the past year and registered them with the Republic of      Marshall Islands. The firm has offered American captains jobs      on those ships at a salary of $72,760 for eight months a      year. That's roughly 41 percent of what some of them would      earn as skippers of U.S.-flag ships.       Offers like that are quite disheartening to seamen like      Lawrence R. Swink, of Lake Tahoe, Nev., captain of the      Performance. ``For those kind of wages they're talking about,      I can run a little tour boat and be home with my family every      night and watch my children grow up,'' he said.
