President, we know that private security contractors at airports can hire quickly. But we also know that with the turnover rates they have, they will have people who will come and go. That is not in the best interest of law enforcement.  In your hometown, you would never delegate the protection of your neighborhood or your city to a contract employee. We bring people on who are public servants, people who are dedicated to law enforcement, who take the job seriously and accept the challenge of that job.  Since September 11, we have seen stories of heroes and heroines across America, and so many times they have been public employees. Those firefighters who walked up the stairs in the World Trade Center, trying to rescue people, giving their lives in the process, were public employees. The men and women in law enforcement on the ground, who lost their lives as they stood at their post trying to help people evacuate, were public employees. Many of the medical rescue workers were public employees. Sadly, the postal employees who died over the last several weeks from the anthrax bioterrorism were public employees.  It is a reminder to all of us that so many of the men and women whom we hold up in admiration and respect time and again for their dedication and courage since September 11 have been public employees.  I think the House approach to this problem is one that will not work. It will not protect America; it will not protect our airports; and it will not return people to our airlines, which we need to do so quickly.  I am going to urge Senator Hollings and all the Senate conferees to stand firm and stand fast on this issue. This is a critically important issue. We need to do this and do it right. To do it in a halfhearted fashion, as the House of Representatives has suggested, is not going to restore the confidence of America's flying public.  It is important for every Member of the Senate to consider the experience at O'Hare on Saturday night, when the current system, which the House of Representatives wants to continue with some modifications and changes here and there, utterly failed and left vulnerable a lot of unsuspecting people who were just getting on an airplane for another flight from Chicago to Omaha. It is an important lesson to be learned.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit I                [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 5, 2001]       Airport Security: 7 O'Hare Screeners Suspended Over Lapse                   (By Tom McCann and Sean D. Hamill)       Seven O'Hare International Airport security workers were      suspended Sunday and are likely to be fired after they let a      Chicago man pass through a security checkpoint with seven      knives, a stun gun and a can of mace in his carry-on luggage,      according to city aviation officials.       The man was eventually stopped and the weapons were found      before he was able to board a plane Saturday. But the      incident, coming two days after the House rejected a plan      adopted by the Senate to federalize airport security workers,      in certain to stoke the debate over how to safeguard the      nation's airports.       Subash Gurung, 27, a native of Nepal, was arrested about      7:30 p.m. Saturday while waiting to board a United Airlines      flight to Omaha, said Chicago Department of Aviation      spokeswoman Monique Bond. Airport police said Gurung bought a      one-way ticket.       Airline employees discovered the weapons during a final bag      check at the gate, Bond said, part of new procedures that      several airlines have adopted since the Sept. 11 attacks.       But that was after two folding knives were discovered in      Gurung's pocket when he walked through a security checkpoint      metal detector, police said. Bond said the knives were      confiscated and police were summoned, but Gurung was allowed      to continue to his gate.       Meanwhile, his bag went through an X-ray machine, but the      security staff did not notice the knives or other weapons,      Bond said. A search of the bag wasn't conducted even after      the two knives were found, she said.       Bond would not say what led to the later search of Gurung's      bag.       ``Something obviously went seriously wrong here, and we're      trying to find out if it's the employees' fault or the      security company's fault,'' Bond said. ``If weapons were      confiscated, he should never have been let through      security.''       The Federal Aviation Administration and Chicago Department      of Aviation have both launched investigations into the      incident and will consider whether the employees should be      fired and whether United should pay a fine.       The suspended workers were all employees of Atlanta-based      Argenbright Security Inc., the company that runs United's      screening operations at O'Hare. Three veteran employees were      working the checkpoint alongside three trainees, said FAA      spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory. The employees' supervisor      was also suspended.       ``We commend all our employees who acted to apprehend this      man,'' said United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``They did an      excellent job.''       Despite heightened airport security in the aftermath of the      attacks, the lapse on Saturday wasn't the first. Last month,      a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight accidentally      brought a gun aboard a plane in his briefcase.       Lawmakers agree steps are still needed to improve baggage      and passenger screening, but the House and Senate remain      divided about how best to achieve that goal.       The Senate has approved a measure that would make security      screeners federal employees. The House version adopted      Thursday increased federal oversight of the 28,000 screeners,      but stopped short of federalizing them.       ``If the system can't detect a knife and a stun gun in      luggage, then you have to ask yourself whether the people are      doing their job right,'' said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.),      who supports the Senate bill that gives the Justice      Department responsibility for airport security.       ``I think the technology works, but you can't pay someone      minimum wage and ask them to act as a law enforcement officer      on the front line fighting terrorism,'' said Durbin at a news      conference Sunday, in which he also proposed legislation to      allow federal agencies to share classified information with      local police.       Gurung was charged with three misdemeanor counts of      unlawful use of a weapon, attempting to board an aircraft      with dangerous weapons and carrying dangerous weapons. A      spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office      said the case was still being evaluated and more serious      charges could be brought.       Gurung was released early Sunday on $1,000 bail and is      scheduled to appear in court Dec. 19. He was questioned by      the FBI, who turned him over to Chicago police.       Gurung could not be reached for comment Sunday. In comments      to WLS-Ch. 7, he said ``It just happened out of accident, in      a hurry.''       He said he has worked in a warehouse but was presently      unemployed.       Gurung recently moved back to Chicago with his brother,      Sushil, from Minnesota, said Adam Colfax, superintendent for      the apartment building in the 5700 block of North Kenmore      Avenue where the Gurung brothers lived until a year ago.       Colfax said Gurung previously lived in an apartment at 1025      W. Hollywood Ave., where Ayub Ali Khan once lived. Khan has      been detained by authorities as a material witness in the      Sept. 11 attacks but it is unclear whether he knew Gurung.                                       ____                     [From USA Today, Nov. 5, 2001]                  Why Rely on Low-Bid Airport Safety?                           (By Paul C. Light)       Now that the House has passed its own airport-security      bill, the stage is set for a showdown with the Senate over      who gets the 28,000 jobs. The Senate wants federal employees      at the baggage machines, while the House wants private      contractors.       President Bush also favors private contractors. Only days      after he expressed his appreciation to federal employees for      ``your dedication and integrity, your commitment to      excellence and your love of our country,'' Bush was lobbying      hard to prevent passage of a measure that would have set up a      new federal workforce of airport screeners.       The Bush administration, facing a civil-service system that      is slow on the hiring, weak on the firing, poor on the      training and sluggish on the disciplining, believes there is      no other choice. As Bush has explained, the House bill      provides the ``quickest, most effective way to increase      aviation security,'' particularly by ensuring ``that security      managers can move aggressively to discipline or fire      employees who fail to live up to the rigorous new      standards.''       Bush's support for a contract workforce crystallizes the      problems facing the federal civil service. On the one hand,      federal employees would almost certainly do a better job at      airport security. According to recent surveys of federal and      private employees by the Brookings Institution's Center for      Public Service, a federal security service would be motivated      more by the job's challenge and the public good, and less by      pay. Federal employees would be more satisfied with benefits      and job security, and therefore less like to leave.       On the other hand, federal workers would be less likely      than private employees to get the tools, training and      technologies to do their jobs well. They would be hampered by      a disciplinary process that their peers believe does little      to address poor performance, and would join a workforce that      is under-resourced, over-reformed and generally demoralized      by a half-century of pay and hiring freezes.       New employees would be joining a federal workforce that is      under duress. Three out of five federal workers told the      Brookings center that their organizations only sometimes or      rarely have the staff needed to perform well. Many believe      the past few years of reinventing government made their jobs      harder. And the vast majority say the federal hiring system      is slow and confusing; a quarter refuse to call it fair.       The question is not whether federal employees often succeed      against the odds; they do. Rather, the question is whether      the federal government can find a private workforce that can      outperform federal employees on anything other than fast      hiring and firing.       The answer is mixed at best.       Private airport-security contractors can hire quickly, but      they're poor at retaining. From 1998 to 1999, turnover among      private contractors at the 19 largest U.S. airports averaged      126%, topped 200% at five and hit 416% at Lambert-St. Louis      International.       Private contractors also have trouble complying with      existing regulations. Just last year, one of the largest      contractors, Argenbright Security, was fined more than $1      million for assigning new employees to its screening check-     points in Philadelphia without background checks or an audit      system to detect what the U.S. attorney's office called ``the      astonishing and widespread criminal activities that occurred      in this case.''       In the best of all worlds, private contractors would hire      and supervise federal employees, avoiding an awful civil-     service hiring and firing system that hasn't been reformed in      decades. But given a choice between the two workforces,      federal employees should get the job. No matter how stringent      the oversight, airport security is too important to consign      to the lowest bidder. That is how the security function fell      into disrepair in the first place.                                  ____               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Nov. 5, 2001]                        Coping With New Tensions                     O'Hare arrest tied to terror?                            (By Susan Dodge)       A Nepalese man arrested at O'Hare Airport over the weekend      with several knives, a stun gun and a can of Mace gave police      the same home address that belonged to a suspect questioned      in the Sept. 11 terrorist hijacking investigation.       But authorities were vague on whether there was any      connection between Subash Gurung, who was arrested Saturday      night at O'Hare, and Ayub Ali Khan, who is being held as a      material witness to the attacks. Khan was one of two men with      box cutters taken into federal custody Sept. 12 on a San      Antonio-bound Amtrak train.       ABC-7 reported Sunday night that Gurung was being      questioned for a second time by FBI officials.       He listed 1025 W. Hollywood, a Chicago apartment building,      as his home address. Khan is believed to have lived at the      same address for a time, authorities said. Khan, 34, is being      held in a federal detention center in New York City.       Seven O'Hare Airport security workers--including a      supervisor--who allegedly let Gurung pass through their      checkpoint were fired Sunday, Chicago Aviation Department      spokeswoman Monique Bond said.       Gurung was within minutes of boarding a United flight to      Omaha, Neb., Saturday night when the stunning security breach      was detected by airline employees who searched his carry-on      bag, where the weapons were located, officials said.       Security officials confiscated two knives at a security      check-point, but Gurung made it to the boarding gate with      seven other knives, a stun gun and Mace in his carry-on, said      Bond.       Police Supt. Terry Hillard and Thomas J. Kneir, head of the      local FBI office, spoke about Gurung's arrest but decided      they could not charge him with a federal crime ``because he      didn't board an airplane,'' said Chicago police spokesman      David Bayless.       Gurung was arrested Saturday and charged with three      misdemeanors: unlawful use of a weapon, attempting to board      an aircraft with a weapon and carrying a dangerous weapon,      said Chicago Police Officer Matthew Jackson, a department      spokesman.       Exactly how did the 27-year-old Edgewater resident make it      through the terminal checkpoint, which supposedly is more      secure since the terrorist attacks?       ``That's the million-dollar question,'' Bond said Sunday.       Equally uncertain was why Gurung was allegedly carrying the      items.       The Federal Aviation Administration, the city's aviation      department and United Airlines all were investigating the      security breach.       United gate employees checked Gurung's carry-on bag as a      random bag search, part of the airline's enhanced security      measures, said United spokesman Joe Hopkins.       Gurung was questioned by the FBI and then released on bond      early Sunday, police said. The FBI declined to comment      Sunday, referring all questions to police.       Gurung 27, told police that he's unemployed and originally      from Nepal. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 19.       The breach was the latest by Argenbright Security Inc.,      which operates the checkpoint for United and has been roundly      criticized for lax security and hiring workers with criminal      backgrounds.       It came as Congress debated how to tighten airport      security. The security lapse bolsters the case for making      airport security workers federal employees, who would be      higher paid and better trained, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin      said, adding, ``You can't do it on the cheap.''       But House Republican leaders argue that federalizing the      security would expand bureaucracy and make it tougher to fire      bad workers. House and Senate officials are expected to come      up with compromise legislation on airport security.
