 As you know, I had a discussion with my good friend, and I know you know him well, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon England. Obviously he is required, the Department of Defense is required under contract agreements that if there is not funding at a certain point in time, for them to send notice, not because they necessarily anticipate that there will be a necessity to have RIFs, but because under the agreement, when they contemplate running out of money, which would be sometime in February, 60 days before that, they have to send out a notice.  My expectation is that the Secretary will be sending us a letter. But I think the Secretary's expectation, and I think the letter may say this, his expectation is, pursuant to our conversations, that will not be necessary nor does anybody contemplate that being done. And I certainly want to say to any and all employees who are listening, that is not going to happen.
