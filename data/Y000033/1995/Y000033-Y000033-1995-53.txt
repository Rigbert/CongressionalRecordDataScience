Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I suggest respectfully that those speaking, none of them support drilling in other areas, they have never supported drilling in any area to produce any oil for the domestic market. None of the speakers on that side of the aisle that have spoken in opposition to this conference report have ever supported any development of any oil field anywhere. I challenge them to show me that if I am wrong.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Tauzin] who is very, very well acquainted with this issue.
