President, I wish to take just 30 seconds to speak in support of Senator Feinstein's amendment.  The issue here is not about whether we support abstinence as a method of preventing the transmission of HIV. Obviously, it is one approach, and an important one especially in countries where young girls are extremely vulnerable. Encouraging young people to postpone sexual activity until they are in a monogamous relationship is a key goal of any AIDS prevention strategy. So abstinence is one approach that we need to support along with other prevention strategies.  But the Leadership Against AIDS Act says that 33 percent of all AIDS prevention funds should be spent on abstinence programs. The question, which is not answered in that act, is how to define abstinence, because if it is defined too broadly, it will eat into funds that are crucially needed for other prevention methods, such as HIV testing, and educational and information programs about methods to prevent HIV transmission among people who are sexually active.  This amendment strikes the right balance, and I commend the Senator from California for taking on this difficult but very important issue.  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Feinstein amendment.
