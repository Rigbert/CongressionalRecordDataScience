  I very much disagree with the figures of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. We wrote to the Congressional Research Service and asked them to compute the grant numbers. They gave us back a document, dated February 27, that relates to the two programs funded in this bill. One of them is the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the other is the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, and these are the numbers that CRS presents. Actually, Vermont, according to CRS, benefits $72,250, according to the Congressional Research Service, as do 35 States. I didn't make up these numbers.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the memorandum from the Congressional Research Service, which is a straight mathematical computation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Congressional Research Service,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2007.                               Memorandum     To: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Attention: Ahmad Thomas.     From: Steven Maguire, Analyst in Public Finance, Government          and Finance Division.     Subject: DHS Grants to States and Insular Areas Under H.R. 1,          S. 4, and S. 608.       This memorandum responds to your request for a comparison      of three legislative proposals: H.R. 1, S. 4 as approved by      the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and S. 608. In      particular, you asked CRS to estimate how much each state      would receive through two programs under each proposal: (1)      the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and (2) the      Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP). All      three proposals would lower the minimum grant award that      states could receive under current law. S. 608, unlike H.R. l      and S. 4, only sets a minimum for funds authorized for SHSGP.      You asked CRS, for comparative purposes, to include LETPP      funds in the minimum when calculating the state-by-state      allocations.       Note that a third related DHS grant program, the Urban      Areas Security Initiative (UASI), is not considered in this      memorandum. The total grant amount to each state would change      if UASI grant awards were included. However, the information      needed to estimate UASI grant awards to each state under the      three legislative proposals is not publicly available.       A question that immediately arises is how proposed changes      to the minimum grant awards would affect the aggregate SHSGP      and LETPP grant amounts awarded to each state, the District      of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the insular areas. Answering      that question precisely, however, is problematic because DHS      does not disclose the risk and effectiveness scores it      assigns to grant applications. Accordingly, we relied on      three basic assumptions to generate what we consider      responsible ``rough justice'' estimates of grant amounts      under the aforementioned approaches:       Assumption 1. DHS Risk and effectiveness scores for each      applicant under the three proposals will equal those for      FY2006. This assumption is valid only to the extent that the      determinants of risk and effectiveness that pertain to each      applicant and the DHS scoring system do not significantly      vary from one year to the next.       Assumption 2. A proxy for each grant recipient's risk and      effectiveness score in FY2006 can be found in the ratio of      (a) the amount of the recipient's FY2006 total grant that was      based on risk and effectiveness to (b) the sum of risk and      effectiveness amounts for all recipients. In other words, if      one assumes that if a recipient received 5 percent of the      total funds available for allocation on the basis of risk and      effectiveness in FY2006, then that recipient will receive 5      percent of the total funds available for allocation on the      basis of risk and effectiveness under S. 608, H.R. 1, and S.      4.       Assumption 3. The total authorization for S. 608 and H.R. 1      will match the amount authorized in S. 4, to wit:      $913,180,500.                                 Caveat       The estimates presented in the following discussion are      intended for illustrative purposes only. Actual grant      allocations will almost certainly differ from the estimates      presented here. In addition, estimates for S. 608, which do      not include funds for LETPP in the minimum, are based on the      assumption that LETPP funds are included.                       Calculating the Estimates       Estimating grants for each eligible recipient involves the      following steps, the results of which are shown in Table 1:       1. Establish the proxies for risk and effectiveness.       2. Allocate the total available $913,180,500 in proportion      to the proxies.       3. When a recipient's risk and effectiveness allocation is      less than the statutory minimum, allocate an additional      amount to reach the minimum.       4. Because this results in a total greater than      $913,180,500, proportionally reduce the grants of all      recipients in excess of the minimum to prevent exceeding the      authorization.       5. Display the resulting adjusted estimated allocations. .       Establishing Proxies for Risk and Effectiveness Scores. In      FY2006, Congress appropriated a total of $912 million for the      SHSGP and LETPP programs--40 percent ($365 million) was      allocated to satisfy the minimum grant award requirements for      eligible recipients and the remaining 60 percent ($547      million) was allocated based on risk and effectiveness.      Examination of column (b) in Table 1 shows, for example, that      California received 15.18 percent of the $547 million; New      York, 8.52 percent; Texas, 8.05 percent; and Florida, 6.82      percent. These percentages and the corresponding      percentage for each grant recipient serve as a proxy for      each jurisdiction's risk-and-effectiveness score for the      CRS estimated allocations under S. 608, H.R. 1, and S. 4.       Estimating Risk and Effectiveness. H.R. 1 and S. 4 would      allocate total SHSGP and LETPP amounts by risk and assessment      subject to statutory minimums--lower than under existing law.      In order to estimate the risk and effectiveness allocations      for each eligible jurisdiction, we multiply the proxy      percentage discussed above by the total authorization of      $913,180,500. For comparative purposes, as you instructed,      CRS used the same methodology for S. 608.       Meeting the Minimums. As noted earlier, existing law sets      two minimum amounts based on the total appropriation: 0.75      percent per state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico,      0.25 percent for other U.S. insular areas. S. 608 would      ensure a minimum of 0.25 percent per state, the District of      Columbia, and Puerto Rico and 0.08 percent for other insular      areas. In contrast, S. 4 would ensure a minimum of 0.45      percent per state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.      The other U.S. insular areas would be guaranteed the same      0.08 percent. Under H.R. 1, however, there would be three      minimum amounts based on the total appropriation: 0.45      percent for international border states (18 states); 0.25      percent for states without an international border (32      states), the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and 0.08      percent for the other U.S. insular areas. With an      authorization of $913,180,500, these minimums would be      $4,109,312 and $2,282,951 for the two categories of states,      respectively, and $730,544 for insular areas.       The last column of Table 1, column (f), compares S. 608 to      S. 4. A positive amount in column (f) indicates that the      state would receive more under S. 608 than under S. 4.       For a complete explanation of the methodology used to      redistribute funds so that all jurisdictions receive the      required minimum, and the total authorization is not      exceeded, see CRS report RL33859, Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland      Security Grant Program, H.R. 1 and S. 4: Description and      Analysis, by Shawn Reese and Steven Maguire.
