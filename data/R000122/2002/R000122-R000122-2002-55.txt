 All of these recommendations were based upon careful scrutiny of the programs. They were based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of the programs going forward, and, in addition, a sense of trying to avoid duplicative costs, ill-defined programs, those areas in which money might be spent but there is no clear indication of the product that was going to be purchased. In fact, some purchases seem to be premature because the testing of the products had not been accomplished. So this process has been a long one, and it has resulted in specific recommendations that today we are considering on the floor of the Senate.  I will make some general points about what is in this bill because it represents a significant commitment to missile defense, both theater missile defense and national missile defense, which now have been amalgamated in the administration's approach which they describe as a layered defense: the boost phase, midcourse phase, and terminal phase.  We have made a significant commitment of dollars in this bill to missile defense, and those points should be made.  First, the Department of Defense estimates that in this year they will spend about $4.2 billion. They expect to spend that for missile defense, leaving $4 billion of funds to be carried over to the next fiscal year, 2003.  We recommend, in this bill before us today, $6.8 billion of new funding for fiscal year 2003, giving the Department of Defense more than $10 billion available for spending next year on missile defense. That is a significant commitment to missile defense, and one that is supported by this Senator and, I am sure, by others. It is probably twice what will be spent this year.  To characterize $10 billion of available resources for missile defense next year as deep and damaging cuts to missile defense is somewhat inaccurate.  I should say at this juncture, the proposed amendment by my colleague from Virginia suggests that we add about $800 million and give the President the option of spending it on missile defense or antiterrorism activities. But it seems clear to me this debate is about missile defense and not about terrorism. Terrorism is something we are concerned about, but I think the impetus for this amendment is the overarching concern of the administration for missile defense.  So I think, first, we have, in fact, included within this bill before us robust funding for missile defense. We also have to respond to the reality that today we are engaged in a war on terror.  In fact, the National Intelligence Estimate for December 2001 stated:       U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked with [weapons      of mass destruction] . . . from nonmissile delivery means--     most likely from terrorists--than by missiles, primarily      because nonmissile delivery means are less costly, easier to      acquire, and more reliable and accurate. They can also be      used without attribution.  That is the National Intelligence Estimate for December 2001. So we do recognize there are threats to us from weapons of mass destruction, but we have to put it in context that the most immediate threats are either short-term theater missile threats by nation states or clandestine operations of terrorists entering the United States.  So with that recognition, I think this proposal we bring to the floor makes a great deal of sense. We have looked hard at individual programs. We are cognizant of the threats, particularly the theater missile threats. And we are also trying to do what we can to ensure that we protect this country from terrorist threats. So we have deliberated carefully and thoroughly on all of these issues.  Let me talk for a moment about the threats because they should be often mentioned because our strategy has to respond to these threats.  First, I think we should point out how we are going forward with the PAC-3 system which is a theater missile defense system. It is in operational testing. It is strongly supported in this bill. It counters those threats that are often mentioned here on the floor.  I know colleagues have talked about the potential access to short-range missiles by terrorist groups in the Middle East. I think they have also talked about the developments which are ongoing in countries such as Iran and Iraq and North Korea for missile systems, short-range tactical systems.  We have a system that is in operational testing, the PAC-3 system that counters those threats. We support that system. It is supported in this budget. We hope it is fielded at the first possible moment, deployed with troops in the field. There are other systems, too, that we support.  We continue to develop the THAAD system, which is another theater missile system. That is supported in this budget. We are supporting the Navy theater-wide system. We are considering, and very carefully supporting, a whole range of missile systems that are important to our defense. So to suggest that this legislation is not supportive of missile defense is to miss the details of the legislation.  We are also looking very carefully, as I mentioned, at specific adjustments to the systems that are being considered today.  That is our role, our responsibility. We are not here simply to say whatever the Defense Department sends over is something we will support without any question or scrutiny. Our job is to look carefully at systems and to make critical decisions about scarce resources, and we have done that.  Let me suggest some of the recommendations we have made in the context of the missile systems I mentioned. First, the sea-based midcourse, which was formerly Navy theater-wide. We fully fund the development and test program, $374 million. In fact, we add $40 million for new shipboard radar for robust theater missile defense. We are adding money to these programs because we believe it is important, and we believe this type of additional expenditure should be included within the budget.  We do, however, look at the program carefully, and we have made the recommendation that $52 million should be reduced because it is for a very vaguely defined concept development study. We believe that study is unjustified, undefined, but we are supporting vigorously the Navy midcourse program, sea-based midcourse, as we should.  From what I have seen of the Navy theater-wide system, the sea-based midcourse, the Missile Defense Agency is engaged in something which might be described as an ad hoc approach. Let me suggest why.  In our authorization bill last year, we asked the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees no later than April30, 2002, on the Department's ultimate plans for the Navy theater-wide system. That was last year's language. We asked them: Give us your plan.  We received a letter back from General Kadish which essentially said: Here is some information, but we can't give you any of the definitive information, particularly the life cycle costs of the system. What he said was, basically, while the questions posed in this request are relevant, a response will not be available until the SMD element of the BMDS is defined, and he suggested that the SMD definition will be completed by December 2003.  That is interesting. Then just a few weeks ago--approximately 10 days ago--I read in the Wall Street Journal where General Kadish was saying there will likely be a contingent deployment of this system in the year 2004. So the program will be defined by December 2003, and then we will have contingency deployment in 2004. That suggests to me a lack of a clear-cut plan, a lack of meaningful communication to this committee and to this Senate.  That shaped a lot of our deliberations in the sense of these ill-defined programs and the significant requests for money.  One area which is most relevant in this regard is the request for systems engineering money. Systems engineering money is generally the hiring of engineers, contractors, and software engineers to talk about designing and integrating systems. It is a very important part of the development of any system, particularly one as complicated and technologically challenging as national missile defense. We had included within this budget $500 million in systems engineering and other Government support and operations funding in individual missile program accounts: More than $170 million in systems engineering for the midcourse program element: the sea-based and the ground-based, the Navy system and the system in Alaska; more than $100 million for program management operations funding in individual program lines in the midcourse element; more than $70 million of Government support in the boost program element; more than $20 million in the sensor program element; and more than $80 million in the THAAD program element.  These are all systems engineering or program management costs. It adds up to a half a billion dollars. There is another category of systems engineering which has been developed in the last 2 years called the BMD system, the system of systems.  First, let me suggest that there are some practical time problems in spending all this money. The presumption for BMD systems engineering is that you are going to integrate all these systems that are being deployed. The reality is, it is very unclear at this juncture what systems will be deployed, what radars will be used, what types of sensors, what combinations of missiles and sensors. It is very unclear. But still the request was for a significant amount of money for systems engineering for the entire BMD system.  We looked carefully at this. We concluded that $736 million for this category was more than sufficient, together with the $500 million that is already embedded in each of the program elements of the existing BMD program.  As a result, we were able to reduce this request for BMD system money by $330 million. But let me also point out that as of this juncture, it appears that BMD will only spend $400 million of last year's money, and this will leave about $400 million for the next fiscal year. Together with the $736 million and the $400 million carryover, BMD systems engineering has over $1 billion, hardly a draconian, drastic cut in their ability to continue to do these programs of integration and systems engineering.  Again, we looked carefully. We determined what they were doing. We determined that they would have more than enough resources to continue their efforts into the next fiscal year, and we were able to move some of this money into the shipbuilding accounts which everyone in this Chamber, I would say without hesitation, will support enthusiastically, an immediate need for our Navy for additional ships.  In addition, we were able to move some of this money into programs for the protection of Department of Energy nuclear facilities. We did that in response to published reports, which we have all seen, that the Office of Management and Budget turned down the Department of Energy for a significant increase in security funds at a time when the threat--at least if you believe the last few weeks from the media--is not the long-range missile, the threat is the terrorists coming in here on an airplane, landing in Chicago with a plan or at least an idea to seize radiological material someplace in the United States, construct a ``dirty'' bomb here, and detonate it. Yet the administration said: No, DOE, you don't need this extra money to secure the nuclear facilities.  We think DOE needs this money, and it is a higher priority than excessive systems engineering money for the ballistic missile defense program.  So as we have looked at all of these programs, we have tried to take a very careful, considerate look, tried to make tough decisions, and they are tough decisions because we don't have unlimited, infinite resources. As the Senator from Michigan said, I question sincerely the availability next year of the inflation savings assumed in the proposed Warner amendment. This seems to be one of those fudge factors that is put in, an estimate. You might realize it, you might not realize it. I await, as the Senator from Michigan does, eagerly, Senator Warner's response from the Secretary of Defense with respect to these questions.  The reality is that these resources may not be realized through inflation savings. If we authorize the spending, which, for political reasons, the administration seems to be absolutely committed to, we may end up using operational maintenance money to fund missile defense, to fund these ill-defined areas of systems engineering and other programs.  We will find ourselves, in that case, coming back here and wondering why our flying hours are down for the Air Force and Navy pilots, why we can't provide the sort of resources we need for ongoing operations maintenance at a time when we have forces in the field engaged today, trying to destroy these terror networks, and succeeding in many cases because of their skill and courage and the support they are receiving.  We have brought to the floor a bill that robustly supports missile defense but asks very tough questions about specific programs that are not adequately justified or are redundant. Let me give an example of that. The THAAD missile system is well on the way toward the engineering phase to get to a point where it can be part of our theater missile defense system in the next several years, we hope. They are asking for $40 million to purchase 10 unproven missiles.  Our concept is fairly straightforward and simple. We provide that $895 million for the test development and for the first flight test of the missile in this budget. A simple proposition: Let's fly one of these missiles first before we buy 10 missiles. Maybe we can save resources. The THAAD Missile Program is a good example of a program that was once forced to accelerate beyond its technical means. It was, as General Welch described it, rushing to failure, and it failed--program course out of sight, product not adequate, not meeting the requirement set out for the system. It was a program in such distress that it was virtually on the chopping block. General Welch's report said: Listen, you have to go back to a careful, deliberate, thorough development process. The program is back on track. And now our sense is they are trying to get off track again--let's just buy these 10 extra missiles today.  That is an example, I believe, of the robust support--$895 million. But the very careful and appropriate question is: Why do you need to buy 10 missiles today when your first flight test is going to be in fiscal year 2005? Due to time constraints, I must yield the floor but will take time later to continue this discussion.                           Amendment No. 3918
