Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) for his openness and willingness to work hand and hand with us on this and also express my appreciation on behalf of all of those who suffer.  Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) for allowing me this time early on in this particular title. I genuinely appreciate the acceptance of this amendment.
