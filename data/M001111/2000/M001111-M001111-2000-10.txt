 President, one of the most important issues we consider here in the U.S. Senate is how to balance our economic needs with our responsibility to conserve our natural resources.  I believe we can strike the right balance. With that hope, I'd like to talk about America's fisheries. In the Pacific Northwest, fishing is more than just a way of life. It is an important part of our economy and contributes to our region's culture.  Unfortunately, that way of life is becoming more difficult. Many fishing families are struggling because some fish stocks are at very low levels. For example, the West Coast salmon and groundfish and the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands crab fisheries have declined dramatically in recent years. Washington's fishing families contribute to our economy and feed consumers both here and abroad, but too often they work within a system that threatens their safety and their livelihood. I've met with harvesters and processors from my region, and I've visited small towns in Washington state that depend on fisheries. The problems they face aren't limited to Washington state. They can also be seen in Alaska and other states.  In an effort to recover decreasing numbers of fish in our waters, fisheries managers have developed complex management systems to limit fishing. In some cases, our current policies encourage fishers to catch as many fish as possible over a limited period of time. This creates a dangerous and inefficient ``race for fish'', which requires fishermen to venture out in bad weather. In fact, one of the most dangerous occupations for young people today is to work in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island crab fishery. The ``race for fish'' is one way to manage fisheries in which too many fishermen are competing for too few fish. However, there are alternatives to this management approach.  I'm proud that there is a growing interest in an innovative management tool called individual fishing quotas. This creative approach uses the marketplace to encourage a safer, more productive, and more sustainable fishing industry. In some cases, it would be a significant improvement over the status quo.  Individual fishing quotas or IFQs would bring some regularity to what are currently short-lived, intense fishing seasons. Under this system, each participant in a fishery would be allocated a percentage of that season's total fish catch. Because they are guaranteed a certain amount of fish, fishermen wouldn't have to ``race for fish.'' They could stretch their fishing out over longer, more balanced fishing seasons.  I believe that individual fishing quotas can help fisherman, fisheries, conservation, and consumers. IFQs can help fishing families because boats won't need to go out in dangerous weather. In addition, because of the slower pace, fishermen would be less likely to lose fishing gear, a common problem in some fisheries. This new system can help fisheries because fishermen will be able to sell or lease quota. That means there will be fewer boats, which can mean cleaner, more efficient fisheries.  In addition, IFQs can improve conservation. In some cases when the fishery slows down, fishermen take better care of their catch and are more careful with bycatch. Let's look at just one example of how the speed of the current system hurts conservation. Currently, some North Pacific crabs that are too small to be caught legally end up trapped in crab pots. Under the race for fish, these pots are harvested so quickly that undersized crabs don't have time to escape. Under a slower fishery, those small crabs would have time to crawl out of the crab pots and grow to maturity, thereby helping to sustain the fishery into the future.  For consumers, IFQs mean they can enjoy fresh fish later in the seasons. For example, fresh halibut is now available more often as a result of a fish quota program put in place to manage halibut harvesting. Clearly, individual fishing quotas can be an effective management tool and can solve a lot of the problems facing fisheries today.  I'm pleased that many of my colleagues have expressed interest in IFQs. In fact, a number of members would like to see a national policy on IFQs developed. Since 1996, I've supported fish quotas and a national policy, and I reiterate my support again today.  But in the meantime, there are important steps we can take. When Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996, Congress placed afour-year moratorium on new individual fishing quota programs. The moratorium on new quota programs expired on September 30, 2000. Now that this ban has expired, we should allow fishery management councils to develop additional fish quota programs. Councils should have the freedom to develop and implement these programs. I am not advocating that Councils be required to implement them, because individual fishing quota programs must be developed on a fishery-by-fishery basis. I do think, however, that individual quota programs should be available as one of the many management tools Councils may draw upon. I must add that all eight Councils have asked for this freedom and have asked for Congress to lift the moratorium.  However, I know that some members want to extend the moratorium. They don't want to allow some fisheries to go ahead with IFQs until there is a national policy in place. I understand and appreciate this perspective. I also recognize members of the environmental community would be more comfortable with such programs if a national policy were already in place. As I said, I support a national policy on these programs, and I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to develop one.  However, I would like to point out that all fishery management plans, including those that rely on quota programs, are required to meet the national standards already in the Act. Let me offer a few examples of these standards. Any fish quota program would have to meet National Standard 4, which prohibits conservation and management measures from discriminating between residents of different states. This standard also mandates that fishing privileges be allocated fairly and equitably, that they are calculated to promote conservation, and that they are carried out so that no entity shall have an excessive share. Any fish quota program would also have to meet National Standard 8, which requires such measures to take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities. They would also have to meet National Standard 9, which requires measures to minimize bycatch, and National Standard 10, which addresses safety.  In addition, the Act requires all individual fishing quota programs approved on or after October 1, 2000, to meet several additional criteria. For example, these programs must be subject to review based on any future national policy and such revision may require reallocation of quota. These programs must also be effectively managed and enforced, which may require reliance on observers and/or cost-recovery fees. In addition, these criteria address the most contentious aspect of individual quota programs: the initial allocation of quota. The Act requires programs to ensure a fair initial allocation of quota, to prevent excessive control over quota, and to include a mechanism for entry-level fishermen, small vessel owners and crew members to access quota. I think all of these examples illustrate that some elements integral to a national policy on individual fishing quota programs are already included in the Act. I believe we are much closer to having a national policy in place than some people may believe.  Unfortunately, it appears likely that the moratorium will be extended. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to consider several caveats to this extension. First, I ask that the moratorium be extended for only 8 months. This will take the moratorium off the appropriations cycle. Placing the moratorium on the yearly appropriations cycle creates a precedent that is easy to repeat every year. Taking the moratorium off the appropriations cycle will increase the urgency for Congress to develop a national policy within the months ahead.  Second, I ask for an exception to the moratorium for fixed-gear sablefish along the West Coast. This fishery is ready for fishermen to be allowed to consolidate permits, which is technically considered an IFQ. In fact, the fishery has been ready to do so since 1994. We should not make these fishermen wait any longer. They deserve to be freed from a 9-day race for fish, and fishermen who want to get out of the fishery should be compensated for their investments. I ask for your support for this exception.  Third, I support asking NMFS to gather input from the eight regional Councils on a national policy for individual fishing quotas. It is appropriate and important for Congress to have this input before we finalize a national policy on quota programs.  Most important, however, I ask for the commitment of my colleagues to deal with this issue next year, during the first session of the 107th Congress. It is not fair to punish those few fisheries that are ready to move forward with quota programs just because other fisheries are not. We have already had four years to resolve these issues, to no avail. If my colleagues believe this issue must be addressed within the broader context of Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act reauthorization, I understand and I hope they will consider this Senator ready and willing to move forward with that challenge. I support Senator Snowe's and Senator Kerry's efforts to hold more hearings on reauthorization, and I offer to help them in any way I can to ensure it happens.  Let's commit ourselves to have a productive, comprehensive dialogue on a national policy. Let's commit to reaching a consensus that will allow our Councils and fisheries to pursue this innovative, effective solution that can work for fishing families, fisheries, conservation and consumers.                          ____________________
