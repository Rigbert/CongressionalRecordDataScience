Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, a distinguished son of Wyoming, Mike Sullivan, now an ambassador, is quoted on this very impressive brochure related to the Chief Washakie sculpture project. I think he says it well:  ``Washakie is a model for leaders across the generations.''  How appropriate it is to have a statue representing the State of Wyoming, representing Native Americans, and representing the kind of country that does and should honor a leader across the generations.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
