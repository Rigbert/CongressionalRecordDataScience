President, I want to take a few minutes tonight--Senator Graham of Florida will be joining me, and Senator Gordon Smith of my home State, my friend and colleague, will be joining me as well tonight--the three of us want to take a few minutes to talk about the important amendment we were able to have added to the HHS appropriations bill during the course of the last week.  In the beginning, we especially express our appreciation to Senator Specter and Senator Harkin. They worked with the three of us and our staffs over the last week on this particular issue.  What our agricultural labor amendment does is require the Department of Labor to report to the Congress on how the Department plans to promote a legal, domestic workforce--specifically, to improve compensation, working conditions, and other benefits for agricultural workers in the United States.  Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm workers and for farmers. We have a system that is completely broken. Estimates are that well over half of the farm workers in this country are illegal. As a result of their status, they can have no power at all. They can't even vote. They are subjected to the worst possible conditions imaginable, horrendous housing, and, in many instances, thrown into the back of pickup trucks and moved by people called coyotes, who, for a profit, bring them from other countries. The conditions to which our agricultural workers are subjected in so many instances are nothing short of immoral.  At the same time, the growers, who have a dependable supply of workers to pick their crops, are also in a completely untenable situation, the growers who want to do the right thing. Senator Smith and I represent a great many of those growers and farmers in our home State of Oregon, who don't know where to turn to find legal workers.  The General Accounting Office did a report a couple of years ago on the farm worker situation in our country. They said there really are enough farm workers, but they came to that conclusion only by counting the illegal farm workers in our country. Well over half of the farm workers in the United States are illegal. It is a situation that essentially turns those farmers, when they want to do the right thing, into people who have to make a choice as to whether or not they want to be felonsand not comply with the law or simply another individual in the bankruptcy line in our country.  To give you an idea how absolutely unacceptable this situation is, just this week I had berry farmers from my home State in Oregon telling me they had recently had meetings with the Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were told, in effect, how to work the system, but they weren't given any hope that what they were doing was within the law. In effect, the administration was telling the berry farmers in my State, with a wink and a nod, they should tolerate this system that is based on workers who can have no power and farmers who lack a system that is dependable and reliable so they can find legal workers.  In the last session of Congress, Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and I put together a bipartisan proposal to change this wholly unacceptable situation and produce a new system for dealing with agricultural labor that would be in the interest of both the farm worker and the farmer. Under our proposal, workers who were legal would get a significant increase in their benefits. Just how significant was documented in a report done for us by the Library of Congress, October 21, 1998. At page 2 of that report, it states specifically that the Library of Congress found that under our proposal--it received 67 votes in the Senate--the legal farm worker would get significantly higher wages, under what the Senate voted for. In addition, there would be benefits for housing, transportation, a variety of benefits that are so critical to the farm workers.  But after 67 Members of the Senate voted for our proposal, the administration said: It is unacceptable. We are going to veto it. It is not good enough. We have other ideas.  At that time, Senator Smith, Senator Graham, and I entered into a series of discussions with the Clinton administration asking them for their plan on how to produce this system that would address the legitimate concerns of both the farm workers and the growers. We have been at that for more than a year.  I see our good friend Senator Graham coming to the floor, and I will yield to him in just a moment.  Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and I have been at the task of trying to get from the administration their plan to deal with agricultural labor for more than a year. We told them, if they don't like our proposal--67 votes in the Senate; the Library of Congress said it will produce higher benefits, wages, improved transportation, and improved housing for so many legal workers--since it wasn't good enough for the Clinton administration, we would like to see their proposal. We decided we would, in the spirit of comity and a desire to get an agreement with the executive branch, wait for their proposal.  We are still waiting to this day. The administration remains on the sideline to this day, unwilling to come forward with any specific ideas that would be in the interests of both the workers and the growers. Just this week, they told the berry farmers in my home State--and we do a lot of things in Oregon well; frankly, what we do best is grow things; our farmers are very important to our State--the administration basically told them, just wink and nod at the rules that are out there today.  In December of 1998, Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor, sat in a meeting in Senator Graham's office with Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and myself. Alexis Herman told us, three Members of the Senate, that the administration would give us a specific proposal for dealing with this agricultural labor situation by the end of February 1999.  No such proposal has ever been delivered. In a moment, I am going to yield to my friend from Florida because he has essentially laid out a timeline that demonstrates how many times we have tried to get the administration off the sidelines and to join us in a bipartisan effort to produce a system that would work for the farm worker and for the grower.  By its inaction, the administration is perpetuating a system that is a disaster for both the farm worker and the farmer. It is a system that is totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of farm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions imaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for the farmers who want to do the right thing to know where to turn.  In the last Congress, Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and myself brought a legislative proposal that would change that, which the Library of Congress said would produce a significant amount of additional benefits for the legal farm worker. The Clinton administration said that wasn't good enough, and we have waited and waited for their ideas.  Well, tonight, as a result of the action taken in the Labor-HHS bill, we are calling, as a matter of law, on the Clinton administration to give us their plan as to how to produce a legal domestic workforce, which would have improved compensation, improved working conditions, and improved benefits that those farm workers are entitled to as a matter of simple justice.  So I am hopeful that we will get the administration off the sidelines soon. I am hopeful that they will do what they promised to do well over a year ago.  If the Senator from Vermont is willing, I would like to break my remarks off at this point and allow the Senator from Florida to speak for a few minutes. We want to be courteous to our colleague from Vermont because he is dealing with an issue of great importance to him. We will be brief.  I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                          Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 1998.                              [Memorandum]     To: The Honorable Ron Wyden; Attention: David Blan.     From: American Law Division.     Subject: Agricultural Labor Proposal.       In your letter of October 15, 1998, you asked for a      memorandum comparing the basic federal protections available      to farm workers with the protections that would have been      extended to farm workers under the proposed conference      agreement to the Commerce State Justice bill/H2A provision.      The letter stated that you are ``especially interested in      whether the agricultural labor proposal before the      Appropriations Conference Committee would have offered farm      workers, and particularly the more than 99.5% of U.S. farm      workers who work on non-H-2A farms new or expanded benefits      compared to current law.''       The proposal would have required the Secretary of Labor to      establish state and regional registries containing a database      of eligible United States workers seeking temporary or      seasonal agricultural jobs, in order to inform those workers      of available agricultural jobs and to grant them the right of      first refusal for available jobs. Basically, farmers would      have to apply to the registry for U.S. workers, and hire all      referred U.S. workers, before they could seek nonimmigrant      alien temporary agricultural workers under the immigration      program known as ``H-2A.'' Agricultural employers could not      import any workers unless the registry failed to refer a      sufficient number of registered workers to fill all of the      employer's job opportunities. Therefore, the employer could      only acquire as many imported workers as would be needed in      addition to those U.S. workers referred.       The proposal would have had an impact on domestic farm      workers in addition to its effect on alien workers. The      general legislative scheme was to condition the right of an      agricultural employer to request and hire temporary alien      workers on the employer's requirement, first, to seek      domestic workers from the registries maintained by the Labor      Department, and, then, to extend the protections granted to      H-2A aliens under the proposal to all workers in the same      occupation on the same farm. Under the proposal, agricultural      employers seeking domestic and foreign workers through the      registries were required to assure that they would not refuse      to employ qualified individuals, and would not terminate them      unless there were ``lawful job-related reasons, including      lack of work.'' Employers were also required to comply with      the following specific assurances.                                 wages       Under current law, agricultural employers, unless they are      exempt as small farmers, must pay the applicable minimum wage      and overtime rates under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act      (FLSA) or 1938, as amended. 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 201-19. Under      that law, farm workers must receive the greater of the      applicable federal or state minimum wage.       Under the conference agreement, the employer must pay the      greater of the prevailing wage in the occupation or the      adverse effect wage rate to the workers. The employer using      the registry must provide assurances that the wages and      benefits promised to the workers hired from the registry      would be provided ``to all workers employed in job      opportunities for which the employer has applied [from the      registry] and to all other workers in the same occupation at      the place of employment.''                       migrant worker protection       Under current law, agricultural employers who hire migrant      and seasonal workers must     comply with the provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal      Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSWPA). 29 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 1801-72. The MSWPA, however, does not cover any      temporary nonimmigrant alien authorized to work in      agriculture employment under the H-2A program. See 29 U.S.C.      Sec. 1802(8)(B)(ii).       Under the proposal agricultural employers were required to      comply with all applicable federal, state, and local labor      laws, including laws affecting migrant and seasonal      agricultural workers, for all United States workers as well      as all alien workers on the farm.                                housing       Under current law, employers have no responsibility to      provide housing or housing assistance to their workers. Under      the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act      (MASWPA), any person who owns or controls housing must comply      with substantive federal and state safety and health      standards applicable to that housing. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1823.       Under the conference proposal, employers are required to      provide housing at no cost to all workers in jobs for which      the employer has applied to the registry, and to all other      workers in the same occupation as the place of employment, if      the workers' permanent place of employment is beyond normal      commuting distance. The employer may provide a housing      allowance as an alternative.                          workers compensation       Under current law, workers compensation coverage is      exclusively a subject of state law, which may not cover all      agricultural employees, especially those considered casual or      temporary.       Under the proposal, the employer was required to provide      insurance coverage providing benefits equivalent to those      under state law, at no expense to the worker, for any job      that was not covered by the state workers compensation law.                               head start       Under current law, migrant employees find barriers to      participation in Head Start programs.       Under the proposal, the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start      Program would have been established, removing barriers to      participation by the children of migrant farmworkers.                             transportation       Under current law, employers are not obliged to provide      transportation to workers. If transportation is furnished,      the employer and any farm labor contractor must comply with      the motor vehicle safety requirements of the MSWPA. 29 U.S.C.      Sec. 1841.       Under the conference proposal, a worker who completed 50      percent of the period of employment would be reimbursed for      transportation expenses to the job, and a worker who      completed the period of employment would be reimbursed for      the cost of transportation back to the worker's permanent      place of residence.                       enforcement of labor laws       Under current law, labor laws are enforced primarily by the      U.S. Department of Labor and by the responsible state labor      enforcement agencies.       Under the proposal, the Secretary of Labor was required to      establish an expedited complaint process, including a written      determination of whether a violation has been committed      within 10 days of the receipt of a complaint.       Workers on farms where the employer did not seek workers      through the Labor Department registry would not have been      affected by the proposal. Agricultural employers who hire      migrant and seasonal workers must comply with the provisions      of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker protection      Act (MSWPA). 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1801-72.       In conclusion, the proposed agricultural registry program      would have required farmers to extend the protections of the      federal migrant and seasonal worker law to all workers in the      same occupation on the site. The proposed agricultural      employment bill could well have expanded employment      protections for U.S. workers beyond current law. If an      agricultural employer applied to a registry and found enough      U.S. workers for some or all of the available job      opportunities, then those U.S. workers would have been      entitled to the enhanced wage, housing, transportation, and      other benefits and protections made applicable to all      employees in the same work on the same site.
