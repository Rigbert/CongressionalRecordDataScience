Speaker, I rise to join my sisters in the State of Ohio--women elected officials, small business owners, women activists across our State--to speak out against attacks on the ability of women to get full health coverage in this country.  Imagine, we can land an astronaut on the Moon, we can target and eliminate Osama bin Laden, but we can't seem to figure out as a society how to make sure that women have full health choices in the insurance programs of our country.  It seems that some people just want to keep women in the corner and not see the struggles that they have had in preventive health care, in full choice for the medications that they take in order that they be able to live full and productive lives.  You know, our grandmother had 16 children. Several of them died. She lived to the age of 93. In those days, there were almost no medications, and more women died in childbirth than soldiers were lost in World War I.  I think the world has moved beyond closed thinking on women's health. I stand with my sisters in Ohio.                          ____________________
