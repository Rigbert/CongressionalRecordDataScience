President, when I recommended Bill Sessions to the President in March, I described him as a respected lawyer from Middlebury with a wide range of legal experience. He has distinguished himself by his contributions to the community and by his participation in efforts to improve our justice system. I have great confidence that Bill Sessions will be a fair, thoughtful and conscientious addition to the Federal bench in Vermont.  Vermont is blessed with a very talented bench and bar and making a recommendation among them was difficult. In the end, I relied on the standard I have cited for years: I recommended the person that I believe any litigant on any issue can be assured will provide a fair and judicious hearing and a common sense determination of disputes and problems.  Bill's integrity and fairness are impeccable. He will be concerned with applying the laws fairly and with how the Federal courts and Federal laws affect people.  I have known and admired Bill Sessions for a number of years. He is a devoted father and husband. He is involved in the community. His legal work is outstanding. I know of his involvement in the bar in a number of positions, including with the rule of law project of the Vermont Bar Association and the civil justice reform project for the Vermont district court.  Bill graduated from Middlebury College and received his law degree with honors from George Washington University. He served as Addison County public defender as well as the executive director of the Addison County Youth Services Bureau. He has served as an adjunct professor at Vermont Law School, where he received the Phi Delta Phi Academic Excellence Award in 1982. He has been engaged in the private practice of law for the past 17 years, most recently with the firm of Sessions, Keiner, Dumont & Barnes. He has handled a wide variety of matters, in particular complex criminal and related civil matters in both Federal and State court, and has tremendous trial experience. The ABA gave this nominee its highest rating.  I was struck during his confirmation hearings last year when Justice Breyer spoke so eloquently about the Constitution and its guarantees of individual dignity. I believe that Bill Sessions has spent his professional life working to uphold human dignity.  I am convinced that Bill Sessions will always remember the effects that his decisions will have on real people--people who may not be powerful or well-connected. He has demonstrated that he has not only mastered the complexities of the law but its meaning. I feel sure that he will do his utmost to see that the decisions of the U.S. district court in Vermont reflect both the letter and the spirit of law. He will make an outstanding Judge.  I am pleased that the President's nomination of Bill Sessions has drawn praise from a number of quarters, ranging from law enforcement officers including the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshal and States attorneys, to State and Federal judges including Judges Billings, Parker, and Davenport. Indeed, the Judiciary Committee received a number of letters in support of this nomination. I would, in particular, like to mention the letters from Doug Richards, the chair of the Vermont Judicial Nominating Advisory Commission; Susanne Young, a Vermont assistant attorney general; Peter Hall, a former first assistant and acting U.S. attorney; and Charles Caruso, a former acting U.S. attorney.  I have every confidence that Bill Sessions will make an outstanding Federal judge, who will be just, practical and hardworking on behalf of the people of Vermont. I have every confidence that once confirmed he will successfully resist the pressures to become cloistered away from the world. I think that his strong involvement with his vibrant family and his community will help protect him. I doubt that Abi, Hannah, Myra and Jonathan are going to allow him to lose touch.  Vermont is the only State in the Union to have only one full-time Federal judge currently. Since Judge Parker was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit last year and Judge Billings assumed senior status, Vermont has been without its complement of two U.S. District Court judges. Vermont deserves to have its Federal judges considered, confirmed and in place ready to rule on important matters.  I thank the President for nominating Bill Sessions and thank my colleagues for expediting his confirmation. I commend them all for recognizing the merit of this extraordinary nominee.                       NOMINATION OF JILL L. LONG
