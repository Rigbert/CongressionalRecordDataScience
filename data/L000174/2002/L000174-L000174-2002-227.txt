It is about accountability, and it is about transparency. I think everybody--investors, corporate managers, or anybody else--will tell you that accountability and transparency are the bedrock of our economy, of our markets.  If one is going to invest in a company, one wants to know what the company does and what the books say. One wants to be able to rely upon their reports.  Transparency will instill confidence, and accountability helps enforce transparency and forthright financial decisions. We do not just rely on the better angels of our nature; we rely on the fact that somebody is going to be there to enforce it.  We cannot stop greed, but we can stop greed from succeeding. This bipartisan amendment is going to send wrongdoers to jail and save documents from the shredder, and that sends a powerful and clear message to potential wrongdoers: Don't do it.  The measure enjoys wide support. The amendment is supported by law enforcement officials, regulators, and numerous whistleblowers, and consumer protection advocates. I have letters of support from these advocates, and I will, at the end of my statement, ask consent to print them in the Record.  Let me summarize some of the provisions. This bipartisan amendment has three prongs to restore accountability: punishing and preventing fraud, preserving the evidence of fraud, and protecting victims of fraud.  S. 2010, as unanimously reported, accomplishes these goals in a number of ways. It is going to create a tough new Federal felony for securities fraud for a 10-year maximum penalty. The idea of 10 years in the slammer is going to focus the attention of those who are more interested in taking their money and hiding it in offshore bank accounts.  As one who was a prosecutor, I was surprised to learn that unlike bank fraud, health care fraud, and even bankruptcy fraud, there is no specific Federal crime of securities fraud to protect victims of fraud related to publicly traded companies.  Can you imagine, Madam President, while all this talk has been going on, it turns out there is no specific crime of securities fraud. This bill would create such a felony with a tough 10-year jail sentence.  The amendment provides for a review of the existing sentencing guidelines for fraud cases and for organizational misconduct to make them tougher as well.  The new crimes and enhanced criminal penalties in this bill were worked out among Senators Hatch, Schumer, and me, and unanimously supported by the Judiciary Committee, and I thank Senators Hatch and Schumer for their support.  The Leahy-McCain amendment also creates two new anti-shredding penalties which set clear requirements for preserving financial audit guides and close loopholes in current anti-shredding laws.  These provisions close loopholes in current laws and set a clear requirement that corporate audit documents must be saved for 5 years. We, incidentally, picked that time period because that is the statute of limitation for most Federal crimes.  These provisions are crucial in preventing recurrences of what happened at Arthur Andersen.  These provisions will preserve evidence that helps law enforcement officers and prosecutors focus immediately on the evidence. It takes a few minutes to warm up the shredder, but it can take years for prosecutors and victims to put together a case without key documents.  The amendment protects corporate whistleblowers. Senator Grassley and I worked out these bipartisan measures in the Judiciary Committee. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his assistance and his constant leadership over the years on whistleblower rights.  When sophisticated corporations set up complex fraud schemes, corporate insiders are often the only ones who can disclose what happened and why.  Unfortunately, the Enron case also demonstrates the vulnerability of corporate whistleblowers to retaliation under current law. This is a memo from outside counsel to Enron management. They were afraid there might be a whistleblower. It said:       You also asked that I include in this communication a      summary of the possible risks associated with discharging (or      constructively discharging) employees who report allegations      of improper accounting practices.  Then he goes on to give them the good news:       Texas law does not currently protect corporate      whistleblowers. The supreme court has twice declined to      create a cause of action for whistleblowers who are      discharged. . . .  In other words, if they dare tell about corporate misdeeds, fire them, it is not going to hurt.  After this high-level employee of Enron reported improper accounting practices, the Enron executives were not thinking about firing the accountants who were doing wrong; they wanted to fire the whistleblower, their own employee. Why? Because they were pocketing the money. They were getting that money out to their bank accounts as fast as they could, and they did not want anybody to say so.  The bipartisan whistleblower protections are supported by the National Whistleblower Center, the Government Accountability Project, and Taxpayers Against Fraud. They call S. 2010 ``the single most effective measure possible to prevent further recurrences. . . . ''  The measure lengthens the statute of limitation by extending it from the earlier of 1 year from discovery or 3 years from the fraud to 2 years from discovery or 5 years from the fraud.  Senators Feinstein and Cantwell worked hard to craft a fair compromise on this provision in the Judiciary Committee.  Indeed, the last two SEC Chairmen from both parties, Arthur Levitt and Richard Breeden, both agreed that the current short statute of limitations is unfair to fraud victims.  Attorney General Christine Gregoire testified before the Judiciary Committee in the Enron State pension fund litigation that the current short statute has forced some States to forego claims against Enron.  In Washington State alone, the short statute of limitations could cost hard-working State employees--firefighters and police officers--nearly $50 million in lost Enron investments.  Last week, Xerox announced it was restating its revenue back 5 years by $6.4 billion. Madam President, as a law student, I remember sitting in the gallery listening to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Dirksen, give his well-known speech: ``A billion here and a billion there, and soon you're talking about real money.''  Imagine a corporation claiming they made a mistake in their revenue of $6.4 billion for the past five years. The disclosures raise the specter of innocent investors who, through no fault of their own, will be barred from recouping losses.  We make the debt from security law violations nondischargeable in bankruptcy. We protect fraud victims by amending the bankruptcy code to make judgments and settlements based upon security law violations nondischargeable. Corporate leaders should not be allowed to take the money, run, file bankruptcy, and keep from ever paying any securities fraud judgment. The State security regulators strongly support this change. You cannot have one set of rules which say if you steal $500 from a store, you can go to jail. But if you steal $50 million from the corporate boardroom, keep the money. That makes no sense. Everywhere I went in the State of Vermont last week, people were saying: If I committed an act, if I stole something, if I cash a bad check for $100, I run the risk of going to jail.  But what do you do if you get $50 million or $100 million? You are home free.  Criminal conduct deserves criminal penalties. Corporate CEOs who rob their company, who rob the pension funds of their employees, who rob the trust of the American people, are criminals. They ought to go to jail.  The steel bars, maybe that will give a conscience to some of these people like Kenneth Lay and others who obviously do not have one. This gives prosecutors, the investigators, and victims the tools to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable.  The people who are involved in such massive criminal activity ought to pay. The American people ought to know they will have to pay. If they don't, there will be a whole lot more fraud.  I ask unanimous consent to have a number of letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Taxpayers Against Fraud,                                                   Washington, DC.                            Government Accountability Project,                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2002.       Dear Senator: The Government Accountability Project (GAP)      and the Taxpayers Against Fraud (TAF) reaffirm our support      for the Leahy Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability      amendment to S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform      and Investor Protection Act of 2002.       Initially introduced as S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal      Fraud Accountability Act, was unanimously reported by the      Senate Judiciary Committee on May 6, 2002. This amendment is      a landmark proposal. It promises to make whistleblower      protection the rule rather than the exception for those      challenging betrayals of corporate fiduciary duty enforced by      the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would be the      single most effective measure to prevent recurrences of the      Enron and Worldcom debacles as well as similar threats to the      nation's financial markets, shareholders and pension holders.       GAP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest law firm      dedicate since 1976 to helping whistleblowers, those      employees who exercise freedom of speech to bear witness      against betrayals of public trust that they discover on the      job. GAP has led the campaign for passage of nearly all      federal whistleblower laws over the last two decades. TAF is      a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest organization      dedicated to combating fraud against the Federal Government      through promotion and use of the federal False Claims Act and      its qui tam whistleblower provisions. TAF supports effective      anti-fraud legislation at the federal and state level.       The Leahy amendment to S. 2673 is outstanding good      government legislation. It closes the loopholes that have      meant whistleblowers proceed at their own risk when warning      Congress, shareholders, and their own management's Board      Audit Committees of financial misconduct threatening the      health of their own company, investor confidence and the      nation's economy. We hope we can count on your support to add      this state of the art whistleblower protection system in S.      2673. If you have any questions regarding the Leahy      amendment, please call Tom Devine at GAP (202-408-0034 ext.      124), or Doug Hartnett (ext. 136).           Sincerely,                                                      Jim Moorman,                                          Executive Director, TAF.                                                       Tom Devine,     Legal Director, GAP.                                  ____                                         North American Securities                            Administrators Associations, Inc.,                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: NASAA supports S. 2673, The Public      Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of      2002, and opposes efforts to weaken its provisions. State      securities regulators believe there is an immediate need to      restore investor confidence in our securities markets.       Passage of the Leahy amendment, which incorporates S. 2010,      the Corporate and Criminal Fraud and Accountability Act of      2002, into the accounting reform bill would send a strong      deterrent message to potential securities violators by      providing prosecutors with new and better tools to punish      those who defraud our nation's investors. Our focus is on      Section 4, which would prevent the discharge of certain debts      in bankruptcy proceedings. At the present time, the      bankruptcy code enables defendants who are guilty of fraud      and other securities violations to thwart enforcement of the      judgments and other awards that are issued in these cases.       We support passage of the Leahy amendment because it      strengthens the ability of regulators and individual      investors to prevent the discharge of certain debts and hold      defendants financially responsible for violations of      securities laws. This issue is of great interest to state      securities regulators, and we hope you'll support it on the      Senate floor.       In addition, state securities regulators enclose Title V of      S. 2673--Analyst Conflicts of Interest--in its current form      and strongly oppose any amendment to this title that would      reduce our ability to investigate wrongdoing and take      appropriate enforcement actions against securities analysts.      An amendment drafted by Morgan Stanley was circulated that,      we believe, would have prohibited state securities regulators      from imposing remedies upon firms that committed fraud, if it      involved securities analysts and perhaps even broker-dealers      that deal with individual investors. Clearly this approach is      ill-advised, especially in today's climate. What message      would be sent to Main Street investors if the states'      investigative and enforcement authority were weakened?      (Additional information on this proposal was delivered to      your office last week.)       Please vote for passage of S. 2673, for the Leahy      amendment, and against any amendments to curtail state      securities enforcement actions.           Sincerely,     Joseph P. Borg,       NASAA President, Alabama Securities Director.     Christine A. Bruenn,       NASAA President-elect, Maine Securities Administrator.                                       ____                                  American Federation of Labor and                          Congress of Industrial Organization,                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.     Legislative Alert!       Dear Senator Leahy: The sudden and spectacular collapse of      Enron has jeopardized the retirement security of millions of      hardworking Americans and exposed systemic failures of our      securities laws. If we are to prevent future Enrons and      restore the credibility of America's capital markets,      aggressive reform is required. This week the Judiciary      Committee will markup S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal      Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, which is an important part      of this effort and deserves your support.       The measures embodied in S. 2010 will help protect working      families and their retirement funds from future Enrons by      strengthening the penalties for securities and accounting      fraud, and destruction of audit papers. The bill provides      strong civil and criminal penalties for conduct such as      document shredding by auditors and conspiracies to defraud      investors; and bars those who commit securities fraud from      using the bankruptcy system to avoid compensating the victims      of such fraud. It also lengthens the statute of limitations      for civil lawsuits by the victims of securities fraud, making      it more difficult for those who commit these crimes to escape      having to compensate their victims.       S. 2010 is an important part of the comprehensive reforms      Congress needs to enact in response to the conflicts in the      capital markets exposed by the collapse of Enron. The AFL-CIO      urges you to support S. 2010 at this week's Judiciary      Committee markup.           Sincerely,     William Samuel       Director, Department of Legislation.                                  ____                                              Consumers Union,                                                   Washington, DC.     Re Support for S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud          Accountability Act of 2002                               Consumer Federation of America,                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2002.       Dear Senator: Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation      of America urge your support for S. 2010, the Corporate and      Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, sponsored by      Senator Patrick Leahy, when it comes before the Judiciary      Committee for markup on Thursday. This proposal adds      important provisions to the civil and criminal laws, which      will both, deter and when necessary, punish securities fraud.        Enhancing Enforcement and Sanctions for Securities Fraud       S. 2010 takes the following important steps to strengthen      enforcement and penalties for securities fraud:       It creates a new felony for the act of defrauding      shareholders of publicly traded companies.       It creates a new felony for destruction of evidence or      creation of evidence with intent to obstruct a federal agency      or criminal investigation.       It provides whistleblower protection to employees of      publicly traded companies when they act lawfully to disclose      information about fraudulent activities within their company.       It enhances the ability of state attorneys general and the      SEC to use civil RICO to enforce existing law; currently only      the US attorney general has such authority currently under      RICO.              Adopting a Realistic Statute of Limitations       S. 2010 also increases the ability of defrauded investors      to recover their losses by lengthening the statute of      limitations. The bill would set the statute of limitations to      the earlier of 5 years after the date of the fraud or three      years after the fraud was discovered.       The current statute of limitations, the result of a 5-4      vote in a 1991 Supreme Court decision, sets up an      unrealistically short timetable for bringing private suits      and needs to be corrected. Former President Bush's SEC      Chairman Richard Breeden, former President Clinton's SEC      Chairman Arthur Levitt, and state securities regulators have      all supported an extension of the statute of limitations.       Suits by defrauded investors have long been recognized by      securities regulators, including former SEC Chairman Levitt,      as an important deterrent against fraud. Moreover, securities      fraud is often well-concealed and not readily apparent to      investors until, in some cases, years after the fraud has      been committed. As Chairman Levitt testified in 1995 before      the Senate Banking Committee, ``Extending the statute of      limitations is warranted because many securities frauds are      inherently complex, and the law should not reward the      perpetrator of a fraud who successfully conceals its      existence for more than 3 years.''       Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, in their vigorous dissent in      the 1991 Supreme Court case, also supported a longer statute      of limitations. Justice Kennedy wrote, ``The most extensive      and corrupt schemes may not be discovered within the time      allowed for bringing an express cause of action under the      1934 Act. Ponzi schemes, for example, can maintain the      illusion of a profit-making enterprise for years, and      sophisticated investors may not be able to discover the fraud      until long after its perpetration . . . By adoption of a      three year period of response, the Court makes a 10(b) action      all but a dead letter for many injured investors who by no      conceivable standard of fairness or practicality can be      expected to file suit within three years after the violation      occurred. In so doing, the Court also turns its back on the      almost uniform rule rejecting short periods of response for      fraud-based actions.''       Indeed, some states' pension funds may have to forego      claims against Enron for securities fraud that occurred in      the late 1990s because of this short statute of limitations.      Washington State's Attorney General discussed this problem      when she testified before your Committee in February of this      year. ``In fact, for Washington State, our claim in the      [Enron] case is for approximately $50 million, when in fact      our losses are in excess of $100 million. But because of the      statute of limitations, we're not able to make that claim.''      (underlining added).       The current statute of limitations rewards those who are      able to conceal their fraud for a relatively short time with      immunity from private liability. It also includes a limit of      one-year from the time of discovery, which encourages a rush      to the courthouse.       The criminal conduct surrounding the collapse of Enron, and      the fact that many claims for fraud will be time-barred by      the current short statute of limitations, have drawn      attention to the need for reform. S. 2010 includes important      investor protection measures. We urge your support for this      bill in the Judiciary Committee April 18.           Sincerely,                                                  Sally Greenberg,                                                   Senior Counsel.

No More Enrons--Support S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal          Fraud Accountability Act of 2002       Dear Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee: We are      writing on behalf of the members of state Public Interest      Research Groups to urge your strong support for S. 2010, the      Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002,      sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, when it comes before the      Judiciary Committee for markup on Tuesday. This proposal adds      important provisions to the civil and criminal law to both      deter and, when necessary, punish securities fraud. Please      oppose weakening amendments.       S. 2010 takes the following important steps to strengthen      enforcement and penalties for securities fraud:       It creates a new felony for the act of defrauding      shareholders of publicly traded companies.       It creates a new felony for destruction of evidence or      creation of evidence with intent to obstruct a federal agency      or criminal investigation.       It provides whistleblower protection to employees of      publicly traded companies when they act lawfully to disclose      information about fraudulent activities within their company.       It enhances the ability of state attorneys general and the      SEC to use civil RICO to enforce existing law; currently only      the U.S. attorney general has such authority currently under      RICO.       Importantly, S. 2010 also increases the ability of      defrauded investors to recover their losses by lengthening      the statute of limitations. The bill would reasonably and      sensibly set the statute of limitations to the earlier of 5      years after the date the fraud occurred or three years after      the fraud was discovered. A securities law violation is often      a complex, multi-year enterprise. Indeed, Enron's recent      accounting restatements went back five years. Under the      fraudster-friendly current law, some state pension fund      claims against Enron may be time-barred.       S. 2010 includes numerous important investor protection      measures to assist whistleblowers, fraud victims, and law      enforcement agencies. We urge your strong support for this      bill to help restore investor confidence in the Judiciary      Committee April 18. Please oppose weakening amendments.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Cantwell: The National Whistleblower Center      strongly supports S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud      Accountability Act of 2002. This law would protect employees      who disclose Enron-related fraud to the appropriate      authorities.       One of the most notorious loopholes in current      whistleblower protection law exists under the securities      laws, in which employees who report fraud against      stockholders have no protection under federal law. It is     truly tragic that employees who are wrongfully discharged      merely for reporting violations of law, which may threaten      the integrity of pension funds or education-based savings      accounts, have no federal protection.       This point was made abundantly clear by the recently      released internal memorandum from attorneys for Enron.      According to Enron's own counsel, employees who were blowing      the whistle on Enron's misconduct were not protected under      federal law, and could be subject to termination.      Unfortunately, the Enron attorney was correct.       It is imperative that the next time a company like Enron      seeks advice from counsel as to whether they can fire an      employee, like Sharon Watkins (who merely disclosed potential      fraud on shareholders), the answer must be a resounding      ``no.'' That can only happen if the Corporate and Criminal      Fraud Accountability Act is enacted into law.           Respectfully submitted,                                                 Kris J. Kolesnik,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                              National Association                                          of Attorney General,                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 2002.       Dear Senator: It has come to my attention that the      substance of S. 2010, the Corporation and Criminal Fraud      Accountability Act of 2002, will be offered as an amendment      to S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor      Protection Act of 2002, as early as next week.       I have attached a letter to Senator Leahy from seven      Attorneys General written last April in support of the      substance of S. 2010, in order to make these views known as      you consider this legislation.       If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to      call Blair Tinkle, NAAG's Legislative Director at 202-326-     6258.           Sincerely,                                                       Lynne Ross,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                            Attorneys General,                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: We would like to take this opportunity      to express our support for your bill, S. 2010, the Corporate      and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, which is      pending before the Senate.       As you know, the proposal would allow state Attorney's      General to seek to enjoin racketeering activities under the      federal RICO statute. Such added authority would enhance the      ability of Attorneys General to protect their citizens from      unlawful activities by organizations both within and outside      the borders of our individual states.       In addition, to restore accountability, S. 2010 provides      prosecutors new and better tools to effectively prosecute and      punish criminals who defraud investors by:       Creating a new, 10-year felony specifically aimed at      securities fraud.       Enhancing fraud and obstruction of justice statutes where      evidence is destroyed and in fraud cases, where there are      many victims or where any victim is financially devastated.       Creating two new document destruction felonies establishing      a new felony shredding crime and requiring the preservation      of audit documents for 5 years.       Creating new protections for corporate whistleblowers.       Finally, the bill protects victims' rights by:       Protecting securities fraud victims from discharge of their      debts in bankruptcy.       Extending the statute of limitations in securities fraud      cases.       We appreciate your efforts to enact this important      legislation. Please feel free to contact us if we can provide      further assistance in this effort.           Sincerely,         Carla J. Stovall, Attorney General of Kansas, President            of NAAG; Hardyress, Attorney General of Oregon,            Chairman, Enron Bankruptcy Working Group; Christine            Gregsire, Attorney General of Washington; William H.            Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont; Ms. Edmonds,            Attorney General of Oklahoma, President-Elect of NAAG;            Thurbert E. Baker, Attorney General of Georgia; Betty            D. Montgomery, Attorney General of Ohio.
