 The rule states, in pertinent part, ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment imposes additional duties by requiring the Bureau to determine whether a decision constitutes a resolution.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Chair, I do.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized.  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Chair, I would like a ruling in opposition to that, because I think what we are talking about here does not change law. It changes nothing other than maintaining the direction we have. It is not requiring any action by the Bureau or Department of the Interior or any other government agency, nor prejudicing anything by the court, simply keeping what we have in place with the contracts and the stability that is needed.  So I think the point of order is invalid with what the intention of this amendment is.  The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair will rule.  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new determination as to what constitutes the resolution of a particular court case through a decision.  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman
