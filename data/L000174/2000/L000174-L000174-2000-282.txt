President, I want to be sure there is no misunderstanding about my purpose in offering this amendment, which would reduce funding in the bill by a total of $21 million for programs to combat tuberculosis and malaria. The funding for these activities was included at my request, and I want to express my appreciation to Chairman McConnell for that.  Like every Senator, I would like to see the highest possible levels of funding to combat these two dreaded diseases, which cause immeasurable suffering in developing countries. I have worked to do that for several years, and I fully intend to continue doing so. If our FY01 budget allocation would permit it, I would recommend higher funding for global health programs, including to combat TB and malaria.  However, we are forced to make excruciating choices. I want to be sure that we allocate our resources wisely, and that we also have sufficient resources to support vital programs to combat anti-microbial resistance, which is a worldwide problem of great urgency and immense proportions, and to strengthen disease surveillance in developing countries.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in addition to providing increased funding above the current levels for programs to combat TB and malaria, we are also able to at least maintain, and preferable increase funding for anti-microbial resistance and surveillance. My hope is that effects of this amendment will only be temporary, that we will receive a higher allocation in the Conference, and that we will then be able to provide higher levels of funding for all of these critically important health activities.                          ____________________
