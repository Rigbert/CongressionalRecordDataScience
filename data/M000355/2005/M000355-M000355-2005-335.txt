 President, I ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1280, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the Senate insist upon its amendment, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees. I further ask that S. 1280 be returned to the calendar.
