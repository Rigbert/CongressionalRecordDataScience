President, I rise today to honor a fine Marine Officer, General Butch Neal, the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, who will soon retire from active duty.  General Neal's long and distinguished career began more than thirty years ago following his graduation from Northeastern University when he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Following the completion of The Basic School at Quantico, Butch was trained as an artillery officer and was assigned to duty in the Republic of Vietnam where he served tours as a Forward Observer and as an Advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Corps.  While serving in Vietnam, he was wounded and received the Purple Heart. He was also awarded the Silver Star Medal on two occasions for his heroism as well as the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'' device.  General Neal distinguished himself over the years as one of the Marine Corps' finest commanding officers. Whether as a battery commander, artillery battalion commander, Deputy Marine Expeditionary Force Commander or Commanding General of the 2nd Marine Division, his reputation as an uncommonly gifted leader of Marines has grown with each billet he held. In the joint arena, he served with distinction as the Commanding General, Joint Task Force for Operation GITMO, the humanitarian relief effort for Haitian immigrants in Cuba and as the Deputy Commander in Chief/Chief of Staff for U.S. Central Command.  Day after day, year after year he demonstrated the rare quality of balancing difficult and often dangerous responsibilities with a keen concern for the welfare of his Marines. Butch has been a superb staff officer. Most Americans remember him from his no-nonsense daily briefings during the Persian Gulf War, but he also distinguished himself in personnel management as well as in operational planning.  This unique combination of leadership and administrative skills carried him to the very highest levels of the Marine Corps. His impeccable character and strong moral fiber make him a leader among the very best of our nation's military commanders. Yet what stands out most to me when I think of this fine officer is his simplicity and unassuming nature.  Despite all the accolades and all the honors, he remains a simple man from Massachusetts. I got to know him and his wife Kathy because they attend the same church as my wife Marcelle and I. He is a hard working New Englander who with love of God, country and Corps dedicated a lifetime in service to our nation. Too often we do not thank the Butch Neals of the world, those who choose a lifetime of service and sacrifice so that the rest of us can live safe and free.  Butch, we are grateful for the service you have rendered as a Marine, as well as the sacrifices made by both you and your family. I wish Butch, his wife Kathy and their children Andrew, Amy and Erin much health and happiness in the years ahead. Our country is better for the many contributions he has given us.                          ____________________
