Speaker, hundreds of my constituents have contacted me about the severe cuts in Medicare reimbursement for home oxygen therapy. As the House and Senate conferees deliberate over the extent of these cuts, I would like them to consider the lives of seniors receiving home oxygen services. The following letter was given to me by Laurie Keiper of Springfield, OR.       To Congress and the Senate of the United States: I am an      oxygen home therapy patient on 3-4 liters, 24 hours each day.      I am a wife of a research vessel boatswain mate who is not      home every night. He is gone most of the summer and fall.       I am a care giver also, taking care of my grandson, most of      his 14 years. He will be starting 9th grade in the fall.       Without oxygen, I can not take care of my grandson, do for      my family, or take care of myself. Instead you will pay more      for child care, hospital and for nursing facility care. Most      likely my 5 years of life expectancy will be shortened to 2      to 3 years or less. Oxygen is 1 percent of the total medicare      budget. If you cut it by 40 percent what will it cost you?       40 percent increase in hospital stays.       40 percent increase in dependent payments, especially      without parental guidance look at all the options--drugs,      alcohol, runaways etc.       40 percent increase in home health and/or nursing facility      payments.       40 percent increase in death benefit burial payments.       It does not seem fiscally prudent to make this cut. Look      for fake bills, bad doctors, people who aren't supposed to be      on Medicare. When someone says they question a bill--follow      up on it. Cut cost that way!                                                    Laurie Keiper.                               ____________________
