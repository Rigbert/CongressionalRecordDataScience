Mr. Speaker, I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 124 to respond to what I call goon squad tactics taken by Canadian fishermen on the weekend of July 19, 1997.  Canadian fishermen, frustrated with their Government's effort to resolve Pacific Salmon Treaty disputes, further escalated the salmon strife by illegally blockading the M/V Malaspina, an Alaskan ferry, in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. What I find most reprehensible, is the failure of the Canadian Government to enforce a court order to end the blockade. Innocent passengers were held hostage while the Government of Canada turned a blind eye.  This isn't the first time the Government of Canada has condoned illegal actions. In 1994, 258 United States fishermen were unfairly charged an illegal transit fee by the Canadian Government to transit from Washington to Alaska through the Inside Passage. U.S. fishermen have only two choices when traveling from Washington to Alaska. The safe route is through the Inside Passage, while the alternate is traveling in the treacherous waters of the Pacific Ocean. This illegal fee forced U.S. vessels to either risk their safety or be illegally fined.  In 3 years, the Canadian Government or its citizens have purposefully ignored and violated international law and harassed United States citizens. How many times are we supposed to put up with Canada's disregard for international law? House Concurrent Resolution 124 asks the President to use all necessary and appropriate means to compel the Government of Canada to prevent any further illegal actions.  Mr. Speaker, Canada's past actions are serious and I would hope that Congress and the administration can work together to develop and implement measures to help protect the interests of the United States with respect to the Pacific salmon fishery. The United States should not tolerate threats to those interests from the action or inaction of a foreign government or its citizens.
