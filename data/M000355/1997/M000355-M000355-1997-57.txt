 GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from Washington pointed out, today's huge news that the Supreme Court has struck down essentially most of the issue advocacy language in the McCain-Feingold bill, maybe we shouldn't waste our time talking about this. But if you look at the original bill, it was designed to shut down campaigns, shut down parties, and shut down issue advocacy, and the Senator from Washington pointed out the only entity exempt from this would have been the press which enjoys a specific exemption under the Federal Election Campaign Act.  In fact, I have it here for our viewers if they want to look, section 431(9)(B), subsection 1:       Any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed      through the facilities of any broadcasting station,      newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless      such facilities are owned or controlled by any political      party, political committee, or candidate;  In other words, a blanket exemption for the press that no one else would enjoy.  I say to my colleague from Washington, just to ask a question, Westinghouse owns CBS, Disney owns ABC, and GE owns NBC. Now, these big corporate giants in America will, through the ownership of these television broadcast networks, enjoy a total exemption from all the restrictions that would be placed on the political speech of everybody else. This is not an unrealistic hypothetical. We just saw Ted Turner, who used to control CNN, declare on Friday he would not sell ads to a certain group because he did not like what they were saying.  So I ask my friend from Washington if he could speculate with me for a moment the mischief that might be created by the ownership of the only exempt avenue to engage in free and unfettered political expression without the heavy hands of the Federal Government, what kind of mischief he might imagine could happen in our country?
