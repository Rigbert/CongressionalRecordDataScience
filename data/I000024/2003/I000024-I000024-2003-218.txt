 I was trying to get across with just a prelude, if you will accept that. There are several of us here who are not attorneys and who are certainly not great legal minds. As we look at this, I recall, though, another hearing, the origin of filibuster dealing back with the days of civil rights. And what comes to my mind is, as I have been listening to these questions being asked and the objections to Miguel Estrada by the minority--correct me if I am wrong--that the filibuster was created and maintained for some civil rights legislation in the first place. Is that correct?
