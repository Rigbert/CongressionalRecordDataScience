Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of Mr. Lowell E. Enslen. I can truly say that Lowell is a dedicated, distinguished and committed citizen. I have known him since 1973, and besides the practice of law he has been one of the most caring people involved in his community. Lowell has practiced law in Hammond and has served the community for over 50 years, including dedicated service to many charitable and civic organizations. His career as a lawyer has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people. For many years Lowell has helped with the induction of new citizens in cooperation with the Federal District Court of Hammond, Indiana on the Fourth of July. Mayor Thomas McDermott showed his appreciation and gratitude for the lifetime of service of Colonel Lowell E. Enslen by proclaiming July 4, 2004 as Colonel Lowell E. Enslen Day.  Lowell E. Enslen was born in Gary, Indiana in 1927. He attended Hobart public schools and Valparaiso University. Lowell was admitted to the American Bar Association in 1952.

Lowell has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. Before and during his service to the Hammond Community, Lowell served America honorably as a soldier and an officer in the United States Marine Corps, rising to the rank of Colonel. He is a member of Enslen, Enslen & Matthews Law Firm, which was established in 1960.

Along with his many other accomplishments, Lowell has received numerous certificates and awards.  Lowell has demonstrated his faithfulness by his extraordinary service to Enslen, Enslen, & Matthews and his community through his hard work and self-sacrifice. Although Lowell has served on numerous committees and has dedicated his time to Enslen, Enslen, & Matthews, he has never neglected to provide support and love to his family.  Mr. Speaker, Lowell E.
