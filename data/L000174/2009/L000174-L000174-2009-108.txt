 The benefit, though, only applies to public safety officers employed by Federal, State, and local government entities.  With volunteers providing emergency medical service to many communities all across the country, my amendment would remedy this gap in the P-S-O-B program by extending benefits to cover nonprofit EMS personnel who provide critical prehospital care.  We have been working to address this gap in the Federal program for some time, and the tragic loss earlier this year of Dale Long--a decorated EMT from Bennington, VT--reminded everyone that first responders of many uniforms literally put their lives at risk every day.  These brave emergency professionals never let their communities down when a call comes in, and no one ever asks the lifesavers at an emergency scene whether they work for the Federal government, a State government, a local government, or a nonprofit agency. My amendment will erase that unnecessary distinction from the P-S-O-B program.  I would like to thank a number of first responder groups--including the American Ambulance Association, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Fraternal Order of Police--for their assistance on this matter. I also would note that this amendment is fully offset and cosponsored by Senator Sanders.  I hope the Senate can move quickly to approve this amendment, and I yield the floor.
