Speaker, tonight I come to the floor with a heavy heart because Ohio has lost one of her favorite sons on the 4th of July. I have asked for this time to say a few words on behalf of the people of our great State on the life of Anthony J. Celebrezze, Jr., who died of a heart attack last Saturday at age 61.  Tony had just finished a heated race in his replica 1937 Chevy at a speedway in central Ohio. He loved competition, he loved turning a wrench, and he loved getting behind the wheel of his Legends car.  No one would have known that he came from one of the most distinguished political families in Ohio history.  Tony's father, Anthony J. Celebrezze, was mayor of Cleveland for 5 years and then served in President John F. Kennedy's cabinet as Secretary of what was then called Health, Education, and Welfare.  Tony was a graduate of John Marshall High School in Cleveland and went on to the U.S. Naval Academy class of 1963. He served 5 years in the Navy and earned the Naval Commendation Medal.  He received his law degree from Cleveland State University and launched his successful political career in 1974, winning election to the Ohio Senate.  In 1978, he was elected Secretary of State and served one term. In 1982 he won the election as Ohio's Attorney General and won reelection in 1986. Tony was a very popular Ohio figure. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1990.  As Attorney General, Tony Celebrezze won accolades for his efforts to protect consumers and the environment. He made our State a better place.  As the Columbus Dispatch noted, what those of us who knew Tony remember most about him was his decency, his warmth, and his humanity.``Celebrezze,'' the Dispatch said, ``may not have won every race he entered, but he was a winner in every way that counted: as a man and as a public servant.''  He will be missed by his fellow Ohioans, as we extend our condolences to the Celebrezze family, his widow, Louisa; his 5 children, Anthony, III, Catherine, Charles, David, and Maria; his sisters, Jean and Susan and their husbands.  Mr. Speaker, I will enter into the Record this warm tribute that was written by the Columbus Dispatcher by Michael Curtin, along with a longer news story that details the accomplishments of this decent, community-minded family man whose intellect and good heart raised the character of our beloved State.  As the articles state, as Ohio's chief law enforcement officer, Celebrezze negotiated a landmark court judgment against the U.S. Energy Department, giving the State the right to regulate nuclear and chemical waste at the Feeds Materials Production Center in Fernald, near Cincinnati. He also brought the first criminal prosecutions under Ohio's hazardous waste laws, expanded consumer protection, and helped bring the DARE program to Ohio.  Mr. Speaker, I know that my time has almost expired, but let me just end by saying the words of the Dispatcher editorial: ``At a time when civility in politics seems virtually nonexistent, Celebrezze is remembered fondly by his many friends on both sides of the political fence.''                              {time}  1945  He understood that politics is a contact sport, but he never adopted the win-at-any-cost philosophy that does permanent damage and creates permanent enemies.  Though his death came far too early, the date on which it occurred, Independence Day, is fitting considering how much of his life was devoted to service to his State and our Nation. Tonight we honor American patriot Anthony J. Celebrezze of Ohio.               [From the Columbus Dispatch, July 6, 2003]Anthony J. Celebreeze Jr.; Ohio's Former Attorney General Dead of Heart                               Attack at 61                    (By Mike Curtin and Joe Hallett)       Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., a former Ohio attorney general,      secretary of state and state senator, died Friday night of      cardiac arrest. He was 61.       Celebrezze, a lifelong fan of auto racing and part of a      Legends racing crew, was stricken after racing his replica      1937 Chevy sedan to a third-place finish at the Shady Bowl      Speedway in DeGraff, in southwestern Logan County.       Legends cars are five-eighths scale, fiberglass replicas of      1930s and 1940s NASCAR cars. Celebrezze's car was No. 63,      marking the year he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy.       Those who knew him best say Celebrezze was happiest when he      was around cars and racetracks. After leaving elective office      at the end of 1990, he devoted himself more to the sport.       ``He loved racing through and through. I don't think he      would have wanted to go any other way,'' said his son,      Anthony J. Celebrezze III. ``He enjoyed the daylights out of      it.''       ``When we were campaigning together and the subject of      racing would come up, he could go on and on about the fine      points of engines and transmissions and gear reductions,''      recalled Eugene Branstool, who ran for lieutenant governor in      1990 when Celebrezze was the Democratic nominee for governor.       After completing his eight-lap race in a preliminary heat      Friday, Celebrezze complained of feeling ill, said Wayne      Hill, a family spokesman.       ``He said he was going to go rest in the truck for a little      bit,'' Hill said. A short while later, his racing partners      found him dead. Celebrezze had no known history of heart      problems, Hill said.       Celebrezze was pronounced dead about 9 p.m. by emergency      medical personnel at the track, said Dr. Joshua Richards,      coroner of neighboring Champaign County.       ``A lot of drivers are going to be upset to hear the      news,'' said Tim Williams of Columbus, who competed both with      and against Celebrezze on the track.       ``Everybody liked Tony. Here was a guy who was attorney      general and who ran for governor, and yet he would do any      task. He would do the grunt work. He quickly became one of      the guys because he could talk the language. He knew the      technical aspects.''       Before losing the 1990 governor's race to Republican George      V. Voinovich, Celebrezze had risen steadily to become one of      Ohio's leading Democrats.       He began his political run in 1974 by winning election to      the Ohio Senate, representing western Cuyahoga County. In      1978, he was elected secretary of state, ousting Republican      Ted W. Brown, who had held the office for 28 years. In 1982,      Celebrezze won his first of two terms as attorney general.       As Ohio's chief law-enforcement officer, Celebrezze      negotiated a landmark court judgment against the U.S. Energy      Department, giving the state the right to regulate nuclear      and chemical waste at the Feeds Materials Production Center      in Fernald, near Cincinnati.       Celebrezze also brought the first criminal prosecutions      under Ohio's hazardous-waste laws, expanded consumer      protection and helped bring the DARE program to Ohio.       He was born into politics--the oldest of three children and      only son of five-term Cleveland Mayor Anthony J. Celebrezze      Sr. After serving as mayor from 1953 to '62, Celebrezze Sr.      was appointed secretary of health, education and welfare by      President Kennedy. From 1965 to '96, Celebrezze Sr. was a      judge of the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.       Paul Corey, a former teacher at Newton D. Baker Junior High      School in Cleveland, remembers the young Celebrezze ``being      badgered all the time if the garbage wasn't being picked up''      while his father was mayor.       ``Tony was a beautiful human being,'' said Corey, who now      lives in Columbus. ``What you see was what you got. He was a      good, very quiet, well-mannered young man.''       Celebrezze graduated from John Marshall High School and      entered the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1963. He served      five years of active duty and earned the Naval Commendation      Medal. For many years thereafter, he served as a captain in      the U.S. Naval Reserve.       Celebrezze earned a master's degree in 1966 from George      Washington University and a law degree in 1973 from Cleveland      State University.       In June 1965, he married Louisa Staton Godwin of      Williamson, N.C. They met while both worked at the U.S.      Department of Defense. They are the parents of five children:      Anthony J. Celebrezze III of Columbus; Catherine Celebrezze      of New York City; Charles Celebrezze of Plantation, Fla.;      David Celebrezze of Leesburg, Va., and Maria Celebrezze of      Columbus.       Mrs. Celebrezze, a licensed social worker, is known for her      knowledge and appreciation of classical music. ``We have an      agreement,'' her husband said in 1999. ``I don't go to her      operas, and she doesn't go to the races.''       ``Actually, he did go to some of those (operas and      concerts),'' Celebrezze's oldest son said. ``And she (his      mother) went to a number of his races, although the only      thing she knew was that they were going around in a circle.''       Throughout his political career, Celebrezze had no closer      associate and friend than his chief of staff, William H.      Chavanne. They met in 1974, when Chavanne worked on      Celebrezze's state Senate campaign.       ``I think he'll be remembered as somebody who was always      concerned about doing a good job. He was hardworking and      smart. He tried to never leave a job undone.''       Voinovich, said Celebrezze's industriousness impressed      Republicans and Democrats: ``The thing that impressed me was      that he was so conscientious with the work he did in state      government.''       Voinovich, said he also noticed that Celebrezze, after      leaving government, continued to work for community and civic      causes.       Since 1991, Celebrezze has practiced law. For the past two      years, he practiced with the Columbus firm of Kegler Brown      Hill & Ritter. He founded the firm's national regulatory and      government-affairs area and was active in administrative law.       Celebrezze ``was a true mentor. He took a lot of younger      people under his wing.'' said law partner Kevin Kerns. ``He      also was a friend, a tremendously loyal individual.''       James M. Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic chairman from 1983 to '91,      said much of Celebrezze's political success stemmed from      being genuine.       ``Tony was a decent guy, and that came across,'' Ruvolo      said. ``In politics, you run into people you respect, but you      don't often run into people you respect and like. People      respected and liked Tony.''       Besides his wife and children, Celebrezze is survived by      his sisters, Jean Porto of Chevy Chase, MD., and Susan      Sullivan of Boston.

Celebrezze Jr.; Former Ohio Attorney General Served His                 State and Nation With Honor and Decency       Some sense of Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.'s, impact on Ohio      can be found in the electronic archive of The Dispatch, where      a search for his name produces more than 1,800 citations.       As a state senator, Ohio secretary of state and Ohio      attorney general, Celebrezze played an influential part in      Ohio's history between 1974 and 1990.       But only a few of those many news stories dealt with what      people remember most about Celebrezze, who died of cardiac      arrest on Friday at age 61: his decency, warmth and humility.       At a time when civility in politics seems virtually      nonexistent, Celebrezze is remembered fondly by his many      friends on both sides of the political fence. He understood      that politics is a contact sport, but he never adopted the      win-at-any-cost philosophy that does permanent damage and      creates permanent enemies.       Though his death came far too early, the date on which it      occurred--Independence Day--is fitting, considering how much      of his life was devoted to service to his state and the      nation.       After high school, he entered the U.S. Naval Academy, where      he graduated in 1963. He spent five years in active duty and      many more as a captain in the Naval Reserve.       Choosing a political career like his father, former      Cleveland Mayor Anthony J. Celebrezze Sr., the younger      Celebrezze entered public service with his election to the      state Senate in 1974 and continued with one term as Ohio      secretary of state and two as attorney general. In the latter      office, he expanded state regulations of the environment,      cracked down on polluters and enhanced consumer protections.       He was one of the state's leading Democrats when he lost a      hard-fought campaign against George V. Voinovich in the 1990      governor's contest.       Since then, Celebrezze had devoted himself to his law      practice and to his beloved hobby, racing Legends cars. He      had just placed third in a race at Shady Bowl Speedway near      DeGraff when his fatal heart attack occurred.       Celebrezze may not have won every race he entered. but he      was a winner in every way that counted, as a man and as a      public servant.                          ____________________
