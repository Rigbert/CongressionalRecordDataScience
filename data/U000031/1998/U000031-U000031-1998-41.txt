Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that I am introducing to address a very serious and growing problem in this country--tobacco use by our youth. I have long been concerned about the increasing number of teens--and increasingly younger teens--who start smoking every year. Every day, 3,000 teens begin smoking. Teenagers typically begin to smoke at 14\1/2\ and become daily smokers before age 18. We know that if individuals do not start smoking as teenagers, they will probably never smoke. For many thousands of Americans, discouraging teens from tobacco use and making it much more difficult for them to purchase tobacco products is literally a matter of life and death.  That is why I am introducing the ``Teen Tobacco Use Prevention Act of 1998.'' This legislation amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to keep tobacco products out of the hands of our nation's children, strengthen warning labels, and restrict tobacco product advertisements. Specifically, the legislation includes the following provisions:  1. Content and warning labels. Requires more complete product constituent labeling and increases the number, prominence, and strength of tobacco product warning labels on packages and print ads. Includes the requirement that the FDA promulgate a rule governing the testing, reporting, and disclosure of tobacco smoke constituents that the Agency determines the public should be informed of to protect public health. Prohibits the advertising of cigarettes and little cigars on media subject to FCC jurisdiction.  2. Statement of intended use. Requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailer advertising of tobacco products to include, after the product name, a statement of intended use as specified in the bill. For cigarettes, for example, the intended use statement is: ``Cigarettes--A Dangerous Tobacco Product Intended For Use Only By Persons 18 or Older.''  3. Vending machine sales. Prohibits the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products from vending machines, except in those locations in which the retailer or operator ensures that no person younger than 18 years of age is present or permitted to enter at any time. Includes a provision requiring the FDA to monitor compliance with the vending provisions for two years and to propose additional restrictions if there is evidence that young people are continuing to purchase tobacco products from vending machines.  4. Minimum age. Prohibits the sale or distribution of tobacco products to anyone younger than 18 years of age. Permits states to set a higher age. Requires retailers to verify that purchasers are 18 or older by checking identification that includes the bearer's date of birth and photograph for anyone 26 years of age or younger. Includes civil monetary penalties for the sale of tobacco products to minors. For the first offense, the FDA will send a letter to the violator describing the law, describing the violation, and describing the potential liability facing the retailer for subsequent violations. For the second violation, the penalty shall be $250. For the third, $500. The penalty will double in size for each subsequent violation.  5. Enforcement. States are required to strictly enforce restrictions on sales to minors and report annually on their progress in reducing such sales and the strategies they are or will be using. States are required to conduct random, unannounced inspections to ensure compliance. If states fail to comply, the Secretary is authorized to reduce their Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment allotments.  6. Individual cigarettes and packages of less than 20. Prohibits sales or distribution of either.  7. Sampling. Prohibits.  8. Distribution through the mail. Prohibits the distribution of tobacco products through the mail, except for mail order sales subject to proof of age requirements. Manufacturers or others who wish to distribute tobacco products through the mail must first file with the Secretary of HHS for approval of the system they will use to ensure that these products will go only to persons 18 years of age or older. The Secretary will review these sales after two years to determine whether minors are obtaining tobacco products through the mail. Imposes the same penalties as those imposed for sales to minors.  9. Tobacco product use reduction targets. Requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a benchmark rate of current tobacco use by children and adolescents, measure youth tobacco product use annually, and report this information to Congress three years from the date of enactment, together with recommendations for additional recommendations if rates are not substantially declining (declining at a rate that would produce a 35 percent or greater reduction in the rate of youth tobacco use five years from the date of enactment; at least 50 percent by the seventh year; and at least 80 percent by the tenth year).  10. Effective Date. January 1, 1999.  Mr. Speaker, I am introducing this legislation because I believe that reducing teens' access to tobacco products and desire to use them must be at the heart of any tobacco initiatives we consider this year. I am very open to suggestions for improvements in the legislation I am introducing today, and I am most interested in working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass meaningful tobacco control and reform legislation in this session of Congress.                          ____________________
