Chairman this amendment that I am introducing, which I will subsequently withdraw, expresses my concern about the committee's action to cap loan guarantees at $7 billion for new energy projects designed to reduce carbon emissions.  And before I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, I am going to ask the chairman to enter into a colloquy with myself, and I will also submit remarks from Mr. Towns, coauthor with me; as well as my ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Barton.  Mr. Chairman, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Congress authorized funding to provide loan guarantees for any technology which reduces carbon emissions. That was designed to help a vast array of technologies such as wind, solar, clean coal, ethanol, and nuclear. Your committee excluded new nuclear plants as one of the technologies eligible for loan guarantees under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. And as a supporter of nuclear power, I oppose that exclusion. I am concerned that this may delay new projects that are being planned, and I am hopeful that these concerns can be addressed when you reach a conference with the Senate.  I would also note that the authorization in the energy appropriation bill is just that, an authorization. No appropriation is required. It is a standard practice that Federal loan guarantee programs have an annual loan volume authorization in an appropriations billand that the program which is authorized in title 17 of the Energy Policy Act is unique. We must remember that it is self-financing and requires no taxpayer funds. Utilities that are building these plants will pay all of the costs associated with the program, including administrative costs of processing the loan guarantee applications and the credit subsidy cost of issuing the loan guarantee itself.  So, Mr. Chairman, I would like you to help us if you can address these concerns.
