I will be faithful to asking that question.  I say that with humor, but the gentleman knows that I believe this is an extraordinarily serious issue. The gentleman knows I agree with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Boehner, that we are losing jobs right now as a result of our failure to extend the authorization of the Export-Import Bank past June 30.  The gentleman knows I believe that 165,000 jobs are at risk. The Indian director of their export-import bank is quoted as saying in the paper, just the other day, that he believes they are going to pick up jobs and orders because of the failure of the Export-Import Bank to be reauthorized.  I think this is not something that is not real. It is a loss of jobs and a loss of competitive status for our country if we do not reauthorize this and do so as quickly as possible.  I will keep asking the question because I feel it is so very important to our country and to our competitiveness, but I appreciate the gentleman's faithfulness in his answer. I am hopeful that it will change.  Mr. McCARTHY. We will keep repealing ObamaCare.
