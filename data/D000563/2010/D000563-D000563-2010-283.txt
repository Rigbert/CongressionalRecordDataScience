President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 29; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that after any leader remarks, the Senate proceed to a period of morning business until 10 a.m., with the time equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that following morning business, the Senate debate the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 39 as provided for under the previous order; that upon disposition of the joint resolution, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 3081, the legislative vehicle for the continuing resolution; and that the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for the caucus meetings. Finally, I ask that any time during consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 39, morning business, recess, or adjournment count postcloture.
