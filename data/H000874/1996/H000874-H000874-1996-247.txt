Speaker, in ending, let me simply say that from time to time we lose individuals who are very special, very unique who have made an extraordinary contribution to their country and to their fellow citizens. Admiral Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda was one of those.  May God bless him, and may God keep and bless his family.                          ____________________
