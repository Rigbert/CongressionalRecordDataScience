Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the worst in recorded history, and supports the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant. Yesterday, I chaired a Helsinki commission hearing that examined the devastating consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. That hearing, Mr. Speaker, featured the ambassadors of Ukraine and Belarus, the two countries most gravely affected by the disaster. Professor Murray Feshback of Georgetown University and Alexander Kuzma of the Children of Chernobyl Relief Fund also provided sound scientific and medical details about the public health crisis that exists.  A decade ago, in the early morning hours of April 26, 1986, reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant exploded, releasing into the atmosphere massive quantities of radioactive substances. The highest amount of radioactive fallout was registered in the vicinity immediately surrounding Chernobyl, some 60 miles north of Ukraine's capital, Kiev. At that time, the prevailing winds were directed north to northwest, so that Belarus received some 70 percent of the total radioactive fallout. Subsequent shifts of the wind, and rainfall, affected northern Ukraine, southwest Russia and beyond, with excessive levels of radiation recorded in northern Scandinavia, various parts of continental Europe, and even as far away as coastal Alaska. Estimated total radioactivity from the blast was 200 times more radioactivity than was released from the atomic bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.  Ten years ago, Mr. Speaker, Chernobyl left its indelible mark on the world's consciousness. Given the monumental consequences of Chernobyl and its devastating toll on the environment and on the health of the surroundingpopulation, this disaster must neither be forgotten nor repeated. Indeed, Chernobyl can never be forgotten by those most directly affected. The tragedy is ongoing. And with each passing anniversary, we uncover more and more about its devastating impact and serious radiological, health and socioeconomic consequences, especially on the populations of Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.  Millions of people--including about 1 million children--in Ukraine, Belarus and western Russian were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation. Millions continue to live in areas contaminated to one degree or another. Children, in particular, have experienced alarming increases in thyroid cancer and other conditions. These trends have accelerated since the disaster and are expected to increase well into the future. In Belarus Gomel region, for instance, which was one of the hardest hit areas, thyroid cancer among children is at least 200 times that of preaccident. Scientists differ over the extent of Chernobyl-related diseases, but few deny that children have been hardest hit by the radiological aftermath. Given the devastating humanitarian, ecological and economic consequences, the resolution calls upon the President to support continued and enhanced U.S. assistance to provide medical relief, humanitarian assistance, social impact planning, and hospital development for Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other nations most heavily afflicted.  Because this disaster is the only one of its magnitude, there is much about its long-term health consequences we do not yet know. Among the most affected were the so-called ``liquidators'', the hundreds of thousands of people who worked to clean up after the accident. Many received substantial doses of radiation. Estimates vary on how many of them have died or become seriously ill. However, we must learn more about the health of those most affected by the disaster, especially the children who were exposed to substantial doses of radiation. The resolution encourages national and international health organizations to expand the scope of research of the public health consequences of Chernobyl. Such research could help not only those directly affected, but can also ensure that the entire world can benefit from the findings.  By supporting assistance and research efforts, we will be doing our part to help overcome the devastating legacy of Chernobyl. Unfortunately, there are still 15 RBMK, Chernobyl-type reactors still being utilized in the former Soviet Union, most of them in Russia. The international community can help Ukraine and Russia improve the safety of their nuclear reactors, especially since Ukraine relies substantially on nuclear power for its energy needs.  Mr. Speaker, one very important component of this resolution is that it urges Ukraine to continue its negotiations with the G-7 to implement the December 20, 1995 memorandum of understanding which calls for all nuclear reactors at Chernobyl to be shut down in a safe and expeditious manner by the year 2000. The resolution calls upon the President to support the process of closing Chernobyl as envisioned by the MOU.  The signatories to the MOU recognize the tremendous costs involved in closing down Chernobyl and its impact on a country undergoing the unbelievably difficult transition from communism to a market-oriented democracy. Ukraine devotes more of its resources to dealing with the Chernobyl aftermath than for its military. According to testimony from the Belarusian Ambassador, Belarus is compelled to spend year in and year out up to 25 percent of its budget to try to cope with the aftermath of Chernobyl. In response, the G-7 has thus far committed some $3 billion in loans and grants to assist with the closure of Chernobyl. Recognizing the country's dire energy situation, equally important is the G-7's broader cooperation with Ukraine to impose market discipline on its inefficient energy sector and make it more rational. Moreover, the MOU recognizes the implications--for the thousands of workers and their families--of closing the Chernobyl plant.  The Chernobyl nuclear disaster marks a tragic milestone in the history of Ukraine, Belarus, and the world. This week we commemorate the 10th anniversary of this nuclear explosion, one of the most bitter legacies of Soviet communism. The legacy has had tremendous and mounting human costs. Its environmental, medical, social, political and economic consequences continue to have a profound impact on countries in the region, especially on Ukraine and Belarus and western Russia, which bore the brunt of Chernobyl's radioactive fallout.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution which is also being introduced in the Senate is important and timely. I am joined by my colleagues Rep. Ben Gilman, Rep. Frank Wolf, Rep. Ben Cardin, Rep. Ed Markey, Rep. Matt Salmon, Rep. Bob Torricelli, Rep. Sander Levin, Rep. David Bonior, Rep. Richard Durbin, and Rep. Luis Guttierez in introducing this resolution and I urge our colleagues to support the measure.                          ____________________
