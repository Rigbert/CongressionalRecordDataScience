 President, I would like to share with my colleagues some recent developments on the pipeline safety legislation I introduced two months ago. I'm pleased to report that in the past week, we've made a lot of progress.  About 10 months have passed since a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, Washington ruptured--spilling more than 275,000 gallons of gasoline. That pipeline disaster killed three young people, and left thousands of people in my state wondering about the safety of the pipelines near their homes.  We can't undo what happened in Bellingham--it will never be the same. But we can make sure that what happened in Bellingham doesn't happen anywhere else.  There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across the country--bringing us the energy we need to fuel our cars and heat our homes. They run near our schools, houses and communities. We have a responsibility to make sure these pipelines are safe. And it is clear that the current laws are not sufficient.  That's why I introduced my pipeline safety bill back in January. Since that time, I have been meeting with the Administration, with Senators, safety officials, citizen groups, and industry representatives.  This week, I spoke at a national conference on pipeline safety here in Washington, D.C. It was hosted by the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, SAFE Bellingham, and the Cascade Columbia Alliance.  I can tell you that people all across the country are following this issue closely, they understand the problem, and they are calling for action.  I want to be clear. We cannot wait any longer--and we can certainly not let this year pass without improving our nation's inadequate pipeline safety laws.  The danger posed by aging, corroded pipelines is not going away. In fact, it's getting worse.  Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents, 325 deaths, 1,500 injuries. More than $850 million in environmental damage. On average there is 1 pipeline accident every day, and 6 million hazardous gallons are spilled every year.  In the two months since I introduced my pipeline safety bill, at least 20 states--almost half of the country--have experienced pipeline accidents. Let me repeat that. In just two months, 20 more states have had pipeline accidents.  Just last week there was a major pipeline spill in Maryland. The clock is ticking, and the list of affected communities is growing.  Back home in Washington state, there is a great deal of impatience that Congress has not acted on pipeline safety measures. This editorial by the Bellingham Herald--from April 5th--gives you a good sense of how many of my constituents feel.  It's titled, Wake Up, Pipeline Bill Is On The Way. It's addressed to Congress, and it says, in part:       Don't know if you had a chance to look at our pipeline      bill, but we're sending you a message. We want you to hear us      loud and clear.  And later it says:       * * * even though what happened in Bellingham could happen      in any one of your home states, we feel you aren't giving      this issue much attention.  As this editorial says--these accidents can happen in any of our states. I don't want another community to go through what the people of Bellingham, Washington have gone through. We can make pipelines safer today.  My bill addresses five key areas of pipeline safety: My bill will expand state authority over pipeline safety. My bill will improve inspection and prevention practices. My bill will invest in new safety technology. My bill will expand the public's right to know about problems with pipelines. Finally, my bill will increase funding to improve pipeline safety by providing funds for new state and federal pipeline safety programs.  I'm proud to say that we are making progress. And I want to share with you some recent developments.  Yesterday, Senator McCain announced that he has scheduled a hearing on pipeline safety for May 11, and he has committed to marking up a pipeline safety bill by the end of May. He also introduced his own pipeline safety bill.  As you may recall, in February, I sent a letter to Senator McCain asking for a hearing. Last week, I spoke with him in person about it, and he pledged to work with me on this issue. As he told me, ``this is the right thing to do.''  I would like to commend Senator McCain for moving the process forward. I would also like to share with the Senate the important work done by the parents of the young people who were killed in the Bellingham explosion, especially Mr. Frank King. On Tuesday, Mr. King met with Senator McCain's staff, and in bringing his own personal story to the Senate--he has helped move this legislation forward.  I'm pleased today to become the Democratic sponsor of Senator McCain's bill. This bill contains many of the elements of the legislation I introduced back in January. The bill also includes some of the good elements of the Administration's proposal, which was introduced this week.  Senator McCain, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, has done a service to our nation and the state of Washington by providing his leadership on this important topic.  During the committee process, I hope we can all work together in a bipartisan manner to make the McCain-Murray bill even more effective at improving pipeline safety. There is still a long way to go, and I look forward to working with Senator McCain on this important issue.  Another step forward took place this week, when the Clinton/Gore Administration sent its pipeline safety proposal to Congress. Working with us, the Administration has crafted a proposal which includes many of my priorities: It places a clear value on the importance of safety. It strengthens community ``right to know'' provisions. It improves inspection standards. It invests in research and development for inspection devices. And it increases penalties for safety violations.  This proposal is a good first step, and now we will work to improve it. Clearly, there are some differences on the partnership with states provisions and other areas, and I will be working to strengthen them within the legislative process. I should add that the Administration's bill has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Hollings and Sarbanes, and in the House by Representatives Shuster, Oberstar, Franks, and Wise.  I want to commend the Vice President, who learned about this issue when he was in Washington state. He recognized the importance of pipeline safety, and he has been working to prompt the Administration to act quickly. I also appreciate the work Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has done. Shortly after the explosion, he stationed a pipeline inspector in Washington state.  So clearly we are making some progress, but there is still much more to do. Unfortunately, the Senate leadership has not expressed a lot of interest in pipeline safety.  I recently received a note from the majority leader's office--listing almost 50 bills that he has deemed ``Legislative Calendar Items'' which he hopes to consider prior to the August recess. Pipeline safety was not on his list. Now, I know priority lists are flexible, and I hope we can get a pipeline safety bill through the committee and onto the Senate floor for consideration before August.  We need to pass a pipeline safety bill, and we need to do it now. I again ask my colleagues to stand with the thousands of people who have been adversely affected by pipeline disasters and pass a bill that will make sure no other community has to suffer from another pipeline disaster.  We have a strong pipeline safety bill. We have Administration support. And we have a commitment from the Commerce Committee leadership to pass legislation this year.  This is our chance for safer pipelines, for safer communities, and for peace of mind. We have a bill. It's up to this Congress, this year to make sure this opportunity doesn't pass us by.                          ____________________
