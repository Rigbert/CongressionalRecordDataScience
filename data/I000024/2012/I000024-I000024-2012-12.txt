And the point I am making here is we don't need to do that when we have our own here.  I understand there is a difference of opinion on this, and there are a lot of emotions. I saw in this morning's Roll Call magazine all the people lined up here with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. It doesn't say anything in the article, but it certainly attacks the emotions of individuals.  So I am not satisfied they would not interfere or through their clarifications could change the intent. And even if they don't, we have taken care of our problem here.
