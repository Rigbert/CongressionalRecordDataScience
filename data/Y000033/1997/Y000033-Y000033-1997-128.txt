Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 1420) to amend the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 to improve the management of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:  Senate amendments:       Page 4, line 11, after ``a'' insert ``wildlife-dependent      recreational use or any other''.       Page 11, line 19, strike out ``and''.       Page 11, strike out lines 22 and 23 and insert ``fish and      wildlife agencies during the course of acquiring and managing      refuges; and       ``(N) monitor the status and trend of fish, wildlife, and      plants in each refuge.''.       Page 15, line 8, after ``use'' insert ``, except that, in      the case of any use authorized for a period longer than 10      years (such as an electric utility right-of-way), the      reevaluation required by this clause shall examine compliance      with the terms and conditions of the authorization, not      examine the authorization itself''.
