 The focal point of the dignified but unassuming room is an information desk, with a big board behind it that's used to post the daily schedule for Delaware's Superior Court. It is, quite literally, where the Court meets the public, and it was the ideal--and perhaps the only--place for this particular occasion, a reception honoring Judge Vincent A. Bifferato as he retired following 32 years on Superior Court, a total of 36 years of public service.  ``Biff,'' as Judge Bifferato is universally known outside of the courtroom, is not the type for a country-club send-off. Part of it is roots. His father, born in Italy and never having had an education himself, always said he knew his son would go to college, and got to see his son sworn in as a member of the Delaware Bar. Biff remembers his father on that day, sitting in the front row, crying; ``To him,'' Biff says, ``it was the American dream.''  And Biff knew, as his life since he became a lawyer has proved, that there is a second chapter to any true American dream story. It's the chapter written after you get there, the story of what you do with power and status once you've got them. And the truth is, it's the part of the story that matters most.  What Biff has done in his position as a judge is to combine the forceful exercise of authority and the vigorous application of the law with an uncommon sense of compassion for and responsibility to the people he was there to serve. He had never forgotten what drew him to public service in the first place--the opportunity to help people who need government, people who need someone on their side in order to have a chance. And he has never let those of us around him forget it either, always reminding colleagues and students--and anyone else who might need to be reminded--of our particular obligation to the least powerful of our fellow citizens.  Biff's concern for how people treat each other is, in fact, the hallmark of his character. In his courtroom, small-town lawyers from one-person firms knew they stood on equal footing with heavy-hitters from the big city. Litigants and witnesses were treated withfairness and respect. Decorum and civility were not ideals but practiced standards.  Biff initiated a monthly forum for lawyers because he saw that solo practitioners and young attorneys from small firms were not getting the mentoring they needed, and also, as he said, that ``[t]here was a need for people to be nice to each other.'' That effort to promote professionalism and ethics--one lawyer described it as a ``blue-collar Inn of Court''--is now called the Judge Bifferato Superior Court Trial Practice Forum. And for his leadership in that undertaking and in countless others, formal and informal, Biff received the inaugural Distinguished Mentoring Award from the Delaware State Bar Association.  As Resident Judge for New Castle County, Biff also made it his mission to ensure that the courthouse staff was appreciated as it should be. His emphasis was never on hierarchy but always on the common effort, never on the power or prestige of his office but on the contribution of each person who helped make the justice system work. It was the Court's staff Biff talked about most at his retirement reception, concluding simply, ``I love them all.''  ``Love'' is a word heard often in relation to Vincent A. Bifferato. It was striking how often it was used at his retirement. Alongside words more expected at such occasions, like respect and esteem, ``love'' for Judge Biff was expressed by almost every speaker, including the Governor, the Mayor and the President Judge of the Court. No amount of ability, no standard of professionalism earns that kind of affection; it is, rather, a response to this man's grace of spirit, to the warmth and sincerity he brings to relationships, to the openness of his heart.  That heart was on generous loan to the Superior Court and to the people of Delaware, but it belongs, first and always, to Biff's family--to his wife, Marie, to his children and grandchildren, to his sister and to his mother, who was there, sitting in the front row, 37 years after that first swearing-in ceremony. She had always been proud of him, she said, long before any of his public accomplishments and contributions, because he was always ``a nice, young boy.''  Biff remarked at his send-off that it was ``a hell of a tribute for just doing your job.'' But it was, of course, much more a tribute to who he is, a ``nice, young boy'' who made the most of his opportunities and then sought relentlessly to open opportunity for others; a leader who not only recognizes but genuinely feels his common humanity with those in need of help; a man who fulfilled and enriched his father's dream--for his family and for all of us.  Biff will have a successor but never a replacement. As he begins to write the next chapter of his life, he has our immeasurable thanks and, indeed, our love.                          ____________________
