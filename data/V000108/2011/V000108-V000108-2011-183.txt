Speaker, it is with great sincerity that I take this opportunity to honor and congratulate Ronald E. Powell, who is celebrating fifty years of service with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) Local 881. For nearly five decades, Ron has dedicated his life's work to the American Labor Movement and has been able to touch the lives of countless workers, families, and communities across the nation. In honor of Ron's fifty years of service, a celebratory reception will be held on June 16, 2011, at Gibson's Steakhouse in Chicago, Illinois.  Ronald Powell began his career with the UFCW in 1961 when he was hired on as a Field Representative for Local 881. Because of his true dedication and strong leadership skills, he was promoted in 1968 to Field Staff Supervisor, and was then appointed Vice President/Director of Field Operations in 1973. In 1983, Ron's hard work and success led him to become President of Local 881. Under Ron's leadership, Local 881 has become an exemplary organization, providing exceptional service in the areas of work-site representation, membership services, benefits, communications, and activities.  In addition to his impressive career with Local 881, Ron serves as a Vice President on the UFCW International Executive Board, and is a Vice President for the Illinois State AFL-CIO. Ron also currently serves as a Trustee for the UFCW Midwest Pension Benefits Fund. In 2010, he was appointed by Governor Pat Quinn to serve on the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority Board. Ron is also a past member of the Board of Directors for the International Employee Benefits Foundation and is the former Chairman of the Illinois State Investment Board. Ron's passion and unwavering devotion to the UFCW and its members is unmatched and he is to be commended.  Ron selflessly gives of his time to many charitable organizations and has been a dynamic force in promoting the union's involvement in numerous civic endeavors. He has been a tremendous asset to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and has helped to raise funds to facilitate research toward fmding a cure. He also initiated fundraising campaigns for the Jackson Park Hospital and the Little City Foundation and is a former board member for the United Way of Illinois and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. Although Ron has served the UFCW and his community with complete dedication, it is his commitment to his family that is most impressive. Ron and his wonderful wife, Lois, have four beloved children and twelve grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Ronald Powell as he is honored for his lifetime of service and dedication to the UFCW, as well as the state of Illinois, Northwest Indiana, and communities nationwide. Ron's complete dedication and uncompromising loyalty are to be admired and he is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
