Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Indiana State League of United Latin American Citizens [LULAC] as it hosts a reception in honor of LULAC national president, Belen Robles, tonight, September 26, 1997, at the Empress Casino in Hammond, IN. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Indiana LULAC State officers, Maria Pizana, Vicki Lipiniskis, Terry Serna, Andrew Martinez, Amelia Velez, and Louise Martinez, for the leadership they have displayed in organizing this special event. This marks the first time the Indiana State LULAC has honored a National LULAC President.  Founded in 1929 in Corpus Christi, TX, LULAC was established to protect the constitutional rights and freedoms of Hispanic-Americans. Over the years, LULAC has improved the social and economic status of Hispanics through its activism in the areas of equal justice, housing, employment, and education. By 1954, LULAC had earned recognition for winning two landmark civil rights cases, which served to integrate the Orange County, CA school system, and secure jury duty rights for Mexican-Americans in Texas. Since that time, LULAC has worked hard to achieve full access to the political process for all Hispanics, as well as equal educational opportunity for Hispanic children. LULAC councils across the Nation work toward this goal by holding voter registration drives and citizen awareness sessions, sponsoring health fairs and tutorial programs, and raising scholarship money for the LULAC national scholarship fund. In addition, LULAC's activism has expanded to include the areas of language and cultural rights. In response to a recent increase in anti-Hispanic sentiment, LULAC councils have fought back by holding seminars and public symposiums on language and immigration issues. The Nation's oldest and largest national Hispanic civil rights organization, LULAC continues to be a strong voice in the struggle for equal opportunity for Hispanic-Americans.  The Indiana State LULAC has faithfully worked to fulfill the National LULAC mission through a strong commitment to community and education. The Indiana LULAC emphasizes the protection of civil and human rights for Hispanic citizens and immigrants, and it strives to achieve this goal by educating the Hispanic community. Extremely youth oriented, Indiana LULAC hosts annual career days and college fairs, provides numerous educational workshops and seminars for students, and offers several leadership training opportunities to students. In addition, Indiana LULAC continues to award scholarships to academic achievers throughout the State and, to date, has awarded over $200,000 in college scholarships. In the future, the Indiana State LULAC aspires to open a LULAC National Education Center, which would provide counseling and tutorial services, scholarships, and low-interest loans to help Hispanic students attend college.  Belen Robels, the first female LULAC national president, has brought a new vision to LULAC. Belen, who works for the U.S. Customs Service, strives to structure LULAC more like a business in order to bring about a greater continuity within the organization. As a result, she has developed a 5-year strategic plan, which will establish a full-time national executive director for LULAC's Washington, DC office. In addition, LULAC is embarking on a membership campaign with the ambitious goal of increasing its current membership of 110,000 to 1 million members. As a law enforcement officer, Belen is knowledgeable about immigration issues, and she uses this knowledge to ensure that Hispanics will receive protection under current immigration law. In addition to her work with LULAC, Belen Robels is on the board of the El Paso Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, vice-chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, and she serves on the Federal Better Relations with Mexico Committee. In 1967, Belen Robles received a bronze Chamizal Medallion from President Lyndon Johnson in recognition of her efforts in the Cabinet-level hearings on Mexican-American affairs in El Paso, TX.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the national and State of Indiana LULAC organizations for their tremendous efforts in uniting Hispanic-Americans. All involved in the success of these organizations should be proud of their efforts in working toward equality for Hispanic-Americans.                          ____________________
