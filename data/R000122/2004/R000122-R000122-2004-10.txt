I commend the chairman for continuing his efforts.  I just point out, all this might be coincidental. General Kern retired on Saturday, I believe. I hope the report and response is ready and en route to the chairman. I hope he, too, agrees with me that this is not an issue that we can ignore.  I must say also this is not just an Army issue. I think there was a tendency initially to portray this as the aberrant behavior of young soldiers. As we now know, there was much more complicated and high-level involvement. What involvement is still unclear, but we cannot walk away from this issue. And because the next Secretary of the Army will have so much authority with respect to reports, with respect to reviewing at least court-martial proceedings or involved in these decisions, this issue has to be addressed. And that is one of the major challenges I think Dr. Harvey will address, I hope, if he is confirmed.  Let me again conclude by thanking the chairman not only for his leadership but for the gracious way he has helped today to illustrate these issues and to assist me in my presentation. I thank him. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Virginia.
