President, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 40, a resolution of disapproval of the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to the implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The rule in question would require the Social Security Administration to send to the Attorney General the names of certain beneficiaries for inclusion in the NICS background check database and would make it illegal for these beneficiaries to own or possess a firearm.  In matters where the government is promulgating regulations limiting the Constitutional rights of Americans, it is especially important that the regulations be drafted carefully. I am concerned that this rule targets individuals with mental illness without requiring the Social Security Administration to determine that the individuals whose rights are being limited are dangerous either to themselves or others. As a result, this rule inadvertently reinforces an unfortunate and inaccurate stereotype that suggests that most individuals with mental illness are violent.  Rather than focus on whether the beneficiary presents a danger, the rule instead turns on beneficiaries' ability to manage their finances. Because of this, the rule includes a test that could lead to absurd and unfair results. Under the rule, two individuals could present the exact same condition and symptoms, but if one of them required assistance with their financial affairs, that person would be reported to the NICS background check system, while the other would not.  I hope that the Social Security Administration will consider these suggestions as well as the comments from my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, and others, and promulgate a new rule. Addressing these concerns would result in a more effective rule, consistent with Constitutional requirements, which would make Americans safer while protecting the rights of those living with mental illness.
