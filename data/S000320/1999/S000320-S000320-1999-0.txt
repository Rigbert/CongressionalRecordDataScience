 I note that this language on special access programs was added after the bill was passed by the Senate. I wish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not wish to clarify that the legislative intent of this provision does not include expanded information relating to intelligence operational activities or sensitive sources and methods.  I ask for the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's clarification regarding the companion section in the State Department Authorization bill, section 1131. Am I correct in understanding that this provision does not levy the same requirement upon the Director of Central Intelligence that is required of the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Commerce?
