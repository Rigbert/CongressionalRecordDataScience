  I make very clear the first $1 million is exempted. That causes a problem for the Senator from Massachusetts. I am embarrassed to present a bill to the Senate of the United States that says a millionaire is going to be protected from bankruptcy court if he can pay his bills.  Now the Senator from Massachusetts raises a very legitimate point. There could be a catastrophic illness that could eat up a lot of the money, even $1 million, presumably. We have even taken that into consideration; that is, we have an interest of justice exception that would be applicable in this case. So something over $1 million could be exempted. I hope the Senator from Massachusetts realizes we have gone through this last year. We tried to accommodate the Senator from Massachusetts. We had a compromise I was embarrassed to accept in the sense that a $1 million exemption is way too high for my background. But I did it because I thought it was important we move this legislation along. We are talking about just preserving in the bill before the Senate a compromise worked out last year that would be law today except for a pocket veto by President Clinton. Otherwise, this Senator from Massachusetts wants to strike that compromise, and he was part of that compromise. I guess I beg him to stick by his compromise.  I yield the floor.
