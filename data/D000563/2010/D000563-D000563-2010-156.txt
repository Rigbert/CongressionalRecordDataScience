President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 8:15 a.m. on Saturday, December 4; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of the House Message on H.R. 4853, the legislative vehicle for the tax cuts, as provided under the previous order.
