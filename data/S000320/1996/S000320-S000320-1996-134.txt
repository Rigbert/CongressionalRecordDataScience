 President, the Wyden amendment contains direct spending and revenue legislation which would increase the deficit by $85 million for the period 2002 through 2006.  At this point, I raise a point of order, pursuant to section 202 of House Concurrent Resolution 67, the concurrent resolution of the budget for the fiscal year 1996. I raise the budget point of order.
