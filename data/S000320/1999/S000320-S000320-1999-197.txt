 President, I rise today in support of the resolution that I offered yesterday with Senator Sessions and many of my colleagues which recognizes the 30th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing.  Mr. President, for thousands of years, men looked to the sky and were fascinated by the moon. To our forefathers it was a source of wonder, hope, curiosity and fear. Near enough to draw their attention, yet so far beyond their reach to remain a constant mystery, the moon was an unattainable destination for the people of earth.  Undaunted by the significance of the task, President Kennedy called upon our nation ``to commit itself to achieving the goal . . . of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.'' With this challenge, a goal that had previously exceeded the grasp of every generation, became the mission of the United States to achieve within ten years.  Facing this great endeavor, the men and women of the American Space Program set to work with steadfast conviction. While their efforts produced steady results, there were tragic losses and technical setbacks that tested their resolve. Brave men gave their lives. Brilliant men and women spent countless hours trying to work through the numerous difficulties associated with such a complex undertaking. However, all remained dedicated to the goal of landing a man on the moon.  On July 20, 1969, 30 years ago yesterday, that goal was achieved. On that day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin closed the timeless breach that had separated the earth from the moon and landed on the Sea of Tranquility. With Neil Armstrong's first step on the lunar surface, the American Space Program met the awesome challenge set by President Kennedy. This important event marks America's ascendance to the preeminent role that it occupies today as the world's leader in space exploration.  While yesterday was an important anniversary for all the people of the world, it was especially important for the people of the United States. Landing men on the moon represents a great triumph of American endeavor. As the Spanish could be proud for having built the great ships that carried Columbus on his voyage of discovery, American scientists and engineers can feel equally proud for having built the Saturn V Rocket, the vehicle that carried the astronauts to the moon. That no other nation has produced a similar vehicle is a testament to the unparalleled achievement of our Space Program.  This resolution celebrates the anniversary of the great achievement of landing men on the moon. It celebrates the efforts of the many men and women who defied the odds and helped to make what was once believed to beimpossible, possible. Finally, it celebrates the courageous spirit of the American people.                          ____________________
