 It doesn't sound to me like the conservative Senator from South Carolina was using any power he had on the Judiciary Committee to hold up a person who has turned out to be very much a judicial activist. I would say even more remarkable, in regard to your statement, after September 1, 1980, the Senate confirmed 11 district court nominees and 2additional circuit court nominees, including Stephen Reinhardt, who has gone on to earn a reputation as one of the Nation's most liberal jurists. The other post-September circuit court confirmation was that of Stephen Breyer, who at that time was Senator Kennedy's chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee.
