He came to Congress, as I did, in 1983. There has been a dramatic and palpable change in the atmosphere on Capitol Hill in that period of time. I know he can remember in the early days when there was real civility between the political parties and real dialogue and parties at night. We went to dinner together even if we fought like cats and dogs on an issue on the floor.  That has changed. The well has been poisoned by the obsession with negative politics. I think that is one of the reasons the American people are checking out. They said if that is the best that can be done, you professionals in the business, we would just as soon stay home and watch professional wrestling. Occasionally professional wrestlers are involved in politics. The point they make is they don't approve of what is happening as we sink to lower and lower depths in the Democratic or Republican campaigns.  I agree with the Senator from Nevada. If one can't say something honest and complimentary about someone across the aisle without another person looking for a political advantage, that is a sorry commentary on the state of political affairs in America.
