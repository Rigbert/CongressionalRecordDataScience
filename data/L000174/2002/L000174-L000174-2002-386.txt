President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment by Senator Carnahan to retroactively renew family farmer bankruptcy protection and make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code. I commend Senator Carnahan for her continued leadership in protecting family farms across the country.  Unfortunately, too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in bankruptcy courts across the country since Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code expired on October 1, 2001. Congress needs to move quickly to restore this safety net for America's family farmers.  This is the third time in the last year that this Congress must act to retroactively restore basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers because Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first passage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these lapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between foreclosure and farming.  In 2000 and into last year, for example, the Senate, then controlled by the other party, failed to take up a House-passed bill to retroactively renew Chapter 12 and, as a result, family farmers lost Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection for 8 months.
