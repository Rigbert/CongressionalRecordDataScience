. retirement system solvent for future generations.  WMU's proposal was the collaborative effort of four students from the University's Lee Honors College--Sam Demorest, Lauren Hearit, Ashley Horvat, and Brad Kent--with the guidance and encouragement of WMU Professor Susan Hoffmann. The proposal submitted by the WMU team was one of 41 entries submitted by schools in 17 states for the opportunity to travel to Washington and present their ideas before Members of Congress. The iOMe Challenge asked college students across the country to think, analyze, and propose a solution addressing the issue of retirement for future generations. The WMU team analyzed every potential aspect of what life in retirement could be four decades from now and collaboratively put together a proposal that directly meets the challenges that lie ahead. The Western Michigan University team's project was selected by an independent blue-ribbon panel who judged based on content, style, economic soundness, and accessibility to young Americans.  Certainly there are a number of proposals for going about preserving the retirement system, and I have been deeply impressed by the recommendations of the team at Western Michigan. Their objective analysis of our current system and common retirement preparation practices, including each aspect's strengths and weaknesses, is sound and pragmatic. The adaptability within our current system allowed these students to provide cost cutting solutions that actually raised benefits for all Americans, while ensuring the system's long-term viability.  With a steadily aging population, significant reforms will need to be made to ensure the retirement system remains viable not only for today's retirees but generations to follow. To simply continue to kick this issue further down the road will only compound the problem for future American retirees. That is why this issue deserves constant attention from all Americans, especially younger generations who will be most greatly impacted. I commend these four students at Western Michigan University for their leadership in taking up this difficult issue, in order to show that our nation's future leaders will not be ignored when we discuss possible solutions regarding our future retirement problems.  Once again, congratulations to the team at Western Michigan University. You make your university, state, and nation very proud.                          ____________________
