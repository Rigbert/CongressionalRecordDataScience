Chairman, my amendment does not alter the substance of the bill, it simply clarifies it further. First, to clarify and ensure consistency in interpretation, it simply amends one phrase in the bill's stay provisions in Sec. 3(c) to track language used in the bill's pleading requirements in Sec. 3(d). Second, it replaces Sec. 4(5)(c) with language making it clear that the term ``qualified civil liability action'' does not include an action brought under the Federal Trade Commission Act or the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  I believe that this change satisfies the objections that the Committee on Energy and Commerce levied against the bill.  I would urge the Members to support my clarifying amendment.
