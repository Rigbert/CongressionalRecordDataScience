  I further say to my friend from Iowa, in the years I have been in the Senate, the only time anyone has tried to get rid of the entire filibuster was back in 1995 when such a measure was offered by the other side of the aisle.  Interestingly enough, the principal beneficiaries of getting rid of the filibuster in January of 1995 would have been our party because we had just come back to power in the Senate, yet not a single Republican, not one, voted to get rid of the filibuster. Nineteen Democrats did, two of whom, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry, are still in the Senate and now arguing, I guess, the exact opposite of their vote a mere 10 years ago.
