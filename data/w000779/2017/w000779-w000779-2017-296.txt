It was factual and very specific, and I think it really highlighted so many of the concerns that we have at this point.  I want to see if I could get this straight on the opioid issue. Here you all are in New Hampshire, right in the center of the Presidential campaign. All of the candidates are coming through, and they are practically trying to outdo each other in terms of their pledges to deal with this wrecking ball that is the opioid addiction that has swept through New Hampshireand, of course, my own home State as well.  I remember then-Candidate Trump being particularly strong and assertive about how he was going to fight opioids.  I think what my colleague said--and I am curious, so I am going to ask a couple of questions because I don't think folks even in my home State are aware of some of these things. So I am going to ask my colleague about it.  Are folks in New Hampshire aware at this point--my colleague put up that Trump chart, showing how the people didn't know what was being cut and how much it was going to cost and all the rest. Are people in New Hampshire at this point aware of the fact that this is essentially after a campaign in their home State, which certainly put out a lot of TV commercials and campaign rhetoric in the fight on opioids?  I think my colleague said that when people unpack this, they are going to see that this is a major broken promise, that TrumpCare is a major broken promise on opioids because, in terms of the time sequence, they all had debates and commercials, then we finally got some money in order to have treatment.  And I think what my colleague said is that now, as a result of TrumpCare and the cap on Medicaid, there will not be the funds to get the treatment to people who are so needy. Is that what this is going to be about in New Hampshire?
