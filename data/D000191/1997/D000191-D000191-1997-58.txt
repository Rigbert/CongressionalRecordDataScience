Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Members will want to listen. This debate occurred late last night. It is confusing and they need to know what is happening. The gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] offered an amendment to the DeFazio-Petri amendment, which on its face would seem to restrict the expenditure of funds on the Animas-La Plata project, which a majority in this House voted last year to not fund.  The Animas-La Plata project, and many of my colleagues have heard of it, is a proposed $400 million plus water project with a .36 to 1 cost-benefit ratio. It is purported to provide a settlement to tribes. It does not. It is purported to do many other things it does not. But it does spend a lot of money.  What we did, Petri-DeFazio, last night was offered an amendment to say, no more funds should be expended on this project which has even been abandoned by its proponents. Its proponents have offered an alternative. The alternative has not had any hearings. It is not authorized. It has not been reviewed by the Bureau of Reclamation. That is progress. They have admitted this $440 million boondoggle should not go forward.  What the Fazio amendment actually does is require that that project go forward. If read carefully, it starts out with a limitation, but what it does is limit funds to be expended for current authorized purposes, which is the $440 million Animas-La Plata project, which even the proponents now admit should not go forward. There is almost $9 million unspent at the Bureau of Reclamation, more than enough to go forward with the planning process, more than enough to develop an alternative.  Surely it cannot cost more than $8 or $9 million to have a planning process and develop an alternative to this project that will meet the obligations to the tribes and be more responsible.
