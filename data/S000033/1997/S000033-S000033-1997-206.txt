 Speaker, for the benefit of my collegues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Schrupp. It is estimated that between 100 million and      200 million children of the world under the age of 15 work.      The concern is for children exposed to hazardous working      conditions, for those who are exploited and endangered      mentally and physically. These children make barely or under      subsistence level wages and work without any proper benefits      or hope of receiving an education. This education can lift      them out of their present state of living and this is the      education that is not available to them.       This is not a new phenomena, one that has recently become a      priority for global consideration and global course of      action. Unicef's 1997 report on the state of the world's      children has focused specifically on the problem of hazardous      child labor. Western media has started informing Americans of      the conditions of soccer ball workers, soccer ball assemblers      in Asia, rug makers in Pakistan, glass makers in India and      textile workers in Asia and Central America. These workers      are children hired for their low cost and expendable nature,      their small fingers, and their inability to organize or      question.       The fact that some of these children are working for      American-based transnational companies has put the pressure      on these companies to discontinue condoning the practice of      child labor. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's      report on the apparel industry and codes of conduct,      corporate codes of conduct under business guidelines      prohibiting the use of child labor are becoming more common      as consumers as well as religious, labor and human rights      groups are increasingly calling upon companies to take      responsibility for the conditions under which the goods they      sell are being manufactured.       Codes of conduct for American industries such as sports      equipment and textile manufacturers are essential to stopping      the importation of goods made by child labor either correctly      or indirectly. Huge and popular names like Disney, Gap, Nike,      Getz, Arizona, Eddie Bauer, and Gitano have been directly      linked to overseas and in some cases national sweatshops      where they can take advantage of the cheap and hard working      supplies of local labor.       The most obvious examples of overseas sweatshops owned by      American-based companies are the Maquiladoras of Central      America where textiles are manufactured. 15-year-old girls      who work in the Maquilas of Honduras tell how they're forced      to take birth control bills on a daily basis and are required      to pay for an expensive abortion injection if they do become      pregnant. These girls are not allowed to leave each day until      they fill a production quota. If a rush order for clothes      came in, observers would note these girls entering the      Maquilas at 7:00 a.m. and not returning until sometimes as      many as 23 hours later. That's a 23-hour workday.       In China, Indonesia, and Pakistan, sporting equipment used      in the United States is manufactured by child laborers.      Jonathan Silvers wrote the following report in the Atlantic      Monthly on soccer ball factories in Pakistan. No amount of      preparation could have lessened the shock and revulsion I      felt on entering the sporting goods factory in the town of      Sialkot where scores of children, most of them aged five to      ten, produce soccer balls by hand for about a dollar and 20      cents a day. The children work 80 hours a week in near total      darkness and total silence. A partial list of infractions for      which they may be punished is tacked to a wall near the      entrance. It's a document of dubious utility. The children      are illiterate. Punishments are doled out in a storage closet      at the rear of the factory. There children are hung upside      down by their knees, starved, caned or lashed. The punishment      room is a standard feature of a Pakistani factory, as common      as a lunchroom at a Detroit assembly plant.       Eighty percent of the soccer balls sold in the United      States are imported from Pakistan. These are the same soccer      balls that were used in the 1996 summer Olympic games and all      professional sporting events. The Fowl Ball Campaign, a      campaign launched by a coalition of non-governmental      organizations, cannot prove that any soccer balls      manufactured in Pakistan are not made by children.       Still, these reports show only a fraction of the picture.      Most cases of child labor do not involve western companies      but occur in domestic households unseen and unregulated. The      more sinister forms of child labor such as child prostitution      and the virtual slavery of bonded labor are often far removed      from western markets and influence. They remain a national      issue for these developing companies, many of which protest      sovereign rights to run their nation's factories as they see      fit. Most of the time, however, the children are employed at      ages ruled illegal even by their country's governments.       For this reason, the United States needs to take      responsibility for more than direct involvement with child      labor. Countries, companies, and non-governmental      organizations around the world are working together to not      only eliminate child labor but to create conditions in      developing countries which will prevent the exploitation of      children.       The Convention on the Rights of a Child was signed into      international law by the United Nations in 1990. It is the      most widely ratified treaty in history signed by all but     six members of the United Nations General Assembly. The      Convention expresses the conviction that children have      rights, the same full spectrum of rights as adults, civil and      political, social, cultural and economic. The United States      is one of the six countries that has not yet signed this      Convention.       American taxpayers' dollars are used to fund free trade      zones which contribute to an environment of poverty for the      people of developing countries. It is this kind of      environment that supports the exploitation of children by      national, international companies. Often a free trade zone      means no corporate taxes, no income taxes, no regulations and      no unions. GAT and the World Trade Organization are      influenced heavily by the U.S. and it is here that the United      States must take some responsibility for the fact that they      support organizations which do not recognize child labor as a      relevant issue.       Other organizations which receive support from the United      States are the World Bank and the International Monetary      Fund. These organizations are responsible for massive      government adjustment into developing countries. The      structural adjustment programs primarily consist of spending      cuts that hurt social and educational programs. These cuts      hurt the lower classes of the country and make the cycle of      child labor all the more difficult to break. It is a cycle,      one perpetuated by poverty and employees willing to exploit      the poor and the helpless.       The greatest setback for these children is their lack of      education. Everyone agrees that the key to ending child labor      is in mandatory education legislation. This is important      because while many people express the need for economic      sanctions and boycotts, large-scale sanctions cannot be      imposed on developing countries until safe and productive      alternatives are developed for the children who would lose      their jobs.       What then is the solution to this problem? What can we do      to ensure that children are not exploited throughout the      world? There are many factors of influential power in the      United States. The most important one is the power of the      individual. The incredible accomplishments of NGOs, that's      non-governmental organizations, across the world were all put      into action by individuals who wanted to make a difference.      The death of child activist Icbow McSee sparked the birth of      Free the Children, an organization dedicated to children's      rights.       Free the Children is run by students ages 8 through 18. The      group of school children in Quincy, Massachusetts who raised      $144,000 to build schools and educational programs in      Pakistan in order to help fulfill Icbow McSee's uncompleted      dream is another example of this incredible power.       Even in the simple choices of the consumer, the individual      can make a statement about what methods of production they      will and will not support. Educating others about the      situation is also an individual source of power. The media is      a valuable tool in expressing individual opinion. Disney and      Gap in particular received enough negative publicity to      publicly embarrass the companies into amending their      production methods.       Bob Herbert wrote recently in the New York Times that Nike      is important because it epitomizes the triumph of monetary      values over all others and the corresponding devaluation into      peculiar interests and values we once thought of as human.      Corporations do not like to create this kind of name for      themselves.       Secondly, the pound of influence of the private sector      should not be underestimated. Transnational companies like      Rebok and Levi Strauss have been positive forces in using      safe and non-exploitive methods of production. All      corporations should adopt such codes of conduct as an      essential step towards eliminating child labor.       The government of the United States has the potential to be      a powerful force in the fight against child labor yet      presently the government does not seem to be taking the      appropriate actions necessary. If corporations can be called      on to adopt codes of conduct, the more (unclear) the      government of our country. The United States must sign a      convention on the rights of a child. The government must work      to regulate our nation's companies to ensure that child abuse      is not a human resource in our nation as well. The government      must include the basic rights of children as part of their      agenda when forming free trade zones and when interacting      with organizations such as the World Bank.       I call on the U.S. Government to take a stance, to show us      that hazardous child labor cannot be acceptable in any form      for any reason. The exploitation of the world's children is      an international crisis for democracy and justice and we need      to do our part.       Companies will go to the third-world countries where they      can hire and they want to hire children because they can work      faster and their hand-eye coordination is actually better      when they're, you know, aged between 12 and 15 and they don't      have to pay them anything. These people are being paid piece      wages about 12 cents a garment. If it's a choice between      paying someone 12 cents to make a garment in a place where      there are no environmental conditions, no social regulations,      nothing like that outside of the United States regular like      restrictions on companies, they don't need to follow any of      these rules.       Bonded laborers--Icbow McSee is actually an example of one      of these. Most of them are in Asia and China, Indonesia and      Pakistan. If a parent needs to pay off debts, what they'll      often do is they will sell their children to manufacturers      who will collect these children around the ages of sometimes      as young as four or five where they can never make any wages      because they spend their entire lives paying off the debt of      their parents, and often these children are made, forced to      stay in their factories by being chained to looms, especially      in the oriental rug market.                               ____________________
