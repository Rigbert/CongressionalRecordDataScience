Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), a member of the Committee on Armed Services.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. My thoughts and sympathies go to those who have lost family members and loved ones to this dastardly deed.  Yesterday morning, while I prepared to come to the hill, I watched in horroron the television as the World Trade Center burned.                              {time}  1945  Then a second plane I saw fly deliberately into the second tower. And as I was watching that, I heard of the third plane crashing into the Pentagon.  I, along with the rest of the Nation, was riveted to the news for the rest of the day. Words cannot describe the feelings I had as I saw those towers crumble. Through the immense devastation, I saw the efforts of many Americans to save and help those victims who were suffering so tremendously. Many of those heroes became victims themselves.  Mr. Speaker, I have heard a lot of talk since then about what we are going to do; but in the last few years that I have been here in Congress, we have suffered other terrorist attacks and all we have done is talk. This has to stop. This time, we have to retaliate; and we have to do so so strongly that no one will dare attack us on our homeland again.
