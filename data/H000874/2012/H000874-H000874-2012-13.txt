America expects it. America, more importantly, needs it.  The economy needs the confidence of a resolution of this stalemate, so I agree 100 percent with the gentleman. But let me say in terms of, again, one of the disquieting factors is we can't even act on that on which we agree.  Now, the gentleman and I disagree on a proposition, and that is the gentleman believes and cites a study, which we think is of questionable validity, that says we're going to lose jobs if we raise taxes on those above $250,000. We don't share that view, and most economists that I talk to don't share that view. But there is a study that the gentleman refers to that says that. I understand that. And what I'm saying is we can vote on that and some of us will agree and some of us will disagree.  But if we can't vote on it--let me call the attention to somebody who's certainly not a Democratic spinmeister, but I think the perception will be that what we are doing is holding the better off, if we can't help them, we can't help those who are not making as much money. I'm sure you're aware of David Brooks' column in The New York Times. He's not a liberal Democrat--or not a Democrat. I don't think he's a Democrat or Republican, but a moreconservative columnist. He says this, and I quote from The New York Times just a few days ago:       Sometimes you have to walk through the desert to get to the      Promised Land. A budget stalemate on these terms will confirm      every bad Republican stereotype. Republicans will be raising      middle class taxes in order to serve the rich--shafting Sam's      Club to benefit the country club. If Republicans do this,      they might as well get Mitt Romney's ``47 percent'' comments      printed on T-shirts and wear them for the rest of their      lives.  I use that quote not to criticize but to say that the perception, I think, is, if we do not act on something on which we agree, we are not doing so because we want to make sure that the best off, if they're not helped, nobody will be helped, and I think that's not good for the country. I think, frankly, it's not good for the Congress, not necessarily Republicans or Democrats. I think we're all perceived as either having the ability to act or not act. If we're going to get this fiscal cliff resolved, it will be because we agree on that which we can agree. Here, we do.  We have 167 CEOs who have written to us saying that the Business Roundtable agrees that we ought to move in this direction. Senator Corker said that just the other day. Others have said that as well. And I really don't think it's either a political ``gotcha'' or political advantage. I just think it will do what the gentleman talked about. It will give confidence to 98 percent of the American people who pay taxes that they don't have to worry on January 1 about their taxes going up. It seems to me that's a positive for our economy because it will give them confidence that they're going to have resources to do some of the things that will help our economy grow.  I understand the gentleman's position is that there will be 2 percent who won't have that confidence and 3 percent of small businesses who, as the gentleman points out, those 3 percent are relatively large businesses in the sense that that 3 percent gets 53 percent of the business income. He's correct. Those are large small businesses or, in many cases, individuals who just make a lot of money, and that's fine, but they're not the majority. I think job creators, in terms of the numbers of small businesses, are those who add one or two or three people to their rolls.                              {time}  1210  We can get off this, but I certainly will yield to the gentleman and hope that we can do that.  The reason you've gotten the suggestion of the two-bill strategy, or two-bill scenario, is because that gives everybody in the House of Representatives--and you talked about this particularly in 2010, but you've talked about it since then of giving the House of Representatives the opportunity to work its will. Two bills, if you move them forward, one which the President says he will sign, one which the President says he will veto--and after all, he's going to be our President for the next 50 months--we can get something done. At the same time, all 435 Members--or 433, I think we have presently--can express their views on those issues on which we have agreement and those issues on which we have a disagreement.  I yield to my friend.
