  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, I saw an extraordinary clip of President Trump at a fundraising event where he is accusing the intelligence agents who rightly reported his conduct of committing treason.  Let's see. Russia has invaded Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent.  He is jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States.  If anybody is committing treason, and I believe that is an impeachable offense, it is the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
