 President, first of all, I congratulate my colleague from Iowa and my colleague from Wyoming for the bipartisanship of this legislation.  The FDA amendments of 2007 mandated basic public results reporting for all clinical trials supporting FDA-approved drugs and devices. Clinical trials results help both patients and doctors understand the benefits and efficacy of a particular medical product.  Moreover, a July 2011 FDA report stated:       Understanding variable characteristics in clinical trial      sites is becoming increasingly important because of the      international nature of current clinical trials. The sources      of differences in efficacy results between the U.S. and      foreign clinical trials sites have yet to be determined, but      differences rooted in the conduct of the clinical trial      should be evaluated.  It has been 5 years since the passage of the FDA Amendments Act, and the National Institutes of Health is still in the process of writing proposed regulations. The clinicaltrials.gov program and title VIII of the FDA Amendments Act were considered major reforms and helped science information advances. If they are not being implemented well or adequately enforced, society will fail to reap the full benefits of the billions of dollars in good medical science research.  This amendment before the Senate will impose a deadline by which the NIH will finalize both the proposed and final regulations. Further, 2 years after the regulation has been in place, the Government Accountability Office will conduct a study on compliance with regulations and will look at, among other things, whether the applicable clinical trial is conducted domestically, in foreign sites, or in a combination of sites. The rapid increase in trials being run overseas makes it imperative that the Government Accountability Office investigate this matter.  Currently, ``80 percent of approved marketing applications for drugs and biologics contained data from foreign clinical trials.'' The ``FDA inspected 1.9 percent of domestic clinical trial sites and 0.7 percent of foreign clinical trial sites.'' We need stronger reporting requirements to ensure we understand what the implications are of this move to having so many trials conducted overseas. I encourage my colleagues to support this important amendment.  Before I move on, I wish to talk about another amendment I am a cosponsor of, which is an amendment offered by Senator Portman that will make dangerous synthetic drugs such as K2 and bath salts schedule I narcotics. I have worked for over a year now to get this legislation passed through the Senate after a constituent of mine named David Rozga committed suicide shortly after smoking K2 with some friends nearly 2 years ago.  I introduced the David Mitchell Rozga Act in March of 2011, and the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed it out of committee along with two other related bills sponsored by Senator Schumer and Senator Klobuchar last July. Since that time, the use of synthetic drugs has grown very rapidly, with the number of calls into poison control centers going from as few as 19 in the year 2009 to over 6,000 in the year 2011.  The House passed their version of this bill last December on a strong bipartisan vote, but one Senator has blocked consideration of this legislation in this Chamber up to now.  So I am grateful we are finally able to have a vote on this issue, and I urge passage of the Portman amendment as well.  Madam President, I wish to go to another amendment, if that would be appropriate at this time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Amendment No. 2121
