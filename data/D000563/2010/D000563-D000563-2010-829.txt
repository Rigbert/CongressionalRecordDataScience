 This is the Executive Calendar. It contains the names of the nominations the President of the United States has sent to the Senate for confirmation. It is an orderly process, a historic process. It has happened thousands and thousands of times. Very few times do we have a lot of controversy associated with these names. If there is a controversy, ultimately there is a vote--a debate, and then a vote.  But now there is a new approach being used by the minority side. That approach is to basically use one of three options: stall, stop, and kill. What they are trying to do, for the 104 nominations sent by President Obama, is to hold them on the calendar as long as possible so it is difficult for him to organize his administration and move forward.  There are some key positions. The one the Senator from Montana spoke of is the nominee for Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. We are concerned about the state of the American economy, our competition in the world, how we stack up against countries such as China.  There is an allegation, which I think is valid, that the Chinese are manipulating their currency so they continue to take jobs away from the United States. It gives them too big a competitive advantage. Here is the UnderSecretary for International Affairs who would be tasked with looking into that issue to try to help American businesses, small and large, and to save American jobs and this nomination now sits on the calendar with 103 others.  What you find is that of those 104 nominations, most of them went through the committees on their way to the Senate floor with unanimous votes or overwhelming majority votes. There is no controversy associated with it.
