President, the State Department has been working to promote regional cooperation in Northeastern Europe. The idea behind this policy is more fully to integrate the Baltic countries into Europe and overcome cold war divisions to promote stability in the region. I support this approach, and I want to see it institutionalized at the State Department by designating a senior-level official with responsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe.  This policy of integration also reduces tensions, since regional cooperation that includes Russia's northwestern regions gives Russia a stake in regional stability. The policy will alsoshow Russia that it need not feel threatened by the integration of the Baltic States into European institutions. The Baltic countries have increased their ties with the northwestern Russian regions, much the way Canada has ties with the border states of the United States. The Baltic States benefit as well from regional cooperation with the Nordic countries, further cementing the Baltic nations as part of Europe.  It is mutually beneficial for the all the Northeastern European countries to address regional problems, such as environmental problems caused by the former Soviet Union, or burgeoning crime and drug smuggling from the Russian mafia.  The Northern European Initiative announced in 1997 is just one example of this policy. It fosters regional cooperation and cross-border ties, relying on the private sector and nongovernmental organizations, as well as governments, in the areas of trade and investment, institution building, law enforcement, nuclear waste control, and the development of civil society, among others. Another positive step was the signing of the Baltic Charter in 1998 that strengthens Baltic bilateral ties and ties with the United States and addresses Baltic security concerns. Regional organizations have been set up, including BALTSEA, to coordinate military assistance, as well as several joint Baltic efforts at defense cooperation.  The State Department has set out on an ambitious agenda that I think is going in a very positive direction. However, I am afraid other crises and problems, for instance the many issues that will come up in Southeastern Europe following the crisis in Kosovo, will divert the Department's attention from this policy and cause it to lose steam. Therefore, I am offering this amendment to direct the Secretary to designate an existing senior-level State Department official with responsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe. The way this assignment of responsibility would fit in the State Department's structure is up to the Secretary.  I also want to make clear that I mean no criticism of the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs by proposing this amendment. On the contrary, I think he has done an extraordinarily good job in pursuing the integration of Northeastern Europe. But with all of Europe on his mind, I think it would only further the aims of the bureau to be sure that a senior-level official is designated to coordinate and promote this policy.  I appreciate the support of Senator Helms and Senator Biden, and understand that this amendment has been added to the manager's package.                           amendment no. 715       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:                    self-determination in east timor       Sec.  . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:       (1) On May 5, 1999 the Governments of Indonesia and      Portugal signed an agreement that provides for an August 8,      1999 ballot organized by the United Nations on East Timor's      political status;       (2) On June 22, 1999 the ballot was rescheduled for August      21 or 22 due to concerns that the conditions necessary for a      free and fair vote could not be established prior to August      8;       (3) On January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a      willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a      majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in the August      ballot;       (4) Under the May 5th agreement the Government of Indonesia      is responsible for ensuring that the August ballot is carried      out in a fair and peaceful way in an atmosphere free of      intimidation, violence or interference;       (5) The inclusion of anti-independence militia members in      Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in      East Timor violates the May 5th agreement which states that      the absolute neutrality of the military and police is      essential for holding a free and fair ballot;       (6) The arming of anti-independence militias by members of      the Indonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the      August ballot has resulted in hundreds of civilians killed,      injured or disappeared in separate attacks by these militias      who continue to act without restraint;       (7) The United Nations Secretary General has received      credible reports of political violence, including      intimidation and killings, by armed anti-independence      militias against unarmed pro-independence civilians;       (8) There have been killings of opponents of independence,      including civilians and militia members;       (9) The killings in East Timor should be fully investigated      and the individuals responsible brought to justice;       (10) Access to East Timor by international human rights      monitors and humanitarian organizations is limited, and      members of the press have been threatened;       (11) The presence of members of the United Nations      Assistance Mission in East Timor has already resulted in an      improved security environment in the East Timorese capital of      Dili;       (12) A robust international observer mission and police      force throughout East Timor is critical to creating a stable      and secure environment necessary for a free and fair ballot;       (13) The Administration should be commended for its support      for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor which      will provide monitoring and support for the ballot and      include international civilian police, military liaison      officers and election monitors;       (b) Policy.--(1) The President, Secretary of State,      Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury      (acting through the United States executive directors to      international financial institutions) should immediately      intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian      Government and military to--       (A) disarm and disband anti-independence militias;       (B) grant full access to East Timor by international human      rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;       (C) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return      to East Timor to participate in the ballot; and       (2) the President should submit a report to the Congress      not later than 21 days after passage of this Act, containing      a description of the Administration's efforts and his      assessment of steps taken by the Indonesian Government and      military to ensure a stable and secure environment in East      Timor, including those steps described in paragraph (1).                    self-determination in east timor
