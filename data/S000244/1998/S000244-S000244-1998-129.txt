Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words and insight of the gentleman from California (Mr. Brown). I think that we are quite proud of the fact, not only was this report completed on time and on budget, which we like to do in the Committee on Science, but also this is one of the first congressional initiatives on any major topic looking into the future that is our own product rather than a reaction from something that has come from the Executive Branch or private industry or the university.  I would like to see the Congress continue in this type of creative venture where we look at how we can better the type of quality of life that we will be bequeathing to our children and grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella).
