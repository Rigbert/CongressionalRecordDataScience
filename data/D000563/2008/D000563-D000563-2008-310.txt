We are trying, before we adjourn for the August recess, to deal with several outstanding measures: the housing bill, which is now back over from the House of Representatives to try to deal with America's housing crisis; the LIHEAP bill, which the Senator has said will provide for the elderly and disabled, help with their air conditioning and heating bills; the tax extenders, an important part of our energy picture so that we have our Tax Code friendly to those who want to promote solar power and wind power and similar renewable and sustainable sources; and, of course, we can't overlook the item that keeps us in through the weekend, the so-called Coburn package--relating to the Senator from Oklahoma--some 40 bills dealing with issues as serious as child pornography and missing children; these elements too.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, how is it conceivable we could have an open amendment process with an endless number of amendments, according to the Republican side, and possibly deal with all of these important issues?
