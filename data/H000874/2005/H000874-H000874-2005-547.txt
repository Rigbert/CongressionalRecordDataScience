I know that our leader and your office are working on that unanimous consent and the parameters of the consideration of, as you point out, a very, very important bill. There are obviously different points of view on the legislation.  I know we are going to be meeting Monday night and going to come in early Tuesday. Would you have a thought as to when, because of the importance of this bill, our Members want to be sure that they are here, as I am sure yours do as well, what time of day you would expect to be considering that piece of legislation?  Mr. DeLAY. In working with the minority leader's office and your office, there have been requests to accommodate some Members and start this debate early in the afternoon instead of early in the morning. I would, along with the unanimous-consent request, anticipate us working out an agreeable time, and I would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both sides.
