Speaker, yesterday, I introduced H.R. 5745, The Putting Main Street FIRST Act: Finishing Irresponsible Reckless Speculative Trading.  The bill would levy a miniscule 0.03 percent tax on stocks, bonds and derivatives, which will discourage irresponsible high-speed trades that have no intrinsic value and that destabilize the market, which were the driving factors of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2010 flash crash.  How much does a 0.03 percent tax cost per trade? It amounts to 3 pennies on a $100 trade.  How much does it raise? The Joint Tax Committee estimates the tax would raise $417 billion over ten years.  These funds can be used to fund national priorities like free higher education so college students aren't stuck in never-ending debt. It can be used for job-creating infrastructure investments, or other national priorities.  Raising much-needed revenue to help average Americans is a big plus, but my primary reason for my bill is to end unhealthy speculation in the market and bring it back into balance. My goal is to stop Wall Street from gambling with Main Street's money.  Opponents of a financial transaction tax have already rolled out their same tired arguments: American retail investors and retirees would get hit with higher administrative fees as brokerages pass the cost of the tax down to them.  The opponents haven't read my bill, or if they have, they are ignoring what's in it.  The fear-mongers have always said a transaction tax will destroy the market. The truth is the U.S. had a transaction tax from 1914 until 1966. In 1932, the transaction tax was raised. When the increase in the tax was proposed, various newspaper headlines screamed our markets would fail. Here are just two: ``Stocks Tax Called Peril to Exchange'' and ``Panic Threat Seen in Taxes.''  In 1932 the Dow Jones was at a low point of 41. In 1966, the Dow Jones was at nearly 1000 points. The sky did not fall.  The point is the large majority of trades today are made by computers with algorithms whose sole purpose is to execute thousands of trades in milliseconds to turn a quick buck.  Flash boys and high-frequency traders go so far as to locate their servers as close to an exchange as possible--all to gain a nanosecond head start of a trade price. How can average Americans compete with that? They can't.  It's time to stop irresponsible trading, time to level the playing field, and it's time to put Main Street FIRST.                          ____________________
