Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. I want to say before the gentleman leaves the floor, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) continues to be one of our ranks who I think is most focused on human rights throughout this world. He takes an extraordinary amount of his own time to visit, to learn and returns to the United States as one of the most powerful and effective voices on behalf of those who are being visited with atrocities and savagery on a regular basis. His voice is one of the strongest in the international community on behalf of protecting individuals and human rights. I congratulate him and am proud to be his colleague.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek).
