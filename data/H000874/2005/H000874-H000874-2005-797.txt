Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for the schedule.  With reference to the Real ID bill, Mr. Leader, can you tell us at this point in time the type of rule that that will be considered under; and, in particular, what amendments, not necessarily specific amendments, but whether amendments will be allowed, motions to recommit, and items of that nature.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I would assume that the Committee on Rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety of amendments. But I will let the chairman of the Committee on Rules make announcements on that and reserve decisions for the committee on what those amendments will be.  I can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating, although actions by the Committee on Rules will need to be taken, contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill, another must-pass piece of legislation, not knowing what that would be. But, obviously, the supplement could be a candidate for that.
