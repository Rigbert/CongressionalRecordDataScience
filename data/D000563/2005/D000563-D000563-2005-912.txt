It turns out, in my State of Illinois and in many other States, that the gun dealers who are the real wrongdoers, the ones who are abusing the system, are not the gun dealers selling in downstate Illinois, where I live, to the hunters and sportsmen and people who go to target ranges or want a gun for self-defense, the real perpetrators of crime or wrongdoing who are protected by this turn out to be a handful of dealers in my State who again and again and again sell guns that end up involved in criminal activity.  So I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, who are we trying to protect here when it comes gun dealers?
