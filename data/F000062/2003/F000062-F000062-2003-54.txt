 Brownback, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 79       Whereas, under the Extradition Treaty between the United      States of America and the United Mexican States, signed at      Mexico City May 4, 1978, and entered into force January 25,      1980 (31 UST 5059) (hereafter the ``Extradition Treaty''),      Mexico has refused to extradite unconditionally to the United      States fugitives facing capital punishment;       Whereas the Mexican Supreme Court ruled in October 2001,      that life imprisonment violates the Constitution of Mexico,      and Mexico has subsequently repeatedly violated the      Extradition Treaty by refusing to extradite unconditionally      criminals who face life sentences in the United States;       Whereas numerous individuals have committed serious crimes      in the United States, fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution,      and have not been brought to justice in the United States      because of Mexico's interpretation of the Extradition Treaty;       Whereas these individuals include the persons responsible      for the April 29, 2002, murder of Deputy Sheriff David March,      the July 17, 2000, killing of Officer Michael Dunman, the      August 29, 1998, murder of 12 year old Stephen Morales, the      April 9, 1999, attempted murder of Anabella Van Perez and the      subsequent August 26, 1999, murder of her father, Carlos      Vara, and the December 22, 1989, murder of Mike Juan;       Whereas attorneys general from all 50 States, the National      League of Cities, and numerous elected officials,      municipalities, and law enforcement associations have asked      the United States Attorney General and the Secretary of State      to address this extradition issue with their counterparts in      Mexico;       Whereas United States Government officials at various      levels have raised concerns about the extradition issue with      their counterparts in Mexico, including presenting a Protest      Note to the Government of Mexico objecting that Mexico's      interpretation of the Extradition Treaty is ``unsupported by      the Treaty'' and effectively ``eviscerates'' it, with few      positive results; and       Whereas the Extradition Treaty, as interpreted by Mexico,      interferes with the justice system of the United States and      encourages criminals to flee to Mexico; Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the      President should address Mexico's failure to fulfill its      obligations under the Extradition Treaty between the United      States of America and the United Mexican States, signed at      Mexico City May 4, 1978, and entered into force January 25,      1980 (31 UST 5059), by renegotiating the treaty or taking      other action to ensure that the possibility that criminal      suspects from Mexico may face capital punishment or life      imprisonment will not interfere with the unconditional and      timely extradition of such criminal suspects to the United      States.                                  ____
