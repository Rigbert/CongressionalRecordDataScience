Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind Members that the language in the bill constitutes the Hyde amendment of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. On average, approximately 72 percent of the money that is in the federal health plan system comes from the U.S. taxpayers, and the premium payers donate the remainder of that amount of money.  An earlier speaker spoke about violence. So let me remind you that many women are dying from so-called safe and legal abortions, as well. There are many of them. One recent mother-victim is the woman who was butchered by an abortionist in Arizona. This woman who died of a botched abortion by a totally legal, so-called reputable abortionist. She bled to death, so both mother and baby were the victims of that violence.  Let me again remind Members that approximately 40 million children have died from abortion in this country, a staggering loss of babies through dismemberment, chemical poisoning, and other types of poison shots.  Do not make us subsidize any more child killing.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey).  (
