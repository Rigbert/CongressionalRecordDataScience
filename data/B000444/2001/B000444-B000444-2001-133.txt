 President, I am pleased to once again join my distinguished colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, in introducing legislation to protect the world's significant tropical forests through ``debt-for-nature'' mechanisms. We have shared a long and fruitful bipartisan relationship on this important issue. I am gratified that we have the bipartisan support of our original cosponsors noted by Senator Lugar.  Tropical forests are a cornerstone of the global environment. Figuratively speaking, they are the ``lungs'' of our planet, and they can help to regulate and mitigate the process of climate change. They guide global patterns of rainfall on which agriculture and fisheries depend. They harbor pharmaceutical treasures that we are just beginning to explore. They are home our planet's widest diversity of plants and animals.  We have a responsibility, a duty, to be good stewards of these essential resources, and it is in our direct economic interest to see that they flourish.  In 1989, Senator Lugar and I coauthored the Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act, which was enacted into law as title VII A of the International Finance and Development Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-240, December 19, 1989). That Act authorized US AID to use its funds for Debt for Nature swaps. Under the authority of this Act, US AID has used $95 million of its funds to establish environmental endowments totaling $146 million in Costa Rica, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines.  President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI), carried forward this linkage between debt reduction and the generation of local funds to protect the environment. The EAI provided $876 million in debt relief and $154 million in local endowments at a federal cost of $90 million in seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, El Salvador, Jamaica and Uruguay.  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 extended the debt for nature mechanism of the EAI to the protection of significant tropical forests in lower and middle income developing countries throughout the world, not just those in Latin America and the Caribbean. Furthermore, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA), authorizes the use of two new, no cost ``debt-for-nature'' models, the Buy Back option and Debt Swap option.  The basic premise behind this series of programs has not changed over the years. Many of the world's important tropical forests are found in countries that do not have the resources to protect them. Their own patterns of economic development and their participation in the international economy place irresistible pressures on them to turn these irreplaceable global resources into quick local cash. One of the important contributors to those pressures is too often the debt those countries owe to us. That is one thing we can do something about.  The mechanisms in this bill will allow us to multiply the small dollar cost of writing the debt of those countries off of our books, leveraging substantially more resources to the cause of preserving tropical forests around the world.  I look forward to taking this bill up in the Foreign Relations Committee as soon as possible, and I fully expect it will continue to enjoy the strong support it has had in the past. I also look forward to working with the Administration to provide the funding that the President has called for to implement this program.                                 ______                                       By
