Forrest Faison, III, United States Navy, on his retirement after 39 years of honorable and dedicated service to our country. His unwavering commitment to those entrusted in his care will remain his legacy long after his departure.  For the past two years, I had the opportunity to work directly with Vice Admiral Faison in his position as the Navy Surgeon General. Throughout his tenure, he provided invaluable support to Congress, particularly its Members and committee staff as he presented the mission, vision, and execution of Navy Medicine for our country' s sailors, marines, and their families. As a fellow Northern Ohioan, I would like to share with you some highlights of his distinguished career.  For 39 years, Vice Admiral Faison excelled in his leadership and the training of medical professionals in America's Navy at home, sea, and abroad. He served as the Deputy Surgeon General of the Navy and Deputy Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, from 2013 to 2015, and as our 38th Surgeon General of the Navy.  As Commander of Navy Medicine West and Naval Medical Center San Diego, he was responsible for medical care and support to over 850,000 eligible beneficiaries with a staff of 16,000 at 10 hospitals and over 30 clinics from the West Coast to the Indian Ocean. He served as Deputy Chief, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery for Current and Future Health-care Operations; Commanding Officer, Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Commanding Officer, U.S. Expeditionary Medical Facility; and U.S. Medical Task Force, Kuwait, where he led a tri-service task force of subordinate commands and was responsible for all healthcare operations in Kuwait, Qatar, and Southern Iraq, including all medical logistics support throughout U.S. Central Command.  Additional assignments included Deputy Commander, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia; Group Surgeon, 3d Force Service Support Group, Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific; Director of Department of Defense Telemedicine, Washington, D.C.; Chief Information Officer, Navy Medicine; Director, Clinical Services, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan; Naval Hospital Lemoore; USS Texas (CGN 39); and Amphibious Group 3.  As Vice Admiral Faison closes this chapter of his life to embark on new adventures, I urge my colleagues to join me in extending our congratulations to him on his retirement. We wish him, his wife Michelle, and family, ``Fair Winds and Following Seas.''                          ____________________
