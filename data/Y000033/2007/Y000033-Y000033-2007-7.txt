Mr. Speaker, I'm amazed that the Democrats took so long to write such a bad bill. I would laugh if this was any laughing matter, but designing the Nation's energy policy is among the most serious responsibilities of the Congress. H.R. 6 has recklessly been designed by radical environmentalists to achieve many of their long-term goals, including significantly raising the price of energy used by Americans, vastly reducing American manufacturing and mining jobs, increasing federal control over rural Western communities, and reducing and further locking-up the use of our vast God-given coal, oil and gas, oil shale, and timber resources.  This bill reaches into every American's bank account and steals vast amounts of hard earned dollars. As a result of this bill, gasoline will be much more expensive, electricity in all areas of the country will go up with many areas with huge increases, home heating oil will continue to surge to record levels, and natural gas prices will literally go through the roof. This bill, a work of exceeding incompetence, is the greatest holiday gift to the OPEC oil cartel ever given by a sovereign nation.  Although there are a few provisions in this bill that are appropriate, the vast expanse of this bill is an abomination. If it becomes law, the Democrats who supported it will have to answer to the American people.
