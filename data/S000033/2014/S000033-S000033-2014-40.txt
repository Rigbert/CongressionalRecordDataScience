 President, on June 11--a month and a half ago--in a very strong bipartisan way, the Senate voted 93 to 3--an overwhelming vote--to pass legislation written by Senator John McCain, a Republican, and myself to address crises facing our veterans community and the VA and to protect and defend the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us. I wish to take this opportunity again to thank Senator McCain for his very strong efforts on getting that legislation passed.  As you know, the legislation we passed was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, to cost about $35 billion. At just about the same time, the House of Representatives passed legislation dealing with, more or less, the same issues, and the bill they passed in the House was estimated by CBO to cost $44 billion--$9 billion more than what we passed in the Senate.  In the last 6 weeks, my staff, my colleagues, and I have been working very hard to refine this legislation, to come up with a more reasonable pricetag, and to address the needs of our veterans community in a significant way. In that process, I have been accused by some of ``moving the goalposts.'' I guess I have. I have moved the goalposts so the legislation we are introducing today is substantially lower--substantially lower--than what passed the Senate and what passed the House. If that is called moving the goalposts, I suspect in this case it is moving the goalposts in a positive direction. In fact, the bill we are presenting would cost less than $25 billion--a lot of money, no doubt--but that is some $10 billion less than what we passed on the Senate floor, and it is $19 billion less than what the House passed.  Our proposal is a commonsense proposal which deals in a significant way with the needs of the veterans community. What it does is provide emergency funding for contract services so veterans can, when they find themselves in long waiting periods--as in fact is the case in a number of locations around the country--they can go outside of the VA and get private health care or care at a community health center or whatever. They no longer have to wait during this emergency period for long periods of time to get into the VA. I think that is a very important part of this proposal. It is something we have to do.  In addition, what we also say is if a veteran is living more than 40 miles from a VA facility--and there are veterans who in some cases are living hundreds of miles away--they do not have to, when they are ill, get in their car and travel for 3 or 4 hours to get health care at a VA facility. They will be able to go to a non-VA facility, a private physician, if they live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility. I think that is a significant step forward.  But what our legislation also does is address an issue of huge concern to the veterans community. Just yesterday--just yesterday--I received, and many members in the Veterans' Committee received, a letter from 16 major veterans organizations. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 23, 2014.     Chairman Bernie Sanders,     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,     Washington, DC.     Ranking Member Richard Burr,     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,     Washington, DC.     Chairman Jeff Miller,     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,     Washington, DC.     Ranking Member Mike Michaud,     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,     Washington, DC.       Chairman Sanders, Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Burr,      Ranking Member Michaud: Last week, Acting Secretary Sloan      Gibson appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee      to discuss the progress made by the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) over the past two months to address the health      care access crisis for thousands of veterans. Secretary      Gibson testified that after re-examining VA's resource needs      in light of the revelations about secret waiting lists and      hidden demand, VA required supplemental resources totaling      $17.6 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year through      the end of FY 2017.       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of      veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need      to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that      veterans can access the health care they have earned, either      from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge      Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that      fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary      Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any      compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or      $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred      obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet      both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by      expanding VA's internal capacity.       Last month, we wrote to you to outlining the principles and      priorities essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy      of which is attached. The first priority ``. . . must be to      ensure that all veterans currently waiting for treatment must      be provided access to timely, convenient health care as      quickly as medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable      to provide that care directly, ``. . . VA must be involved in      the timely coordination of and fully responsible for prompt      payment for all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress      must provide supplemental funding for this year and      additional funding for next year to pay for the temporary      expansion of non-VA purchased care. Finally, whatever actions      VA or Congress takes to address the current access crisis      must also ``. . . protect, preserve and strengthen the VA      health care     system so that it remains capable of providing a full      continuum of high-quality, timely health care to all enrolled      veterans.''       In his testimony to the Senate, Secretary Gibson stated      that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has already      reached out to over 160,000 veterans to get them off wait      lists and into clinics. He said that VHA accomplished this by      adding more clinic hours, aggressively recruiting to fill      physician vacancies, deploying mobile medical units, using      temporary staffing resources, and expanding the use of      private sector care. Gibson also testified that VHA made over      543,000 referrals for veterans to receive non-VA care in the      private sector--91,000 more than in the comparable period a      year ago. In a subsequent press release, VA stated that it      had reduced the New Enrollee Appointment Report (NEAR) from      its peak of 46,000 on June 1, 2014 to 2,000 as of July 1,      2014, and that there was also a reduction of over 17,000      veterans on the Electronic Waiting List since May 15, 2014.      We appreciate this progress, but more must be done to ensure      that every enrolled veteran has access to timely care.       The majority of the supplemental funding required by VA,      approximately $8.1 billion, would be used to expand access to      VA health care over the next three fiscal years by hiring up      to 10,000 new clinical staff, including 1,500 new doctors,      nurses and other direct care providers. That funding would      also be used to cover the cost of expanded non-VA purchased      care, with the focus shifting over the three years from non-     VA purchased care to VA-provided care as internal capacity      increased. The next biggest portion would be $6 billion for      VA's physical infrastructure, which according to Secretary      Gibson would include 77 lease projects for outpatient clinics      that would add about two million square feet, as well as      eight major construction projects and 700 minor construction      and non-recurring maintenance projects that together could      add roughly four million appointment slots at VA facilities.      The remainder of the funding would go to IT enhancements,      including scheduling, purchased care and project coordination      systems, as well as a modest increase of $400 million for      additional ``VBA staff to address the claims and appeals      backlogs.       In reviewing the additional resource requirements      identified by Secretary Gibson, the undersigned find them to      be commensurate with the historical funding shortfalls      identified in recent years by many of our organizations,      including The Independent Budget (IB), which is authored and      endorsed by many of our organizations. For example, in the      prior ten VA budgets, the amount of funding for medical care      requested by the Administration and ultimately provided to VA      by Congress was more than $7.8 billion less than what was      recommended by the IB. Over just the past five years, the IB      recommended $4 billion more than VA requested or Congress      approved and for next year, FY 2015, the IB has recommended      over $2 billion more than VA requested. Further corroboration      of the shortfall in VA's medical care funding came two weeks      ago from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which issued      a revised report on H.R. 3230 estimating that, ``. . . under      current law for 2015 and CBO's baseline projections for 2016,      VA's appropriations for health care are not projected to keep      pace with growth in the patient population or growth in per      capita spending for health care--meaning that waiting times      will tend to increase. . .''       Similarly, over the past decade the amount of funding      requested by VA for major and minor construction, and the      final amount appropriated by Congress, has been more than $9      billion less than what the IB estimated was needed to allow      VA sufficient space to deliver timely, high-quality care.      Over the past five years alone, that shortfall is more than      $6.6 billion and for next year the VA budget request is more      than $2.5 billion less than the IB recommendation. Funding      for nonrecurring maintenance (NRM) has also been woefully      inadequate. Importantly, the IB recommendations closely      mirror VA's Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP), which      VA uses to determine infrastructure needs. According to SCIP,      VA should invest between $56 to $69 billion in facility      improvements over the next ten years, which would require      somewhere between $5 to $7 billion annually. However, the      Administration's budget requests over the past four years      have averaged less than $2 billion annually for major and      minor construction and for NRM, and Congress has not      significantly increased those funding requests in the final      appropriations.       Taking into account the progress achieved by VA over the      past two months, and considering the funding shortfalls our      organizations have identified over the past decade and in      next year's budget, the undersigned believe that Congress      must quickly approve supplemental funding that fully meets      the critical needs identified by Secretary Gibson, and which      fulfills the principles and priorities we laid out a month      ago. Such an approach would be a reasonable and practical way      to expand access now, while building internal capacity to      avoid future access crises in the future. In contrast to the      legislative proposals in the Conference Committee which would      require months to promulgate new regulations, establish new      procedures and set up new offices, the VA proposal could have      an immediate impact on increasing access to care for veterans      today by building upon VA's ongoing expanded access      initiatives and sustaining them over the next three years.      Furthermore, by investing in new staff and treatment space,      VA would be able to continue providing this expanded level of      care, even while increasing its use of purchased care when      and where it is needed.       In our jointly signed letter last month, we applauded both      the House and Senate for working expeditiously and in a      bipartisan manner to move legislation designed to address the      access crisis, and we understand you are continuing to work      towards a compromise bill. As leaders of the nation's major      veterans organization, we now ask that you work in the same      bipartisan spirit to provide VA supplemental funding      addressing the needs outlined by Secretary Gibson to the      floor as quickly as feasible, approve it and send it to the      President so that he can enact it to help ensure that no      veteran waits too long to get the care they earned through      their service. We look forward to your response.           Respectfully,         Garry J. Augustine, Executive Director, Washington            Headquarters, DAV (Disabled American Veterans); Homer            S.
