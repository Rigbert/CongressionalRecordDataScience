Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) for recognizing this paperwork problem and drafting legislation to cut the red tape and to make sure that these payments are made to the appropriate beneficiaries in the earliest possible manner.  Let me tell the Justice and Treasury Departments that if I hear of any delay in expediting these payments, I am going to be all over their back just as the gentleman from New York and other Members of this House will be on their back as well. This has to be a priority, and this Congress is stating that this has to be a priority through the passage of this bill today.  I am very pleased to support the efforts of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler). And I am supporting it because I am an American and because this is the right thing to do.
