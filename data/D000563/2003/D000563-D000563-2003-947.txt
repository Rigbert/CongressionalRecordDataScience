Ibelieve it is unprecedented. We are asking for the writings of Mr. Estrada so we may know who he is. I don't think that is unreasonable.  There are three conceivable outcomes of the nomination. One is that there be a cloture vote called for by Senator Frist to try to bring an end to this debate on the floor. That is his right.  As I noted, there was a cloture vote called on Richard Paez, a Hispanic nominee of the Clinton administration. So it has happened before.  There could be a decision by Senator Frist to move this nomination back to the calendar. I think the best outcome would be that, finally, Miguel Estrada would be open, candid, honest, and not conceal what he truly believes about the state of law in America. If he is seeking a lifetime appointment to the second highest court of the land, that is the least we can ask of him.  Those are the potential outcomes. What I tried to do was circumvent even those three and say let's move to the economy, and maybe at some later time move back to Miguel Estrada. But the Senator said, no, we don't want to talk about the economic situation in America, about unemployment, about job loss and loss of consumer confidence, the biggest deficits in the history of the United States. We just want to talk about one judicial nomination. That is unfortunate.  I yield the floor.
