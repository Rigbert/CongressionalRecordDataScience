 But the bottom line for me is that in this great and wealthy country, we should be outraged that so many millions of families are still not latching on to the American dream despite the fact that they are working long and hard hours. Clearly an essential part of what the American dream is about is to have a decent house in a decent community.  We should also understand that, if my memory is correct, the banking industry right now is enjoying record-breaking profits. And I think, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) made very clear, because of acts of the United States Congress, banks have certain benefits, among other things, the FDIC, which guarantees the money that is in those banks.And banks, therefore, have a responsibility to their communities and many banks understand that.  But essentially, if this institution, the Congress, is to mean anything, we have got to stand up for those people who are not earning huge sums of money, those people who are not living on the mansions on the Hill. We have got to address the needs of senior citizens and working families who are paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing.  As my colleague the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Vento) indicated, the CRA in fact has been an extremely successful program. It has done what it is supposed to do. It has created affordable in Vermont and throughout this country. It has helped small business create decent paying jobs.  We must stand firm against anyone in this institution who wants to weaken a program that has worked so well for working families in this country.
