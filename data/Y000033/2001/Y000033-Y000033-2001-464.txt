Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleagues, Congressman J.D. Hayworth of Arizona, Congressman Dave Camp of Michigan and Congressman Chris Cannon of Utah to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). This legislation has been drafted with the input of the Association on American Indian Affairs, Tanana Chiefs Conference, National Indian Child Welfare Association, National Congress of American Indians, tribal attorneys and the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys. It has always been my intent to have all affected parties participate in the legislative process in the drafting of ICWA amendments.  In 2001, we still have American Indian and Alaska Native children being adopted out of families, tribal communities and states. We continue to have this problem in Alaska and I have been asked to introduce ICWA amendments to further clarify ICWA.  Specifically, the bill details jurisdiction of child custody and child adoption proceedings that involve an Indian child.  The bill has a couple of specific provisions which outline jurisdiction in Alaska since Alaska is not a reservation state (outside of Metlakatla). The bill states that an Indian tribe in Alaska shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the State of Alaska over voluntary and involuntary child custody proceedings involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled in Alaska. Additionally, a person seeking to adopt an Indian child in the State of Alaska, may file an adoption petition at any time in the tribal court of the Indian child's tribe. If the tribal court agrees to assume the jurisdiction over the proceeding, that tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction and no adoptive placement or proceeding can continue in the state court.  The bill makes conforming technical amendments conditioning an Indian tribe's existing right of intervention.  It clarifies that State and tribal courts are required to accord full faith and credit to tribal court judgments affecting the custody of an Indian child in ICWA child custody proceedings, and in any other proceedings involving the determination of an Indian child's custody, including divorce proceedings.  It clarifies that ICWA applies to voluntary consents to termination of parental rights and voluntary consents to adoptive, preadoptive and foster care placements.  It clarifies and adds exacting details on setting limits on when an Indian birth parent may withdraw his or her consent to an adoption.  It clarifies that tribe's are to receive notice of voluntary adoptive placements of Indian children and details the content of notice when an Indian child is placed for an adoption.  It clarifies in detail the intervention by an Indian tribe and sets specific time frames for intervention by a tribe in the voluntary foster care placement proceeding and voluntary adoptive proceeding. It also requires tribes to show why it considers a child to be covered by the ICWA.  It provides for a detailed notice to parents when a child is placed for adoption.  It provides detailed requirements for resumption of jurisdiction over child custody proceedings.  It imposes criminal sanctions on any individual, group or association who knowingly conceals whether a child is an Indian child or whether a parent is an Indian.  Finally, the bill provides further clarification of the definition of ``Indian child'' and ``Indian child's tribe'' as applied in child custody proceedings.  I think it is appropriate that Congress further clarifies the ICWA to ensure that American Indian and Alaska Native children are not snatched from their families or tribal communities without cause. In a recent July 1, 2001 article in the San Antonio Express News, the story stated that ``This year, the head of the Child Welfare League of America offered American Indians something they have longed to hear for more than three decades: an apology for taking American Indian children.'' (San Antonio Express News, Sunday, July 1, 2001 Article ``Torn from their roots; The unfortunate legacy of the Indian Adoption Project is that it has separated many Native Americans from their culture'').  ``It was genuinely believed that Indian children were better off in white homes,'' said Terry Cross, Executive Director of the National Indian Child Welfare Association. (San Antonio Express News, Sunday, July 1, 2001 Article).  That changed in 1978 when Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act. ``Even now, Cross cites problems. Sometimes social workers are not properly trained to identify children as Indian. Or agencies fail to notify tribes of adoptions''. (San Antonio Express News, Sunday, July 1, 2001 Article).  I believe that these FY 2001 ICWA amendments to be acceptable legislation which will protect the interests of prospective adoptive parents, Native extended families, and most importantly, American Indian and Alaska Native children.  The Committee on Resources will seek additional input from the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services. I am hopeful that these agencies will again embrace this legislation so that we can affirm this country's commitment to protect Native American families and promote the best interest of Native children.  I urge and welcome support from my colleagues in further clarifying the ICWA to ensure no more American Indian or Alaska Native children are lost.                          ____________________
