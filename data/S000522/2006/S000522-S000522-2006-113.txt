Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding me time and thank him for the job he has done on this very important legislation.  Mr. Chairman, this morning I had the privilege of joining First Lady Laura Bush, Ambassador Tobias, Dr. Kent Hill at an event announcing Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal as the newest countries to be added to the President's Malaria Initiative, $1.2 billion over its 5-year program. Mrs. Bush also announced Admiral R. Timothy Ziemer as the new U.S. Malaria Coordinator.  I think Members should be aware if they are not already that every 30 seconds an African child dies of malaria moreover about 1.2 million people die each year, mostly in Africa, from this preventable disease.
