President, I wish to inform my colleagues about why I would object to a unanimous consent request to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill or any other legislation that may contain a provision undoing or modifying a straightforward law establishing congressional accountability for the Total Information Awareness Program.  Just this past February, as part of the fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate considered, debated and adopted unanimously an amendment sponsored by myself and Senators Feinstein, Reid, Boxer, Corzine, Leahy, Cantwell, Harkin, Levin, Durbin, Biden, Daschle, and Clinton. That amendment requires specific congressional approval for any deployment of technology developed by the Defense Department's Total Information Awareness Program; the Defense Department must seek authorization and appropriation for any deployment of the TIA technology to another agency or department. DARPA may continue to research and develop TIA technology as long as it submits a report required by the amendment. The report is due May 20, 2003, and it requires an explanation of the intended and actual use of funds for each project and activity of the TIA Program, the schedule for proposed research and development of each project and activity and target dates for the deployment of each project and activity. The report will also address the efficacy of systems such as TIA in predictive assessments of terrorist capabilities and plans, the likely impact of the TIA Program on privacy and civil liberties, the laws that will require modification to use the TIA Program and recommendations for eliminating or minimizing the adverse effects of the TIA Program on privacy and other civil liberties.  The TIA technology will give the Federal Government the capability to operate the most massive domestic surveillance program in the history of our country. It will put the financial, medical and other details of America's private lives at the fingerprints of tens of thousands of bureaucrats. The American people have the right to know if the federal Government intends to deploy this technology against them, when it will do and how, and Congress should preserve its oversight over the program. The amendment enacted in February provides that accountability.  Just last week the American people got a painful reminder about the shameful abuse of power and secrecy in the McCarthy era, and are rightfully wary about the protection of their privacy. In fact, although some in the Defense Department and elsewhere claim they are only interested in mining ``lawfully-collected'' information, just about any piece of information about any U.S. citizen can be ``lawfully'' collected or obtained by the federal government. It is for these reasons that I will object to any motion to proceed to any legislation affecting the Total Information Awareness Program unless and until I have fully reviewed it to guarantee that the accountability in the TIA amendment is preserved.                          ____________________
