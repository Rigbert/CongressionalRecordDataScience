Mr. Speaker, I was on the bridge from Selma to Montgomery. I almost lost my life on March 7, 1965, because I was fighting for the right to vote, to open up the political process. I do not know, maybe the gentleman has changed his ways or maybe he has seen a different light, but that is the effect of this legislation. It will destroy the heart and the very soul of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
