 President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a great contributor to the State of Washington and to the national science and education communities. Dr. Len Peters recently stepped down as the Director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA. Fortunately, Dr. Peters has agreed to remain in Richland, working for Battelle Memorial Institute to help promote and build education and community projects.  PNNL, a DOE national laboratory, experienced tremendous growth during Dr. Peters' tenure. The lab added 330 new members to its world-class staff, enabling the facility to better serve the Nation in the areas of renewable energy, national security, and environmental research. Dr. Peters led the staff in enhancing relationships with a number of research universities in the region, continuing his commitment to quality public-private relationships in the interest of furthering math and science education.  Dr. Peters came to PNNL in 2003, after serving as the vice provost for research at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Prior to guiding Virginia Tech's ambitious research portfolio, he served as acting vice president for research and graduate studies at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Peters spent nearly 20 years in the classroom, educating our next generation of scientists. He is a distinguished scholar and a leader in the field of atmospheric chemistry.  In his new role at Battelle, Dr. Peters will continue to serve Washington State through community outreach programs. His work to expand higher education opportunities in the Tri-Cities, as well as his leadership on the Hanford Reach Interpretive Center Board are examples of his strong commitment to building a better community, region and State.  I thank Dr. Len Peters for his guidance and commitment to PNNL over the past 3\1/2\ years. For the people of Washington State and the entire Pacific Northwest region, I thank Dr. Peters for his continued service to our community and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
