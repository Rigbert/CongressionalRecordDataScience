Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3479, the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act, and would point out that I believe one of the reasons we are here today under suspension is a broad-ranging bipartisan support that exists for this legislation today.  Whether we talk about a Democratic mayor for the city of Chicago, whether a Republican governor of the State of Illinois, whether we talk about the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, or whether we talk about the AFL-CIO, whether we talk about the Republican or Democratic leadership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that reported this bill to the Congress, one of the things that has been debated hotly about this legislation is the status of the Peotone site in the State of Illinois.  What I want to use my time today is to point out to Members of this body that there are three airports involved, O'Hare International Airport, an airport in Rockford, Illinois, and the airport in Gary, Indiana, which is in my congressional district. There is a proposed site in Peotone, Illinois.  The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) talked about a potential racial divide on the Illinois side. I wouldpoint out that Gary, Indiana's population is 85 percent African American, and for those African American citizen of Gary, Indiana, the passage of this legislation is very important for their economic future because they and their surrounding environs have been decimated because of the loss of manufacturing jobs.                              {time}  1300  We have an existing airport at Gary, Indiana, just as there is one at Rockford. One of the things that the leaders on the committee took great pains to do was to ensure that both of those airports, as well as the proposed Peotone site, are all treated equally. Given that equity that exists in this bill for those two airports and that proposed site, I strongly urge support passage of this bipartisan legislation.
