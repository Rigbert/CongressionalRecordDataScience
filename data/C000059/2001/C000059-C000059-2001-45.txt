Speaker, I rise today with a deep sense of personal conviction and pride to submit for the Record a proclamation on the 43rd Observance of Captive Nations Week. It was in memory of the millions who perished under authoritarian regimes and remain under authoritarian regimes still that the 86th Congress and President Dwight D. Eisenhower began the tradition of paying tribute to their fight for freedom, democracy, free market economy, human rights and national independence, with Public Law 86-90. President Ronald Reagan served to more forcibly imprint this need several years later when he called history's most powerful authoritarian regime, the Soviet Union, an `evil empire.'  I am convinced that Captive Nations Week has served a vital role in the fight against authoritarian governments. This one week a year has provided, and continues to provide, a level of focused pressure and attention on those nations that utilize force, coercion and fear to maintain control over the individual. As a result, we no longer witness Germany fascism, Soviet Stalinism, the Nazi concentration and work camps of World War II and more. In time, I believe that remaining Captive Nations, such as China, will also join the community of democratic states.  China in particular provides us visible daily evidence of the human rights violations that continue to be perpetuated in the world. In this country the authoritarian government continues to deny men and women their inalienable rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of movement and assembly, freedom of the press and the right to practice their religious beliefs without fear of persecution.  Captive Nations Week recalls our obligation to speak out for captive peoples around the world. During this one week in July, we may reaffirm our support for peaceful efforts to secure their right to liberty and self-determination. Thomas Jefferson's timeless words on the 50th Anniversary of our Nation's Independence in 1826 best highlight the goals of Captive Nations Week:  ``All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights and an undiminished devotion to them. . . .''  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I add my prayers and hopes to the millions said each and every day for the ``rights of man'' to be secured for all peoples around the world and that Americans are privileged to experience with each breath that they breathe. And I also applaud those who would not be victimized, the individuals who refused to be swayed by untruths and promises of power--the ones who fought tyranny and prevailed. In 2001 there remain many Captive Nations, but our hope remains that one day there will be none.                          ____________________
