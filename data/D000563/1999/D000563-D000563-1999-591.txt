WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I am holding this draft amendment. You are referring to two paragraphs, and it appears to me that the first paragraph is the title; am I correct? I find that inconsistent with what I believe was paragraph 2. The first paragraph is the title, and there is really only one paragraph in the body of the amendment.
