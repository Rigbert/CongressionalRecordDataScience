Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a minimal issue at all. I hope Members will listen, because again I want to reiterate, a contract was made with agriculture in 1996 that will be ending in the year 2002, that all subsidies on all crops will be eliminated.  In the face of that contract, why are we singling out sugar growers? This is not an attack on sugar companies. This is an attack on people who grow sugar, who work in the fields. Why should we distinguish them from soybeans or wheat or corn, if that happens to be your crop? ``Oh, no, we have to identify sugar. Let's take them out of the contract.''  I say, ``Wrong.'' We made a contract, let us stick with it.  Is this a minimal question? Well, the people from CoBank do not think so, because the senior Vice President, Mr. Cassidy, wrote a letter to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Livingston) on June 18, 1998, at which time this senior Vice President said, ``Look, we finance about 2,000 customers. There are $1 billion worth of loans in jeopardy if this amendment passes.''  Banks do not operate on tomorrow. They operate on a year and two and three-year commitments. Therefore, we are jeopardizing many, many sugar growers. Why do that? Do not pass this amendment. Stay with the contract the Congress made with farmers and with agriculture until the year 2002.  Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record the letter from Mr. Jack Cassidy to Chairman Livingston.  The text of the letter is as follows:                                                       CoBank,                                        Denver, CO, June 18, 1998.     Hon. Robert L. Livingston,     Chairman, House Appropriations Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I'm writing to express CoBank's      opposition to an amendment to the pending Agricultural      Appropriations bill that would effectively end the federal      sugar policy.       With $19 billion in assets. CoBank is the largest bank in      the Farm Credit System. We provide financing to about 2,000      customers, including agricultural cooperatives, rural utility      systems, and to support the export of agricultural products.      At present, CoBank has 25 farmer-owned cooperative customers      involved in the sugar or sweetener industry, with loans from      CoBank totaling nearly $1 billion. CoBank's customers, their      farmer members, and CoBank itself have made numerous business      decisions and financial commitments based on the seven-year      farm bill passed by Congress in 1996. As you know, that      legislation included provisions vital to the U.S. sugar      industry at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. Great hardship would      result to sugar farmers and their cooperatives if Congress      fails to live up to the commitments made as part of the farm      bill.       For these reasons, we urge you to support the existing farm      bill provisions and oppose any proposals that would undermine      the existing sugar policy.       Please call me at 1-800/542-8072, extension 4362, if you or      your staff have any questions.           Sincerly.                                                  Jack E. Cassidy,                                            Senior Vice President.
