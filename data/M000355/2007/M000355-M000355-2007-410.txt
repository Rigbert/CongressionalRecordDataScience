 President, one of the pressing items the distinguished majority leader failed to mention was he filed cloture on the motion to proceed to a motion that would allow us to express our views about the appropriateness of the continued service of the Attorney General. There are plenty of people around here who have had something to say about that. There have been hearings about it, calls for resignation. The distinguished majority leader wants to use up floor time,precious floor time in the Senate so that we can express ourselves on the Attorney General's service, something each of us could do individually at any point we want. That is not exactly a pressing item.  If we want to finish this bill, the message is clear. There needs to be at least as many Republican rollcall votes this time as last year. The way to do that is not to invoke cloture and try to stuff the minority, as has been done 32 times already this year. The way to do that is to process amendments, make it possible for amendments to get pending, continue to discuss them, finish the bill when we get to an appropriate level with our amendments that produces a degree of comfort on this side of the aisle that we have had an adequate opportunity to express ourselves on probably the most important issue we will deal with in this entire Congress. This is no small matter. It is a big issue, a big problem, and it requires broad bipartisan cooperation to bring a bill such as this to a conclusion. Therefore, I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture.
