President, I would like to enter some remarks for the record regarding the Bumpers grazing fee amendment to H.R. 3662, the Interior appropriations bill.  In my view, if Federal policies are enacted that drive the small, independent family rancher off the land, there will be many adverse consequences for our country. I appreciate Senator Bumper's responsiveness to my concerns about small, family ranches that led to a 5,000 AUM cap instead of the original cap of 2,000 AUM.  This change, a 150-percent increase in AUM's over his initial proposed cap, resulted in an exemption from the fee increase for approximately 300 Oregon ranchers. Further, the amendment would not impact most of the 2,100 permittees in Oregon.  There are, however, some small family ranchers who I remain concerned about. A significant number of Oregon ranchers are small and independent but they operate through one permittee, an incorporated family ranch. They are the folks I am concerned about. They include families with multiple households who live on, work on, and derive their livelihood from the ranch. They are working together to provide for their families, they provide generations worth of knowledge, and they are active in associations and restoration work. It is those family ranches who hold permits to graze more than 5,000 AUM that will have to pay the increased fee.  To address this problem, each legitimate, separate household on a family ranch should be recognized as an independent permittee or lessee for the purposes of determining the grazing fee increase.  This should be done for a simple, yet very important reason. Multi-generational ranchers are the backbone of our land stewardship program. They provide a unique knowledge of the land, are critical to maintaining our national food supply, and are helping to ensure the long-term protection of our rangeland resources. We need to assure that we consider their needs as we look to the future of grazing on public lands.                          ____________________
