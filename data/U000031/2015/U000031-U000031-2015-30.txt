Chair, I am delighted that Ms. Meng brought this to our attention. Mr. Royce is a very dear friend. I know we all share the same thoughts. I also want to just thank Pete Sessions, chairman of the Committee on Rules, for making this amendment in order. I would urge all my colleagues to support the amendment and appreciate it being offered tonight.  I yield back the balance of my time.
