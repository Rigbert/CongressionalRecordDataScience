Al Myers, a beloved teacher at Williston Central School in Vermont who recently passed away after being injured while working on the set of a school play. Mr. Myers was best known as a popular educator who was remembered by former school principal Lynn Murray as being ``brilliant with children.'' As a U.S. Senator, I remember Mr. Myers bringing students to Washington, DC every year. He truly wanted them to understand the importance of living in the world's greatest democracy.  In memory of Mr. Myers, I ask unanimous consent that the following memorial article, by Matt Ryan of the Burlington Free Press, be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 27, 2009]                          Myers' Death Mourned                             (By Matt Ryan)       Williston.--Parents, students and teachers at Williston      Central School are mourning the death of a popular educator      who fell from a ladder and suffered a severe head injury      while working on the set of the school's production of ``The      Wizard of Oz.''       Al Myers was found in the auditorium Friday morning and      transported to Fletcher Allen Hospital where he underwent      surgery. He died Saturday morning, according to the school.       Julie Longchamp, the producer of the school play, worked      with Myers for 20 years.       ``He was an extraordinary man with a lot of passion,''      Longchamp said. ``Everyone has come together and we're going      to be putting Al's show on.''       Longchamp prepared for the play near Myers' desk, in their      office at the school Sunday evening. In the auditorium,      parents and students quietly worked on the play's set and      costumes, the Emerald City and Glinda's pink dress. Tickets      for the show, which is scheduled for this weekend, sold out      April 1.       ``The play the Wizard of Oz will go on as scheduled under      the direction of Julie Longchamp,'' principal Walter Nardelli      wrote in an e-mail to parents. ``Al and his family would have      wanted it that way.''       Counselors will be available today for students, and staff      will attempt to keep the day as normal as possible, Nardelli      said. He encouraged children to go to school. Students were      on break last week.       The school was coordinating with Champlain Valley Union      High School to support former students who worked with Myers,      Nardelli said.       Myers had directed many theater productions over the years.      Former students and parents of students posted thoughts about      the teacher on several Facebook pages dedicated to his      memory. They wrote about working with Myers on plays like,      ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and      ``Macbeth,'' and catching his infectious love for music and      theater.       ``Mr. Myers was a wonderful teacher who took me under his      wing as he did to so many others,'' David Stephens of      Burlington wrote. ``I remember the sing-a-longs that he had      in class where he would pull out his guitar and would have      100 percent participation because it was so much fun. I can      still remember a bunch of the songs we would sing, `Feeling      Groovy,' `Blowin' in the Wind.' ''       Former Williston Central School principal Lynn Murray      remembered Myers being ``brilliant with children.''       ``In my entire career, I have never met anyone with so much      heart, so much talent and so giving a nature,'' Murray wrote.       According to one Facebook page, a celebration of his life      will be held at noon, May 16 at the Williston Central School.      As of 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 450 people joined the ``In      Memory of Al Myers'' Facebook page.       ``He's going to be a very, very missed man,'' Longchamp      said.                          ____________________
