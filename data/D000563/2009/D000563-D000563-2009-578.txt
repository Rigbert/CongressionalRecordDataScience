President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. Tuesday, October 6; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Thomas Perez, to be Assistant Attorney General, as provided for under the previous order.
