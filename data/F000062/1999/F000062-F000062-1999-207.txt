 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion of public service: Clara Shin of Orange, CA. Ms. Shin is a former AmeriCorps program officer and is currently a distinguished White House Fellow.  One of the greatest gifts that Clara Shin has been endowed with is an appreciation and a passion for public service. Her background is filled with notable accomplishments that have provided her with a sense of community and an unfailing commitment to helping others.  Ms. Shin received her bachelor's degrees in physiobiopolitics and government from Smith College and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School. As a law student, she worked at the U.S. Agency for International Development, serving as a legal intern to the Regional Legal Advisor for Southern Africa. She later joined AmeriCorps as its youngest program officer and was responsible for developing the first national grant applications for local programs seeking funding. She then managed a $25 million grant portfolio for the program and coordinated a service network spanning the Southwest. Ms. Shin also co-designed the $100 million community service component of a Housing and Urban Development initiative to revitalize severely distressed public housing developments. She founded KOSOMOSE Women's Journal, a magazine for Asian American women, and helped start the Tahoe-Baikal Institute, a bi-national environmental institute in California and Siberia that trains environmentalists in land and water issues.  As one of 17 White House Fellows, Ms. Shin has achieved the nation's most prestigious fellowship for leadership development and public service. Her assignment to the White House Office of the Chief of Staff allows her to work hand-in-hand with leaders in government on immigration, race, and science and technology issues, where she coordinates working group meetings, tracks and manages issues, and meets with advocacy groups. For more than thirty years, White House Fellows have carried out the program's mission to encourage active citizenship and service to the nation. Ms. Shin is an individual who exemplifies this notion. Her efforts to serve those around her are an inspiration to us all.  Mr. President, it is with great honor that I pay tribute to Clara Shin for her accomplishment and dedication to public service. Her enthusiasm for social and environmental causes is both uplifting and encouraging. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Clara Shin many more years of success.                          ____________________
