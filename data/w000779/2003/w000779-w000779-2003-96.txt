President, I do not intend to object. I want to clarify, based on the discussions we have been having with the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Dorgan-Wyden amendment involves a number of savings provisions. We are going to be working with the chairman's staff and the staff of Senator Byrd. We think we can find common ground on a provision that will save upward of $1 billion. I withdraw my reservation.
