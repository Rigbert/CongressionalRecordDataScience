Speaker, today my colleagues and I introduce the NAFTA Accountability Act of 1995 to stand up for the thousands and thousands of workers across our country who are being terminated.  NAFTA promised our country a $12 billion trade surplus. This year we will rack up an historic $40 billion deficit with our two trading partners on the continent. NAFTA promised our people 200,000 new jobs.  It has already cost us over 300,000 lost jobs: Like 3,200 workers at Fruit of the Loom in Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, and North Carolina; like 200 workers at Emerson Electric in Indiana; like 120 workers at Alcatel Data Networks in New Jersey; like 127 workers at American Manufacturing Co. in Alabama; like 130 workers at Data Products in Georgia; like 220 workers at Woolrich, Inc. in Pennsylvania; like 340 workers at Oxford Industries in Georgia; like 245 workers at Sara Lee in Georgia.  Mr. Speaker, we will continue the list as the week moves on.                          ____________________
