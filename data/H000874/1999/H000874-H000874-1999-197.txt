I also quoted the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), who indicated that if we delayed until September he was fearful that it would kill campaign finance reform.  As the distinguished Majority Leader knows, we had over 50 hours of debate on the Shays-Meehan bill last Congress and we had 252 Members vote in favor of passing that bill, and frankly with all due respect the hearing that we had yesterday, three good Members of Congress, the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), came and testified, but very frankly, Mr. Leader, they testified on bills they have had in it for at least two congresses. Very little change in their testimony. They indicated to me it was essentially no different than it was before. So I fear that the hearings will simply delay us and will be a device to kill rather than pass campaign finance reform.  I would hope that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey) would consult with his leadership and see if we could accelerate that so we could bring Shays-Meehan to the floor as quickly as possible, and I thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Bonior) for yielding, and I thank the leader for his consideration of that request.
