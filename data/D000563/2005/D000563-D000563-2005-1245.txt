I have been waiting patiently for 2 days. I have said on the CAFE amendment I will be more than happy to allow Senators Bond and Levin to offer their alternative amendment at the same time, debate it at the same time, with an agreement on time limitation on debate, but my fear is we are going to drift into the night hours and drift away. I don't want that to happen.  I ask if the Senator would be kind enough to tell me what his intention is after we have completed these two amendments.
