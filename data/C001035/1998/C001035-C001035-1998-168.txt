President, I am a strong supporter of public education. Increasingly, more education is key to the American dream. I would not support any legislation that I felt in any way undermines this country's commitment to public education.  There have been a lot of myths and misinformation circulated about the bill that the distinguished Senator from Georgia has taken such a leadership role in drafting and bringing to the floor. I would like to engage the Senator from Georgia in a colloquy in an attempt to put to rest some of the misinformation that has been circulated about his proposal.  First, I want to commend him for his leadership. I know that he is sincerely committed to improving the quality of education in this country. He has been a real leader on this issue, and it has been a pleasure and a privilege to work with him. The Senator from Georgia and I have had many conversations about this bill. I, too, had some misinformation about it in the beginning, and the Senator from Georgia was able to alleviate my concerns.  For the record, I would like to publicly ask some questions of the Senator from Georgia so that everyone may have the benefit of this information.  First, as the Senator from Georgia knows, I oppose vouchers because they would divert needed funds from our public schools. I would ask the Senator from Georgia, does this bill in any way divert money from local school districts that would otherwise be used for public education? Does this bill in any way authorize school vouchers?
