Speaker, I said the people watching. I did not say you, the people watching. I did not attempt to garner their attention directly.  In any case, the point is made.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon, and I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott).  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut, who is doing a real public service in coming out here and organizing this effort to talk about education.  As I listen to this education business about loans, I think about my own circumstance, my own family. My sister told me that she will be 54 years old when she gets through paying off her loans. These are loans that were for a PhD at the University of Chicago in the 1970s. She is going to be paying until another 6 or 7 years.  When interest rates have fallen, all of us who have a house, we go out and we refinance our loan. We drop our interest rate. I bought a house at 8 percent. I am now down at 6 percent. And I save myself all kinds of money.  A student cannot do that. You cannot refinance a student loan. If they really cared about children in the middle class, they would make it possible for you to refinance the loan. You can do it if you have a house. You go in and you get a home improvement loan and you use that home improvement money to pay off your college loan. Then you pay at 6 percent and you get tax deductibility. That is how they make people work around the law and put the students out there and let the banks squeeze them endlessly.  As I was sitting here thinking about this whole education thing, I was thinking about what is a democracy based on? A democracy is based on an educated electorate. If you do not have people who are educated and can understand and participate, you lose the democracy. And we have done some things here in this last couple weeks which are, if you think about them in that context, are very destructive.  We had a big debate out here about how many H-1B visas we are going to give. Now, most people do not what an H-1B visa is because our grandparents or our great grandparents came and they just kind of walked in here. But now if you come to the United States, you have to have some kind of a visa, and it either has to be a work visa or you are coming here because your family has been here and you are unifying the family or maybe there is so many could come in from each country.                              {time}  1700  But we have a special category. It is called an H-1B visa. This is a visa that we give to people who have a special skill somewhere in the world. We say, we need that skill in the United States, so we will give you one of those visas, come on in and work here. You can't stay, but we will use you, we can pay you as little as possible, give you no benefit, but if you are willing to come here, we will take you in on that basis.  Last year we passed the bill and we said we need 60,000 of those people in the United States next year. Lo and behold, industry in this country was so desperate for trained people that we had used those 60,000 visas by the 1st of July. So in come the Republicans and say, we need 150,000 more. We have to go out into Poland and Czechoslovakia and Germany and India and Cambodia and we have got to find these 150,000 people and let them come in here.  If you think about that, what that says is we are not training enough people in this country to fill the jobs that are available. These are not $5 an hour jobs flipping hamburgers in some fast food joint. These are in my district at Microsoft where we pay 30, 40, 50, $60,000 to these people, and they cannot find an American who qualifies for that job, so they have to go to India, or the Ukraine, or Uganda or somewhere and find them.  So when the President says that the focus of this country and this Congress ought to be developing an educational system that prepares our kids for the jobs of the 21st century, he is talking about making Americans available for those H-1B visas. The problem in politics is that a lot of times we always think in 2-year terms or maybe 4. We do not think about the fact that we are really sewing the seeds for 20 years from now if we don't educate our kids, if in those first 3 years we do not learn to read. Then they are not going to know how to read a computer, ma'am, when they get an opportunity to work as a computer operator, or as a programmer.  If they do not learn basic math--my daughter teaches in the Seattle schools. She teaches sophomore remedial math. She said to me, dad, you can't believe how many kids don't know how to use a ruler. She has to take them out in the parking lot and say, all right, now here is what a ruler is about. How big a parking space, so they measure out the parking space. Then she says to them, why is that parking space this size. The kids finally say oh, so the car will fit in. So they measure the car. Lo and behold, a parking space is a little bit larger than an automobile, a standard automobile.  Now when you are taking 15 and 16-year-old kids who come through our system and they do not have the capacity to make the logical connections between a ruler and a parking space, you have got serious difficulties in our educational system. So when the President says we need 100,000 new teachers to get those kids in the first 3 years where they learn to add and subtract and do fractions and they learn to read and write. That is what that is all about. It is not about somehow the Federal Government taking over education. It is supplementing those school districts in this country, and Seattle has not got a bad school system. But we still have kids who are not making it, who arenot getting it, because the schools are too big or too whatever, and we need to add this kind of thing.  Now, the other thing is this whole business about school buildings. My daughter is in a school building that was built before the Second World War. When they try and wire for computers, God help you. You have to have Rube Goldberg come in to put together the wiring to work inside a building that was built 50 years ago. That is not the oldest building in Seattle. There are a lot of buildings, and all over this country, and we say to our kids, well, we want to get you ready for a job. But we do not give them the opportunity to deal with the very things that they are going to have to do when they go out into the world. To me, it is a tragedy.  There was an editorial in this morning's newspaper which I think is the one that just stops me sort of sometimes. When we look at what we have spent our time and energy in here, Bob Herbert in the New York Times said, having been handed the gift of Monica Lewinsky, the Republicans are running with her. She conceals their real agenda. If they can parlay the Monica madness into substantial increased majorities in the House and Senate, they can renew their conservative assault on government and on their subversion of the interests of ordinary working people and the poor.  You cannot say it any clearer. If the poor, if the lower classes in our country, in the middle class in our country, if we do not come up with ways to give them an education, this democracy will lead to fascism. You will have to have the government with a soldier on every corner like they do in half the countries of the world. The reason we have a democracy is because people are educated. If we do not educate them, we will have turmoil in this country that we are not prepared for. That is why what the President is saying is that this is a long-term plan in the best interests of all Americans.  I congratulate the two of you for putting this together.
