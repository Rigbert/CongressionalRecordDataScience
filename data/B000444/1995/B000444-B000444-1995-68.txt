  Put bluntly, there is no legitimate reason not to be for this amendment. None. Zero. None. I challenge anyone to tell us why this amendment does not make sense.  Going after fraud should be our top priority, our first priority. The bill makes progress but it does not go far enough.  At least it is not what the Gingrich bill in the House does which makes it easier for health care providers to engage in fraud. Literally, not figuratively.  Last, the point made by the Senator, there is $18 billion in Medicare fraud a year and $16 billion in Medicaid fraud a year. I see no legitimate rationale for not tightening this up unless there is some outrageous special interest that thinks it would benefit from it. I see none. Prosecutors want it. Prosecutors ask for it.  I held a hearing in my State where I had the top prosecutors from Philadelphia and the top prosecutors from the State of Delaware. They point out that the House bill, which set them back decades--this bill would not do much. Our bill would make a significant impact on their ability to deal with health care fraud.  I thank my colleague for his leadership and allowing me the minutes.
