Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to commend Congressman Rob Bishop and his staff for their hard work and diligence on this land conveyance. I would also like to thank Chairman Rahall for allowing this bill to go forward.  This legislation will help the community of Box Elder, Utah, gain much needed land and help the Forest Service better meet its management needs.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
