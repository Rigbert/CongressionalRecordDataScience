Speaker, if I could just make a brief point, last night I was in Lima, OH, giving a speech to a large number of people. And afterwards three different citizens came up to me, two who were high school graduates, and one a mother of a gentleman who is 30 years old but is working in a temporary position. And that is the fastest work category in our country, fastest growing category, temporary work. She said: ``Marcy, my son is worried because in two weeks he loses his temporary job.''  It is not just low wages of these workers, it is the insecurity of not knowing whether there will be a job for them. The other two young men that were there were just seeking work, seeking to better themselves, having to work at jobs like Payless Shoes, which imports all of its shoes. And when you are a manager for a lot of those jobs, you qualify for food stamps.  Is this the kind of America that we want to produce, one where when you work, and in Mexico, as we were told by the people down there, they work for hunger wages. These people in Lima, OH last night had several problems in trying to locate steady, well-paying jobs where they could secure a future for themselves and their family.
