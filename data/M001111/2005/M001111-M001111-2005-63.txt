 President, I talked about this amendment earlier today. It provides stopgap coverage for low-income seniors and disabled individuals who may lose their benefits or suffer a gap in coverage due to the implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside and we come back to the amendment to discuss it.
