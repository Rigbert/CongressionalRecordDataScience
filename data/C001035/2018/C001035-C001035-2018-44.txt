President, in 1959, a new summer playhouse opened in Brunswick, ME, with a performance of the popular operetta ``Song of Norway.'' In 2018, the Maine State Music Theater presents its 60th season with professional productions that range from ``Singin' in the Rain'' to ``Saturday Night Fever.''  It is a pleasure to congratulate Maine State Music Theater on this landmark anniversary and to thank the casts, crews, supporters, and volunteers who, for six decades, have delighted audiences and enriched the cultural life of our State.  The oldest professional musical theater in Maine, Maine State Music Theater was founded by Victoria Crandall, a truly remarkable entrepreneur and artist. Born in Cleveland, she studied piano at the prestigious Eastman School of Music, toured with the USO during World War II, and was an accompanist for such show business legends as Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante.  After working in theatrical productions on Broadway, Ms. Crandall struck out on her own in 1959 to pursue her dream of establishing her own theater company and chose the Bowdoin College campus in Brunswick as the place to make her dream come true. Rejecting the prepackaged shows often used in summer theaters, she presented originally designed productions--as many as nine per season--that earned rave reviews from audiences and critics alike.  Ms. Crandall passed away in 1990 at the age of 81 while in New York City casting roles for that year's season. At the time of her death, she had staged 186 productions in Brunswick that were seen by more than 1.5 million people.  Ms. Crandall's legacy is carried on by accomplished performers and technical personnel, many of whom have gone on to achieve success on Broadway and in Hollywood. With dedicated management and strong community support, Maine State Music Theater has expanded its offerings to children's programs, outdoor concerts, film and lecture series, and an educational fellowship program for those developing careers in the theater. The 2017 season set a new record for attendance, with more than 95 percent of the house sold for the four main productions.  Maine State Music Theater is a true gem of the Maine arts scene and a highlight of the State's glorious summers. I offer the company all the best on this 60th anniversary and wish them great success for many years to come.                            ____________________
