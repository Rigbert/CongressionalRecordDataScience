 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize Judy Olson for her years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of Washington State. Judy served on my staff for 11 years prior to becoming the Washington State Director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency in August of 2009.  During her many years on my staff, Judy served as my eastern Washington regional director. Covering a region that spanned 13 counties and 24,239 square miles, Judy brought a tireless dedication to the needs of my constituents in this vast region. A longtime resident of Whitman County, Judy and her husband farmed wheat, dried peas, and lentils. This gave her deep understanding and firsthand knowledge of the challenges facing our farmers and agricultural communities. Over the years, Judy continuously worked to ensure that the people of Washington State, whether they lived in Spokane or in Omak, were well served by the Federal Government.  I would like to thank Judy for her years of service to me and the people of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of public service, and her dedication to her work is truly appreciated. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors and know that her many talents will continue to serve the Farm Service Agency in the Obama administration.                          ____________________
