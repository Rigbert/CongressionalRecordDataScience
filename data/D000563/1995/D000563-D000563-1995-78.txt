Speaker, during the closing weeks of this legislative debate, the people of the United States should focus on two numbers, 270 and 235. Keep those numbers in mind during the course of this debate about balancing the budget and the future of Medicare.  You see, the Republicans have proposed $270 billion in cuts in Medicare over the next 7 years, cuts which will raise the cost of Medicare for seniors, limit the medical procedures that are covered, reduce the opportunity for a senior citizen to choose his or her own doctor, reduce provider payments to hospitals and doctors, $270 billion in cuts. They tell us we need it to balance the budget.  Do not forget the other number, 245, $245 billion tax cut which the Republicans are proposing while we are trying to balance the budget. Is it not amazing how close those two numbers are, 270 and 245? If the Republicans would give up on the $245 billion tax cut, we would not have to cut Medicare.                          ____________________
