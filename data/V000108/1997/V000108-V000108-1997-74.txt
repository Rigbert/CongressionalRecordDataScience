Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge No. 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union on the festive occasion of its 90th anniversary and golden member banquet on Sunday, June 1, 1997.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the beautifully renovated Croatian Center in Merrillville, IN. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration entails a formal recognition of the union's golden members, those who have achieved 50 years of membership. Honorees who have pledged their allegiance for 50 years include: Frank Boskovich, Mary D. Cost, Olga J. Curley, Lillian Damjanovich, Violet Evans, Eleanor Fischer, Adolph Kurpis, Joseph J. Labas, Annebelle Mazlack, Robert D. Medved, Henry Mikulich, Elizabeth Morgavan, Helen Mrak, Vincent R. Mrzlak, Rosemary Muick, Mary Pastuovic, Mary Pintar, Frances Sasak, Abert P. Seibal, Frederick J. Simunic, Donald R. Starkey, Jack Tomlin, and Marion A. Youngerman.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with approximately 280 additional lodge members who have attained this status.  This memorable day will begin with a mass at St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Gary, IN, which will be officiated by the Reverend Father Benedict Benakovich. Following dinner, there will be a program featuring guest speaker, Mr. Bernard M. Luketich, national president of the Croatian Fraternal Union. The festivities will be culturally enriched by the performance of several Croatian entertainment groups. The Croatian Glee Club, ``Preradovic,'' directed by Brother Dennis Barunica, and the Hoosier Hrvati Adult Tamburitza Orchestra, directed by Ed Sinndicih, will both perform at the anniversary celebration. The Croatian Strings and Junior Dancers, and the Adult Kolo Group, under the direction of Elizabeth Kyriakides, will provide additional entertainment for those in attendance.  I am proud to commend lodge president, Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge No. 170, for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
