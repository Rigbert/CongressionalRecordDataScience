 We are in a new world now, and the new world includes not just losing jobs producing goods but jobs involving services, and trade adjustment assistance does not apply. So the 4,000 computer programmers at IBM who gave their jobs to India and China cannot qualify for trade adjustment assistance. The Senator from Connecticut is right; they then get into fierce competition for the limited jobs available in America.  I have met with the men and women who are in the ranks of the unemployed, and they are finding it extremely difficult to find any job that pays nearly what they made before. The first casualty of unemployment is their health insurance, and then, of course, their home and their savings. All of these things are casualties as Congress not only is insensitive to this loss of jobs overseas, this outsourcing of jobs, but even fails to include unemployment insurance for these workers.  I say to the Senator from Connecticut--I will yield the floor because I see another colleague--if the election in November is a referendum on this report as to whether or not it is healthy for America to see jobs outsourced and sent overseas, bring it on.  If my colleagues think they can rationalize the sending of these jobs overseas because Mr. Mankiw and President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers happen to have some theoretical model behind them, they ought to take these wonderful Wall Street models to Main Street in America.  I hope before the end of the day we will count noses in the Senate on the Dodd amendment. Let us find out how many people buy the Mankiw vision of the world and how many people buy the reality of this world.
