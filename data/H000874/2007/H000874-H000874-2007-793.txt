 Jay began his House career in 1982 as a Legislative Assistant and then Administrative Assistant to Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin. From 1985 to 1991, he served as the Chief of Staff to Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania. Following his Member office service, Jay assumed the role of Staff Director on the Committee on Education and Workforce--currently the Committee on Education and Labor. Jay served the Committee and Chairman Goodling for six years before being nominated and elected to the office of Chief Administrative Officer of the House. He was sworn in to this prestigious position on July 31, 1997.  Jay has served as Chief Administrative Officer in the last six Congresses, and under his leadership, the Office of the CAO dutifully fulfilled its mission to provide first-rate administrative, technical, and support services. During his tenure, the CAO achieved customer satisfaction ratings in the 90th percentile and set new benchmark standards for customer service by Government agencies. Thanks in large part to Jay, the CAO truly is a world-class organization.  Furthermore, the House achieved nine consecutive clean annual financial statement audits, and successfully responded to the anthrax contamination of House office buildings in 2001. Jay led efforts to strengthen the House's business continuity and disaster recovery readiness following the September 11 attacks, and to modernize the committee hearing rooms to upgrade broadcasting capabilities, which enhanced the House's ability to share the legislative process with a greater number of citizens across the country.  Jay Eagen has served the U.S. House of Representatives, and our Nation, with honor and distinction. And on behalf of our entirecommunity, I extend a heartfelt thank you to Jay and wish him many wonderful years as he moves on to the next phase of his life with his wife, Cathy, and son, Keiran.                          ____________________
