Mr. Speaker, it is rare that I apologize when I know I am speaking from my heart. It is rare that I ask this House to listen to a gentleman's understanding as he sees the issue. It is rare that I have to apologize when other gentlemen do not take the opportunity to read the facts on an issue.  The gentleman and I have discussed this for many, many years, and he and I know we differ. He knows my emotionalism on this. He knows I have lost over 42 percent of my working people in this area. He knows that I am a gentleman that would never impugn another gentleman. The gentleman knows that.
