S. Navy CDR Jeffrey Smith, captain of the USS Kentucky. Commander Smith, a Kentucky native, is the youngest commanding officer of an Ohio-class submarine. The commander has accomplished great feats in his naval career and he proudly represents the State of Kentucky with everything he does. I know he is especially honored to command the ship that bears the name of our beloved Commonwealth.  Commander Smith was born in Covington, KY, and moved to Independence, KY, shortly thereafter. Upon graduating from Simon Kenton High School, he attended Xavier University and then transferred to the University of Kentucky. In 1995, Commander Smith graduated with a degree in physics and was commissioned in the Navy, where he began nuclear power training in Florida.  His dedicated service to the U.S. Navy brought him to the post of commanding officer of an Ohio-class submarine. The youngest man in his position, Commander Smith leads both the Gold and Blue Teams and is charged with overseeing the drills, maintenance, and day to day operations of the USS Kentucky.  Respected as a leader by his crew, Commander Smith also makes time to share his love of his State, the namesake of the submarine, with his men. After each announcement, it has become his trademark to lead the men in a round of ``Go Big Blue'' cheers. A true Kentucky Wildcats fan, he loves to talk University of Kentucky basketball and ``bracketology'' with his men come NCAA Tournament time. By sharing some of these beloved hallmarks of the Bluegrass State, Commander Smith not only shows his own pride in being a Kentuckian, but also provides his men a sense of attachment to the place for which their ship was named.  Commander Smith, besides being an avid UK Wildcats fan, enjoys reading, playing video games, and spending time with his four children. He credits his interests and leadership capabilities to his education from the University of Kentucky. From physics and engineering courses which enable him to effectively operate the ship, to psychology courses which allow him to understand his men and their attitudes in different situations, a diverse educational and experiential background allows Commander Smith to lead his men effectively.  It is my privilege today to recognize a Kentuckian who has truly devoted his life to the service of this Nation. A rising star in the U.S. Navy, CDR Jeffrey Smith has committed himself to excellence and to proudly representing the State of Kentucky. I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in saluting U.S. Navy CDR Jeffrey Smith.  A recent publication by the University of Kentucky newspaper the Kentucky Kernel highlighted the accomplishments of the Commander. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      [From University of Kentucky, Kentucky Kernel, July 3, 2012]              USS Kentucky's Commander Is a Proud UK Alum                           (By Sarah Geegan)       There's just no telling where an education from the      University of Kentucky can take you.       For U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Smith, the journey that began      at UK has taken him around the world and deep below the      ocean's surface, as captain of the USS Kentucky, a nuclear      submarine.       ``Having been born in Kentucky and growing up there, I      can't imagine any pride greater than serving as commander of      the ship that bears my home state's name,'' says Smith, whose      parents and sister still live in Kentucky.       Born in Covington and raised in Independence, Smith      graduated from Simon Kenton High School and attended Xavier      University for a year before transferring to UK. After      graduating in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in physics, Smith      was commissioned in the Navy and went to officer candidate      school in Pensacola, Fla., where he began nuclear power      training.       At 39, Smith is the youngest commanding officer of an Ohio-     class submarine. The Kentucky--560 feet long and 42 feet in      diameter, and producing around 18,000 tons of displacement--     is about the size of the largest ships that worked during      World War II. It has a crew complement of 160, and it is      capable of sinking more than 800 feet and traveling faster      than 25 knots. (``That's pretty much freeway speed for a      submarine,'' Smith says.) The Kentucky's primary mission, as      a strategic nuclear deterrent, is to provide a credible,      survivable launch platform for ballistic missiles from sea.       The ship is really a world of its own, Smith says, and it's      a complex world with tens of thousands of moving parts. For      the commander of the Kentucky, a day's work involves taking      care of the ship and making sure its crew members are      prepared for any situation they could face while at sea.       ``Life aboard a nuclear submarine is all about mitigating      risk, while still making sure that you are able to perform      your mission,'' Smith says. ``A submarine at sea is really a      dangerous environment. Everywhere within reach, there are      cables carrying high-voltage electricity. There are pipes      containing rapidly moving sea water. There are     high-pressure hydraulics lines. And we live constantly within      just a few feet of the most unforgiving, deadly, crushing      environment, right on the other side of our hull--the deep      sea. It's of paramount importance that we keep it on the      other side of that hull.''       A naval submarine will operate at sea for about 50 to 100      days before coming back to port for a couple of months,      during which time it undergoes a regimen of critical      maintenance and a crew rotation. The Kentucky has two crews,      a Blue Team and a Gold Team. Smith commands both.       While the Kentucky is under way, the daily routine is one      of training, planning and maintenance. Breakfast begins at      05:00 (5 a.m.) and is over by 06:30, at which time the crew      receives briefings before commencing drills at 08:00. Drills      consist of simulations of various different situations that      could be encountered aboard the ship, such as fires,      floodings, and casualties.       On some days, the crew performs strategic exercises, in      which the crew practices the tasks they could be asked to      perform while on a mission--everything from processing      messages to walking through a strategic launch. This part of      the day is usually done by 15:00 (3 p.m.), followed by a few      hours of planning, training, and debriefing before dinner at      17:00 hours. There's usually a movie for the crew around      20:00, and then it's lights out.       Running parallel to that daily routine, the ship maintains      a regular watch schedule, in which at any given time, one-     third of the crew is manning a watch station on their part of      the ship. The watch shifts run for six hours in an 18-hour      rotation.       In port, the routine centers around maintenance, with      anywhere from 50 to 150 separate scheduled maintenance items      every time the ship comes in.       ``The scheduled maintenance on a car is a good      comparison,'' Smith says. ``Think of all of the things that      you have to check on your car every 5,000 miles. Well, a      submarine is a lot bigger and a lot more complex than a car.      And a typical car owner might keep their car for five or six      years, while a submarine has to last for 40. So we have to      ensure that the ship is in good shape for another whole      generation of submariners.''       Smith says he works conscientiously to instill a sense of      Kentucky pride in his crew. One of the first things he did      after taking command was to implement ``Go Big Blue!'' as the      ship's rallying cry. He ends every shipboard announcement      over the loudspeaker with that call, and the crew echoes it      back.       ``I think you'll find it's true, on any of the ships named      after a state, that the commanders will try to get the whole      state-pride thing going among the crew,'' Smith says. ``I      have just a little extra fire in my belly, being a native of      Kentucky and a graduate of UK. My crew definitely knows that      we're representing a great state.''       Smith says the education he received at UK has helped to      prepare him for his role in the Navy in ways he couldn't even      have imagined when he was a student some 20 years ago.       ``The experience that I had in college--not just in      physics, but the whole multidisciplinary aspect of what      college is--has served me very well throughout my career,''      he says. ``I use the physics every day, and the engineering      and math. But there's also philosophy--particularly the      connection between philosophy and anthropology: How do we      live in a multinational society? There's psychology, which      helps me to be able to interpret the reactions of my crew in      an objectively harsh environment. I use business management      and financial accounting. Even the Russian I studied has      served me well. There was not a single class that I took at      UK that I have not gone back and leveraged in my career at      some point.''       A lifelong Wildcat fan, Smith says he was thrilled to see      the Cats bring home their eighth NCAA Championship this year.      He offers his own, admittedly biased, take on bracketology:       ``I tell my fellow officers that when you pick your bracket      for the NCAA tournament, you need to realize that there is a      Center of Awesomeness in the Universe, which is Rupp Arena,      and the farther any team is based from there, the less of a      chance they are going to have of making it to the Final      Four.''       Smith is also father to four children. In his spare time,      he enjoys reading broadly on diverse topics, including      philosophy, poetry, and music. He is an avid video gamer, who      welcomes challenges from his crew in just about any game      imaginable.       ``I try to remain as interdisciplinary as possible,'' he      says.                          ____________________
