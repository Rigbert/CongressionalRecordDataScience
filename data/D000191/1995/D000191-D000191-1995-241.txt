  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Speaker Gingrich's whip organization has been awesome as he has rolled up victory after victory no matter how controversial his legislative agenda.  He rolled up a large majority of Republicans to push GATT through a lame duck Congress. Speaker Gingrich did yeoman's work behind the scenes to deter any congressional scrutiny of the $40 billion Mexico bailout, and when we finally forced a vote on the floor the Republican leader threatened committee assignments, subcommittee chairs and other retaliations if his minions did not toe the line.  Just last week they flexed their leadership muscle gain on welfare and nutrition reform, but the muscles of the Speaker's whip organization have suddenly gone flaccid with the prospect of term limits.   [[Page H3885]] The Speaker has constructed a bizarre rule and amendments that are designed to fail. It is time for supporters of the Republican contract to sue for breach of contract, or maybe to invoke the ultimate term limits in November 1996 and vote the rascals out.                          ____________________
