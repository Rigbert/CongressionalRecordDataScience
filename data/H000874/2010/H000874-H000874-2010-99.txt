 Mr. McKEON. Well, I'm sorry. I have not read that. And I'm not quoting from that same rhetoric. And as Colin Powell said, it is not the same.  In fact, this is Mr. Powell's quote: ``Skin color is a benign, non-behavioral characteristic. Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics. Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.''  Mr. Powell's comment.
