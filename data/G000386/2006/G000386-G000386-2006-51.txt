 President, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincerest congratulations and gratitude to retiring U.S. Attorney Charles ``Chuck'' Larson, Sr. While I could easily just focus on all Chuck has done in his years as the dedicated U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, this man has given so much more in over 40 years of Government service.  When his country has called, Chuck has been there. He served in the U.S. Army and Army Reserves for 40 years, retiring as a lieutenent colonel in 1989. Four U.S. Presidents have called on Chuck to serve in various capacities, and each time he has stepped forward and served with honor and distinction.  Chuck was first appointed as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and continued to serve in this position under President George H.W. Bush through 1993. During his service at this post, Chuck went well above and beyond. He devoted himself to fighting the scourge of drug crime and abuse by bringing local, State, and federal agencies together. Chuck also recognized the need for community outreach, and he pioneered a number of programs that brought together community leaders, clergy, and citizens to explore approaches to reduce drug abuse in Iowa.  These ideas were recognized as very innovative at the time and led to President Clinton's call for Chuck to serve on the Commission on Drug-Free Communities, a post in which Chuck served with distinction and which his son, Chuck, Jr., fills today.  Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Chuck was again called to duty as the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Iowa by President Bush. He continued his aggressive and innovative strategies in this new and complex era of the war on terror. His efforts led to programs for the training of law enforcement and other emergency responders in dealing with and preventing terrorist attacks. Chuck extended this training effort to private industry and trade associations. Yet Chuck never ceased his efforts in Iowa in fighting crime and drug abuse. His past successes in community outreach programs and law enforcement coordination led to the creation of programs such as the ``Weed and Seed'' initiative in Cedar Rapids and the statewide ``Meth and More'' program. These programs not only helped put criminals behind bars but also provided help and support to thousands trapped in the destructive cycle of methamphetamine abuse and educated Iowa communities about the disastrous effects of drug abuse. His devotion to this cause can be summed up in Chuck's own words, ``if we can save one life, then our efforts are a success.''  In the midst of this, his country called yet again. In 2004, Mr. Larson was ask to serve as the senior Department of Justice representative in Iraq. Chuck was given the enormous task of directing and administering efforts to train Iraqi judiciary, law enforcement, and civilian contractors. He was tasked with nothing less than restoring justice and equity to the Iraqi judicial system. Despite the inherent dangers and complexities of his mission, Chuck yet again served with distinction.  Again, I offer my thanks and congratulations to U.S. Attorney Charles Larson, Sr. Chuck's dedication, devotion, and courage, again and again, provided invaluable service to our country and the great State of Iowa. Chuck, you are a true American and a model for all in Government service.                          ____________________
