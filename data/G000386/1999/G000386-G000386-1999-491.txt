(b) A witness is unable for economic reasons to obtain      counsel may inform the Committee at least 48 hours prior to      the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain      volunteer counsel for the witness.

Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the      Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness,      his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a      manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere      with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman      or presiding Member of the Committee present during such      hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his      representative or any law enforcement official to eject said      person from the hearing room.                    vi. depositions and commissions       1.

Unless otherwise specified,      the deposition shall be in private.

Counsel. Witness may be accompanied at a deposition by      counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the      provisions of Rule V.4.       3. Procedure.

Objections by the witnesses as to the form      of questions shall be noted for the record. If a witness      objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of      relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with      the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time,      seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from      a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the      objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may      order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the      Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil      or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify      after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member      of the Committee.       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony      is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is      transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for      review.

Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in      this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not      substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not      relieve the witness from his obligation to testify      truthfully.       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by      issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas,      conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or      systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the      Committee.
