 President, I rise this morning in honor of the 75th anniversary of the League of Women Voters of the United States.  Founded in 1920, out of the Women's suffrage movement, the leagues has served 75 years educating voters about the most complex public issues of the day.  The league has an impressive history. It has a long tradition of providing voters information--from the first national radio broadcast of a candidate forum in 1928, to its Emmy-Award-winning 1976 debates between former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.  The league encourages citizen participation in the democratic process. The organization has educated and advocated on issues ranging from--passage of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote--to the passage of the motor-voter law in the last Congress.  And, the leagues doe not shy away from taking on the issues. For example, in 1955, the league's president testified against Senator Joseph McCarthy's abuse of congressional investigative powers.  Organized in thousands of communities throughout the Nation, the league emphasizes the need for government to be representative, accountable, and responsive.  Mr. President, the League of Women Voters is an excellent organization and I am proud to honor the league's 75th anniversary today.
