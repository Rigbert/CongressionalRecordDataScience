 The gentlewoman talked about a 1 percent cut. I would point out that several years ago this Nation spent more money on water projects in one city than we did on every water project in the United States of America. The city was New Orleans, because we didn't make the proper investment up front.  I don't think we should risk losing one life. And I would acknowledge that we have already reduced the Corps' budget from existing year level by $216 million.  We have at least a third of the harbors in this Nation that are not dredged to depth. Every time a ship comes in or leaves that is not fully loaded, there is a job that is lost, one job or more. There is $1 of profit for that shipper, for that company, or more that is lost. Those are the numbers I'm worried about.  I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
