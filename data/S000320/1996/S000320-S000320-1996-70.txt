  The amendments (Nos. 5271 through 5278), en bloc, are as follows:                           amendment no. 5271       Insert at the appropriate place in the bill:       (a) Reduction in Facilities Energy Costs.       (1) In general.--The head of each agency for which funds      are made available under this Act shall--       (A) take all actions necessary to achieve during fiscal      year 1998 a 5 percent reduction, from fiscal year 1996      levels, in the energy costs of the facilities used by the      agency; or       (B) enter into a sufficient number of energy savings      performance contracts with private sector energy service      companies under title VIII of the National Energy      Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287 et seq.) to achieve      during fiscal year 1998 at least a 5 percent reduction, from      fiscal year 1996 levels, in the energy use of the facilities      used by the agency.

At the end of title V of the bill, insert the following new      sections:     SEC. 5____. COMMEMORATIVE COIN PROGRAM REFORM.       (a) Commemorative Coin Program Restrictions.--Section 5112      of title 31, United States Code, as amended by sections 524      and 530 of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the      following new subsection:       ``(m) Commemorative Coin Program Restrictions.--       ``(1) Maximum number.--Beginning January 1, 1999, the      Secretary may mint and issue commemorative coins under this      section during any calendar year with respect to not more      than 2 commemorative coin programs.       ``(2) Mintage levels.--       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),      in carrying out any commemorative coin program, the Secretary      shall mint--       ``(i) not more than 750,000 clad half-dollar coins;       ``(ii) not more than 500,000 silver one-dollar coins; and       ``(iii) not more than 100,000 gold five-dollar or ten-     dollar coins.       ``(B) Exception.--If the Secretary determines, based on      independent, market-based     research conducted by a designated recipient organization of      a commemorative coin program, that the mintage levels      described in subparagraph (A) are not adequate to meet public      demand for that commemorative coin, the Secretary may waive      one or more of the requirements of subparagraph (A) with      respect to that commemorative coin program.       ``(C) Designated recipient organization defined.--For      purposes of this paragraph, the term `designated recipient      organization' means any organization designated, under any      provision of law, as the recipient of any surcharge imposed      on the sale of any numismatic item.''.

(3) Scope of application.--The amendments made by this      section shall apply with respect to the proceeds of any      surcharge imposed on the sale of any numismatic item that are      deposited in the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund after the      date of the enactment of this Act.       (4) Repeal of existing recipient report requirement.--     Section 302 of Public Law 103-186 (31 U.S.C. 5112 note) is      repealed.       (c) Quarterly Financial Reports.--Section 5134 of title 31,      United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the      following new subsection:       ``(g) Quarterly Financial Reports.--       ``(1) In general.--Not later than the 30th day of each      month following each calendar quarter through and including      the final period of sales with respect to any commemorative      coin program authorized on or after the date of enactment of      the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government      Appropriations Act, 1997, the Mint shall submit to the      Congress a quarterly financial report in accordance with this      subsection.       ``(2) Requirements.--Each report submitted under paragraph      (1) shall include, with respect to the calendar quarter at      issue--       ``(A) a detailed financial statement, prepared in      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,      that includes financial information specific to that quarter,      as well as cumulative financial information relating to the      entire program;       ``(B) a detailed accounting of--       ``(i) all costs relating to marketing efforts;       ``(ii) all funds projected for marketing use;       ``(iii) all costs for employee travel relating to the      promotion of commemorative coin programs;       ``(iv) all numismatic items minted, sold, not sold, and      rejected during the production process; and       ``(v) the costs of melting down all rejected and unsold      products;       ``(C) adequate market-based research for all commemorative      coin programs; and       ``(D) a description of the efforts of the Mint in keeping      the sale price of numismatic items as low as practicable.''.

(e) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made      by this section shall take effect on the date of enactment of      this Act.     SEC. 5____. MINT MANAGERIAL STAFFING REFORM.       Section 5131 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking subsection (c); and       (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment will begin the necessaryreform of the commemorative coin programs authorized by Congress and carried out by the U.S. Mint. The amendment, supported fully by the Mint, includes many programs of H.R. 2614 passed by the House as well as recommendations for reform from the GAO. The amendment is a comprehensive substitute that enjoys widespread support.  Commemorative coins are collectibles. The coins issued for each program satisfy a number of objectives.  First, they raise awareness. Coin themes are meant to recognize significant national, and sometimes international, events, heroes and heroines, and historic sites vital to our American experience. They are expressions of our tremendous pride in all that molded this great country.  Second, they allow the Treasury a means of decreasing the national deficit through profitable programs.  Third, the sale of these coins enables worthy causes to raise money. For example, the restoration of our Nation's Capitol, the construction of memorials to our fallen heroes, and equally important for upkeep and maintenance of great homes such as Mount Vernon and the White House, and even the notable open-air home to four of our most prestigious Presidents, Mount Rushmore have been funded through commemorative coin programs.  As wonderful as these programs seem, serious problems exists--as underscored by the recent General Accounting Office report I requested last year. The commemorative coin market has been flooded with far too many coins. Overzealous programs trying to generate as many products as possible only reduce the value of coins for collecting. When mintage levels go through the roof, the value of these commemorative coins drops considerably.  More importantly and much to my dismay, taxpayers end up carrying the burden of coin programs that are not received well by the collectors. And while the sponsoring organizations may satisfy its goal of raising funds, the U.S. Mint incurs a loss which is passed on to the taxpayers.  The amendment I am offering has been crafted to augment the valuable work on commemorative coin program reforms sponsored by Representative Michael Castle, chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Congressman Castle's bill, H.R. 2614, which was supported overwhelmingly in the House, serves as a clear foundation for the reforms embodied in this bill. I commend him on his guidance and perseverance as it relates to this issue.  Mr. President, the reforms contained in this amendment will accomplish three major goals: Protect the taxpayer from losses incurred by the Mint, keep the number of coins in the market at a collectible level for collectors, and keep the total number of yearly programs at a manageable level for the Mint. Fulfillment of these goals will not only protect the American taxpayer, but will ensure the preservation and success of future commemorative coin programs produced by the U.S. Mint.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the amendment be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Shelby, for his work in this area. As a member of the Banking Committee he is keenly aware of the necessity for these reforms.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Contains a technical correction to a previous      amendment to H.R. 3756 concerning exclusive use of the Mint      facility at West Point to produce all gold and all platinum      numismatic items and bullion products.       Section 2. Commemorative Coin Program Reform. Section (a)      addresses commemorative coin program restrictions. Section      ``(m)'' to be added to Section 5112 of title 31, USC,      requires that the Secretary of the Treasury may mint and      issue no more than two commemorative coin programs per      calendar year beginning on January 1, 1999. It also sets      guidelines of maximum mintage levels for each denomination of      numismatic product as prescribed by the Citizens      Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. This section includes      an exception for the Secretary to increase the mintage levels      as he determines appropriate from results of adequate, market      based research.       Subsection (c) defines designated recipient organization.       Section (b)(1) addresses the recovery of mint expenses      required before payment of surcharges to any recipient      organization. Section 5134(C)(2) of title 31, USC is amended      by inserting ``, including amounts attributable to any      surcharge imposed with respect to the sale of any numismatic      item'' before the period.       Section (b)(2) amends Section 5134(C) of title 31, USC by      adding subsection (f), Conditions of payment of surcharges to      recipient organizations. Subsection (f)(1) states no amount      of any surcharge imposed shall be paid from the fund to the      recipient organization unless the program costs have been      recovered. Subsection (f)(1)(B) requires submission of an      audited financial statement, which demonstrates to the      satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the      organization has raised funds from private sources in an      amount equal to or greater than the maximum amount of      surcharges that organization may receive from the sale of      numismatic items.       Subsection (f)(2) requires annual audits beginning after      the commencement of the surcharge payments. Subsection      (f)(2)(A) requires these audits to begin with the first      fiscal year in which the payments are received. The audit      shall be in accordance with generally accepted government      auditing standards and performed by an independent public      accountant selected by the entity. The annual audits shall be      conducted until the surcharges are fully expended. Each audit      shall report the amount of surcharges received, the amount of      surcharges expended, and whether the expenditures were for      authorized purposes.       Subsection (f)(2)(B) sets minimum requirements for the      annual audits. Required to be included in the audit shall be      the amount of payments received, expenditures from the      proceeds, and verification that expenditures were for      authorized purposes.       Subsection (f)(2)(C) requires an accounting of surcharge      monies separate from all other revenues and expenditures of      the recipient organization. Subsection (f)(2)(D) calls for      the submission of the annual audit no later than 90 days      after the end of any fiscal year of the recipient      organization. This report shall be submitted to the Secretary      of the Treasury and made available to the public. Subsection      (f)(2)(E) allows the recipient organization to pay the cost      of the audit with surcharge funds. Subsection (f)(2)(F)      allows the Secretary of the Treasury to waive the annual      audit requirements, and Subsection (f)(2)(G) states that      Federal entities are exempt from this paragraph.       Subsection (f)(2)(H) requires recipient organizations to      provide, at the request of the Treasury Department's      Inspector General or the Comptroller General of the United      States, books, records and workpapers relating to receipts      and/or expenditures of surcharge monies.       Subsection (f)(3) prohibits surcharge monies from being      used, in any form or fashion, to attempt to influence or      support Congressional numismatic legislative action.      Subsection (f)(4) defines designated recipient organizations      as ``the recipient of any surcharge imposed on the sale of      any numismatic item.''       Section (b)(3) applies to the scope of the amendment which      will involve all proceeds of any surcharge imposed on the      sale of any numismatic item that are deposited in the      Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund after the date of the      enactment of this Act.       Section (b)(4) repeals the existing recipient report      requirement as mandated by Section 302 of Public Law 103-186      (31 U.S.C. 5112 note).       Section (c) amends section 5134 of title 31, USC, by adding      the new section ``(g) Quarterly Financial Reports.''      Subsection (g)(1) requires that the U.S. Mint shall provide a      quarterly financial report to Congress for all authorized      commemorative coin programs to be due no later than the 15th      day of the month following each calendar quarter.       Subsection (g)(2) outlines the minimal requirements of      these quarterly reports. Subsection (g)(2)(A) calls for a      financial statement prepared in accordance with generally      accepted accounting principles with information specific to      action for each quarter as well as cumulative financial      information relating to the entire program.       Subsection (g)(2)(B) states further requirements for all      quarterly reports such as all costs relating to marketing      efforts, all funds projected for marketing use, all costs for      employee travel relating to the promotion of the programs,      all numismatic items minted, sold, not sold, and rejected      during the production process, and the costs of melting down      all rejected and unsold products.       Subsection (g)(2)(B) requires the Mint to include      information showing adequate market-based research for all      non-circulating commemorative coin programs. Subsection      (g)(2)(D) requires a description of the efforts of the Mint      doing what it can to keep the price of numismatic items as      low as practicable.       Section (d), the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory      Committee amends Section 5135(a)(4) of title 31, USC, to      shorten the length of service for members appointed to the      Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee (CCCAC) to a      term of 4 years and Subsection (d)(2)(A) allows for the      Chairperson of the CCCAC to be elected by and from the      Committee members by amending Section 5135(a)(6). Subsection      (d)(2)(B) further states that the representative of the     Mint, or the alternate to that member, appointed to serve in      the CCCAC may not serve as Chairperson effective June 1,      1999.       Section (e) defines the effective date of all sections in      this amendment to take effect on the date of enactment of      this Act.       Section 5, the Mint Managerial Staffing Reform provision,      no longer requires a presidential appointment of the      following positions at each Mint facility: superintendent,      assayer and engraver at the Philadelphia Mint.                           amendment no. 5274 (Purpose: To provide for the continuation of the term of a member of    the Morris K. Udall Scholarship Board after the member's term has                   expired until a successor is chosen)       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:       Sec.   . Section 5(c)(1) of Public Law 102-259 (20 U.S.C.      5603(c)(1)) is amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by striking ``and'' after the      semicolon;       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and      inserting ``; and''; and       (3) by adding after subparagraph (B) the following:       ``(C) a Trustee may serve after the expiration of the      Trustee's term until a successor has been chosen.''.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It ensures that trustees of the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation be able to serve after the expiration of their term until a successor is chosen.  Under the act which established the Morris K. Udall scholarships and foundation, trustees are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. We all know that the nomination and confirmation process can be time consuming, and the work is not always completed in time for an efficient transition between new trustees and those whose term has expired. The resulting vacancies are disruptive to the organization and do not serve the purposes for which Congress created the foundation.  The Goldwater Foundation, also chartered by Congress, has an identical provision as this amendment, and the modification is worthy of the Senate's approval.                           amendment no. 5275 (Purpose: To allow the Department of Interior, through the Bureau of   Indian Affairs, to transfer directly to Indian tribes in North and  South Dakota portable housing units at the Grand Forks Air Force Base    which have been declared excess by the Department of Defense and          requested for transfer by the Department of Interior)       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary      of the Interior, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, may      directly transfer to Indian tribes in North and South Dakota      portable housing units at the Grand Forks Air Force base in      North Dakota which have been declared excess by the      Department of Defense and requested for transfer by the      Department of the Interior.
