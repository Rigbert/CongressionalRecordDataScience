Chairman, let me just say that historically the fund was never used either for this magnitude, this duration, or this purpose. What has happened during the 1980's, and this is why I call this a backdoor form of foreign aid, if this was necessary to prop up the political environment of this continent and of this hemisphere, then that is what the debate ought to be about, but the fact is we took over $20 billion of our taxpayers' money and put it at risk. It is still at risk.  The long-term debt of Mexico, and if we look at what is happening with the internal dynamics of that country, with its private banks, with the loans that are owned by the private sector, this is not over, as my good friend knows, probably as well as anyone in this institution. This is not the way to do it. This is not the way to do it. I think the gentleman is creating a real paradox inside for Members who may wish to have an open debate on the merits of how we relate to Mexico, but I think this completely erodes that confidence.
