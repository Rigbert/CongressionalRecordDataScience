President. I rise today on behalf of my fellow Rhode Islanders to commemorate the 2549th Anniversary of the Buddha, the Khmer New Year.  This 3-day anniversary, which begins today, highlights the rich heritage of Cambodian Americans, while recognizing contemporary Khmerian accomplishments. Specifically, the New Year's festivities celebrate the ancient dance, music, and religious traditions of the Cambodian community. The event also provides older Cambodian Americans with an opportunity to pass their customs down to future generations while simultaneously allowing all Khmerians to share their culture with other Americans.  This celebration traditionally serves as a respite between the Khmerian harvest and the weeks colloquially referred to as the ``rainy season.'' Traditionally, the Anniversary of the Buddha affords Khmerians a chance to give thanks, reflect, and welcome the spirit Tevada Chhnam Thmey. Also, in accordance with tradition, scores of Cambodian-Americans will gather with friends and family to visit local monasteries. While there, the Khmerian people will proffer food to their clergymen, pray for ancestors, give charity to the less-fortunate, forgive the misdeeds of others, and thank elders for their knowledge and care.  The Khmerian ceremonies and activities occurring this week demonstrate that each year brings new opportunities for charity, peace, and happiness. Rhode Islanders witnessed the realization of one such opportunity this year. I was fortunate to work with Miriam Hospital in Providence and Representatives Kennedy and Langevin to obtain visas to reunite Cambodian-Rhode Islander Minea Meas with his family. Three long years after Minea received political asylum in our country, his wife, Chantol Lim, and his children Monita, Sovannra, and Sinvath joyfully relocated from Cambodia to builda positive future with Minea in Rhode Island. Consequently, the Meas family will never forget the Year of the Monkey.  As we commemorate this important time, let us reflect on recent international affairs and our Nation's continued efforts to promote universal human rights and fundamental democratic ideals. Let us also take this opportunity to honor the Cambodian Americans currently serving in our Nation's military, for helping to preserve the liberties we all enjoy.  Finally, I would like to wish all Cambodian Americans happiness, prosperity, and good health in this, the Year of the Rooster.                          ____________________[Pages S3549-S3550]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        CAMBODIAN KHMER NEW YEAR
