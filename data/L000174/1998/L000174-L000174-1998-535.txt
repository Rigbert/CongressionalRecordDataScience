President, I want to speak briefly about juvenile crime legislation pending before the Senate. The ``Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act,'' S.10, was reported by the Judiciary Committee last year and may be among the bills we consider early in this session. While the measure was improved during the course of the Judiciary Committee markup, unfortunately, as explained more fully in the minority views to the Committee report, there is much work that still needs to be done and much that still needs to be improved.  The bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would mandate massive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our States, and would allow an influx of juvenile cases in Federal courts around the country. The repercussions of this legislation would be severe for any State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance.  I look forward to the Senate taking up these matters and to a full and open debate on exactly what this bill will do. Those aspects that will do more harm than good ought to be rejected. Those aspects that can be improved, should be. Those aspects that fail to respect the role and judgment of the States, their legislatures and their people ought be changed. This can only be done if the Senate is willing to do the work still unfinished and do so in our greatest tradition of full, fair and open debate.  Washington Does Not Know Best. I am very concerned about the stringent mandates with which States must comply before they qualify for the $500 million per year in new funding under S.10. This new block grant program sounds great until you look closely. The extensive new requirements created by this program make this money inaccessible to the States. In fact, no State currently qualifies for the new grant money. Consequently, while this bill is touted as helping the nation's juvenile justice systems, States that accept the help will have to surrender their State legislative judgment and change their laws to comport with Washington mandates.  For example, to qualify for this new source of funds, States would have to change their laws to ensure, for example, that they make accessible to the FBI all juvenile disposition or adjudication records, whether the juvenile was brought in for shoplifting, graffiti or more serious felonies. In addition, the States must make sure they make those records available, not only to elementary or high schools in which the juvenile is enrolled, but also to any college to which the juvenile may later apply. Many of our home States will find these requirements too intrusive and costly to make it worth their while to change their laws.  We Should Avoid the ``Federalization'' of Juvenile Crime. By imposing on the States a one-size-fits-all approach to juvenile crime, this bill turns federalism on its head. As reported, S.10 would repeal the presumption in current Federal law that the State has primary responsibility for dealing with juvenile offenders. Changing that presumption to get the federal government and the federal courts involved is neither necessary nor wise.  Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts have expressed serious concerns about the efforts in S.10 to shift juveniles to the federal court system. As the Chief Justice noted in his 1997 Year-End Report:       The Judicial Conference of the United States has raised      concerns about legislation pending in Congress to      `federalize' certain juvenile crimes, maintaining its      longstanding position that federal prosecutions should be      limited to those offenses that cannot or should not be      prosecuted in state courts.  The Chief Justice clearly recognizes what so many other law enforcement and court personnel know: The federal courts are not equipped to handle the expected increase in federal juvenile cases if S.10 is not modified.  We should preserve the core protections for juveniles in custody. Regrettably, S.10 would gut the core protections that have been in place for over 20 years to protect children who come in contact with the criminal justice system and to keep abused, neglected and mistreated children out of detention altogether. Every Vermonter who has contacted me about this issue has said the same thing: dismantling these core protections is an ill-conceived move.  Back-sliding on the protections against putting children in adult jails flies in the face of research showing that children who spend time around bad influences, like adult criminals, have a higher recidivism rate. The co-chair of Vermont's Children and Family Council for Prevention Programs has explained: ``If even intermittent contact is allowed, youth will certainly learn more and better ways to act out inappropriately and aggressively.''  We should focus on prevention. Right now, S.10 lacks balance. The bill is chock full of punitive measures to prosecute and lock-up children, but skimps on efforts to stop children from getting into trouble in the first place. Focusing on the back end of the juvenile justice system--after children get into trouble--is short-sighted. Any police chief or cop-on-the-beat will tell you that. We should also focus efforts on preventing kids from getting into trouble and intervening at the first warning signs before they enter into criminal activity.  I have heard from numerous law enforcement officials who support a clear earmark for juvenile delinquency prevention programs. They know that prevention programs are key to reducing our Nation's juvenile crime rates. This bill earmarks new federal grant money for a number of enforcement uses, including increasing sanctions, improving juvenile record keeping, mandating drug testing, and juvenile prison construction. No earmark is made for prevention. This is a mistake and will turn out to be a costly one unless we can modify the bill to bring it into balance. If we are going to have earmarks, we must dedicate money for prevention. Prevention programs enhance the skills and competency of troubled juveniles. Such programs help teenagers stay in school and stay out of trouble. Without an earmark, in the competition for dollars, prevention programs will surely lose out.  I urge my colleagues to talk to the police and prosecutors in their home states. I am confident you will hear, as I have, that well-crafted crime prevention and youth development programs do make a difference. I am also sure that you will hear how critical it is to keep juveniles separate from adult inmates and to allow teenagers who have committed a minor offense a real chance to improve their lives.  We should work together in an open and bipartisan manner to consider and improve this juvenile crime legislation.                          ____________________
