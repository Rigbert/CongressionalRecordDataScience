 President, I ask unanimous consent the report of the IG be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Police Hiring and Redeployment Grants Summary of Audit Findings and     Recommendations, October 1996-September 1998--Executive Summary                             i. background       In 1994, the President pledged to put 100,000 additional      police officers on America's streets to promote community      participation in the fight against crime. He subsequently      signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of      1994 (Crime Act), authorizing the Attorney General to      implement over six years an $8.8 billion grant program for      state and local law enforcement agencies to hire or redeploy      100,000 additional officers to perform community policing.       The Attorney General established the Office of Community      Oriented Policing Services (COPS) to administer the grant      programs and to advance community policing across the      country. Management of the COPS grants entails both program      and financial management. The COPS office is responsible for:      (1) developing and announcing grant programs, (2) monitoring      programmatic issues related to grants, (3) receiving and      reviewing applications, and (4) deciding which grants to      award. The Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs      (OJP) is responsible for financial management of the COPS      program and is charged with: (1) disbursing federal funds to      grantees, (2) providing financial management assistance after      COPS has made an award, (3) reviewing pre-award and post-     award financial activity, (4) reviewing and approving grant      budgets, and (5) financial monitoring of COPS awards.       In order to meet the President's goal of putting 100,000      additional police officers on the street, COPS developed six      primary hiring and redeployment grant programs for state and      local law enforcement agencies. Hiring grants fund the hiring      of additional police officers and generally last for three      years. Redeployment grants are generally one-year grants and      fund the costs of equipment and technology, and support      resources (including civilian personnel) to free existing      officers from administrative duties and redeploy them to the      streets. At the end of the grant period, the state or local      entity is expected to continue funding the new positions or      continue the time savings that resulted from the equipment or      technology purchases using its own funds.       According to COPS, as of February 1999, COPS and OJP had      awarded approximately $5 billion in grants under the six      programs to fund the hiring or redeployment of more than      92,000 officers, of which 50,139 officers had been hired and      deployed to the streets. COPS obtains its ``on the street''      officer count by periodically contacting grantees by      telephone.                          ii. summary findings       From October 1996 through September 1998, the Office of the      Inspector General (OIG) performed 149 audits of COPS and OJP      hiring and redeployment grants totaling $511 million, or 10      percent of the funds COPS has obligated for the program. We      continue to perform additional grant audits as our resources      permit. Executive summaries of these audits are available for      public review on our website: . A      comprehensive program audit of COPS' and OJP's administration      of the overall $8.8 billion Community Policing Grant Program      is nearing completion and should be issued in the next few      months.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ In addition to expanding on issues contained in this      summary report, the program audit will report on COPS'      ability to meet the President's goal to put 100,000      additional police officers on the street by 2000. The exact      nature of the goal has become confused because of conflicting      statements made by Administration officials, who state that      the goal is to put 100,000 new officers on the street by the      year 2000, and recent statements made to use by COPS      officials, who state that the goal is to fund 100,000 new      officers. The program audit addresses that issue at length      and also addresses COPS' and OJP's monitoring of grantees and      the quality of guidance provided to grantees to assist them      in implementing essential grant requirements.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Our audits focus on: (1) the allowability of grant      expenditures; (2) whether local matching funds were      previously budgeted for law enforcement; (3) the      implementation or enchantment of community policing      activities; (4) hiring efforts to fill vacant sworn officer      positions; (5) plans to retain officer positions at grant      completion; (6) grantee reporting; and (7) analyses of      supplanting issues. For the 149 grant audits, we identified      about $52 million in questioned costs and about $71 million      in funds that could be better used. Our dollar-related      findings amount to 24 percent of the total funds awarded to      the 149 grantees.       In considering our COPS audit results, it should be kept in      mind that they:       (1) Are snapshots as of the grant report's issuance date.      Subsequent communication between the auditee and COPS/OJP may      result in correction to, or elimination of, the issues noted      during our audit; and       (2) May well not be representative of the overall universe      of grantees because, as a matter of policy, COPS has referred      to us for review what it believes to be its riskiest      grantees. During FY 1998, we began supplementing COPS      requests for audits by selecting about one-half of the      grantees ourselves. Our results to date, however, may still      be skewed because of the number of audits conducted on COPS-     requested grantees and because our selections were not      entirely random. Some of our audits were also intended to      be targeted at suspected problem grantees. (Of the 149      audits we performed through September 30, 1998, 103 were      referred to us by COPS or OJP. Although we selected only      46 of the 149 audits summarized in this report ourselves,      our results to date do not differ markedly from the      results in the COPS/OJP referred audits.) It should also      be noted that COPS and OJP do not always agree with our      findings and recommendations. Upon further review and      follow-up, COPS and/or OJP may conclude that, in their      judgment, a grant violation did not occur.       Other findings include:       20 of 145 grantees (14 percent) overestimated salaries and/     or benefits in their grant application. The COPS office      depends primarily on the information provided by the law      enforcement departments that submit the grant applications.      When grantees overestimate salaries and/or benefits, COPS      overobligates funds that could be available for use      elsewhere. Also, grantees may be using the excess grant funds      for purposes that are unallowable.       74 of 146 grantees (51 percent) included unallowable costs      in their claims for reimbursement. Types of unallowable costs      include overtime, uniforms, and fringe benefits not      previously approved by OJP. When grantees overstate costs,      COPS program costs are overstated and taxpayer money is at      risk.       52 of 67 grantees receiving MORE grants (78 percent) either      could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or could      not demonstrate that they had a system in place to track the      redeployment of officers into community policing. The COPS      office counts 35,852 officers under the MORE program towards      the President's goal of adding 100,000 additional officers.       60 of 147 grantees (41 percent) showed indicators of using      federal funds to supplant local funding instead of using      grant funds to supplement local funding. The findings      included budgeting for decreases in local positions after      receiving COPS grants (27 grantees), using COPS funds to pay      for local officers already on board (7 grantees), not filling      vacancies promptly (22 grantees), and not meeting the      requirements of providing matching funds (35 grantees). When      grantees use grant funds to replace local funds rather than      to hire new officers, additional officers are not added to      the nation's streets. Instead, federal funds are used to pay      for existing police officers.       83 of 144 grantees (58 percent) either did not develop a      good faith plan to retain officer positions or said they      would not retain the officer positions at the conclusion of      the grant. COPS and OJP started awarding community policing      grants in FY 1994 and most grants last for about three years.      If COPS positions are not retained beyond the conclusion of      the grant, then COPS will have been a short-lived phenomena,      rather than helping to launch a lasting change in policing.       106 of 140 grantees (76 percent) either failed to submit      COPS initial reports, annual reports, or officer progress      reports, or submitted these reports late. The reports are      critical for COPS to monitor key grant conditions such as      supplanting and retention.       137 of 146 grantees (94 percent) did not submit all      required Financial Status Reports to OJP or submitted them      late. Without these reports, OJP cannot monitor      implementation of important grant requirements.       33 of 146 grantees (23 percent) had weaknesses in their      community policing program or were unable to adequately      distinguish COPS activities from their pre-grant mode of      operations. The findings suggest a need for COPS to refine      its definition of the practices that constitute community      policing as well as those that do not.       After we issue our grant reports, COPS, OJP, and the      grantee are responsible for ensuring that corrective action      is taken. By agreement with COPS, OJP is our primary point of      contact on follow-up activity for the grants, although COPS      works with OJP to address our audit findings and      recommendations, particularly those that indicate supplanting      has occurred. The options available to COPS and OJP to      resolve our dollar-related findings and recommendations      include: (1) collection or offset of funds, (2) withholding      funds from grantees, (3) bringing the grantee into compliance      with grant terms, or (4) concluding that our recommendations      cannot or should not be implemented. To address our non      dollar-related findings and recommendations, COPS and OJP      can, in addition to other options, bring the grantee into      compliance with grant requirements or waive certain grant      requirements. When OJP submits documentation to us showing      that it has addressed our recommendations, the audit report      is closed.       The report consists of the body of the report; a detailed      matrix setting forth the audit findings made during the 149      audits; the response of COPS and OJP to a draft of the      report, and our reply to their response.
