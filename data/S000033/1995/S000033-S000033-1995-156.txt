 Chairman, I will be withdrawing this amendment, which would reduce by $3.2 billion in fiscal year 1996 funding for the nuclear weapons activities of the U.S. Department of Energy. Instead, I will be offering an amendment to the fiscal year 1996 defense appropriations bill, which in fact will take a bigger bite out of wasteful Federal spending for unneeded unclear weaponry.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that it is absurd for this country to keep producing and deploying huge amounts of nuclear weaponry, and ignore the fact that the cold war is over. This mindless spending costs the American taxpayer over $30 billion a year.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that this country has many, many problems. We have people sleeping out on the street; we have children who are hungry; we have elderly people who cannot afford their prescription drugs; we have millions of middle-class families who cannot afford to send their kids to college; we have 30 million people who cannot afford health insurance. We have many problems, but one problem we do not have is a lack of nuclear weaponry.  It may be of esoteric interest to some scientists as to how many times over we can destroy humanity, whether it is 100 times over or 50 times over, through the use of nuclear weapons. That may be of interest to some people, but it really is not one of the pressing problems that this country has right now.  The cold war is over. We should not be spending $30 billion a year on nuclear weaponry, $300 billion a year over a 10-year period.                              {time}  1215   Mr. Chairman, we have some 20,000 nuclear warheads in our Nation's arsenal. That seems to me to be enough.   Mr. Chairman, I am withdrawing this amendment today but will be bringing it back in a more appropriate fashion through the Department of Defense appropriation. I believe very strongly that we must get our priorities right. We do not need more money on nuclear weaponry when we are cutting program after program that tens of millions of middle-income and working-class Americans depend upon. I look forward to the support of my colleagues when this amendment resurfaces in the Department of Defense appropriation.   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
