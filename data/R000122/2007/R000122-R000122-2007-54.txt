President, I would like to make general comments on the legislation that is before us today--the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008.  This legislation provides critical funding for our Nation's transportation infrastructure and supports programs that are essential to creating vibrant neighborhoods and communities throughout the United States. I particularly wish to commend SenatorMurray and Senator Bond for their leadership on this very important legislation.
