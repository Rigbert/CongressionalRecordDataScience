 We are looking at those provisions, and we are looking at making sure able-bodied people do achieve the goal of going from dependence to independence, more especially in this time of economic recovery, which is really the secret to all of this. The numbers in the Food Stamp Program have decreased dramatically as we have seen our economy improve, but we are taking a look at those waivers. The difference is, in the House bill, we have a situation where if somebody has children 6 and under, it used to be 10 and under, and then on the other side, people who were 50 to now 60 are included--that has raised some dust.  There are several other issues the Senator has mentioned. It is just a matter of degree. We want to provide integrity to that program. We want it to work and have it go to the people who truly need it, and we have tried very hard to accomplish that.  We will study hard the good recommendations the Senator has mentioned, and we will do our best.
