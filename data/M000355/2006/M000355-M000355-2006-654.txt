 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:54 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, June 13, 2006, at 9:45 a.m.                          ____________________
