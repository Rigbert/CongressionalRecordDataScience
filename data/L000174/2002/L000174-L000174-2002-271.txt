President, I agree with the senior Senator from Nevada. Everybody is going to say they are against hate crimes. Nobody is going to say they are for hate crimes. But if we are against them, then let's pass laws that give our law enforcement officers the teeth to go after hate crimes. Let's not go through the fiction of trying to amend this bill to death so nothing comes forward. We cannot let everyone say they are against hate crimes while some do their best to kill the hate crimes legislation.  Violent crimes motivated by prejudice and hate are tragedies that demand our attention.
