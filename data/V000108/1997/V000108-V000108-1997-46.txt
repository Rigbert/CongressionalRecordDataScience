Speaker, it is my great pleasure to extend sincere congratulations to Mrs. Helen Vincent on her retirement from Teamsters Union Local 142 next month. Helen will be honored for her 38 years of dedicated service to the Teamsters at a dinner to be held this Friday, November 7, at the Patio restaurant in Merrillville, IN. Helen's family and colleagues will be attending this special event, where Rick Kenney, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 142, will speak in recognition of her outstanding service.  Helen began working as a secretary for Teamsters Local 142 in 1959. Founded in 1941 in Gary, IN, Teamsters Local 142 represents approximately 5,500 laborers in the trucking, warehousing, commercial services, municipalities, and manufacturing industries. Helen's responsibilities at Local 142 have included the preparation of contracts, personal secretarial work for the secretary-treasurer, bookkeeping, and related duties. Throughout her career, Helen's coworkers have regarded her as a very reliable and efficient worker, who always goes above and beyond the call of duty. In addition to her outstanding career with the Teamsters, Helen and her husband of 39 years, Bob, successfully raised two fine sons, Robert and Mark.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Helen Vincent on her imminent retirement from Teamsters Local 142. In all aspects of her life, Helen has managed to put forth her best effort for a job well done. Helen's husband, children, and four wonderful grandchildren, Bobby, Megan, Sam, and Teresa, should be proud of her accomplishments, as she has been an invaluable source of guidance and support for both the Teamsters and her family.                          ____________________
