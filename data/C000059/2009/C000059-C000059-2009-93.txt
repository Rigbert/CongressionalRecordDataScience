Pitts. Today, I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible man who dedicated his life in service to our country. On Tuesday, December 30, 2008, Lt. Gen. Pitts passed away at the age of 89.  Lt. Gen. Pitt's father was a career military officer, and Lt. Gen. Pitts was born at March Field Hospital, located in Riverside, California, on Thanksgiving Day 1919. When he was 10 years old, Lt. Gen. Pitts took his first airplane ride and vowed to become an Air Force pilot. In 1943, he graduated from West Point and flew 25 World War II missions against Japan in a B-29 Superfortress. In his last mission in the bomber, he was shot down off the coast of Japan but was able to parachute out of the plane and was rescued by a submarine.  After Lt. Gen. Pitt's heroic service during World War II, he was steadily promoted and earned three stars. He served as a NATO commander in Turkey, four tours at the Pentagon and also as a diplomat in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, England and Taiwan. In 1972, Lt. Gen. Pitts returned to March Air Force Base as the Commander of the 15th Air Force. His military decorations and awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with an oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Distinguished Unit Citation Emblem with one oak leaf cluster and the Purple Heart.  In 1975, Lt. Gen. Pitts retired from the Air Force and he and his wife, Doris, made Riverside their permanent home in the 1990s. He was active in the March community during his retirement, helping to keep the base open during the Base Realignment and Closure process. In honor of his efforts, March erected a stone post at the parade grounds on the base. He was also a board member of the March Field Museum.  On December 22, 2008, Lt. Gen. Pitts celebrated his 60th anniversary with his wife Doris. He is survived by his wife; daughters Cowgill, Alisha and Linda; sister Nanetta Atkinson; and four grandchildren.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men like Lt. Gen. Pitts who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. Lt. Gen. Pitts was a dear friend and above all, he was a patriot. He will be sorely missed but his legacy and service to our great nation will always be remembered.                          ____________________
