Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I had not intended to take part in this debate but the gentleman from Washington indicated that the WIC Program was slashed in regards to the rescission program. Let me point out there was $125 million in that account, and the rescission program cut $25 million. There is still $100 million in the account. That is within the agriculture budget.  Most of us on the Committee on Agriculture, if not all, understand that the WIC Program is a very important program. Most of us also understand they have an 86 percent participation rate. They are advertising on national radio to encourage more people to participate. There has to be some level there where you are spending money on advertising hopefully to get it up to all people who are deemed eligible, but there is $100 million in there right now that is not even spent.  It was under the WIC Program that we took money from the crop insurance program to spend more on WIC. Nobody is slashing this program; $500 million in authorization, subject to appropriations, more in the WIC Program than last year. This is simply not accurate.  I thank the gentleman for giving me the opportunity to set the record straight.  Mr. McCRERY. I appreciate the gentleman making it clear that the rescission package did not slash the WIC Program, and I would like to point out this bill does not slash the WIC Program. In fact, just the opposite. We provide more money for WIC, not less, even more money than the CBO baseline predicted would be required for WIC.  So I appreciate the gentleman's comments.
