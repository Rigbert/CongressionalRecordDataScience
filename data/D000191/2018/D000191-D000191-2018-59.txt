Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I have to say, I have read the amendment, and I can't quite follow it, my staff can't quite follow it, the gentleman's staff couldn't quite explain it. The gentleman has explained it in a way that this language may or may not reflect.  FEMA has said they don't understand it. They may well be doing something regarding public facilities that is not following the intent of the law, but again, I am not certain about this as the solution.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
