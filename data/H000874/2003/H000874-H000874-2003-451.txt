Speaker.  Reclaiming my time again, Mr. Speaker, and I do not want to beat this dead horse too badly, but on Monday my presumption is that the only votes at 6:30 are suspension votes; is that correct?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, that is correct, unless we try to go to conference on the budget. We would have a motion to instruct.
