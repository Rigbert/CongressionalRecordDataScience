 President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the Senate reconciliation bill; provided further that no more than 1 hour per side of the statutory time limit be consumed during Monday's session and that no amendments be in order during Monday's session; finally, that this order be vitiated if this bill is not available on Monday.
