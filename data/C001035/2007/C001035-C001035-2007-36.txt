President, I rise to introduce Senate Bill 2003, a measure that will enhance the Federal Government's ability to perform its duties capably and economically as it faces a wave of retirement of highly experienced Federal employees.  When we think about the coming demographic shock of millions of baby boomers reaching retirement age, we usually focus on the cash-flow implications for the Social Security and Medicare programs. But their aging will also have a profound effect on the Federal workforce.  On average, retirements from the Federal workforce have exceeded 50,000 a year for a decade. The numbers will certainly rise in the near future. The Office of Personnel Management calculates that 60 percent of the current Federal workforce, whose civilian component approaches 3 million people, will be eligible to retire during the coming 10 years.  Federal agencies, which already must hire more than 250,000 new employees each year, will need to work hard to replace those retirees, as the private sector and State and local governments will be facing the same problem and competing for qualified replacements.  The baby boom retirement wave will have another impact. It will cause a sudden acceleration in the loss of accumulated skills and mentoring capabilities that experienced workers uniquely possess.  Human-resources research has repeatedly shown that, in general, older workers equal or outperform younger workers in organizational knowledge, ability to work independently, commitment, productivity, flexibility, and mentoring ability.  Making good use of their talents is, therefore, not charity. It is common sense and sound management.  Federal agencies recognize the value of older workers, as witnessed by the fact that nearly 4,500 retirees have been allowed to return to full-time work on a waiver basis.  Agencies could make use of even more Federal annuitants for short-term projects or part-time work, but for a disincentive embedded in current law.  Title 5 of the United States Code currently mandates that annuitants who return to work for the Federal Government must have their salary reduced by the amount of their annuity during the period of reemployment. The bill I introduce today with the welcome cosponsorship of Senators Warner and Voinovich would provide a limited but vital measure of relief to agencies who could benefit from the skills and knowledge of Federal retirees. It provides a limited opportunity for Federal agencies to reemploy retirees without requiring them to take pay cuts based on their annuity payment.  This simple but powerful reform is a priority item for the Federal Office of Personnel Management. As OPM Director Linda Springer has said, ``Modifying the rules to bring talented retirees back to the Government on a part-time basis without penalizing their annuity would allow Federal agencies to rehire recently retired employees to assist with short-term projects, fill critical skill gaps and train the next generation of Federal employees.''  Organizations endorsing the reform contemplated in my bill include the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the Federal Managers Association, the Partnership for Public Service, and the Council for Excellence in Government.  I would note two important points about the bill.  First, it will not materially affect the necessary flow of younger workers into Federal agencies. The bill contemplates reemployment for part-time or project work of not more than 520 hours in the first 6 months following the start of annuity payments, not more than 1,040 hours in any 12-month period, and not more than 6,240 hours total for the annuitant's lifetime. In terms of 8-hour days, those figures are equivalent to 65, 130, and 780 days, respectively.  These limits will give agencies flexibility in assigning retirees to limited-time or limited-scope projects, including mentoring and collaboration, without evading or undermining the waiver requirement for substantial or full-time employment. of annuitants.  I would also note that this bill gives no cause for concern about financial impact. Reemployed annuitants would be performing work that the agencies needed to do in any case, but would not require any additional contributions to pension or savings plans. Meanwhile, their retiree health and life insurance benefits would be costs unaffected by their part-time work. Even without making any allowance for the positiveeffects of their organizational knowledge, commitment, productivity, and mentoring potential, their reemployment is likely to produce net savings.  This measure offers benefits for Federal agencies, for Federal retirees who would welcome the opportunity to perform part-time work, and for taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
