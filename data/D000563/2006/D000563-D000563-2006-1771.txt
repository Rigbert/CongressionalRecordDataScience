 At a press conference on December 19, 2005, President Bush called FISA ``a very important tool.'' I would say to the President, FISA is more than a tool. It is a law, and we are a nation of laws.  Our Constitution separates powers between different branches of Government. Under article I of the Constitution, Congress has the power to make laws. Under article 2 of the Constitution, the President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed.
