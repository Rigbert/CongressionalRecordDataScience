 President, for the information of all Senators, the Omnibus appropriations bill is now pending. I filed cloture to ensure that the Senate can pass it and send it to the President for his signature before the end of the week. It is my hope that we can enter into an agreement to vote on the omnibus tomorrow rather than running out the clock into the weekend.                          ____________________
