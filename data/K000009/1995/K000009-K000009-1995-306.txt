Speaker, first let me say, we heard about NAFTA, you hafta. Now it is Mexico, bailout or bust. United States taxpayers should not have to become Mexico's insurance company. Why should our taxpayers have to place the full faith and credit of our U.S. Treasury behind the Wall Street speculators who gambled and lost their own money? We have no legal obligation to do that. They are not insured by the Treasury of the United States or any of our respective banking institutions.  So today, I would like to ask on the record our U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Federal Reserve specifically which speculators have their hands out to the taxpayers of the United States? Which creditors must Mexico pay off in the first quarter of this year, in the second, in the third, in the fourth, and in years hence? Which investment banks, we want to know who they are and where they are located and how much? Which mutual funds, which multinational corporations who gambled that the fundamentals of that system of government in Mexico were good enough for them to take our jobs south of the border? And which global banks? Who specifically does Mexico owe the $26 billion that is coming due this year, and then the dozens and dozens of billions, $89 billion total public debt, not counting the private debt, and all the creditors that Mexico owes?  Call my approach tough love. There are just some times when you have to say ``no.''  Imagine, we have a U.S. Treasury Department which recently, under the GATT debate, told our savings bondholders in this country that they could not earn 4 percent interest anymore on their U.S. savings bonds. You remember a couple years ago they could earn 6 percent; then they lowered it to 4 percent. Then under GATT, they removed the floor completely. So American taxpayers who buy U.S. savings bonds have no real incentives to buy them anymore.                              {time}  1350  Then the Federal Reserve Chairman testified here in Washington last week that in order to try to balance our budget, gosh, maybe senior citizens in our country would have to take a $10 a month reduction in their cost-of-living allowance under their Social Security. That is not exactly what I had in mind for the seniors in my district, but the very same organizations, the U.S. Treasury, which cut the interest rates to our bond buyers, and the Federal Reserve, which has told our seniors, ``Sorry, you are getting too much money,'' now they have pledged the full faith and credit of this Government to another nation. I find it very interesting.  What is so reprehensible to me is when I first got here in Congress in the 1980's, I came here because of the high unemployment in my district. I was appointed to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.  The very first bill that I came up with on that committee was to try to find a way to help the people in my district to hold onto their homes. We had a bill that would have prevented foreclosure.  We had a bill that said, ``Look, we will create a   second mortgage, and for those of you where the bankers are at your door, the creditors are at your door, we will give you a second mortgage. It will be short term. After a year you will have your job back and you will be able to stay in your house and continue to earn money at your job.''  They have a good credit history. We were only asking for a short-term add-on to their mortgage. It was guaranteed by the collateral of the house itself. They had to pay it back, and the political situation in Toledo, OH, is pretty stable.  Guess what, we could not get that bill through the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of this Congress. We couldn't help our own people with any kind of guarantee to hold on to their own homes.  Yet, now, another nation comes and is in trouble, and we are willing to pledge $40 billion in loan guarantees plus $18 billion. They already have the lines open to Mexico as of last week. I would find the whole situation absolutely amazing if it weren't so upsetting, because it just goes to prove that those that have a lot have incredible political power in this city and around the world.  I have never seen the kind of people running around here to help my district when it was in recession that I have now seen running around this Congress and up and down Pennsylvania Avenue to try to bail out the Wall [[Page H315]] Street speculators who would not listen to us when we debated NAFTA last year. We tried to get provisions in there to protect our people, as well as to have a slower market opening mechanism so we would not have these kinds of dysfunctions as NAFTA kicked in. They wouldn't listen to us then. They have made billions already. We shouldn't pledge the full faith and credit of the taxpayers of our country.                          ____________________
