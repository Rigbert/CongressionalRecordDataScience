President, I was going to respond to Senator DeMint's amendment, but I see Senator Thune on the floor, and we are trying to alternate from side to side. It will take me about 10 minutes, but I yield to him.  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield to me for one comment. We are still working on a UC for setting up votes, and for the benefit of my colleagues, we think it is roughly sometime shortly after 4 p.m., but we haven't completed the unanimous consent agreement as yet. But for the information of colleagues, we are working on a series of 13 votes at least.  Thanks.
