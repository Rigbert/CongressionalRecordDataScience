Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an individual who has been a tireless supporter of education in my congressional district. My congressional district has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live. Diana Poulton is one of these individuals.  Over the last four years, Diana has been actively involved with the Science and Technology Education Partnership (STEP), a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring students to pursue science and technology careers. As the Honorary Chairman of STEP, I have witnessed first-hand Diana's deep commitment and dedication to building a brighter future for students in the Inland Empire.  The flagship program for STEP is the annual STEP Conference, which hosts thousands of 4th through 8th grade students at a fun-filled learning event dedicated to the exciting world of science and technology. This conference puts thousands of students in contact with some of the top science and technology companies and organizations, which they might otherwise never experience in their school career. With the increasing demands for science and technology workers and the diminished supply in our region, the STEP Conference is one of the largest in California and serves as a spark to ignite the imagination of young minds.  This successful conference takes a great amount of time and energy to plan and Diana is an integral part in the planning and execution of the event. It is not uncommon for her to work after-hours to ensure the conference will be a success. Not only is she an inspiration to the students but also to the volunteers who know they can count on her to answer their questions or help them in any way. Diana serves a vital role to the STEP organization and I commend her commitment to STEP, students and education. As a member of the Science Committee, I am thankful for people like Diana Poulton because she sets an example that will serve as a guiding light for others in the future.  Diana's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire in Southern California. She is part of the heart and soul of STEP and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend.                          ____________________
