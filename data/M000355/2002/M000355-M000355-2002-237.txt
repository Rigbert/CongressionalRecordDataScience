 Taylor. Bob recently announced that he will retire from his position as Dean of the College of Business and Public Administration at the University of Louisville. I want to thank Bob for his many years of service to the State of Kentucky and to the Nation.  Since Bob first came to UofL in 1984, the Business School has soared to new heights. Under Bob's leadership, the School has grown to include new undergraduate programs, as well as a masters of business administration, the masters of public administration, and a doctoral program in urban affairs. Thanks to Bob's vision, the School has also developed a top notch entrepreneurship program which has garnered national attention and has been recognized by Success Magazine as one of the best programs in America.  As much as he is recognized for his professional success, Bob is also a widely respected leader in the Louisville business community. Never one to seek the spotlight, Bob has repeatedly worked behind the scenes to facilitate communication among diverse groups in the community. He has helped bring people together time and time again such as with his work in helping develop Greater Louisville, Inc., and Leadership Louisville. Bob has played a critical role in the economic development of the Louisville area and his many contributions are greatly appreciated.  Prior to coming to the University of Louisville, Bob led a distinguished 20-year career in the United States Air Force. His military service began in 1961 when he was commissioned through the Air Force ROTC program. During his last ten years in the military, Bob was a professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1981 he retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel.  Although he will be retiring from his full time position as Dean of the Business School, Bob will continue to remain very active. In 2003, he has plans to spend time conducting research, studying and teaching. Ultimately, Bob intends to return to UofL in 2004 to teach at the Business School.  Bob Taylor's time as Dean of the College of Business and Public Administration at the University of Louisville may be coming to an end but his record of unwavering service will continue on for many years. On behalf of this body, I thank him for his dedication and contributions to Kentucky and this nation, and sincerely wish him and the entire Taylor family the very best as he moves into this next phase of life.                          ____________________
