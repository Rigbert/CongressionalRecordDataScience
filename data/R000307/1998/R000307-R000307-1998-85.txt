President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, July 15. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Wednesday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted, and there then be 20 minutes for the following Senators limited to 5 minutes each: Senators McCain, Coats, Lieberman, and Murray. I further ask that following that debate the Senate stand in recess until 11 a.m.
