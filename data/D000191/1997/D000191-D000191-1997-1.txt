Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am not particularly aware of the merits of this bill, but I would like to go to the procedure before us.  The House is being kept here because Republicans are unable to get the Committee on Rules to meet and bring forward the appropriations bills. We could bring those bills forward tomorrow in the regular order. There is no reason the House, which was kept in session until midnight or later 3 or 4 nights last weekend while they tried to force the votes on fast track, there is no reason to keep the House here again tonight.  So I would like to suggest, Mr. Speaker, that the other side consider where we are going. The gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] is here, and perhaps he has some news about the appropriations bill.
