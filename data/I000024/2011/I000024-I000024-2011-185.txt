President, we are trying to resolve one of the great problems I am sure my colleagues are sensitive to; that is, the infrastructure of this country. Today we have two witnesses next to each other, the head of the AFL-CIO and the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to show that liberals, conservatives, labor, and industry all feel this should be at least the second highest priority in America.  When I heard the President's budget yesterday and I looked at it, I shook my head in disbelief: $8.7 trillion in new spending, $1.6 trillion in new taxes--all these things. I remembered back when I was complaining in 1996 at this very podium during the Clinton administration. That was his budget. It was $1.5 trillion. Do my colleagues know that the deficit in this President's budget is greater than the entire budget of 1996--to run this whole thing called America. It was a shocker to me. It reminded me about how people talk about entitlements and how we are going to have to do something with that.  Something we can do right now is something I tried to do last year and the House Members are trying to do right now. When the President gave his message, he talked about how he was going to freeze nondefense discretionary spending and everyone applauded, thinking that was a great austerity program. In reality, he is talking about after he has increased it from 2008 levels to 2010 levels and then freezing in those increases. That is what I find unreasonable.  So I am reintroducing S. 360--I have a whole lot of cosponsors--to wind back the discretionary spending to 2008 levels and then freeze it at 2008 levels.  I will just tell you, briefly, what the bill does. It reduces the nonsecurity spending to 2008 levels and will hold it there for 5 years through 2016. After that, spending will be allowed to increase with the CPI of inflation between 2017 and 2021. The amount of money saved by this in that period of time would be over $1 trillion.  If I can put up the chart. This chart shows what is going to happen if we don't do that. The red is what is projected in the President's budget; the blue is what is projected if we are successful in doing this. I am very proud the House of Representatives Republicans in their budget have included my bill I introduced last year and that I am reintroducing today as S. 360 as part of their budget. I think it is responsible. We will be looking forward to getting cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By Ms. Collins:  S. 361. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
