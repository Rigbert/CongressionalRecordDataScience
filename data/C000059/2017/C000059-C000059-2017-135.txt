Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the communityof Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, California are exceptional. On Saturday, February 11, 2017 Natasha Johnson will be honored as the Citizen of the Year by the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.

In 2012, Natasha was elected to the Lake Elsinore City Council, where she continues to serve after being re-elected in 2016. As an elected official, Natasha has worked tirelessly to establish a more sustainable economic development base in Lake Elsinore to create more jobs and demonstrate that our community is a great place for families to live, work and play.  Natasha has served our region through her participation in organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America, H.O.P.E, Operation Homefront, and New Song. She also serves on the Board of Directors for the Elsinore Woman's Club, Boy Scout Advisory, and United Way. Natasha is also a past President for the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.  In light of all that Natasha has done for the community of Riverside County and the city of Lake Elsinore, it is only fitting to honor her as Citizen of the Year.
