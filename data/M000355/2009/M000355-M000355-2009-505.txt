 President, I listened carefully to the remarks of my friend the majority leader about the amendment process. I certainly commend him for the way in which we have operated this year. As he well knows, 41 Republicans signed a letter to him a couple months ago indicating this is an issue about which Republican Members, regardless of their particular political philosophy--and we do have lots of different philosophies represented in those 41 Members--felt very strongly about. I commend the majority leader for responding. I think it has given the Senate an opportunity to operate again such as it did in the past. I think Members are, by and large, on both sides of the aisle, comfortable with voting. People send us here to vote. My 41 Republicans represent half the American population, and they are certainly entitled to have their say. I think we are operating in a way that is widely accepted and popular on both sides of the aisle.                          ____________________
