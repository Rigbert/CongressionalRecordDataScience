President, I thank my principal cosponsor of this legislation, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, for his contributions to this bill. We found that Maine and Wisconsin have many similar problems in ensuring that there is an adequate supply of dentists in our more rural parts of our State.  It is our hope that this legislation will be considered and enacted this year.
