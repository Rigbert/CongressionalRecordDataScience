Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Maj. Gen. C. ``Dean'' Sangalis on his receipt of the 1997 Navy Award. Today, Dean will be presented with this award at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, IN, where there will be a testimonial luncheon featuring time-honored military customs and traditions. The Navy Award is bestowed upon individuals who have demonstrated outstanding achievements, dedication, and years of honorable service to their God, country, branch of service, and community.  Throughout his life, Dean Sangalis has served as an exceptional example of a good American. As a U.S. Marine and World War II veteran, Dean has demonstrated the enduring qualities of loyalty, honor, and service to our country. In 1946, at age 19, Dean enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and, shortly thereafter, served with the 1st Service Battalion, 1st Marine Division, in Tientsen, China, and the 1st Marine Provisional Brigade on the island of Guam. He completed his initial tour of duty in April 1948, as a member of the All Navy Olympic Wrestling Team at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. Dean was again called to active duty in June 1952, and began his rise up the ranks in September of that year when he was commissioned a second lieutenant. While on active duty, Dean served as a platoon commander of I Company, 3d Battalion, 9th Marines in Japan, and I Company, 3d Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in Korea. He completed his tour of duty with the Marine Detachment, Great Lakes, IL.  Dean Sangalis further excelled during his 30 years of service as a Marine reservist. Some of his accomplishments in this capacity included serving as commanding officer in various companies and fulfilling high-level administrative responsibilities. During Dean's assignment as commanding officer of the 2d Battalion, 24th Marines, the battalion was awarded the General Harry Schmidt Trophy as the most outstanding infantry battalion in 1971. Dean also served as: director of the Marine Corps Reserve Support Center in Kansas City, MO; assistant division commander, 4th Marine Division, New Orleans, LA; and commanding general, 2d Marine Amphibious Brigade. Dean was promoted to major general on May 18, 1985, and received his last designated assignment as commanding general, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, NC, in 1986. Maj. Gen. Sangalis joined the retired reserves on December 1, 1987.  In addition to his outstanding military career, Dean Sangalis secured a successful professional career within the insurance industry. From 1959 to 1992, Dean was district agent for Northwestern Life Insurance Co., specializing in a variety of areas within the field. While with Northwestern Life, Dean has served as a member of several prominent professional organizations, and has received numerous honors, including the 1975 State of Indiana Underwriter of the Year Award.  Over the years, Dean Sangalis has also devoted countless hours to many volunteeragencies in Indiana's First Congressional District. Dean has served as chairman of the American Cancer Society, fundraiser for the YMCA, and a member of the board of directors for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana. He is also a member of the Merrillville Rotary Club and the Schererville Chamber of Commerce. Currently, Dean is on the fundraising committee of Trade Winds Rehabilitation Center. In recognition of Dean's outstanding volunteer leadership, the Northwestern Mutual matching gifts plan for agents and employees will present him with a $5,000 check for the Northwest Indiana Boys and Girls Club later this month.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Maj. Gen. C. Dean Sangalis on his receipt of the 1997 Navy Award. Dean's wife, Velda, their children, Callista, Theodore, Vanessa, and Christopher, and five grandchildren can be proud of his accomplishments. His strong devotion to country, and service to his community, truly embody the spirit of volunteerism.                          ____________________
