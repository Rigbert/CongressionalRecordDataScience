 President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates and committee allocations for budget year 2015 pursuant to section 116 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today, I am adjusting those levels.  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. On May 22, the Committee on Appropriations reported one bill that is eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act: the Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which includes $100 million in budget authority and $43 million in outlays that is designated as disaster funding.  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a total of $100 million in budget authority and $43 million in outlays. I am also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the appropriations committee for 2015 by $100 million in nonsecurity budget authority and $43 million in total outlays.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the changes to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the budgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: BUDGETARY AGGREGATES--PURSUANT TO SECTION 116 OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET   ACT OF 2013 AND SECTION 311 OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974                            [$s in millions]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    2014         2015------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..........................    2,842,558    2,939,993    Outlays...................................    2,819,514    3,004,163Adjustments:    Budget Authority..........................            0          100    Outlays...................................            0           43Revised Spending Aggregates:    Budget Authority..........................    2,842,558    2,940,093    Outlays...................................    2,819,514    3,004,206------------------------------------------------------------------------REVISIONS TO THE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAY ALLOCATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015                   PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 302 AND 314(a) OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974                                            [In millions of dollars]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Current                               Adjusted                                                          allocation/limit     Adjustments*     allocation/limit----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fiscal Year 2015:    Revised Security Category Discretionary Budget                 521,272                  0            521,272     Authority.........................................
