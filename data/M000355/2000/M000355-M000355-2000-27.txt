 President, I rise today to honor my good friend, the twentieth President of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, John Roush.  I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to John Roush, the students and faculty at Centre College, and the City of Danville, Kentucky for their successful bid to host the only vice presidential debate of the 2000 election. Under the leadership of John Roush, the college and the community worked together to make the debate at Centre College a reality.  By all accounts, the debate in Danville was a success. Even though Centre College is the smallest higher-education institution to have ever hosted a presidential or vice presidential debate, they exceeded expectations and pulled-off a top-rate event. The town and college coordinated events throughout the day of the debate to build anticipation and provide opportunities for those who did not have tickets to participate in the occasion. An outdoor concert, open to the public, was held on Centre's campus and featured Maysville native and celebrity Nick Clooney, gospel singer Larnelle Harris, and the Owensboro Symphony Orchestra. Then, attendees were treated to a live, big-screen viewing of the vice presidential debate.  President John Roush's fingerprints were all over the events of the day; his creativity and ingenuity a benefit to everyone who participated. Whether you watched the debate from the screen on Centre's lawn, the seats of Centre's Norton Center for Fine Arts or on television in your home, the professionalism with which John led the extensive preparations for the debate were apparent.  Just talk to anyone at Centre College, in Danville, or in all of Kentucky for that matter--they will tell you that in the two years John has served as president at Centre, he has rallied students, faculty, and city residents with his passion for excellence. He has been described by his peers and co-workers as having an ``infectious enthusiasm'' and being ``full of integrity.'' He has been characterized as ``energetic'' and ``impressive.'' I know from my own personal experience with and observation of John that all of these descriptions are true. I am proud to call him a fellow Kentuckian and friend.  At this point, Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record an excerpt from an October 7, 2000, editorial by Washington Post writer David Von Drehle that ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal, which perfectly sums up the atmosphere in Danville, KY, on the day of the debate.       Centre College hosted the debate. This unlikely setting--     far from the nearest airport, in a place without many four-     lane roads, in fact--turned out to be one of the best ever.      The whole day was a happy pageant of Norman Rockwell meets      Alexis de Tocqueville.       Tired and jaded political junkies stepped from their cars      and buses into an afternoon that was either the very end of      summer or the very beginning of fall. Clear sky, warm sun,      fresh breeze. Though the trees all appeared to be green, a      few golden leaves began to drift toward the grass of the      college common as evening approached.       On the common, bands played marches and choirs sang gospel      hymns. Hours before the debate began, the gently sloping      ground filled with grandparents on lawn chairs and moms and      dads on blankets and children who twirled and ran and tumbled      and plucked     leaves from their hair. There were young men in shorts and      their sweethearts in sun dresses enjoying the day and      preparing to watch the clash on giant screens.       Speakers read passages from great documents of American      history--the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburn      Address--and an orchestra played the national anthem and ``My      Old Kentucky Home.'' Kids waved flags.  There are no words I can add to more accurately describe the picture-perfect day John Roush orchestrated at Centre College on October 5, 2000.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I applaud you, John Roush, for what you have accomplished at Centre College and thank you for your commitment to higher education.                          ____________________
