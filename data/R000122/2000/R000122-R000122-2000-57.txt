President, this amendment would increase funding for GEAR UP by $100 million. GEAR UP is a critical component of our efforts to provide disadvantaged young people a chance to go on to college. GEAR UP reaches out very early in their educational careers, giving them the mentoring, the support, and the information necessary to succeed, not only in high school but to go beyond, to enter and complete college.  I offer this amendment along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Murray. We are offering it because we believe--as I am sure everyone in the Chamber believes--that the opportunity to go on to postsecondary education is central to our country and central to our aspirations in the Senate.  This opportunity is particularly difficult to achieve if one is a low-income student in the United States. The GEAR UP program is specifically designed to reach out early in the career of a child, the sixth or seventh grade, and give them not only the skills but the confidence and the expectation that they can succeed and can go on to college. Both these skills and information, together with the confidence that they can succeed, are essential to their progress and to our progress as a Nation.  GEAR UP is based upon proven early intervention models such as the I Have a Dream Program and Project GRAD. These programs have succeeded in improving low-income student achievement, high school graduation rates, and college enrollment rates. We are building on a successful set of models.  GEAR UP provides students with very specific services tailored to help them prepare for college. These services include tutoring, mentoring, and counseling. They are critical to ensure that students are equipped both academically and emotionally to succeed in college. We often hear about the lack of opportunities available to low-income families. This is particularly the case when we talk about entering and succeeding in college. Low-income children are the least likely individuals in the United States to attend college. In fact, if we look at high-achieving students from low-income schools and backgrounds, they are five times less likely to attend college as comparable students in higher-income schools across this country. By focusing on college preparation for these needy students, GEAR UP is directly targeted at eliminating this disparity.  There is something else that is important about GEAR UP. There are many talented young people who, if they are the first child in their family to seriously contemplate college, do not have the advantage of parents who are knowledgeable about the system. Their parents often do not have the information and the incentives to provide the kind of support and assistance these young people need. That, too, must be addressed, and GEAR UP does that.  In fact, GEAR UP addresses the needs not only of students but also of parents. In a recent survey, 70 percent of parents indicated they have very little information or they want more information about which courses their child should take to prepare for college. Eighty-nine percent of parents wanted more information about how to pay for college. This information disparity is particularly acute in low-income areas. Again, GEAR UP provides that type of information and assistance.  It is well documented that continuous programs that are integrated into the daily school life of a child are the best types of programs to provide for successful outcomes. That is exactly what GEAR UP does. It starts early in a career, sixth and seventh grade, follows the child through their middle school years and into high school, and is integrated with other subjects so there is both continuous support and an integrated approach to preparing a child for college.  GEAR UP does this through partnerships and collaborations among State departments of education, high-poverty school districts, institutions of higher education, businesses, and other private or non-profit community organizations. GEAR UP is a college preparatory program, a Federal program that focuses on children in early grades. As such, the existence of other programs such as TRIO does not eliminate the need to fully fund GEAR UP. We have to recognize that we have not only the responsibility but also an opportunity to fully fund the GEAR UP program.  I commend Senator Harkin and Senator Specter. They have dealt with a variety of educational issues in a budget that constrains their choices--indeed, their desires--significantly. They have done remarkable work, including funding for the LEAP program, which provides low-income students with funds to go to college. But if you don't have the first piece, if you don't have a GEAR UP program that gives students the skills, the confidence, the insights to get into college, Pell grants and LEAP grants are irrelevant because these deserving young students won't even be in the mix.  GEAR UP is important. It is fundamental. The budget that Senators Specter and Harkin were dealing with did not give them the full range of choices they needed to ensure they could fund these important priorities. That is why we are here today, to provide a total of $325 million for GEAR UP, an increase of $100 million over what is in this current appropriations bill. If we do this, it will allow every State to have a GEAR UP program. As a result of the additional $100 million, GEAR UP would serve over 1.4 million low-income students across the country. That would be a significant and commendable increase in our efforts.  If we don't provide this full $325 million, we will see over 400,000 needy students denied essential academic services which are provided through GEAR UP. Without this amendment, the need for these types of skills and support systems will not be met.  Furthermore, the demand for GEAR UP is not being met. In 1999, GEAR UP received 678 partnership and State grant applications covering all 50 States. However, due to limited resources, only one out of four partnerships and half of the State applications could be funded. Clearly, the need is there. The demand is there. We must meet it with sufficient resources.  Today GEAR UP's reach is limited because of the constraints on our appropriations. We need to provide sufficient resources so we can do our best toreach all the needy students in the United States.  My home State of Rhode Island was fortunate to be one of the States to receive GEAR UP funding. The current Rhode Island GEAR UP program is comprised of a partnership of 21 nonprofit organizations known as the College Access Alliance of Rhode Island. They reach out to schools. They reach out to homes. They provide community support, a network which helps these young students understand their potential and tells them: Yes, you can go on to college; yes, you can succeed; yes, you can be part of this great American economy and this great American country.  Providing these resources has helped countless young Rhode Islanders to reach their full academic potential. In just one year, Rhode Island GEAR UP has provided invaluable services. It has helped 1,300 students enroll and participate in summer academic programs. It has tracked the academic progress of over 8,000 highly mobile, disadvantaged students. They move many times from school to school, city to city. Rhode Island GEAR UP has been able to track these youngsters, keep in contact with them, keep encouraging them, keep getting them ready to go on to college. It has also identified 1,000 low-income students in need of extra support. It has linked these students to academic tutoring and mentoring, the kind of help they need to succeed.  Although these are impressive numbers, because of limited resources we currently cannot duplicate this type of effort in every State, in every community across the country. I believe we should.  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy and Murray. It is also supported by a broad coalition of interested groups: the United States Student Association, the California State University; the College Board, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Community Colleges, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, the American Association of University Women, the American Counseling Association, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the National Association of State Boards of Education, and the National PTA.  I have a letter representing their support. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            United States Student Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2000.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of the undersigned, I wish to      express my strong support and appreciation for your amendment      to provide $325 million for GEAR UP in FY 2001.       As you know, early intervention and mentoring programs      drastically increase the chances that low-income students      will attend and graduate from college. GEAR UP takes a unique      approach to early intervention. First, GEAR UP involves whole      cohorts of students, beginning in middle school and extending      throughout high school. Research clearly demonstrates that we      must help students to begin preparing for college no later      than the middle school grades.       Second, GEAR UP is sparking the development of university/     K-12 partnerships that often include businesses and      community-based organizations. In fact, more than 4,500 big      and small businesses, community-based organizations,      religious and civic organizations, chambers of commerce, and      others joined the states, universities, and middle schools      that submitted applications for the first round of GEAR UP      awards in 1999. Clearly, our nation's business and community      leaders recognize that the quality of tomorrow's workforce      depends, in large part, upon what we do today to prepare      middle and high school students for the rigors of college-     level work.       Because such programs are crucial to increasing access to      higher education, we believe that it is important to point      out that the undersigned strongly support all efforts to      increase access through early intervention programs,      including TRIO. Although the objectives of these programs are      similar, the approaches that TRIO and GEAR UP employ are      quite different. In view of the tremendous challenges we face      in breaking down the barriers to college attendance for      students from low-income families, we also support funding      the TRIO program at the highest possible level.       Some $231 million in FY01 funding is needed just to keep      year-one and year-two GEAR UP grantees on their current      trajectory. Should the Senate fail to adopt your amendment,      needy students in communities that have not yet received GEAR      UP grants will be denied the opportunity to gain the skills      and information essential for going to college.       Senator Reed, we thank you for all you are doing to ensure      that the door to higher education is opened wide to low-     income students in Rhode Island and throughout our nation.       With best regards,           Sincerely,                                             Kendra Fox-Davis,                                                        President,                            The United States Student Association.
