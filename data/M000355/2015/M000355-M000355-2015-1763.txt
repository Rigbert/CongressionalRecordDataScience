 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today Democrats voted to continue blocking funding for the Department of Homeland Security to protect actions President Obama himself referred to as ``ignoring the law.'' The vote came after a Federal judge enjoined the administration from moving ahead with that overreach. I was certainly glad to see that court decision. The issue will continue winding its way through our courts. In the meantime, Congress is trying to do what it can. Yet even Democrats who had previously been critical of the President ``ignoring the law'' voted again today to defend his overreach.  My preference is still to debate and pass the funding legislation that is currently before us. It has already passed the House. It is the simplest and easiest way forward. If Democrats think it needs to be amended, I am sure they will try to do that, but first we need to bring it to the floor. As long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even doing that, the new bill I described offers another option we can turn to. It is another way to get the Senate unstuck from a Democratic filibuster and move the debate forward.                          ____________________
