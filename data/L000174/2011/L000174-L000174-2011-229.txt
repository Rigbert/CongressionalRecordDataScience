President, I have worked on efforts to prevent the diversion of fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for years. When the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, took on the issue, I urged him to work with me, to withhold the amendment during the Judiciary Committee's consideration of the bill, and I would work with him to include improvements on the Senate floor.  I did. I kept my word. In fact, I included language he drafted in the managers' amendment and worked hard to pass it despite the misgivings of several Senators on both sides of the aisle.  However, when our bill went over to the House of Representatives, they preserved the principle against fee diversion but changed the language. The language of the bill is that which the House devised and voted to include as worked out by the House Republican leadership to satisfy House rules. The provisions Senator Coburn had drafted--and I understand may offer with his amendment--apparently violate House rule 21, which prohibits authorizing legislation from converting discretionary spending into mandatory spending. So instead of a revolving fund, the House established a reserve fund.  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make important improvements to ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are used for USPTO activities. That office is entirely fee-funded and does not rely upon taxpayer dollars, but it has been and continues to be subject to annual appropriations bills. That allows Congress greater opportunity for oversight.  The legislation that passed the Senate in March would have taken the Patent and Trademark Office out of the appropriations process by settingup a revolving fund that allowed the PTO to spend all money it collects without appropriations legislation or congressional oversight. But instead of a revolving fund the House formulation against fee diversion establishes a separate account for the funds and directs they be used for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The House forged a compromise with its appropriators to reduce any incentive to divert fees from the PTO and to provide the PTO with access to all fees that it collects while keeping the PTO within the normal appropriations process with the oversight that process includes. The America Invents Act thus creates a new Patent and Trademark fee reserve fund into which all fees collected by PTO in excess of that amount appropriated in a fiscal year are to be deposited. Fees in the reserve fund may only be used for operations of the PTO. In effect, they are doing what we have asked but staying within the House rules.  In fact, in addition, the House appropriators agreed to carry language in their appropriations bills that would guarantee that fees collected by the PTO in excess of the appropriated amounts would remain available to the PTO until expended and could be accessed by the PTO through reprogramming procedures without the need for subsequent legislation.  This may sound kind of convoluted, but what a number of people, including Senator Coburn, wanted to do was to make sure the fees went to PTO. I happen to agree with that. What the House did has the effect of making sure the fees go to the PTO.  What I hope we not do now is try to offer amendments that may change that and in effect kill the bill. Through the creation of the reserve fund, as well as the commitment by House appropriators, H.R. 1249 makes important improvements in ensuring that user fees collected by the PTO for services are used by the PTO for those services.  So while I oppose fee diversion, I also oppose the Coburn amendment, and I will tell you why. After 6 years of work getting this bill here, this may kill the bill over a formality: the difference between a revolving fund and a reserve fund. One would be hard-pressed to know what the difference is except it would kill the bill. It would require the House to consider the whole bill again. They spent days and weeks in heavy debate working out their compromise in good faith. It was worked out by the House Republican leadership. There is no reason to think that having done that, they are going to reconsider and allow the original Coburn language to violate the rules and avoid oversight.  In fact, I ask that a letter from Congressmen Rogers and Ryan to Chairman Smith be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.     Hon. Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Chairman Smith: It is our understanding that H.R. 1249, the      America Invents Act, is likely to be considered on the House      floor in the upcoming weeks.       As you know, section 22 of H.R. 1249 would strike the      current appropriations account language for the Patent      Trademark Office (PTO), replace it with a ``United States      Patent and Trademark Office Public Enterprise Fund,'' and      permit the PTO to collect and spend authorized fees--all      without requiring action or approval from Congress.       We strongly oppose this proposed shift of billions in      discretionary funding and fee collections to mandatory      spending. Putting PTO funding on auto-pilot is a move in      exactly the wrong direction, given the new Republican      majority's commitment to restraining spending, improving      accountability and transparency, and reducing the nation's      unparalleled deficits and debt.       Placing PTO spending on mandatory auto-pilot as outlined in      H.R. 1249 would also hand the Congressional ``power of the      purse''--bestowed in the Constitution--to the Obama White      House, and essentially eliminate the ability of Congress to      perform substantive oversight of the PTO. We strongly oppose      undermining these critical efforts, particularly when House      Republicans have pledged to strengthen oversight of federal      agencies to ensure resources are being used wisely and      appropriately, and to prevent federal agencies from over-     stepping their authority.       Oversight of the PTO belongs with the Congress, and should      not be abdicated to the Executive Branch of government.      Patent applications are filed by U.S. citizens and companies      from all 50 states and territories, ranging from as many as      66,191 from California, 16,545 from Texas, 15,258 from New      York, 8,128 from Ohio, 3,577 from Virginia, and 600 from      Nebraska in 2010. Virtually every Member of Congress      represents constituents who have a stake in the oversight of      PTO--and often businesses and livelihoods depend on actions      the agency undertakes. It would be both irresponsible and      unwise to allow the PTO to operate solely under the authority      of bureaucrats and White House political appointees--without      being held accountable to the American public through their      elected Representatives in Congress.       Given these concerns, we ask that section 22 be deleted or      otherwise be modified prior to floor consideration in order      to strengthen oversight of this important agency, and to      ensure American citizens are getting the most from every      dollar.           Sincerely,     Harold Rogers,       Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations.     Paul Ryan,       Chairman, House Committee on the Budget.
