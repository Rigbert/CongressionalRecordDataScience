Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment only because of the offset.  The offset that we are talking about is taking money of the inspector general's office, which is our auditors, and we desperately need auditors in the Federal Government. We, as appropriators, are very reluctant to cut the inspector general's office in general.  I want to work with the gentlewoman. I recognize her passion to make sure that the good work that the Smithsonian does gets out to the general community throughout the United States. I am a big supporter of the Smithsonian. We have level-funded the Smithsonian Institution this year. Obviously, we are operating under difficult budget constraints.  We certainly support what the gentlewoman wants to do; we just don't support the offset in which she wants to do it with.
