 President, we have heard a great deal on this floor about the problem of drugs in this country. Senator Hatch, Senator Feinstein, Senator Moynihan, and others, have spoken eloquently about the personal and societal costs that we bear because of illegal drug use. Add in the abuse of legal drugs in this country and the costs are staggering.  The record of the harm done is clear. The facts accumulate in depressing measure, detailing the damage done to individuals, to families, to communities, and to our civic life. Drugs destroy a person's capacity to live a decent life. They contribute to a widening circle of hurt that goes far beyond any individual choice to use drugs.  Like a stone dropped into a pond, the ripples move outward in an ever-widening circle. The result is an arc of pain and loss that is no respecter of social position, education, age, race, or location. Nothing brought this home to me more forcefully than a letter I received recently from a constituent. A constituent whose family has borne the brunt of what illegal drug use truly means. We can pile up facts and figures. We have the numbing statistics. But these cold, sterile numbers do not bring home to us the true meaning of what is involved. In order to understand the circle of hurt, let me share with you this story. As the dismaying figures on family violence, crime, and drug-addicted babies only too clearly show, this record is not unique.  Although is it not unique, it is, nevertheless, a story whose very prevalence is part of the harm done everyday by illegal drug use.  Kay and Jim Degrado of Marshalltown, IA, a community of 25,000, know firsthand what the facts and figures mean. Some years ago, their son began experimenting with drugs at 9 and was an addict by 13. Nothing that these good people could do made a difference. They watched as their son slowly sank into addiction and a world of violence, drug dealing, and abuse. As with many families, they were unprepared to deal with the problems. Their son became an addict and a dealer.  At 26, during his second treatment episode, he met a 22-year-old prostitute and crack addict. They subsequently moved in together after they were expelled from the treatment program. In addition to living together, they also began dealing together. They had an 800 number, beepers, and a separate apartment to deal from. Sales helped them maintain a $1,500 a day habit. This in a town of only 25,000. It was at this time that the couple learned that they were to have a baby, the woman's second. The first child was raised in a drug-addicted household, with all the emotional scars that involves. The second child, Tomi, now four, suffered a worse fate. She was born addicted.  As the Degrado's learned, drug use damages the unborn child in profound ways. In ways that endure for a lifetime. Their granddaughter, young Tomi, was born with multiple problems. She has difficulty sleeping. She is averse to being touched. She's irritable and has a short attention span. In addition, she has difficulty swallowing, a common feature of drug-affected children. At four, she still must receive supplemental food and medication through a feeding tube in her abdomen. She is unable to use a spoon, lacking the coordination. The grandparents have adopted the child--after years of effort--and can give Tomi a loving home. But they can never heal the hurt. And there are many Tomis in this country.  According to some estimates, as many as 100,000 or more such babies are born every year to addicted mothers. The disabilities are lifelong. Tomi requires constant medical attention. And she has learning disabilities that will affect her as long as she lives. But this is not the end of the story. As with Tomi's parents, many addicts have more than just one child. These children are born addicted. Or they come into drug-using homes where physical and sexual abuse are common. Tomi has an older half-sister, and her mother is pregnant again.  Fortunately, the Degrados' son is in treatment, again, after two suicide attempts and numerous relapses. He visits his daughter but has not taken an active role in her life. It is still unclear if he will stay clean and sober. If he does, and I wish him well, it will come at great effort, one that will occupy him for the rest of his life.  And the cost? The monetary costs, of course, have been enormous. But that is only a small part of the expense. From the seemingly individual choice to use drugs, the Degrados' son, destroyed his own life. He brought pain and suffering to his family. It is a pain that still remains. In addition, he also fathered a child born with lifelong disabilities. Pushed drugs to others. And engaged in numerous crimes. From his one act, a decision to use drugs, the circle of hurt spreads outward in ever-widening arcs. That is the reality of drug use. The damage and harm are personal, immediate, and enduring.  Yet, what we hear from many these days--from some of our cultural and political elite--is that we should legalize such drugs. That we should makethem widely available. The common argument is that we should not interfere with a personal choice. A choice which is, according to the argument, a victimless crime. No one is harmed. What a cruel and insensitive lie that is. No wonder so many decent people like the Degrados feel like the country, or its culture leaders, has taken leave of its senses.  And one finds the argument and its logical consequences increasingly prevalent. Recently, a member of my staff learned that a bookstore right here in the Washington area had a whole display on how to process your own drugs at home. The display was full of books on how to start your own drug business in the comfort of your living room. This in a store in a suburban shopping mall frequented by teenagers and families. This is reminiscent of the 1960's. That was the last time we flirted with the ``drugs-are-OK-for-everybody'' theme. But this is not the 1960's and I had hoped that we had learned something from our past. Seemingly not. At least not some.  Turn on MTV or listen to much of the popular music these days and you get the drugs-are-OK message. First, leading political figures and cultural gurus openly discuss the idea of making drugs readily available at over-the-counter prices. Second, newspaper editors flirt with the idea of legalization. Third, movies and TV shows are once again introducing drugs as okay into their plots. Fourth, many of our political leaders are sending confusing messages. So far, the most notable comment from the President on drug use was, ``I didn't inhale.'' Just think of the unfortunate signal that sends, however inadvertent. And fifth, one of the most remembered policy recommendations from this administration was the call by the Surgeon General for legalization.  Lately we have William F. Buckley, Jr., repeating the legalization theme. And he is in good, or rather, bad company. Some newspapers, magazines, and a variety of pundits have picked up the theme. This does not mean, however, that this is an idea whose time has come. All of this fulminating over the virtues of drugs or the harm caused by preventing people from self-administering deadly substances, is limited to a few, if well-financed, individuals. But their voice has a disproportionate access to the media. A media that then broadcasts and enlarges on the theme, making it seem more influential than it really is. Unfortunately, this posturing encourages young people to dismiss not only the harm that drugs cause but to question whether it is wrong to use drugs. And so, the hurt goes on.  After years of decline, after years in which teenage attitudes toward drugs was moving in the right direction, we now see dramatic reversals in teen drug use, heading back up. More disturbing, we see a decline in negative attitudes to drug use. We have not yet returned to the 1979 levels of abuse, but we have made notable gains in that direction. As recent studies show, an increasingly large percentage of high school kids now report frequent marijuana use. The age at which use is beginning is also dropping. Experts now recommend that we must begin our antidrug prevention message in grade school.  Meanwhile, the casualties mount. The most recent data, released by the drug czar's office, confirm--as if more confirmation was necessary--that drug use is on the rise, especially among kids. This is particularly true of marijuana use. As we learned to our regret, marijuana is a gateway drug for further substance abuse. Heroin use is also on the rise. And much of the West and Middle West face a growing problem of methamphetamine use--the so-called workingman's cocaine. This drug is responsible for dramatic increases in family violence, in violent crime, and in hospital emergencies. What the numbers tell us is a depressing story of returning drug abuse.  We are still dealing with an addict population created by the drugs-are-OK argument from the 1960's and 1970's. Our current hardcore addicts were the 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds of then. Today we are putting our 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds at risk. We are mortgaging their futures and the lives of everyone they touch. We are exposing them to a cycle of hurt and suffering. I can imagine few more irresponsible acts. The last time we did it unconsciously or by inattention. If we do this again, we can make no claim to ignorance. We cannot appeal to our innocence. What we do now, we do with full knowledge. We simply cannot let this happen again.  I would like to ask my colleagues to look at my remarks from the standpoint of it portraying the problem of drugs that a family in Iowa had, the Kay and Jim Degrado family of Marshalltown, IA. It tells a story about how early drug use of a child leads to greater and greater problems. It talks about crack babies, and in the case of this family a crack grandchild that has been adopted by this family--the problems that families get into down the road of time in prison; all the crime that comes from illicit drug use.  I compliment this family for sharing their story with me and the granting of permission to me to discuss this issue on the floor of the Senate.                          ____________________
