Speaker, it is with great pride that I pay tribute to my Croatian heritage. On Sunday, March 15, 1998, the Duquense University Tamburitzans performed at Merrillville High School in Merillville, Indiana. Following this event, there was a reception at Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge #170 in Merrillville, Indiana hosted by Lodge President Mrs. Elizabeth Morgavan.  Croatian Americans have played an integral role in the development and continued success of the United States of America. Beginning in early part of this century, thousands of Croatian people emigrated to the United States to seek a better and more prosperous life. Many Croatian immigrants came to major industrial centers such a Gary, East Chicago, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, and Detroit. The jobs that awaited them were not easy and the working conditions not always safe. Nonetheless, these brave people endured and succeeded to build better lives for themselves and their children.  I grew up in an ethnic neighborhood in Gary, Indiana. It was a neighborhood where names like Roganovich, Mudrovich, and Milosovich were more common that Smith, Baker, and Wilson. It was a well tended neighborhood where everyone knew the names of the people on their block. It was a neighborhood where hard work and mutual respect ruled the day.  On 38th and Madison, I learned the values which are so prominent in many of my Croatian brothers and sisters. I have seen first hand how faith, family, humility, determination, courage, concern, and appreciation of our shared heritage can build good character. Croatian immigrants did not have it easy in America. They had to fight to overcome language and cultural differences--but overcome they did. They made the steel that made the cars, machines, and engines that today has made America a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. For that, I am very proud. Croatian-Americans have played by the rules despite the heavy obstacles placed in front of them. For that, I am very proud. They have put God, family, and country at the top of the list. For that, I am very proud. Yes, I am proud to be a part of an ethnic group that has brought so much to the United States of America. Croatian Americans have truly lived the American dream. I will continue to fight to ensure that we continue to dream.                          ____________________
