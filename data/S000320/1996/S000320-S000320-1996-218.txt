 President, section 613 prohibits the executive department from pooling or passing the hat for funds. This amendment allows for agencies to contribute funds to Federal executive boards when they are created. It is very tightly written, and it is intended to meet specific problems faced by these boards.  It is my understanding it has been cleared on both sides.
