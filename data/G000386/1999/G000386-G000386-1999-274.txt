 President, this resolution I am offering with Senator Baucus calls for fair access to Japan's $35 billion telecommunications equipment market. Telecommunications is one of our most important exports and one of our most significant areas for future export growth.  Recently, the United States and Japan reached a new telecommunications procurement agreement covering procurement by the successor companies of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company. This agreement replaced the 1997 agreement that expired when the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company was restructured.  We have had many difficulties gaining access to Japan's telecommunicates market in the past, probably not too different from a lot of sectors as we try to enter our products into Japan. It may be nothing new in that respect, but this is a new agreement that will be in effect for 2 years, and we should give it a chance to work. But history shows we have not made much progress when it comes to implementing fair bilateral market access agreements with Japan.  You know the usual story: We are always overjoyed, after several months or even years of negotiating an agreement with the Japanese, that it has been some major breakthrough; and then down the road a few months or years, when you expect the agreement to be carried out--not only according to its word but also according to its spirit--you find the victory you anticipated and were thankful for at the time it was signed comes out to be a half a loaf or a quarter of a loaf in practice. I think that is what we are finding out here a little bit with this telecommunications agreement.  The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and the government in Japan, which owns 65 percent of the telecommunications group, have traditionally maintained that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is a private company which should not be subject to government interference but be allowed to make its own procurement decisions.  Our concern is that we need effective bilateral government oversight so Japan's telecommunications industry does not revert to its traditional reliance upon domestic suppliers and consequently circumvent this agreement. That is because Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's procurement history shows that even nearly two decades after the first bilateral agreement on this company's procurement, Japan still tends to make a large portion of its procurement from the ``NTT family'' of Japanese equipment makers; thus, not opening their markets to products from overseas, including U.S. products. Often, NTT over-engineers specifications, which in the past were very Japan-specific or company-specific--another nontariff trade barrier to keep out products from the United States and other countries.  World telecommunications trade is growing very rapidly, but global market access is not keeping pace with the fast pace of technology development. The Baucus-Grassley resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the only effective way for the United States to achieve significant market access in Japan is through Japan staying with serious and sustained deregulation and consequently having market opportunities for imports from other countries, including the United States.  This resolution carriers a message that ought to be heard loud and clear in the runup to the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference that will take place in Seattle at the end of November. So I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.                          ____________________
