 President, Members have been working toward an agreement on a continuing resolution that will fund the government and provide critical resources to support veterans and combat Zika. Senate Republicans stand ready to move forward with this important measure now.  I encourage our colleagues across the aisle to work with us to complete the negotiations so we can advance this important measure.                          ____________________
