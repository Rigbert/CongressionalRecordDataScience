 President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce legislation to standardize Medicare eligibility for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It is estimated that osteoporosis results in 1.5 million fractures and $20 billion in medical costs each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through the use of 1992 incidence data of bone fractures related to osteoporosis, determined that such fractures represent three percent of all Medicare costs. A recent report issued by the Alliance for Aging Research examined the dramatic savings realized when the onset of age-related disability is delayed. The report indicates that delaying the onset of osteoporosis by 5 years could save the economy up to as much as $10 billion annually.  In the state of Iowa, 15 percent of men and women over the age of 50, which is approximately 340,000 Iowans, have osteoporosis. Women are particularly prone to getting osteoporosis, which can lead to bone fractures that result in loss of independence and eventually to nursing home care. Early detection is critical, and there are effective treatments available to prevent bone mass deterioration. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Medicare currently covers bone mass measurement, which is the diagnostic tool used to detect osteoporosis. However, Medicare carriers have discretion regarding eligibility requirements. States cover bone mass measurement on a case-by-case basis; some States cover it when an individual is in the early stages of or already has the disease; and some States allow early detection of the disease based on whether or not the patient is at high risk of developing osteoporosis.  Medicare carriers in states such as Iowa and Maine promote early detection of osteoporosis by covering bone mass measurement for individuals at-risk of the disease. However, carriers in more than half the States do not allow testing until the person already has the disease or is at very high-risk of getting it.  The legislation I am co-sponsoring with Senator Snowe would help reduce the economic and social costs of osteoporosis through early detection of this crippling disease. The bill would establish uniform eligibility requirements for coverage of bone mass measurement, eliminating the variation in Medicare coverage that currently exists. It would not require that every individual be screened for the disease, only those that are considered at-risk. Medicare is a federal program where everyone pays 2.9 percent of their pay. Therefore, everyone deserves to have access to the same benefits.  I congratulate my colleague, Senator Snowe, for taking the lead on this very important health issue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
