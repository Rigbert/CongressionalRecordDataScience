You know, part of what Mexico owes is money that is owed on the old Brady bonds. For those of you who are TV junkies, maybe you know this, back in the 1980's, the early 1980's, there were all kinds of debt Mexico could not pay back. Then part of it was turned into these Brady bonds. The yield on Brady bonds was 40 percent.  Can you imagine, just think if you owned those bonds. So part of these are [[Page H386]] being rolled over as a part of this new debt that Mexico has to pay to its creditors.  Now, with this new group they are paying 20 percent at the moment, but, of course, it could go up. Would we not love for the depositors in our communities to be able to earn a 40-percent interest rate at their bank?
