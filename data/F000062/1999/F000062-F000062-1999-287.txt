  Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Colorado is on the floor. I really want to extend to him and to all of the people of Colorado my deepest sympathy and sorrow for the events yesterday. After I finish a brief global warming statement, I would like to make a more inclusive statement about the events that took place in Colorado, but I want him to know that my heart and thoughts are with him and the people of Colorado today.  Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate Earth Day tomorrow, I wanted to speak for a few minutes about what I consider to be the single greatest environmental threat facing our planet: the threat of global warming.  The phenomenon of global climate change really hit home for me in January of 1997. That year, devastating floods killed seven people and caused nearly $2 billion in damage in California. California is famous for its weather extremes, but the 1997 floods were unusual in terms of their ferocity, the loss of life they caused, and the tremendous property damage that occurred.  Even more striking, the 1997 flood was only one of four 100-year floods that occurred in California in the 1990s. Therefore, it certainly got my attention when I read that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency believes that major changes in the El Nino and La Nina ocean currents, which brought so much rain to California, may be linked to changes in the ocean's temperature.  Last fall, I received an in-depth briefing from Dr. John Holdren, the Teresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy and Director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at Harvard University. Dr. Holdren presented clear and compelling evidence to me that global warming is real. It is happening, and it will have significant impacts on human health, our environment, and our economy.  Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, however, literally every week my office receives bulletins from groups that continue to dispute the reality of global warming. Today I would like to lay out the evidence that global warming is indeed occurring.  There is overwhelming scientific consensus about the following facts: The natural greenhouse effect (which is primarily a product of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane) makes the earth habitable, keeping the average surface temperature about 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it would otherwise be.  Large increases in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities produce significant further global warming, accompanied by other changes in climatic patterns.  Today's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is about 30 percent higher than pre-industrial levels. The methane concentration is over 100 percent higher. These levels are higher than at any time in the last 160,000 years.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an assembly of 2,000 of the world's leading experts on climate and related disciplines, has found that human activities are increasing the greenhouse effect, and therefore raising the temperature of the planet. It is important to note that the IPCC includes scientists from all member states of the World Meteorological Association and the United Nations.  To quote the IPCC:       The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, and      among them, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have      grown significantly since pre-industrial times . . . These      trends can be attributed largely to human activities, mostly      fossil fuel use, land-use change and agriculture.      Concentrations of other anthropogenic greenhouse gases have      also increased. An increase of greenhouse gas concentrations      leads on average to an additional warming of the atmosphere      and the Earth's surface. Many greenhouse gases remain in the      atmosphere--and affect climate--for a long time.  The IPCC estimates that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have risen from 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution, to 360 parts per million today. By the end of the next century, the carbon dioxide level will be somewhere between 480 and 800 parts per million.  According to the IPCC, this change is ``unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. The balance of evidence, from changes in global mean surface air temperature and from changes in geographical, seasonal, and vertical patterns of atmospheric temperature, suggest a discernible human influence on global climate.''  Already, these increased greenhouse gas emissions are changing the earth's climate. Here are the facts:  The average temperature of the earth has risen 1.3 degrees in the last 100 years.  Ten of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last 12 years. 1998 was the hottest year on record.  The last 50 years appear to have been the warmest half century in 6,000 years, according to evidence from ice core samples.  Scientific evidence convincingly shows increased rates of evaporation and rainfall, glacier retreat, sea ice shrinkage, and rising sea levels.  The IPCC estimates that by 2100, the earth's temperature will have risen by two to six degrees. This rate of warming, if it were to occur, would be the fastest warming rate in the last 10,000 years.  Even if an overwhelming body of scientific evidence regarding global warming did not exist, the weather map alone would tell us something is wrong. According to the National Climatic Data Center, weather extremes are becoming more and more frequent: hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, flooding, droughts. So far this century, extreme weather events have increased by 20 percent. Annual precipitation is up 6 percent since 1900, and total winter precipitation is up 8 percent.  Just look at the period from November 1997 through July 1998, when a series of extreme weather events hit this nation. Northern California had its wettest May ever in 1998, with precipitation in at least one area hitting 800 percent of normal. Meanwhile, Texas suffered under a devastating drought, with San Antonio getting only 8 percent of its normal rainfall in May. In Florida last summer, the U.S. Forest Service estimated that 80 percent of the State was at a drought level equivalent to a desert. Ohio, the Upper Midwest, and New England had no shortage of rain, however; floods in those areas claimed 13 lives.  While individually none of these events can be linked directly to global warming, collectively they show a troubling pattern consistent with what the best science tells us global warming will look like.  Things could get worse. According to the IPCC, one third to one half of all mountain glacier mass could disappear in the next century. Melting glaciers, combined with melting of the antarctic ice shelves, could raise sea level by as much as three feet in the next 100 years. This could cause severe flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area, New Orleans, the Everglades, and the Chesapeake Bay.  The weather changes caused by global warming also could wreak havoc upon the environment and human health. The University of California estimates that global warming could render 20 to 50 percent of the State's natural areas unsuitable for the current species who live there. Major vegetation changes are occurring over one-eighth of the planet. The effects of global warming on human health, including outbreaks of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever, are so significant that I plan to discuss those separately in a floor statement soon.  Global warming is not a problem that we can afford to ignore or dismiss. The scientific evidence is overwhelming and persuasive, and we need to take steps now to reduce global warming. That is why I am circulating a letter, along with Senators Gorton and Bryan, that encourages the President to work with Congress to implement improved Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standards. Cars and light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, are responsible for 20 percent of all carbon emissions in the United States, and emit more carbon than all sources in Great Britain combined.  By raising fuel efficiency standards, we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 240 million tons per year. Thiswill help curb global warming, improve air quality, save consumers at the gas pump, and reduce our reliance on imported oil.  Stronger fuel efficiency standards alone will not solve the global warming problem, but they are a very good place to start. I am pleased to say that a bi-partisan group of 22 Senators have already signed the letter to the President, and I am hopeful that more will sign soon.  I also urge all of my colleagues--especially those who may remain skeptical about the existence of global warming--to attend a briefing that I am hosting on May 11 with scientists from the University of California, including Nobel Laureate Sherwood Rowland. These scientists will discuss recent satellite measurements concerning global climate change; disturbing new evidence that climate change may be occurring more abruptly than scientists had earlier forecast; and possible solutions to the problem.  Global warming is an extremely complicated issue, and I understand that a number of policy alternatives are currently on the table--from the Kyoto Protocol supported by President Clinton, to the ``Credit for Early Action'' bill sponsored by Senator Chafee, to the bill currently being drafted by Senator Murkowski. I do not presume to stand here today with a master plan for how to stop global warming.  But I do feel strongly that global warming's existence cannot be disputed. It is real. It could cause the greatest environmental crisis of our time. I hope that we can at least recognize the threat, and begin working together to address it.                          ____________________
