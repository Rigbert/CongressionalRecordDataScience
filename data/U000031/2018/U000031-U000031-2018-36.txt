Speaker, today I rise on behalf of the Michigan Congressional Delegation--Reps. Debbie Dingell, Tim Walberg, Dan Kildee, Bill Huizenga, Brenda Lawrence, Justin Amash, Mike Bishop, Dave Trott, Paul Mitchell, and Jack Bergman--to acknowledge and commend one of the finest public servants the Great State of Michigan has been blessed to have: Mr. William ``Bill'' McBride.  There has never been a better friend and advocate for Michiganders than Bill McBride.  Over the past 44 years of Bill's service he has earned immense respect for his integrity, sincerity, and civility. No matter which political party was in power, in any of the branches of government, our constant source of information and enlightenment was--and is still--Bill.  Bill's distinguished career includes serving as chief of staff to Michigan Delegation Members Carl Pursell and Vern Ehlers. He also served as deputy chief of staff for Governor John Engler and most recently director of Governor Snyder's federal office.  Bill is not just a beloved colleague and friend, he is a Michigan institution. ``Ask McBride'' has become a fond and common phrase for all of us. As loyal as the day is long, Bill has set the gold standard for public service.  Bill exudes kindness, a sense of humor, and a sense of fair play. Always.  They say home is where the heart is and Bill's has certainly always been Michigan. When any issue has arisen affecting our state, Bill has been in the thick of it. His hard work has had a positive impact that will ripple far beyond when he leaves public service. We are sure to confront many situations and challenges where we will dearly miss his sage counsel, wit, and wisdom. He will stay on speed dial for several of us on both sides of the aisle for years to come.  The Michigan Congressional Delegation stands today to wish Bill the very best of luck as he turns the page and moves on to write many more, which we are sure will be just as storied and successful.  God speed Bill, and I thank him from the bottom of our hearts.                          ____________________
