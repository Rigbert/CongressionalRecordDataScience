I might also say, during the course of the debate he raised an important issue--legal aid attorneys. These are attorneys who work primarily in the civil area, representing people of limited means. They are not very well paid. Many of them come out of law school facing debt on their own. We want to make sure that people, regardless of their economic status in America, have access to good legal counsel. So I have pledged to him--and I renew the pledge--that if there is a way for us to help the legal aid attorneys as well as defenders and prosecutors, we should.  It is in the best interests of our country to have competent counsel available for all Americans in terms of our civil and criminal justice systems. Think about how much we count on prosecutors to take the bad guys off the street and keep them off. We don't want somebody bungling a trial because of lack of experience or lack of skill. We want the best and brightest as prosecutors. Similarly, if the system is going to work and work well, there is a good attorney across the table defending the person who has beencharged so there truly is a contest that is respectful of our judicial system.  The same thing for legal aid attorneys. Whether they are representing people of modest means who are dealing with the daily drudgery of divorce or wills or landlord-tenant issues or small claims court, we want to make certain that those who are of modest circumstances in this country do not lose because the race always goes to the swift; that is, to those with more money.  I thank the Senator from Maryland for his commitment to this amendment and his general commitment to justice in this country.
