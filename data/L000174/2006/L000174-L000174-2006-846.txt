President, this evening, Senators will finally have the opportunity to vote to consider legislation which has been publicly debated and considered for several years. It is a bipartisan bill that is the product of lengthy and conscientious negotiation. We have held dozens of public hearings and committee markups. It has been an exemplary process.  I see the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania in the Chamber. He has arranged--I have lost count of the number of meetings where people from across the spectrum, political and otherwise, have had a chance to be heard--businesses, victims, labor, industry, everybody. It has been a great process. But with every day we delay consideration of this bill, victims are dying and more companies are going bankrupt. Both are tragedies for the families and victims, as well as for the workers and retirees and for the families who built these companies.
