 President, I rise today to honor Jonathan Cameron Boster, a fallen firefighter who gave his life in service to his community. While nearly 100 fire service personnel nationwide sacrifice their lives every year, Jon's death is even more poignant because he was just 19 years old.  At 10 p.m. on April 8, 1996, Grant County Fire District 5 was responding to a structure fire in Moses Lake, WA. The water tanker Jon was driving rolled off a curved rural road, killing him and injuring one other firefighter. Jon's comrades could not turn back because of their commitment to the community. They did what Jon would have done; they fought the fire.  Jon was a fun-loving young man with bright eyes and a charming smile. A Montana State all-star basketball player in high school, Jon also played football and ran track. He enjoyed water and snow skiing, fishing and hunting. Jon delighted in his niece and nephew and his greatest joy was playing with them.  His driving desire, however, was firefighting and his world revolved around his ambition. He was a resident firefighter and E.M.S. provider and a State-certified first responder and defibrillator technician. He planned to attend the Washington State Fire Academy.  Each October, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation holds a memorial in tribute to the firefighters who died the previous year. On October 5, 1997, Jon will be honored and a plaque listing his name and the names of each fallen firefighter will be unveiled and dedicated.  Every fallen firefighter is a hero, and each death a loss to an entire community. While Jon's death is sorrowful, we can take comfort in knowing that Jon gave his life in pursuit of his goal, racing not just to a fire, but toward a dream.                          ____________________
