 President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his work on this extremely important issue and wish him well as he offers this amendment next week on this important bill. I thank my colleagues for allowing us today to talk about issues that are really going to make a difference in our classrooms across the country.  Mr. President, across this country families are having conversations at their breakfast tables about how we can improve education. They are talking about reducing class size. They are talking about afterschool programs. They are talking about dropout prevention. They are talking about teacher training, because parents know that is what is going to make a difference for their own child, for their family, for their neighborhood, and for their community. That is the type of conversation we need to be having on this floor in this Senate in this Congress, as well. I am delighted that we are finally going to have the opportunity to do that.  Mr. President, I am pleased that one of the first bills that is going to be considered is S. 280, which is the Ed-Flex bill. It is a bill that will help States develop new and innovative programs, and it is an important issue and one that I am glad we are going to address and that I am happy to support.  I think it is really important to note that merely improving the process is not enough. We also have to make an immediate and a direct impact on the overcrowded classrooms that our children across this country find themselves in every single day in this country.  That is why I am going to be introducing an amendment that will authorize a 6-year effort to continue to help local school districts hire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers nationally to begin to reduce class size in first through third grade where it will have the most impact.  My amendment builds on the bipartisan success of last year's agreement. It is based on local control and flexibility, and it focuses on improving teacher quality, which is so important. Local school districts will make all the decisions about hiring and training their new teachers. Any school district that has already reduced class size in those early grades to 18 or fewer students will be able to use the funds to either further reduce class size in the early grades or to reduce class size in other grades or carry out activities to help improve teacher quality.  My amendment will also provide accountability and ensure that schools communicate with parents which is so essential today. These funds are supplementary, and they cannot replace current spending on teachers or teachers' salaries. School districts will be required to send a report card in easily understood language to their local community including information about how achievement has improved as a result of reducing class size, and they won't have to fill out any new forms. Reducing red tape and improving local decisionmaking in education programs is a bipartisan effort, and both Ed-Flex and my class size reduction amendment accomplish both.  Last year's bipartisan agreement that we reached included my legislation to provide $1.2 billion as a downpayment on the goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers, and it did it without requiring any new reports or any new forms. Governors and legislators across this country are now responding to our budget agreement last year and addressing this at their local levels. Local school districts are putting together their budgets right now as we speak and teachers are writing their lesson plans for next year with the expectation that we will deliver on the promise that we made to them last year. They are all counting on us. We must take this opportunity to now fulfill our commitment to reduce class size.  Mr. President, smaller classes mean a better education for children. Studies have shown it. Teachers know it. Parents know it. And they know it from experience. I have seen it with my own eyes. Controlling a room of 30 children is not teaching. It's crowd control. We need to return to teaching.  Just yesterday, I heard from Christi Rennebohn-Franz, who is a first and second grade teacher in Pullman, WA, and she wrote and told me that ``without small class sizes, we cannot reach all children and give them the time that they deserve. If you have too many students in your class, you go home every day knowing that you came up short giving them the attention they need.''  Another teacher from Fircrest, WA, wrote to me to say that ``since I teach at an at-risk school, lower class size means that I can more effectively work with students on a variety of problems they bring to my classroom every day.''  Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with Senators from both sides of the aisle to ensure that we meet our promise to these teachers and all the other parents and students across America to reduce class size and truly make a difference in the education of our children and our country's future.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
