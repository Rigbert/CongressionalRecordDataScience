Kiko. Phil was one of the first people I hired on my personal staff in 1979, when I was a freshman Member of Congress, and in the years since, he has become a close friend and confidant.  During my tenure on the House Committee on the Judiciary, a Committee upon which I have served throughout my tenure in this body and chaired from 2001 to 2006, Phil served the country and Committee ably by pushing through several pieces of legislation that, in my opinion, have made this country a better place. Just look at the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1982, a historic event that reaffirmed the promise of voting equality to millions of Americans. And then, as General Counsel and Chief of Staff to the Committee on the Judiciary last year, Phil led staff negotiations that led to near unanimous House and Senate passage of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act. His unique capacity to bridge partisan divisions to advance the promise of equality our Constitution provides to all of America's citizens best illustrates his unrivaled abilities as a consensus-builder and negotiator.  Moreover, the skills Phil demonstrated during consideration and passage of this legislation were applied to advance other legislation whose titles are as familiar as they are historic. Phil was a driving staff force behind congressional passage of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, which has been hailed by child safety and law enforcement groups as the most comprehensive federal child protection legislation in a generation.  And who can forget the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 which demonstrated fundamental vulnerabilities in America's law enforcement and intelligence communities. Phil played a central staff role in consideration and passage of the USA PATRIOT and USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, laws that have provided America's law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the tools necessary to detect, disrupt and deter terrorist attacks before they occur on American soil. Phil has also played pivotal roles in congressional passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, the Class Action Fairness Act, REAL ID Act, and other legislation that will distinguish his years of service to the Committee as among the most productive and meaningful in our Nation's history.  Madam Speaker, most Americans have probably never heard of Phil Kiko, but they have heard of the aforementioned bills he has worked on, and they have certainly been affected by them in some way, shape or form. Phil's tenacity and passion for working on ideals that he believed to be right and just often pushed him and those he worked with, to spend many a late night in the Capitol--but the benefits of his dedication went ultimately to Americans like you and me.  It is never easy to say goodbye, especially to one who has been by my side for decades. But I also know that there comes a time when we must all simply move on. That time has come for Phil Kiko, and so I stand before you, and the rest of my colleagues, and I ask you all to join me in wishing Phil all the best, as he takes his next step.  On behalf of the Committee on the Judiciary, the House of Representatives, and myself, I thank you Phil, for all your service to this Nation, and congratulate you on a job well done.                          ____________________
