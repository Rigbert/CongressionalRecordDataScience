Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend for yielding and her good work and leadership on this issue.  I say to my colleagues, this is the result of an enormous amount of bipartisanship. The legislation, division A, which deals with trafficking of women, we all know now that especially with the break up of the Soviet Union and the ascendancy of the Mob, organized crime in Moscow, in the Ukraine, and all around the world, is trafficking in women and children as never before.  The estimates are as high as 2 million individuals, mostly women, who are being trafficked every year. About 50,000 are coming into the United States, and many of those are forced into prostitution.  Our legislation, and, again I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson) who has worked so closely on this, has been very bipartisan. It throws the book at those who would commit these heinous crimes and make money off the exploitation of women and children.  Our legislation provides $95 million over 2 years for enforcement of anti-trafficking provisions. But, again, the life imprisonment aspect to it, the protection for the women themselves so they are not put on the next plane and sent back to Kiev or St. Petersburg or anywhere else where they might be in danger is very important. We try to put sandbags of protection around them and to say we will help you, we will give you a hand and assistance, and that is what this legislation does.  There are many other aspects to it. It is a comprehensive bill. We have had three hearings in my subcommittee on this issue, and we heard from the victims themselves, who talked about how even the NGOs, like Miramed in St. Petersburg, which is out there on the cutting edge trying to help these women, are under tremendous duress by the Mafia, as well as very much underfunded.  We want all of the world's governments, especially those that are countries of origination, to do all that they can to mitigate and hopefully end this egregious practice.  Division B, the Violence against Women Act, provides about $3.3 billion over 5 years, more than double the current programs, to increase law enforcement and expand shelter space and rehab programs for battered and abused women.  There are many, many important grants articulated in the legislation, like the $140 million for Violent Crimes Against Women on Campus Grants, to ensure that our young women on the college campuses are protected to the maximum degree possible, and then $60 million for the Safe Havens Project; and, very significantly, the money for the shelters is increased by $375 million to a total of $875 million to protect battered women and their children.                              {time}  1230  There is also legislation, as my colleagues heard, dealing with Aimee's Law. Aimee's Law passed overwhelming in this House. It ought to be part of this package, and it will hopefully prevent those who have high rates of recidivism, the rapists, the murderers so they do not get out early to recommit these crimes, because we know that there are thousands of those who commit the crimes upon their release.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule, and then I hope for support of the underlying conference report.
