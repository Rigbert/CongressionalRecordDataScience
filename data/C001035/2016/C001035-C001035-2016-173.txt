President, I am pleased to join some of my colleagues today to speak about the key role woody biomass can play in helping to meet our Nation's renewable energy needs.  Last night an amendment that several of us offered was adopted by a voice vote. I thank the sponsors of that amendment who have joined with me--Senator Klobuchar, Senator King, Senator Ayotte, Senator Franken, Senator Daines, Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch--all of whom worked hard to craft this important amendment.  There has been a great deal of misinformation, regrettably, circulated about the amendment, which I hope we will be able to clarify through a colloquy on the floor today. I know the lead Democratic sponsor of the amendment, Senator Klobuchar, would like to speak on it and has an engagement, so I am going to yield to her before giving my remarks. I thank her for her leadership.
