 We want to limit the trades to commercial trades that really have value to businesses rather than just speculators, as the leader said, clicking a mouse and moving around millions of dollars. And we want to offer this as an amendment.  I ask the majority leader, did we say to the Republican side: You can offer your own version of the speculation amendment, and you can try to strike ours, if you wish. Offer yours. But we are giving you the opportunity to offer your amendment, in your terms, with your substantive suggestions, and we will vote on each one of them. Is that the offer on the table to the Republicans?
