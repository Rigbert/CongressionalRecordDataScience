President, earlier today we heard a moving speech by the Democratic leader and my longtime friend, Harry Reid. He spoke of his life and his time here.  An amateur boxer turned police officer, turned lawyer, turned majority leader, that is the supercondensed outline of the life of Harry Reid. When the book closes on this 114th Congress, so too will it close on the congressional career of Senator Reid. He is a fighter and a champion. That is an understatement.  He is a fellow country boy, but he had a much tougher upbringing in the isolated hamlet of Searchlight, NV. You can read about that in his book. That upbringing has bred traits that I have admired since he arrived in the Senate in 1987. His humble upbringing, raised in a shack with no indoor bathroom or hot water, sowed the seeds of a life in public service and of the perspective that has infused and driven his public service. He first came to Capitol Hill as a police officer, working nights to pay his way through George Washington University Law School. Little did he know he would end up being one of the longest serving majority leaders in the history of the U.S. Senate.  He can point to so many of the things he has done, including steering the Affordable Care Act to Senate passage. But I want to thank Senator Reid for his strong support of justice bills that I have championed. An original cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization that I introduced in recent years--to strengthen and renew the transformative and lifesaving work that is made possible under VAWA--he has always worked to combat the scourge of domestic violence, helping to shepherd the reauthorization of this vital legislation across the finish line. He has also supported vital grant programs to put more cops on the street in communities small and large and to keep them safe. His commitment to advancing our comprehensive immigration reform bill, we got it through the Senate by a large bipartisan majority. When the history books are written, one of the huge mistakes made was when that the House of Representatives did not take up that bill, even though they had the votes to pass it. These are all examples of how trueleadership takes action--not merely talking points--no matter how difficult, to make a difference.  Harry Reid was at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 2015, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. I looked at him there with Congressman John Lewis and President Barack Obama--the first African American elected as President--as one of the towering figures in America. But the true measure of a man is revealed not when he pauses to remember past injustices, he works to prevent them from happening. From pay equity to restoring the Voting Rights Act, from the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, to the enactment of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, there can be no doubt that Senator Reid fights for every American, every day.  And yet, no matter how large a national leader Senator Reid has become, he has never forgotten the people of Nevada. In him they have a tireless and effective champion of the highest caliber. Senator Reid's work on behalf of Nevada has been relentless.  He has been our fighter. He has been our champion. And he has been a friend. He has faced and risen above personal adversity. He is a truly American story. And his presence here in the Senate will be missed next year. When Marcelle and I leave Washington for the last time, we will think of the special friends we have had. Harry Reid, Landra Reid--we will think of them. We wish them all the best as they begin their next chapter together.                          ____________________
