 President, I rise with the chairman and ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss a transportation infrastructure project that is of great importance to the southern California region.  I want to first, however, thank Chairman Murray and Senator Shelby for their outstanding work on this bill. The fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill provides appropriations for important transportation and transit projects in the State of California and the rest of the nation. The transportation needs in California alone are tremendous. I understand the difficulty you faced in trying to meet as many of these needs as possible under tight budget constraints.  I am concerned, however, that this is an important California project that was not funded--the Metrolink's double track project on the San Bernardino line.
