 President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the ``Community Forestry and Agriculture Conservation Act of 1999.''  Mr. President, all across America we are losing hundreds of thousands of acres of productive forest and agricultural land to urban uses. And with the loss of these lands, we also lose some of our ability to protect watersheds, fish and wildlife, and the rural character and economies of many communities.  Local governments and non-profit organizations, including growing numbers of land trusts, are responding to these issues, and to citizen demand that private land provide more public benefit. They have made significant progress by purchasing land outright or protecting it through conservation easements.  Unfortunately, communities and non-profits simply do not have the resources to meet public demand for open space protection. And the most traditional means of protection--outright purchase of land or conservation easements--are inadequate to protect larger tracts of forest and agricultural land.  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would give communities a flexible and dynamic tool to protect forest and agricultural land. In fact, some communities, including at least one in the State of Washington, are already mobilizing to take advantage of the legislation I am introducing today.  The concept behind this bill is straightforward.  Under my bill, a group of community members and leaders who are interested in protecting a tract of forest or farm land would work with one or more landowners to reach a voluntary sale agreement at fair market value.  The community group would then form a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation with a diverse board of directors. The board of directors could include landowners, conservationists, financial and business leaders, forestry and agricultural professionals, and others interested in managing the land.  The non-profit corporation would develop an agreement on what land would be acquired and at what price.  In addition, the corporation would develop a binding management plan. The management plan would provide for continued harvest of trees and crops, but in a manner that exceeds federal and state conservation standards.  A local government would then issue tax exempt revenue bonds on behalf of the non-profit corporation to fund the acquisition of the land. The bonds would be held and serviced by the non-profit with revenue raised by the continued harvest of trees or crops in accordance with the management plan. The non-profit corporation would also hold the title to the land.  In forming the non-profit corporation, community leaders would be required to meet strict standards before bonds were issued. These standards will ensure that public benefits are achieved and abuse is prevented.  First, the non-profit corporation must draft a land management plan that exceeds state and federal law.  Second, the corporation must enter the land into a permanent conservation easement.  Third, the corporation must secure the commitment of a third party 501(c)3 organization or governmental entity to hold the conservation easement. It must also provide the third party with the financial resources needed to monitor compliance with the easement.  Last, the corporation must establish a diverse board of directors. No more than 20 percent of the board members can represent a for-profit entity that does business with the non-profit.  Mr. President, let me explain why my bill is necessary to make this new approach possible. Current law allows for the issuance of tax-exempt debt on behalf of non-profit corporations, such as hospitals and higher education facilities that require large amounts of capital. This bill ensures forest and agricultural based non-profits can enjoy the same benefits.  Once the interested parties complete the management plan, issue the bonds, acquire the land and place it in trust, landowners, local governments, the environment, and the public all benefit.  Mr. President, foresters and agricultural producers are often land-rich and cash-poor. My bill would allow landowners to capitalize some or all of their assets. It would also allow landowners to continue harvesting timber from the land but at a lower harvest level. While the non-profit could manage harvest activities on the land, it is more likely it will contract out for these services. This will allow the original landowner or other interested natural resource businesses to manage and receive economic benefits from the land. In addition, this tool will allow the landowner to escape the management problems that arise when urban growth begins to encroach on forestry or agricultural operations.  Local governments benefit by continuing to receive tax dollars that result from economic activities on the land.  And the land receives better stewardship because broad-based conservation efforts can be undertaken at a lower cost than under more traditional land acquisition methods. Through these conservation easements, non-profits will have the financial flexibility to apply lighter resource management practices on the land.  This is an important point. The lower cost of capital and non-profit land management would allow communities to increase conservation benefits. I know many landowners and companies would prefer to increase conservation practices. However, they also have to meet the demands of the bottom-line and stockholders. By reducing these financial pressures, we can provide a higher level of resource protection on these lands.  And the higher levels of resource protection can respond to the greatest environmental needs in that region. For example, in my home state of Washington, the non-profit corporation could increase buffer areas along streams to protect salmon runs and engage in habitat restoration. These steps would help my state respond to salmon listings under the Endangered Species Act.  Finally, the American people benefit the most. They will have more environmental protection and recreational opportunities without sacrificing an important part of their community's economic and tax base. This tool will also allow communities to promote local ownership of their land and to better control their destiny.  Mr. President, in the last three years, Congress and the Clinton Administration have been discussing more and more the issues of ``sprawl'' and ``livability.'' We are finally starting to see at the national level a recognition that the federal government's actions play an important role in how communities grow. These are not new ideas--they have been discussed at the local and state levels for decades. I ampleased to see Congress and the Administration joining this discussion.  We have heard and seen many good ideas and proposals for improving the quality of life in our communities, from greater open space protection to improved transportation infrastructure. I support many of these efforts.  However, my bill addresses one aspect of this discussion that is not drawing as much attention in the press. And that is the destruction of farm and forest economies in many regions that are rapidly urbanizing. In the Puget Sound region, growth has choked the economic viability of forest and agricultural operations in many areas. Concerned citizens and governments are forced to try to save forest and farm land on a smaller, more piecemeal basis. As successful and rewarding as many of these efforts have been, we need to give communities the option to save larger tracts of land that cannot be acquired outright. By doing so, we can maintain viable farm and forest operations near growing urban areas, and help strengthen the connection between rural producers and urban consumers.  Today, Representatives Dunn and Tanner are introducing this legislation in the House. I am pleased to join their effort on this important issue by sponsoring companion legislation.  In closing, I want to emphasize that this is an approach that every Senator can support. It is bipartisan. It is voluntary. It maintains private land ownership and embraces private landowners. It limits government involvement but establishes proper enforcement to prevent abuse. It protects the environment. It provides local control.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me to pass the Community Forestry and Agriculture Conservation Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1085       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
