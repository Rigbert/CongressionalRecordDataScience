 President, for 25 years the Chevrolet Corvette, known as America's sports car, has been exclusively manufactured in the General Motors Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Bowling Green, KY. I rise today to celebrate Bowling Green as the ``Home of the Corvette.'' We are very proud that it is in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  The Corvette looms large as one of America's most admired sports cars. Introduced in 1953, it was originally produced elsewhere, but in 1981, General Motors recognized Kentucky as the growing, business-friendly environment it has become and decided Bowling Green and the Corvette made a good match. The first Kentucky-built Corvette rolled off the assembly line on June 1, 1981.  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant also produces the Cadillac XLR and XLR-V in addition to three models of the Corvette. Over 39,000 GM cars are manufactured in Kentucky each year and delivered to driving enthusiasts all over the world. Over the 2\1/2\ decades, the Bowling Green Assembly Plant has undergone redesign and updating to incorporate the latest technology. Recently, the newest model, the Corvette Z06, was launched and continues the success of the made-in-Kentucky Corvette brand.  The over 1,200 Kentuckians who work at the Bowling Green Assembly Plant maintain a high standard of quality while also serving as vital contributors to their communities. Plant employees have generously donated their efforts and resources to noble causes such as the United Way, Junior Achievement, the American Red Cross, D.A.R.E.--Drug Abuse Resistance Education--the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and various local charities.  The plant and its workers also work closely with Western Kentucky University to sponsor grants and events. They also offer 30 internships to WKU students each year, giving young men and women an invaluable opportunity to learn about the business world from inside one of America's biggest companies. Several interns have gone on to earn permanent jobs with GM after graduation.  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant's contribution to the local economy cannot be understated, either. Not only does the plant provide jobs to Kentuckians and keep directing money into the local economy, the plant also offers public tours, attracting over 50,000 tourists to the area every year.  Every Corvette built in Kentucky is custom-built for an individual customer; the cars are not mass produced. The employees of the Bowling Green Assembly Plant are very proud of their commitment to precision and high quality. They have won more than 70 automotive industry awards since 1997.  The Bowling Green Assembly Plant will celebrate its 25 years in Kentucky this September. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Kentuckians who make America's sports car for their dedication to achievement and success, both on the job and in their communities. Kentucky is still reaping the rewardsof its 25-year partnership with GM, and we hope to continue to do so for years to come.                          ____________________[Pages S8951-S8952]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    TRIBUTE TO THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF GM IN BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY  Mr. McCONNELL.
