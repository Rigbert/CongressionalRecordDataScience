Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I rise to recognize an outstanding member of the northwest Indiana community, Ms. Agnes Lynch. This incredible woman has been a life force for countless students and for her family. Her presence in our community has touched the lives of thousands and helped many become the leaders of today  Originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Ms. Agnes (Ott) Lynch earned her B.A. in Englishat Mount Mary College in Milwaukee. Two major events highlighted those college years. One was the once-in-a-lifetime experience of winning the national Tournament of Orators sponsored annually by the Hearst Newspaper chain. She was the only woman to ever win the national finals of that contest. The 1950 finals were held in Baltimore and Bishop Sheen was one of the judges. To that day, Agnes cherishes her kiss on the cheek from Sheen, at least as much as the cash prize that accompanied her first-place finish.  This other event, meeting her future husband, occurred while Agnes was working her way through college at the Milwaukee Public Library. John Lynch came into the library one night to check out a book. He was on his way home from the German bakery, just down the street from the library, where he was working his way through Marquette University. John and Agnes were married in Milwaukee just after graduation and moved to Gary, John's hometown.  After their third child was born, Agnes started her teaching career, first at Toleston High School and then, for 25 years, at Merrillville High School, where she was the English Department chairwoman, sponsor of the Thespian Society and director of the class plays. There are few people in northwest Indiana who didn't have Agnes for a teacher. In her spare time, she earned her M.A. from Valparaiso University. After retiring from Merrillville High School, Agnes taught for 3 years at Indiana University Northwest.  A widow since John's passing in 2000, Agnes now devotes her time to church, traveling and basking in the accomplishments of her children. Mr. Speaker, Agnes Lynch has given her time and efforts selflessly to the people of northwest Indiana throughout her long and illustrious life. She has given the gift of knowledge to thousands in our community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Lynch for her outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. I am proud to commend Agnes for her lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
