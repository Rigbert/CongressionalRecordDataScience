 47, the Natural Resources Management Act, and later today we will vote to pass it. The lands bill is the product of over 100 pieces of legislation addressing the management and preservation of some of our Nation's most precious natural areas. It touches every State, features the input of a wide coalition of our colleagues, and has earned the support of a broad, diverse coalition of many advocates for public lands, economic development, and conservation.  I am especially proud that the bill will take action on key priorities for my own State, from protecting national monuments, to preserving the legacy of historically Black colleges and universities, to helping local communities fight invasive species.  The fact that we are about to push this comprehensive package across the finish line is a credit to the dedicated efforts of Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Manchin. From the outset, S. 47 has benefitted from good-faith, bipartisan efforts at the committee level and here on the floor. I look forward to voting to pass the bill later this afternoon. I am going to do so enthusiastically for the people of Kentucky and for communities across the Nation.                          ____________________
