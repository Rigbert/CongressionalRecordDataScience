 President, I intend to object to any unanimous consent request at the present time relating to the nomination of Nani Coloretti to be Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  I have been conducting an inquiry regarding allegations of questionable hiring practices at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN. As part of that inquiry, I have requested documents from the Treasury Department that could resolve my concerns and questions. I encourage the administration to provide those documents to me as soon as possible.                          ____________________
