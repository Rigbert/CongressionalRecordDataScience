 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) that what we need is strong supply management, and I am a strong advocate of a two-tier supply management system. I also agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) that the current system is far from perfect. But I strongly disagree with him in saying that we have got to junk the whole system because what we have now is not perfect.  The fact of the matter is that, just last month, dairy farmers all over this country had the option of essentially voting for the Boehner-Obey point of view. They had the option of saying, well, the current system is not perfect. They had the option of voting for 1-B, which, in my view, is strongly flawed, or letting the current system expire and have nothing. But farmers who knew that the current system is not perfect said overwhelmingly by 96 percent that we need to have federal milk price supports, and that is what they voted for.                              {time}  1645  Mr. Chairman, there is no question in my mind, none whatsoever, that at a time when all over this country, in Wisconsin, in Vermont, in the Midwest, all over, when family farmers are going out of business, when today family farmers are receiving, in terms of inflation accounted for dollars, much, much less than they received 15 or 20 years ago, when they are struggling just to keep their heads above water, there is no doubt in my mind that if we approved this measure and did away with all price supports that what we would see is a rapid acceleration in the decline of family farms all over this country, especially the small farms.  Mr. Chairman, during the last 6 years alone, we have seen a decline to the tune of 26 percent of dairy farms in this country. And what we are also seeing is that while the small farms go under, in terrible numbers, in Vermont, in Wisconsin, all over this country, that the larger farms are becoming larger and gaining a greater share of the market. For example, in 1978, farms with 50 cows or less produced 40 percent of the milk supply. By 1997, that same size farm produced only 12 percent of the milk in our country. And the trend is very clear: Fewer and fewer large farms produce more and more of the milk, while small farms are rapidly going out of business.  If the Boehner-Obey amendment were to pass, this process would rapidly accelerate, and I will tell my colleagues what this country will look like in 20 years. What we will have, literally, is a handful of giant agri-business corporations controlling the production and distribution of dairy products all over this country. And that would be a disaster not only for rural America and the economies of rural America, that would be a disaster not only for the environment and keeping our land green, it would be a disaster for consumers as well.  I have, I believe, one of the strongest pro-consumer voting records in the House of Representatives, and I will challenge anyone who thinks that the consumer benefits when a handful of giant corporations will control the production and distribution of dairy products. So if my colleagues are for the consumer, if they are for the family farmer, if they are for the environment, they will vote against this amendment and vote for final passage. Let us do what little we can to protect the family farmer.
