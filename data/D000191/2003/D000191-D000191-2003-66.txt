Speaker, we will bring down in the actual quotes and not have to characterize it.  Following in this vein, you know, arguably the architect of this policy man who has been advocating a war with Iraq since the last war in Iraq ended, Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Defense Secretary, when talking about misjudgments, and this is a direct quote, not a characterization, ``There is lots of money to pay for this that does not have to be U.S. taxpayer money and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people. The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and a $100 billion over the course of the next 2 or 3 years. We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon.'' That is a direct quote.  Mr. Wolfowitz, held in high regard by this administration, said Iraq would rebuild itself, no cost to the American people. So thus far, if we just add up the first reconstruction bill and the second reconstruction bill, he is wrong by $20 billion, $20 billion that this President is asking this Congress to borrow on behalf of the American people, indebting future generations of Americans, to build, not rebuild. Remember, much of this is not rebuilding war damage. This is building Iraq in the vision of Halliburton and all the gold-plated defense contractors.  We might get into that later. There is a wonderful little piece here I have from the administration on that.  But that is what the money is. It is going to be borrowed and spent in Iraq, not providing jobs here, infrastructure here, but building infrastructure in Iraq in the vision of Paul Wolfowitz who is wrong by a magnitude of $20 to $100 billion at least in addition to the lives that have been lost. But has he been held to account? No, he has been held in high regard.
