 President, today I want to congratulate the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Uganda Cancer Institute for officially opening the UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre in Kampala, the first comprehensive cancer center jointly constructed by U.S. and African cancer institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The 25,000-square-foot regional cancer center is a state-of-the-art-facility that can treat up to 20,000 patients a year and includes an adult and pediatric outpatient clinic, a specimen repository, training center, conference rooms, and a pharmacy.  Uganda has a substantial cancer burden, and 6 out of 10 of the most common cancers there are caused by infectious diseases. To address this unique health need, Uganda has invested in cancer research, training, and clinical care. The UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre will significantly increase patient access to cancer diagnosis and treatment while furthering study of cancers in Uganda, particularly those that are infection related.  This alliance brings together two international leaders in the field of oncology care, training, and research and is ideally positioned to provide American and Ugandan physician scientists with indepth training in the treatment of infection-related malignancies in both the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa.  The relationship between Fred Hutch and the UCI dates back to 2004, and the UCI/Hutchinson Center Cancer Alliance was formally established in 2008. The program was formed to support the development of a strong biomedical infrastructure in Uganda that would contribute to the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer and related health concerns.  In 2008, Uganda had just one oncologist who treated more than 10,000 patients a year. In response, Fred Hutch spearheaded an extensive medical training program that has trained more than 300 Ugandans and Americans to date in the treatment of infection-related cancers, including physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, data specialists, and experts in regulatory affairs and fiscal management. Today, the number of practicing oncologists in Uganda has increased twelvefold.  The UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre is funded in part by two grants for which I was proud to advocate totaling $1.4 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (through the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad Program), as well as an $8.6 million investment from Fred Hutch. The Ugandan Government has supported the collaboration through donations of land, provision of funding for personnel and equipment, and technical support.  I am proud to work with Fred Hutch in their effort to bring cutting-edge cancer care to patients and families all around the globe. This joint venture with UCI has the potential to drastically improve the lives of many people, both in Uganda and worldwide. I am proud that my State of Washington is home to Fred Hutch, and I applaud them and the Uganda Cancer Institute for their cross-national effort to effect this critical change.                          ____________________
