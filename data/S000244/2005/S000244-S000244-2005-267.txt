 Madam Speaker, H.R. 1036, the Copyright Royalty Judges Program Technical Corrections Act, amends certain technical aspects of the copyright act that were substantively amended by Congress' enactment of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004.  It is appropriate to note the efforts of Chairman Lamar Smith and Ranking Member Howard Berman of the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, who worked so hard to ensure passage of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act last year. Enactment of the legislation came only after 20 years of successive efforts to streamline, modernize, and de-conflict the role of the U.S. Copyright Office in administering the various compulsory licenses contained in title 17 of the United States Code.  Before discussing the specifics of this bill, I would like to offer some background. By their nature, statutory changes in this area are complex. Proposed changes inevitably affect a number of preexisting and carefully negotiated balances that potentially impact the public and a wide variety of stakeholders.  The various compulsory licenses were authorized at differing times, and each is shaped in response to the unique circumstances of commercial licensors and licensees. Nevertheless, each is intended to benefit the public by reducing the transaction costs of certain types of protected works and each requires the Copyright Office to assume certain administrative functions, which may include rate setting, royalty collecting, and royalty distribution functions.  It is the interplay between these administrative and adjudicative functions, some of which are fiduciary in nature, that created potential conflicts for the Copyright Office. This problem was addressed in the Reform Act by authorizing the establishment of three copyright royalty judges, or CRJs, who operate independently of the Copyright Office. The CRJs are empowered to consider arguments from participants in contested distribution proceedings, resolve factual disputes, and order distributions.  In contrast, the role of the Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office is limited in such cases to largely ministerial functions such as advising the CRJs and participants in proceedings on certain matters within the substantive expertise of the office and actually effectuating the disbursement of funds in response to a CRJ order.  The ad hoc enactment of various compulsory licenses also contributed to a perpetuation of certain inefficiencies and inconsistencies that could only be addressed properly by creating a comprehensive and predictable schedule for rate-setting and distribution proceedings.  By enacting the Reform Act last year, Congress took important steps toward protecting the public, the Copyright Office, licensors, and licensees with a more stable and cohesive administrative and adjudicatory construct. But a clear articulation of the respective roles of the Copyright Office and the new CRJs is fundamental to the success of the new system.  Unfortunately, as enrolled, the law inadvertently provided in some places that the Librarian was charged with ``authorizing'' the distribution of funds. This language could be interpreted to imply that Congress intended the Librarian to retain a role that clearly had been intended to be exercised by the new CRJs.  H.R. 1036 corrects this error to ensure that the Reform Act operates as Congress intended. The Copyright Royalty Judges Program Technical Corrections Act includes further noncontroversial stylistic, technical, clarifying, and conforming changes that have been carefully considered and reviewed by Members and staff on both sides of the aisle, the Register of Copyrights, copyright owners, and many of the commercial users who are the beneficiaries of the licenses.  When the copyright royalty judge, or CRJ, system is fully implemented, disputes among participants will be settled in a more predictable, rational, and consistent manner; decisions will be improved by the involvement of judges required to possess relevant subject matter expertise; and significant cost savings and efficiencies should accrue to participants.  I urge Members to support this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1115
