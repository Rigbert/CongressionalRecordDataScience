 Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank Congressman Cardoza, who really has lived this mortgage foreclosure hell with the people of his region. I also thank Congressman McNerney, Congressman Costa, and all of these Members from California who have stood up here today to try to put the brake on over there at HUD and say, ``Hey, wait a minute. Pay attention to what is happening across California,'' and I must say across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Idaho--all of these States where the middle class is being washed out and where our money and our equity from our homes is being transferred to Wall Street, which now controls two-thirds--six banks--of the wealth of this country.  Something is fundamentally wrong. HUD has to stand up and do its job. We offer our amendment in all good faith, and we just say to Secretary Geithner over at Treasury: Wait until the Treasury bill comes on the floor. There is more to come.  I want to thank the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee for his graciousness and willingness to work with us as we stand up for Americans who are facing foreclosure.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).  The amendment was agreed to.                        Parliamentary Inquiries  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.  The CHAIR. The gentleman may state his parliamentary inquiry.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, on page 56 of the bill currently under consideration, at the bottom, beginning with the last partial word on line 19 and then proceeding through lines 1 through 4 on page 57, it constitutes legislation and authorizing on an appropriations bill in that it creates a new program, basically a grants program to the Secretary of Transportation. It sets a dollar amount of $250 million, and it further has a limitation clause in terms of the time when that would become effective.  I am aware that the rule waives all points of order against this legislation for violations of rule XXI, paragraph 2(a). I would assert in my parliamentary inquiry that this, in fact, is a violation of the House rules that the Rules Committee has waived. I am aware of that.  Yet it is my understanding that the precedents of the House indicate that, when a legislative provision is inserted into an appropriations bill and that piece of authorizing language is permitted to go--offending the House rules either by the fact that nobody from the authorizing committee gets up and makes a point of order against the provision that violates the rules or if the Rules Committee, as they have done in this case, issues a blanket waiver, waiving all violation of that particular section of the House rules--that it then ripens, and only at that moment in time does it ripen, which is when the rule is adopted or when the provision is read and a member of the authorizing committee doesn't stand up and exercise his or her committee's jurisdiction. It then ripens for there to be a perfecting amendment.  I am further aware that the rule by which this bill came to the floor also only makes in order 24 amendments, not the historic open rule under an appropriations bill.  So my question to the Chair is: At what moment in time would it be appropriate to offer a perfecting amendment to the language that I have just indicated, which is on pages 56 and 57, in light of the fact that this matter only ripened when the rule was passed?  Just by way of making an observation before the Chair gives its answer, if you think about the operation of this rule, there are no perfecting amendments available to authorizing language in a bill until such time as the House has permitted the offense.                              {time}  1520  The House didn't permit the offense, that is, the waiver of its rules, until the Rules Committee was successful in achieving the passage of this rule.  So my parliamentary inquiry is, when would a Member who might be interested in modifying or perfecting this offending language, in violation of the House rules, have the opportunity to do that?  The CHAIR. Any amendment not specified in the report of the Committee on Rules would be precluded.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. If I may ask a further parliamentary inquiry.  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for further inquiry.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Just so I am clear on the Chair's ruling, and that is that when the Rules Committee passes a rule waiving the rules of the House and protecting language that is clearly in violation of House rule XXI (2)(a), if the Rules Committee further compounds that by announcing a rule that only a certain subset of amendments are going to be made in order, that no Member, not just majority Members, or the chairman, no Member of this House has the opportunity to do anything about that offending language. Am I correct in that?  The CHAIR. House Resolution 1569 waives points of order against provisions of the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI and specifies the amendments that may be offered.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Further parliamentary inquiry. That was a long sentence. I think the answer to my question was yes.  The CHAIR. The gentleman is correct that neither a point of order nor an amendment is available for that purpose.                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Arcuri  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 111-578.
