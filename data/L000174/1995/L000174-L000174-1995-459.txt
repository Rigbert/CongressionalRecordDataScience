President, while the distinguished majority leader is on the floor, I note that many of us have been trying to work out a time agreement. There is cooperation on both sides of the aisle. For example, I am about to call up an amendment which will by [[Page S8327]] prearrangement have a second-degree amendment by Senators Exon and Coats. We will keep that on a relatively short time agreement, and we will wrap that one up. I will also be yielding to Senator Kerrey, who has an amendment which I understand is going to be accepted. Senator Breaux and I have been trying to work out one of the major issues, which I think both sides agree is a major issue that must be debated, an intraLATA amendment, to try to see if we can reach an area of agreement by which we would speed that one up.  Mr. President, with that, I yield, if I might, to the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.
