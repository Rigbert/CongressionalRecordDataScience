  What that says to me, Mr. President, is not, I think, what the Senator intends.  Would the Senator object to language explicitly saying that if all the material facts are not disclosed to the agency at the time of the letter of approval then a civil and criminal penalty could apply if the law was violated. Would the Senator have any objection to clarifying it?
