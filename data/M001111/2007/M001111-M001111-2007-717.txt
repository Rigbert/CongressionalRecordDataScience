 There should be no question that the Members of the Senate support our troops. We all do. In this resolution, we want to make sure we go on record saying we support our troops from the time they go to battle and are sent on their missions to the time they come home.  We make very clear in the Murray resolution that this Senate will go on record saying the support of our troops extends far beyond their mission in the field. It means when they come home and are sent to Walter Reed or one of our other medical facilities, we will support them with what they need. It says we will support their families throughout their lifetime, if that is what it takes, for their service to this country.  I hope this is passed on a strong, loud, bipartisan vote.  I yield the floor.
