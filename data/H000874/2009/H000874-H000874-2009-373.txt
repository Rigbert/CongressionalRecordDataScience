 Let me first observe that, quite obviously, we are going to provide for tax relief, as the President said in his campaign, as he's reiterated in his speech to the joint session, tax relief for 95 percent of taxpayers. We have every intention of pursuing that.  We also have every intention of having a fiscally responsible budget. We also, as the President also indicated in his speech to the joint session, will pursue vigorously energy independence and the issue of global warming.  The gentleman speaks of one of the alternatives, an alternative proposed by the President to deal with that issue in terms of cap-and-trade. The Energy and Commerce Committee will be considering that, as the gentleman knows, and I'm not going to anticipate their specific action. But I am going to say that we are committed on this side of the aisle, as I hope your side of the aisle will be as well, to very, very substantially reducing the carbon footprint that we are making in this country, and indeed, that's being made around the world, which we believe that science is pretty clear on this. And very frankly, the previous administration, which did not express that view early in its tenure, during its last year, changed somewhat its view. In any event, we want to deal with that.  And the gentleman has mentioned an alternative the President has proposed. It's an alternative supported by a large number of people, and that is before the committee. And we'll see what the committee does with it.
