 Mr. Chairman, I want to express my concern about the procedures used to bring this important legislation to the House floor and the lack of inclusion in doing so. I would point out in the rule that was adopted earlier today in this Chamber, section 1404 was added to the underlying legislation relative to the treatment of certain counties for the purpose of reimbursement under the Medicare program. I do not rise today to express my opposition to the inclusion of those counties if relief is necessary for them. I rise in opposition to a point that other counties were not included as well.  The fact is, under this legislation, counties in Lackawanna, Pennsylvania; Luzerne, Pennsylvania; Wyoming, Pennsylvania; Columbia, Pennsylvania; Lycoming, Pennsylvania; and Mercer, Pennsylvania, were included. Hospitals in Orange County, New York, were included. Hospitals in Dutchess County, New York, were included.  On November 7 of last year, I wrote to the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means explaining that Porter Memorial Hospital in Porter County, Indiana, was experiencing similar difficulty as far as an inequitable reimbursement under their classification in Medicare reimbursement. On January 22 of this year, I received a response from the honorable chairman indicating that he had received my communication, that hearings would be held and I would be notified. On February 5 of this year I wrote to the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and asked that we be allowed to testify on behalf of Porter Memorial Hospital in Porter County, Indiana.                              {time}  1945  Subsequent to February 5, no hearings were held that I am aware of. We were not asked to provide any materials for justification as far as the arguments for Porter Memorial Hospital. But tonight, on May 22, I find out that we have 8 hospital counties in the States of Pennsylvania and New York whose problems are being rectified tonight. That is not fair. That is not inclusive in this legislative process. Porter Memorial Hospital in the State of Indiana, in the County of Porter, is as deserving.  I would hope as this session proceeds that the representations made by the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means on January 22 that hearings were going to be held and that action on this vital issue to Porter Memorial Hospital would be taken.  The fact is that Porter Memorial Hospital is located very near Chicago, Illinois. Their costs of providing care to residents in that area are comparable to the City of Chicago, Illinois, but the reimbursements are not. There is a differential for an adjoining county between Cook County, Illinois, and Porter County, Indiana. That is Lake County, Indiana, and that places the people at Porter County in a further disadvantage. I would hope that this problem is rectified.
