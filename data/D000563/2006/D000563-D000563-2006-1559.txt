So if a library offers basic Internet access, and within that access a patron can, for example, send and receive e-mail by accessing an Internet-based e-mail service such as Hotmail, for example, that does not mean the library is a communications service provider and, therefore, it does not mean that a library could be subject to these national security letters of investigation.  By way of comparison, a gas station that has a pay phone isn't a telephone company. So a library that has Internet access, where a person can find an Internet e-mail service, is not a communications service provider; therefore, it would not fall under the purview of the NSL provision in 18 U.S.C. 2709. It is a critically important distinction. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for making that clear and for all of his good work on this bill.  Libraries are fundamental to America. They symbolize our access to education. They are available to everyone, regardless of social or economic status.  When we first introduced the SAFE Act, I went to the Chicago Public Library to make the announcement. The library was established in 1873, and for over 130 years it has given the people of the City of Chicago the ability to read and learn and communicate. Here is what the mission statement says at that public library:       We welcome and support all people and their enjoyment of      reading and pursuit of lifelong learning. We believe in the      freedom to read, to learn, and to discover.  We have to ensure, in the Senate and in Congress, in the bills that we pass, including the PATRIOT Act, that this freedom to read, learn, and discover is preserved for our children and our grandchildren.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
