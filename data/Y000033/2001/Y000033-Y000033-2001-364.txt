Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the gentleman as the new chairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. He has done an exceptional job in bringing a great communication between the Congress and the District of Columbia.  This is a good amendment. As he said, this is not Federal funds, this is District of Columbia funds. This is a germane amendment, it is an appropriation amendment, and I support the gentleman's amendment.
