Mr. Chairman, this bill is really not a reconciliation bill, it is a wrecker ball bill on middle class families.  Mr. Chairman, an ugly spirit has risen in our Nation's Capital. A mean spirit. A cruel spirit. A spirit that gave rise to this Republican bill.  Republicans raise taxes on the working poor--and cut taxes for the idle rich. Republicans raise taxes on 30 million working families.  Republicans spend more on defense, but cut Head Start, school lunches, and student loans. They choose bombers over babies, defense contractors over children, star wars over schools.  Do you really want a welfare bill that would put children in orphanages? Do you want to return to the days when families put the disabled in back rooms. Do you want to send senior citizens to dilapidated hospitals and second rate medical care?  I cannot believe, I truly cannot believe what this bill does to our country. There are Americans who need our help. Children do not choose to go hungry. The elderly do not choose to become sick. The handicapped do not choose to be disabled.  Mr. colleagues--there, but for the grace of God, go I. Each and every Member of this body is blessed. We have a responsibility--a moral obligation--to do right by our children, our seniors, and our working families. This bill fails that test.  Two hundred and forty-five billion dollars can help a lot of families earn a livable wage. It can feed a lot of children. It can help a lot of students get through school. It can provide medical care for hundreds of thousands of seniors. With $245 billion, you can do a lot of good for a lot of people.  Or you can squander it on a privileged few. You can pay for a tax cut for rich, political friends. That is the choice you make today. I urge you to look within your heart--to do what is right. Vote ``no'' on this proposal. It is cruel, it is mean, it is downright lowdown.
