President, I rise today to honor the memory of a man who, at such a young age, displayed the courage and valor of a true American hero. Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis was a proud son of the great State of Oklahoma, growing up in the community of Antlers. Remembered as being energetic, outgoing, and humorous, he graduated in 2002 from Antlers High School, where he was a standout tennis player, twice making it to the State championships.  Even before the attacks on America on 9/11, PVT Dennis knew that he wanted to dedicate himself to service in the United States Army. He enlisted prior to his graduation from high school, and arrived in boot camp merely 3 weeks after receiving his diploma. His parents, Jerry and Jane Dennis of Antlers, realized that their son was proud to be answering the call to serve his country. Despite their worry for his safety, they sent with him their support and love as he was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment based out of Fort Bragg, NC.  As a part of the U.S. effort to stamp out the threat of terrorism, PVT Dennis, now an Army sharpshooter, along with the rest of his regiment, was sent to fight in Afghanistan. On April 25, 2003, PVT Dennis was on patrol in eastern Afghanistan with other soldiers when they drove into an ambush. A firefight with rebel fighters quickly followed. When his sergeant was shot, PVT Dennis made his way to a foxhole and provided cover fire as his comrades took the sergeant to safety. Tragically, PVT Dennis was mortally injured in the process.  At just 19 years of age, PVT Dennis lay dying from his wounds, worrying more about the physical condition of his fellow soldiers than his own health and well being. PVT Dennis passed on to the next life that day, but no one could deny the bravery displayed by this young man from a small town in far southeastern Oklahoma.  Hundreds gathered at the funeral for PVT Dennis, held at the First Baptist Church in Antlers. They will never forget this incredible young man who displayed such great love for his country. As Army Brigadier General Abe Turner stated so eloquently at the funeral ceremony, ``We will remember you. We will honor you, and you will always be a hero.'' He is Oklahoma's hero--Private First Class Jerod R. Dennis.                          ____________________
