 President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an outstanding citizen of the State of Washington. Sally Skinner Behnke has been awarded the 2001 Isabel Colman Award for Excellence in Community Service for displaying significant and broad based leadership in her community. This prestigious award is given by the YWCA of Seattle-King County-Snohomish County and is reserved for an individual or organization whose efforts have contributed to enhancing the quality of life in the community. Ms. Behnke's efforts for over 20 years have done just that.  Some of her many achievements include being the first woman to serve on the board of Washington Mutual, Past President of the University of Washington Alumni Association, founding member and Past President of the Northwest School for Hearing Impaired Children, and an active fund-raiser for the Lifelong AIDS Alliance. The two experiences that she is most proud of are working on the board of the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center and serving as Past Board Chair of Children's Hospital. These contributions to our community make her more than worthy of this award and our recognition.  Ms. Behnke's work is inspiring, and her words are encouraging. She said, ``Take care of your home. Look around at this wonderful, wonderful place that is yours and mine. And if you haven't already, find a little corner of it to give your heart to.''  On behalf of the people of Washington State, I would like to thank Ms. Behnke for her time, energy and many years of dedicated service.                          ____________________
