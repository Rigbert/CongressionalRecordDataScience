President, we have been working on the issue of human trafficking on a bipartisan basis for almost a year, and it is usually bipartisan.  I know when we included my amendment on the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, most Senators voted for it. Only 20 current Republican senators voted against that victims act, and the rest voted for it. All the Democrats voted for it.  But on this issue today, the Judiciary Committee reported out a comprehensive bill with strong bipartisan support. We did that last fall. This year we reported out a less comprehensive bill with fewer protections for those at risk of human trafficking, and despite that setback, I agreed to keep working across the aisle to make it stronger, including the crucial prevention piece that was in last year's committee-reported bill.  We have been on this bill for 3 days. I think we can all admit the progress has been thwarted by the inclusion of a divisive provision that would limit the services available to victims of human trafficking.  I wish to propose a way forward. I know all Senators want to work together to end human trafficking. And just as we saw on my bill, the Violence Against Women Act, 78 Senators voted for that act with its provision on trafficking. We want to support a bill that will pass the Senate.  I filed a substitute amendment, Senate Amendment 300, to get us aroundour current impasse. It includes three things. First, the Klobuchar-Cornyn bill as reported earlier this month by the Judiciary Committee; second, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, also reported earlier this month by the Judiciary Committee, but without the divisive language that limits victims services; third, the Leahy-Collins-Murkowski-Ayotte amendment that was filed yesterday to protect runaway and homeless youth from trafficking.  This trafficking prevention bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee last year with the support of Senator Grassley, Senator Cornyn, and nearly all of the other Judiciary Committee members, but has been narrowed here at the request of Republicans this year.  I hope the combination of these three bills--and I do it in good faith--can bring us together. More importantly, it is responsive to the requests of survivors and the many dedicated people who work with them to remove the unnecessary partisan provision that has resulted in this impasse. They need us to find a way forward. They need the Senate to stop playing politics and pass a meaningful bill.  With that, I ask unanimous consent that letters written by a number of groups and others who support the removal of this divisive provision so that we can move forward on this trafficking legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               The National Network for Youth,                                                   March 11, 2015.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Network for Youth is      grateful for your leadership on human trafficking which is a      dark mark on our modern society. Slavery has no place in      America and we stand proudly with you to prevent and end      human trafficking in America.       The National Network for Youth, founded in 1974, champions      the needs of runaway, homeless, and other disconnected youth      through strengthening the capacity of community-based      services, facilitating resource sharing, and educating the      public and policy makers. NN4Y members work collaboratively      to prevent youth homelessness and the inherent risks of      homelessness, including exploitation, human trafficking,      criminal justice involvement, and death.       Human trafficking is a bipartisan and nonpartisan issue.      Together, we stand united against modern day slavery,      including both sex and labor trafficking. Presently, we are      at an important moment in the Senate with both parties      unified to take a strong stand against human trafficking,      from prevention to law enforcement, and service provision to      survivors. We are so pleased that the Runaway and Homeless      and Youth Trafficking Prevention has become a part of this      important conversation and we thank you for your support of      that legislation last Congress.       The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with      the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece      of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This      legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this      moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and      divisive provisions.       Respectfully, thank you for your work. Please work across      the aisle to ensure that this critical trafficking      legislation becomes the law of the land.           Best regards,                                          Darla Bardine, J.D.,                              Executive Director, National Network     for Youth.                                  ____         Vermont Coalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth Programs,                                   Montpelier, VT, March 11, 2015.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy, The Vermont Coalition of Runaway and      Homeless Youth Programs wishes to express our ongoing      appreciation for your efforts to move the Runaway and      Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. As a      longstanding champion of Federal support for efforts to      assist vulnerable runaway, homeless and trafficked young      people, I know that you must be as frustrated as we are in      recent efforts to insert an element of partisanship into what      should be a broadly bi-partisan effort to protect victims of      human trafficking. The Runaway and Homeless Youth and      Trafficking Prevention Act and the broader legislation it's      amended to should be important opportunities for citizens of      the United States and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to      unite in moral outrage over the realities of victims of human      trafficking.       Difference of opinion and the deliberative role of the      Senate is part of what makes our democracy strong, but      sometimes unity of purpose should prevail, particularly in      efforts involving protections for the most vulnerable among      us. There should be no doubt that legislation involving the      well-being of individuals who have been victimized by the      most base of human behavior should be free of partisan      wrangling. It's disappointing and deeply distressing that      this isn't always the case.       I write this letter to encourage your efforts to remove      partisan language from the Justice for Victims of Trafficking      Act in an effort to ensure that the Act and the RHY amendment      that Senator Collins and you introduced move forward      unimpeded.       Again, thank you for your efforts on this issue.           Sincerely,     Kreig Pinkham,       Executive Director, Washington County Youth Service Bureau/     Boys & Girls Club, VT Coalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth      Programs Board Member.                                  ____                                        Human Rights Campaign,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2015.       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Human Rights Campaign's      (HRC) more than 1.5 million members and supporters      nationwide, I write to support the Leahy substitute amendment      to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act which would      ensure critical protections for victims of trafficking and      add necessary protections for runaway and homeless youth that      does not include an expansion of the Hyde Amendment language.      Each of the components of this substitute amendment has      strong bipartisan support.       This amendment will help many vulnerable populations      including the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)      community. LGBT individuals are particularly impacted by      human trafficking and are at an increased risk for      victimization globally. In fact, 10 percent of all      trafficking victims identify as LGBT. They also make up a      disproportionate amount of the total homeless youth      population. Recent studies have found that while LGBT youth      comprise only 10 percent of the total youth population, up to      40 percent of youth living on the streets today identify as      LGBT.       Increased incidence of homelessness and family rejection      make LGBT individuals--especially youth--particularly      vulnerable to trafficking. According to the Department of      Health and Human Services Administration for Children and      Families, one in four LGBT youth is rejected by their      families because of their sexual orientation or gender      identity. Due to this rejection, many LGBT youth find      themselves homeless and living on the streets. Once on the      street, these youth are targeted for exploitation and      trafficking.       Because homelessness can often lead to trafficking,      inclusion of protections for runaway and homeless youth will      result in a more effective Justice for Victims of Trafficking      Act. Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs provide critical      funding for support systems that serve youth who become      homeless. The programs funded by the act--including emergency      shelters, street outreach, transitional living and assistance      for homeless youth in rural areas--can serve as critical,      final safety nets for youth who would otherwise become      victims of trafficking.       According to the American Bar Association, for LGBT people      who are trafficked the societal stigma around their sexual      orientation or gender identity is an additional factor that      prevents them from accessing help or reporting abuse. This      amendment provides important protections against      discrimination for LGBT youth by prohibiting any program      funded by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act from      discriminating on the basis of actual or perceived race,      color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity,      sexual orientation, or disability.       We greatly appreciate your commitment to improving the      lives of young people across America, including those who are      LGBT. Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.           Sincerely,                                                  David Stacy,                                      Government Affairs Director,     Human Rights Campaign.                                  ____     Planned Parenthood Action Fund     For Immediate Release: Tuesday, March 10, 2015     Contact: Planned Parenthood Action Fund media office: 212-         261-4433  Planned Parenthood Condemns Effort to Insert Extreme Anti-Abortion                  Agenda into Bill on Human Trafficking       Washington DC.-- Planned Parenthood Action Fund condemned      efforts by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) to advance an extreme      abortion restriction as part of important bipartisan efforts      to establish greater protections for victims of human      trafficking. Following is a statement by Cecile Richards,      President, Planned Parenthood Action Fund:       ``It's outrageous that some politicians are using a bill to      protect victims of sex trafficking to push an extreme anti-     abortion, anti-immigrant agenda. This is politics at its      worst. A bill that was supposed to help women is instead      being used to hurt women.       ``The Senate should protect victims of human trafficking      but should not do so at the expense of women's access to safe      and legal abortion. The majority of human trafficking victims      are women and girls, and they need access to the full range      of reproductive health care services without barriers.''                                       ____                                               Legal Momentum,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2015.       New York, NY.--Today, Legal Momentum, the Women's Legal      Defense and Education Fund, urged that a provision harmful to      women's health be removed from a human trafficking bill being      considered by the Senate, the Justice for Victims of      Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178).       ``The intent of this bill--to support survivors of      trafficking--will be subverted if the provision is left      intact. Human trafficking survivors--survivors of the worst      kind of exploitation, which our government has called `modern      slavery'--who were raped and became pregnant should have      access to the full spectrum of health services, including      abortion,'' said Legal Momentum's President and CEO, Carol      Robles-Romaan.       Legal Momentum fully supports the aims of the bill minus      the troubling provisions. The bill would enhance services for      runaway and homeless victims of youth trafficking, improve      the response to victims of child sex trafficking, and      establish an interagency task force to monitor and combat      trafficking. Harmful provisions that deny health care to      victims, restrict women's health options, are harmful to      immigrants, or fail to adequately protect the LGBT community,      should be removed so that the bill can help victims of one of      the most heinous crimes, human trafficking, which has been      condemned by the whole world. We urge all senators to vote      for the Leahy Comprehensive Substitute Amendment, which      adheres to the bi-partisan compromises made when the JVTA was      reported out of the Judiciary Committee.                                  ____                                          Give Way to Freedom,                               Essex Junction, VT, March 11, 2015.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy, Thank you for your ongoing leadership      in the fight to protect victims of human trafficking and      ensure that they receive full support and services to which      they are entitled under federal law. Give Way to Freedom is a      private operating Foundation based in Vermont that works with      victims of trafficking throughout New England and southeast      New York. Through this work we see first-hand the complex      needs of victims of trafficking.       As Vermont and New England continue to build our response      to this heinous crime it is vital that victims remain the      core focus of all efforts. We applaud your dedication to this      principal, and support your efforts to ensure that victims of      trafficking receive the full range of support and services      they need to recover and rebuild their lives.           Sincerely,                                                   Edith Klimoski,     Director.                                  ____                                 Center for American Progress,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2015.     Ranking Member Patrick Leahy,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Building, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Ranking Member Leahy, I write today to thank you for      your leadership in helping victims of trafficking and      resolving the unacceptable situation with the Justice for      Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178). The Center for American      Progress extends our deep support for your Comprehensive      Substitute Amendment that removes abortion restrictions for      the funds to help victims of trafficking and retains      nondiscrimination provisions in the Runaway and Homeless      Youth Act.       Thank you again for your leadership in moving these      important pieces of legislation forward without harmful      restrictions.           Sincerely,                                                  Donna Barry,                                    Director of Women's Health and                                                   Rights Program.
