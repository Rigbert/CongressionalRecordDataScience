  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, there was a lot of bloviating on the Republican side yesterday about the government takeover of the student loan business. What nonsense. I mean, what we are going to do is stop subsidizing the banks. That's what the Republicans are really upset about here.  Today, for every dollar in student loans, the taxpayers are dinged 15 cents--subsidies to the banks. If we convert to a National Direct Student Loan Program--the minority of the loans today go through that--for every dollar we lend to a student we will get back $1.03.  Now, they want to run government like a business, but their idea of a business is shoveling subsidies to the private sector. I want to run government like a business. I want to give more loans to students, more effectively, at lower cost to the taxpayers. That's the National Direct Student Loan Program. This is a reform that's long overdue. Stop crying about the subsidies to the banks.                          ____________________
