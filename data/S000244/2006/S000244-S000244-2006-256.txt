Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4772) to simplify and expedite access to the Federal courts for injured parties whose rights and privileges under the United States Constitution have been deprived by final actions of Federal agencies or other government officials or entities acting under color of State law, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4772       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Property Rights      Implementation Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. JURISDICTION IN CIVIL RIGHTS CASES CONCERNING REAL                    PROPERTY.       Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by      adding at the end the following:       ``(c) Whenever a district court exercises jurisdiction      under subsection (a) in an action in which the operative      facts concern the uses of real property, it shall not abstain      from exercising or relinquish its jurisdiction to a State      court if the party seeking redress does not allege a      violation of a State law, right, or privilege, and no      parallel proceeding is pending in State court, at the time      the action is filed in the district court, that arises out of      the same operative facts as the district court proceeding.       ``(d) In an action in which the operative facts concern the      uses of real property, the district court shall exercise      jurisdiction under subsection (a) even if the party seeking      redress does not pursue judicial remedies provided by a State      or territory of the United States.       ``(e) If the district court has jurisdiction over an action      under subsection (a) in which the operative facts concern the      uses of real property and which cannot be decided without      resolution of an unsettled question of State law, the      district court may certify the question of State law to the      highest appellate court of that State. After the State      appellate court resolves the question so certified, the      district court shall proceed with resolving the merits. The      district court shall not certify a question of State law      under this subsection unless the question of State law--       ``(1) is necessary to resolve the merits of the Federal      claim of the injured party; and       ``(2) is patently unclear.       ``(f)(1) Any claim or action brought under section 1979 of      the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) to      redress the deprivation of a property right or privilege      secured by the Constitution shall be ripe for adjudication by      the district courts upon a final decision rendered by any      person acting under color of any statute, ordinance,      regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or territory of      the United States, which causes actual and concrete injury to      the party seeking redress.       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, a final decision      exists if--       ``(A) any person acting under color of any statute,      ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or      territory of the United States, makes a definitive decision      regarding the extent of permissible uses on the property that      has been allegedly infringed or taken, without regard to any      uses that may be permitted elsewhere; and       ``(B) one meaningful application to use the property has      been submitted but denied, and the party seeking redress has      applied for but is denied one waiver and one appeal, if the      applicable statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage      provides a mechanism for waiver by or appeal to an      administrative agency.     The party seeking redress shall not be required to apply for      a waiver or appeal described in subparagraph (B) if such      waiver or appeal is unavailable or can not provide the relief      requested, or if pursuit of such a mechanism would otherwise      be futile.''.     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES AS DEFENDANT.       Section 1346 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by      adding at the end the following:       ``(h)(1) Any claim brought under subsection (a) that is      founded upon a property right or privilege secured by the      Constitution, but was allegedly infringed or taken by the      United States, shall be ripe for adjudication upon a final      decision rendered by the United States, which causes actual      and concrete injury to the party seeking redress.       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, a final decision      exists if--       ``(A) the United States makes a definitive decision      regarding the extent of permissible uses on the property that      has been allegedly infringed or taken, without regard to any      uses that may be permitted elsewhere; and       ``(B) one meaningful application to use the property has      been submitted but denied, and the party seeking redress has      applied for but is denied one waiver and one appeal, if the      applicable law of the United States provides a mechanism for      waiver by or appeal to an administrative agency.     The party seeking redress shall not be required to apply for      a waiver or appeal described in subparagraph (B) if such      waiver or appeal is unavailable or can not provide the relief      requested, or if pursuit of such a mechanism would otherwise      be futile.''.     SEC. 4. JURISDICTION OF COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS.       Section 1491(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended      by adding at the end the following:       ``(3) Any claim brought under this subsection founded upon      a property right or privilege secured by the Constitution,      but allegedly infringed or taken by the United States, shall      be ripe for adjudication upon a final decision rendered by      the United States, that causes actual and concrete injury to      the party seeking redress. For purposes of this paragraph, a      final decision exists if--       ``(A) the United States makes a definitive decision      regarding the extent of permissible uses on the property that      has been allegedly infringed or taken, without regard to any      uses that may be permitted elsewhere; and       ``(B) one meaningful application to use the property has      been submitted but denied, and the party seeking redress has      applied for but is denied one waiver and one appeal, if the      applicable statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage      provides a mechanism for waiver by or appeal to an      administrative agency.     The party seeking redress shall not be required to apply for      a waiver or appeal described in subparagraph (B) if such      waiver or appeal is unavailable or can not provide the relief      requested, or if pursuit of such a mechanism would otherwise      be futile.''.

Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States      (42 U.S.C. 1983) is amended by adding at the end the      following: ``If the party injured seeks to redress the      deprivation of a property right or privilege under this      section that is secured by the Constitution by asserting a      claim that concerns--       ``(1) an approval to develop real property that is subject      to conditions or exactions, then the person acting under      color of State law is liable if any such condition or      exaction, whether legislative or adjudicatory in nature,      including but not limited to the payment of a monetary fee or      a dedication of real property from the injured party, is      unconstitutional;       ``(2) a subdivision of real property pursuant to any      statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State      or territory, or the District of Columbia, then such a claim      shall be decided with reference to each subdivided lot,      regardless of ownership, if such a lot is taxed, or is      otherwise treated and recognized, as an individual property      unit by the State, territory, or the District of Columbia; or       ``(3) alleged deprivation of substantive due process, then      the action of the person acting under color of State law      shall be judged as to whether it is arbitrary, capricious, an      abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.     For purposes of the preceding sentence, `State law' includes      any law of the District of Columbia or of any territory of      the United States.''.     SEC. 6.
