Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise and wish to present to the committee an amendment that concerns Ukraine.  The real issue for us here in the House today is whether the United States should begin walking away from the most strategic country in Central Europe: Ukraine. My amendment says stay the course with the democratic forces for reform. It says do not single out Ukraine as the only nation in the world that will receive a one-third cut from last year's allocation. My amendment will allow the committee and will allow this Congress more flexibility as we move towards floor passage and conference in order to restore the funds that rightfully should go to democracy building in that new republic.  Let me just say that proposing to reduce assistance for Ukraine comes at absolutely the wrong time. The third set of parliamentary elections are about to occur. During the last week of August, Ukraine will celebrate its 10th year of independence. This kind of ill-advised action by this Congress is going to give the forces that are against reform a greater share of authority inside that country. I do not really think that the gentleman, the chairman of the committee and other Members that proposed this initially, really want that to happen.  Put it in the context of our own country. It took us 11 years from the time of the Declaration of Independence to adopt our own Constitution, 89 years to end slavery at the end of the Civil War, 141 years to give women the right to vote, and 188 years for the adoption of the civil rights acts of our country. Now, I am not suggesting Ukraine should take that long. All I am saying is that after 10 years certain Members may be expecting too much.  Let me also say that other nations, like Russia, are making very favorable overtures toward Ukraine, particularly with the recent appointment of former Russian Prime Minister ViktorChernomyrdin as the new Russian Ambassador to Ukraine. America should be no less interested in Ukraine. Further, the House bill does not even meet the administration's request of $170 million for Ukraine, and President Bush and Secretary Powell have both stressed the importance of this strategic partnership.  Even the wife of the slain journalist Heorhiy Gongadze wrote a letter to all of us in which she says, ``Do not do this. It would be a terrible mistake to adopt the House committee version.'' She says, ``Condemn the actions and inactions of the Ukrainian executive power when appropriate, demand open and honest investigations, seek the truth about my husband's murder, and cut off funding or restrict it, if you deem it necessary, but please do not reduce the aid to Ukraine that is so important in the building of a normal Democratic society.'' I will insert her full letter in the Record.  This September, we are going to have the first Rada-Congressional exchange to try to more completely work together as legislative bodies in our respective communities, to try to help to integrate Ukraine more fully into the world community.                              {time}  1830  Do I think everything is rosy in Ukraine? I would be the first to say no. Much more remains to be done on nuclear safety.  I wish to insert in the Record two letters. One from our U.S. Department of Energy and one from the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States talking about the serious nuclear safety issues that still remain and need to be addressed in Ukraine.  We need full investigations into the suspicious deaths of independent journalists. We need an independent and free press and media and allow them to develop and help them to develop in that country. We need to urge Ukraine to create a judicial system and rule of law that yields justice. We need to ensure human rights and free speech to help advance that country toward a more open free market economy with reliable and transparent credit institutions, and we need to help them complete land title reform and agricultural transition to a privatized system of production.  The report that accompanies the bill is also inadequate. I am going to also insert into the Record tonight more complete language that should be in the report that urges Ukraine toward these types of reforms.  But let me remind our colleagues, Ukraine has had major accomplishments over the last decade. It has, at our request, completely dismantled its nuclear weapons. It has worked to become and wishes to be part of the full union of European and western states. Ukraine refused to sell turbines to Iran giving up an economic sale in excess of over $100 million.  The current President of the Ukraine personally invited Pope John Paul II for an historic visit with Ukraine. I might say to the chairman of the full subcommittee, with all due respect, last week you spoke eloquently of not isolating China and you voted on behalf of opening China up. I can tell you China arrests Catholic bishops. She would not invite the Pope into that country. In fact, she ordains phony bishops. So I would say do not treat Ukraine in a manner any worse than you would treat China.  If you look at Ukraine, she has a growing middle class. It has grown at over 6 percent this last year. Industrial production is up by a fifth. Land privatization is occurring. Small businesses are up by 40 percent. Small bank accounts have started. In fact, and this is really important for our colleagues to understand, almost all of the U.S. assistance to Ukraine does not go to the government. In fact, it goes to help the development of the very organizations that are working for all the good causes I have just talked about: small business development, exchange programs, support for independent media, municipal development, nuclear clean up; all these very, very worthy causes.  So in offering this amendment today it was my hope to put some of this on the Record. It is my hope that as this bill moves toward full passage and over to the Senate that we might get some perfecting language that would not single out Ukraine for this type of harsh treatment by the people of the United States.  In fact, our hope is that this discussion today and the chairman's willingness to allow us to talk about this in giving us some time on the floor will help to give us a meeting of minds so that we can, in fact, perfect the House language and help Ukraine move herself into the company of the free nations of the world.         Department of Energy,                     National Nuclear Security Administration,                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2001.     Ambassador William B. Taylor, Jr.,     Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to the NIS, U.S. Department of          State, Washington, DC       Dear Ambassador Taylor: We understand that the House      Committee on Appropriations report on foreign operations      limits Ukraine assistance in 2002 to $125 million, based      partly on the completion of major nuclear safety projects.      The International Nuclear Safety Program has completed the      safety parameter display system project, the simulator      project, and the Chernobyl Replacement Heat Plant project.      However, additional nuclear safety work is needed in Ukraine.       Projects that are not yet complete include: simulator and      operator training; completion of in-depth safety assessments;      physical security upgrades; nondestructive examination      improvements; operational safety improvement's; emergency      cooling reliability upgrades; plant computer upgrades; and      nuclear fuel qualification.       I recently returned from a visit to Ukraine for      commissioning of the Chernobyl replacement heat plant and for      reviewing State/AID supported projects at the Khmelnytskyy      nuclear power plant. I saw impressive progress due to State/     AID assistance at both locations. The Ukraine safety program      is at a pivotal stage. On the one hand, clear improvements to      safety and operations are evident and documented. However, an      enduring safety culture has not taken hold and important      projects remain to be completed which Ukraine is currently      unable to provide for itself. Until that safety culture is      firmly established, cutbacks may endanger the progress made      to date, e.g., they may drive Ukraine to seek help from      Russia in some areas.       We plan to complete nuclear safety improvements at reactors      in the countries of the former Soviet Union by 2006. A      reduction in funding would prevent current projects from      being completed, and reduce the sustainability of the already      completed projects. We hope you will support this important      work at the same level as last year. We look forward to      continuing to work with you.           Sincerely,                                                  James M. Turner,     Assistant Deputy Administrator.                                  ____                                           Embassy of Ukraine,                                                    July 17, 2001.     Re Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill--Assistance for        Ukraine.     Hon. Jim Kolbe,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations Appropriations,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Kolbe: This letter is written to express my alarm      about the level of funds provided for assistance to Ukraine      in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. I am the widow      of Georgiy Gongadze, the Ukrainian journalist whose brutal,      unsolved murder has received so much international attention      and which led to my seeking refuge in America. As I      understand it, the House Appropriations Committee reduced the      President's recommendation for aid to Ukraine by $44 million.      I think this is a terrible mistake. Furthermore the      Committee's proposal indirectly refers to my husband's murder      to justify their reduction.       If Congress uses my husband's murder as justification to      reduce U.S. aid to Ukraine, this will send absolutely the      wrong message to those honorable people who are still working      (and with whom I worked) so hard to build a democratic      nation. Conversely, such an approach will play into the hands      of the anti-reformists who seek to thwart democracy and      benefit from the perpetuation of the corrupt legacy of the      Soviet system. My husband sought the development of a free      and independent media, of non-governmental and of local      organizations to build a civil society in Ukraine--these      entities are the ones that desperately need America's help.      The assistance provided in your bill goes to such programs to      help the very people who need and should have American money      and counsel, good people who will be isolated and alone      without U.S. support. As a lawyer who worked with such      groups, I know that American assistance is the lifeblood of      these programs--and it is here where the seeds of democracy      must be sown.       I am sure that we share very serious concerns about the      direction and actions of the Executive branch of Ukraine.      However, please do not let these concerns keep the United      States from providing the level of aid needed by those that      are making a real and valuable difference, especially at the      grass roots level. Condemn the actions and inactions of the      Ukrainian executive power when appropriate, demand open and      honest investigations, seek the truth about my husband's      murder and cut off funding or restrict it if you deem      necessary, but please--do not reduce the aid to Ukraine that      is so important in the building of a normal, democratic      society.       Thank you for your time and consideration of my concerns.           Respectfully,     Myroslava Gongadze.                                  ____                                           Embassy of Ukraine,                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2001.     Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     The House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur, I wish to address you on a      matter of urgency for the country and people I represent as      Ambassador here in Washington.       I was informed that a few days ago the Appropriations      Subcommittee on Foreign Operations approved a draft Foreign      Operations Bill that instituted a cap of $125 million of      technical assistance to be made available for Ukraine next      fiscal year, thus reducing by $44 million the amount      requested for my country by the US Administration.       The draft Committee's Report advances three reasons for      this reduction: ``the completion of a long term projects in      nuclear safety, the continuing setbacks to needed reform, and      the unresolved deaths of prominent dissidents and journalists      in Ukraine''.       I believe that both Subcommittee's recommendation and its      substantiation would be quite different if all the relevant      facts were taken into consideration.       Of particular concern to all Ukrainians would be the      message that ``projects in nuclear safety have been      completed''. Ukraine just a few months ago marked that 15th      anniversary of the Chernoby meltdown and mourned its      countless victims. Disastrous effects of that tragedy are      still having tremendous negative impact on everyday life of      millions in Ukraine--diverting close to 10% of the GDP for      programs to alleviate the damage from this horrific calamity.      The message that the United States considers its involvement      in upgrading nuclear safety of the existing nuclear reactors      in Ukraine as ``completed'' would only exacerbate deeply felt      sense of so many Ukrainians that we have been abandoned by      the international community to deal single-handedly with the      problem of a global magnitude.       As to ``continuing setbacks to needed reform'', it is clear      that we could have done better in the past. On the other      hand, the country has demonstrated spectacular sustained      economic growth over the last 18 months while being fully      dependent on imports of gas and oil and getting no assistance      from the international financial institutions. It is rather      difficult to imagine how this could have been achieved      without reforms finally starting to produce the positive      effects on the economy.       As for the last reasoning of the Subcommittee      recommendation, let me unequivocally state that the      disappearance of journalist Heorhiy Gongadze is considered in      Ukraine not only as a terrible human tragedy but also as a      case that needs to be fully investigated in a manner that      would leave no doubt as to its circumstances and culprits. We      value assistance provided by the FBI to the Ukrainian law      enforcement agencies in the investigation and hope that this      cooperation will help resolve the case in the near future.       This August Ukraine marks 10th Anniversary of our      independence. After hundreds of years of oppression,      unimaginable sufferings and millions of deaths the Ukrainian      people will be celebrating our first decade of freedom. This      will be the time for festivities but also for deep      reflections on our past, present and future. This will also      be the time when Ukrainians will remember the crucial role of      the United States in helping us achieve this long sought and      hard earned freedom. When Ukraine was under Soviet dominance      the United States Congress created a strong bond between the      Ukrainian and American peoples by adopting each year      resolutions demanding freedom for captive nations. Ten years      after this freedom had become reality this bond could and      should be reinforced by continuous assistance provided by the      Congress directly to the Ukrainian people.       I rely on your deep knowledge and understanding of the      crushing problems a newly independent state has to overcome      and your vision of Ukraine's future as a democratic and      prosperous member of Western community of nations, that you      have shared with me, in helping to provide next fiscal year      adequate funds for effective and meaningful technical      assistance to the People of Ukraine.           Sincerely,                                           Kostyantyn Gryshchenko,                                                       Ambassador.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
