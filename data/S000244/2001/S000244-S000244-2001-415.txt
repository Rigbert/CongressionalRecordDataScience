The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 860       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Multidistrict Litigation.--Section 1407 of title 28,      United States Code, as amended by section 2 of this Act, is      further amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(j)(1) In actions transferred under this section when      jurisdiction is or could have been based, in whole or in      part, on section 1369 of this title, the transferee district      court may, notwithstanding any other provision of this      section, retain actions so transferred for the determination      of liability and punitive damages. An action retained for the      determination of liability shall be remanded to the district      court from which the action was transferred, or to the State      court from which the action was removed, for the      determination of damages, other than punitive damages, unless      the court finds, for the convenience of parties and witnesses      and in the interest of justice, that the action should be      retained for the determination of damages.       ``(2) Any remand under paragraph (1) shall not be effective      until 60 days after the transferee court has issued an order      determining liability and has certified its intention to      remand some or all of the transferred actions for the      determination of damages. An appeal with respect to the      liability determination of the transferee court may be taken      during that 60-day period to the court of appeals with      appellate jurisdiction over the transferee court. In the      event a party files such an appeal, the remand shall not be      effective until the appeal has been finally disposed of. Once      the remand has become effective, the liability determination      shall not be subject to further review by appeal or      otherwise.       ``(3) An appeal with respect to determination of punitive      damages by the transferee court may be taken, during the 60-     day period beginning on the date the order making the      determination is issued, to the court of appeals with      jurisdiction over the transferee court.       ``(4) Any decision under this subsection concerning remand      for the determination of damages shall not be reviewable by      appeal or otherwise.       ``(5) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the      authority of the transferee court to transfer or dismiss an      action on the ground of inconvenient forum.''.       (d) Removal of Actions.--Section 1441 of title 28, United      States Code, is amended--       (1) in subsection (e) by striking ``(e) The court to which      such civil action is removed'' and inserting ``(f) The court      to which a civil action is removed under this section''; and       (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new      subsection:       ``(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b)      of this section, a defendant in a civil action in a State      court may remove the action to the district court of the      United States for the district and division embracing the      place where the action is pending if--       ``(A) the action could have been brought in a United States      district court under section 1369 of this title; or       ``(B) the defendant is a party to an action which is or      could have been brought, in whole or in part, under section      1369 in a United States district court and arises from the      same accident as the action in State court, even if the      action to be removed could not have been brought in a      district court as an original matter.     The removal of an action under this subsection shall be made      in accordance with section 1446 of this title, except that a      notice of removal may also be filed before trial of the      action in State court within 30 days after the date on which      the defendant first becomes a party to an action under      section 1369 in a United States district court that arises      from the same accident as the action in State court, or at a      later time with leave of the district court.       ``(2) Whenever an action is removed under this subsection      and the district court to which it is removed or transferred      under section 1407(j) has made a liability determination      requiring further proceedings as to damages, the district      court shall remand the action to the State court from which      it had been removed for the determination of damages, unless      the court finds that, for the convenience of parties and      witnesses and in the interest of justice, the action should      be retained for the determination of damages.       ``(3) Any remand under paragraph (2) shall not be effective      until 60 days after the district court has issued an order      determining liability and has certified its intention to      remand the removed action for the determination of damages.      An appeal with respect to the liability determination of the      district court may be taken during that 60-day period to the      court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction over the      district court. In the event a party files such an appeal,      the remand shall not be effective until the appeal has been      finally disposed of.
