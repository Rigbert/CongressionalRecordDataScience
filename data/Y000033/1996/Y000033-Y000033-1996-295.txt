Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support and information. He brings up a very valid point. If we had listened to the localities, the States, and the communities, we could have solved the problem on the river. I would suggest another thing, though, as long as the gentleman brought it up, because I brought it up myself about importing the Canadian wolves down to reintroduce wolves.  I have also suggested we can rebuild the Columbia River fishery by the enhancement with Alaskan stock. The answer I get from NMFS and the Fish and Wildlife: ``We cannot do it because they are not indigenous to the area. They are not part of the stream.'' To them I say, ``I thought you wanted to bring the fish back. We can help you do that.'' They say, ``We cannot do it.''  But it is all right for them to bring the wolves down, against everybody's wishes and beliefs, and they are Canadians; because our fish come from Alaska, a State of the United States, they are saying, ``They are not part of the system.'' It is the mindset that we are dealing with today that is not working.  Under our bill, we will bring the people in and it will be part of the State, part of the community, and we will solve the problems and bring the species back. I am very excited about that concept, and I hope those that might be listening to this program will think about what we are trying to do, not gut it, not repeal it, but to improve upon it. That is what our bill does. I thank the gentleman.
