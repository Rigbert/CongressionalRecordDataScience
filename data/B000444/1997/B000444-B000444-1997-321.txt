 Not one single time. And I was chairman of the committee.  Now, I would point out one other thing to my friend. I want to have complete candor. If one considers taking judges based on their ideology and call that political, yes, we Democrats were political, as well. I am not complaining about that. I am not complaining about anybody who stands up and says I do not want Judge Smith, the President's nominee, because I think he will be bad on the court for the following reasons and comes to the floor and makes the case. I do not quarrel with that because I think that is the prerogative of the Senate and any Senator. What I am quarreling with is a different kind of politicizing, and that is drawing the conclusion that because I now control the Senate, I am not going to let the President of the United States have nominees whether or not I have an ideological problem with them.
