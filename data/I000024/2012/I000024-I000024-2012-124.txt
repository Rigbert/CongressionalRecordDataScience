The Senator from Texas talked about the X on the runway. I made it very clear by the time you can see the X on the runway when you are cleared to land and you have a sophisticated plane that is full of passengers, there is a point beyond which you can't go in terms of your plane is dirtied up making a go-around. Obviously it wasn't necessary because I had 7,000 empty feet to come around, but that is not important because that is not the issue.  I recognize and respect Senator Hutchison in the fact that she was on the NTSB, and I know that obviously is meaningful to her, as it is to Senator Rockefeller.  What we are dealing with here is we have a committee--and I have a lot of respect for the committee for which Senator Rockefeller is the chairman and Senator Hutchison is the ranking member, and this committee is the committee of jurisdiction.  Now, what did I do? I introduced this bill a year ago. I talked about it. We had 25 cosponsors at that time. We had endorsements from all over the country. We had the National Air Traffic Controllers Association come in. We sent out ``Dear Colleagues'' to talk to people. Again, we sent a letter to the Commerce Committee that Senator Hutchison was on at that time requesting a hearing. We had 32 cosponsors signing that letter, requesting a hearing, some of which were on the Commerce Committee. Nothing happened.  On September 20, as the months go by, we made more requests. We talked about this, and every time they said we are going to be doing this. You finally get to the point where you have to go ahead and get it done. And that is why we have a rule XIV. I am not a Parliamentarian, and I don't know exactly how things work.  I remember I had experience with this when I worked in the House of Representatives, that when something is bogged up in a committee we had what is called the discharge petition reform of 1994. It was considered by the Wall Street Journal, or perhaps Business Daily, as the single greatest reform in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. It addressed this same thing. It is a way of bottling up bills in committees so they could never have hearings and never be able to get on the floor for a vote. That discharge petition reform became a reality, and now the light is shining and everything is great.  But when you have been trying to get a hearing before a committee for a year and you have 66 cosponsors, you have to resort to whatever is out there available to you for a remedy. That remedy happens to be rule XIV. Rule XIV will allow me to do this, and with the two people holding the bill up, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison, I will have no choice but to file cloture and to go ahead and get a vote on this bill, recognizing it takes a supermajority when you file cloture. So I would do that.  I didn't think I would get into this or need to enter it into the Record. I have an article which I will find here and will submit for the Record. I think it is very important. It goes into detailed documentary cases where they have been unable to get fairness through this system.  How many cases would ultimately go to the district court? I think very few. The idea that there is going to be an opportunity for a pilot to take what he is accused of to the district court to see it in a sense of fairness has nothing to do with how many pilots are sitting on that district court. It is a sense of fairness, and that is what they deal with. The people in the district court system don't have expertise in all of these areas, but they can look at fairness. And I can tell you in my case, if they had looked at that and said, wait a minute, the FAA has cleared him to land and there are no NOTAMs published, he didn't do anything wrong. It finally gets to the point--and I have been very patient. I have waited a whole year for this and finally I have come to the point where I have flat given up, so I decided that we are going to have to do it this way since it is clearly the will of the Senate to pass this legislation.  So, with that, I have some things I want to have printed in the Record. First of all, I have the sequence of events, the request that we made of the Commerce Committee to hear this legislation.  I have an article that was in Pilot magazine by John Yodice, who is considered to be the single foremost legal authority in this area.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have both items printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         S. 1335, Inhofe-Begich Pilot's Bill of Rights Summary              The Pilot's Bill of Rights Does Three Things       1. Makes the FAA Enforcement Process Fairer for Pilots--     Requires that in an FAA enforcement action against a pilot,      the FAA must grant the pilot all relevant evidence 30 days      prior to a decision to proceed with an enforcement action.      This is currently not done and often leaves the pilot grossly      uninformed of his violation and recourse. Eliminates the NTSB      rubber stamp review of FAA actions. Too often the NTSB, which      hears appeals from the FAA, gives wide latitude to the FAA,      making the appeals process meaningless. In FY10, of the 61      appeals of FAA certificate actions considered by the NTSB,      only five were reversed. Of the 24 petitions seeking review      of emergency determinations considered by the NTSB, only one      was granted and 23 were denied. The bill clarifies the      deference NTSB gives to FAA actions. Allows for federal      district court review of appeals from the FAA, at the      election of the appellant. Makes flight service station      communications available to all airmen. Currently, the FAA      contracts with Lockheed Martin to run its flight service      stations. If a request is made for flight service station      briefings or other flight service information under FOIA, it      is denied to the requestor because Lockheed Martin is not the      government, per se. However, they are performing an      inherently governmental function and this information should      be available to pilots who need it to defend themselves in an      enforcement proceeding.       2. Improves the Notices to Airmen System--Requires the FAA      undertake a NOTAm Improvement Program, requiring      simplification and archival of NOTAMs in a central location.      The process by which Notices to Airmen are provided by the      FAA has long needed revision. This will ensure that the most      relevant information reaches the pilot. Non-profit general      aviation groups will make up an advisory panel.       3. Requires a Review of the Medical Certification Process--     The FAA's medical certification process has long been known      to present a multitude of problems for pilots seeking an      airman certificate. In fact, 28% of all requests for      assistance received by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots      Association relates to the medical certification process. The      bill requires a review of the FAA's medical certification      process and forms, to provide greater clarity in the      questions and reduce the instances of misinterpretation that      have, in the past, lead to allegations of intentional      falsification against pilots. Non-profit general aviation      groups will make up an advisory panel.                                  ____                    Action on Pilot's Bill of Rights       July 6, 2011--Introduced Pilot's Bill of Rights with 25      cosponsors and endorsements from Aicraft Owners and Pilots      Association and Experimental Aircraft Association.

(By John S. Yodice)       Under the Federal Aviation Act, the National Transportation      Safety Board functions as a court of appeals for pilots when      the FAA has suspended or revoked a pilot or medical      certificate. In our increasingly complex airspace system and      the more intensive regulation of our flying activities, no      pilot is immune. This appellate function is given to the NTSB      because it is independent of the FAA, and presumably able to      provide a fair and impartial forum for the hearing of such      appeals. Under the Act, an appealing pilot is entitled to      ``an opportunity for a hearing.'' It also provides that an      FAA order of suspension or revocation must be reversed if the      NTSB finds after a hearing that ``safety in air commerce or      air transportation and the public interest do not require      affirmation of the order.''       Decisions of the current NTSB cause us to question its      fairness and impartiality in pilot appeals. Many of these      decisions have been reported in this column, one as recently      as last month (``Pilot Counsel: No `Statute of Limitations,'      '' July AOPA Pilot). Here is another case that raises doubts.       The FAA ordered the suspension of a private pilot's      certificate for 30 days for piloting a Piper Cherokee 140      into the Washington, D.C., Air Defense Identification Zone      (now the ``Special Flight Rules Area''). The FAA said that      the pilot failed to comply with the special security      procedures of the relevant notam, and was ``careless or      reckless'' in the operation. The pilot appealed the order of      suspension to the NTSB. He filed an answer to the FAA's order      admitting the inadvertent incursion, but defending that ``the      special procedures required pursuant to FDC notam 7/0206 are      unique, complex, and ambiguous.'' (To prove the pilot's      point, although it never came up in the case, there have been      thousands of such inadvertent incursions, as opposed to very      few, if any, intentional ones.) He also adamantly denied that      he was ``careless or reckless'' in his operation.       The result of the appeal to the NTSB was that the pilot was      denied a hearing to contest the FAA charges; he was denied a      waiver of the suspension even though he timely filed a report      with NASA under the Aviation Safety Reporting Program      (``Pilot Counsel: ASRP,'' June AOPA Pilot); and he wound up      with a ``careless or reckless'' violation on his public FAA      airman record.       This result was achieved by a series of procedural,      regulatory, and policy interpretations by the NTSB, all one-     sided. To start with, the NTSB has a procedural rule allowing      summary judgment, i.e., no hearing, if there are no factual      issues to be heard. (In my experience the only party      routinely granted summary judgment is the FAA, never the      pilot.) Based on the pilot's admission that he inadvertently      entered the ADIZ, the FAA moved for summary judgment, and the      board granted the motion. What the FAA and the board ignored      in denying a hearing were the three issues raised by the      pilot: one, that he was not ``careless or reckless;'' two,      that ``the special procedures required pursuant to FDC notam      7/0206 are unique, complex, and ambiguous;'' and three, that      he was entitled to a waiver under ASRP.       The FAA has a catchall regulation, FAR 91.13(a), that      provides: ``No person may operate an aircraft in a careless      or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of      another.'' In a one-sided interpretation, the NTSB has      written out of the rule the required element of proof that      life or property has been endangered. The pilot was never      afforded the opportunity to prove that there was no danger to      anyone or anything. In another one-sided interpretation of      the same rule, the board held that the ``careless or      reckless'' part of the charge is merely ``residual'' to the      ADIZ incursion charge and therefore does not warrant a      hearing.       The board rejected without serious discussion, the pilot's      defense that the security procedures are unique, complex, and      ambiguous. Apparently the board could not bring itself to      acknowledge that there could be something wrong with a rule      that is unintentionally violated by thousands of otherwise      law-abiding and safety-conscious pilots.       The pilot timely filed a report with NASA under ASRP that      should have entitled him to a waiver of the 30-day      suspension. Most pilots charged with inadvertent incursions      have been granted waivers. The board, although conceding that      the pilot raised this issue in his reply to the FAA's motion      for summary judgment, denied that this was an issue for      hearing because, technically, the pilot did not raise it in      his answer. Merely raising it in a different pleading filed      with the board was not sufficient.       Notice that every one of these issues, without exception,      went against the pilot and in favor of the FAA, all without      granting the pilot the hearing, which the Act contemplates,      to put on his side of the case. This case would not be so      remarkable if it stood alone, and not in context with the      many other cases we have seen, many of which we have      reported, in which the NTSB one-sidedly seems to favor the      FAA and disfavor pilots.
