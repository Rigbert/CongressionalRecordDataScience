. Government legal authority to kill a U.S. citizen in a foreign country that is not an area of active hostilities, if the target is a senior operational leader of al-Qaida or an associated force. So it is qualified in that regard.  The white paper argues, such an attack does not violate the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen in this circumstance, ``if he poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.'' Imminent threat. No. 2, ``his capture is not feasible,'' or the Justice Department white paper goes on to say, ``and the operation complies with the law of war principles, such as the need to minimize collateral damage.''  I will say to the Senator, I stand with him. I want an answer to his question. I think we should pursue it on a bipartisanship basis, as we have many issues together in the past. I think it is a legitimate question. But I would say that the white paper we have been given relative to this U.S. citizen overseas has some fairly narrow circumstances in terms of the use of force.  When it comes to the use of that force in the United States, I believe the circumstances should be just as narrow, if not more. I would say to the Senator, I am genuine in my concern for bringing these issues out in a full hearing of our constitutional subcommittee. I think I have answered the question. I hope he appreciates my sincerity.
