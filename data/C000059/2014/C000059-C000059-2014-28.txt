Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Linda Pearson is one of these individuals. On January 16, 2014, Linda will be honored as the 2013 ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Corona Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala at the Eagle Glen Golf Club.  For over 34 years, Linda has tirelessly dedicated herself to serving the Corona Regional Medical Center. She is currently the Director of Marketing, Patient Relations, and Volunteers and is known for her creative thinking and quick problem solving.  In addition to working with the Corona Regional Medical Center, Linda is a committed member of many other local organizations and serves on multiple boards whose programs help ensure the betterment of our community. Over the years, she has held board member positions with the Circle City Rotary, Corona Chamber of Commerce, Foundation for Community and Family Health, and Crossroads Christian School. Linda Pearson truly is an example of an individual committed to decades of service and outstanding representation within Corona and Riverside County at large.  Linda is known as an effective leader with a natural ability to organize the efforts and goodwill of others. She is an enthusiastic team builder who enjoys the challenge of researching and analyzing to find viable solutions to improve the lives of all community members. In light of this, Linda was awarded the Corona-Norco YMCA Ira D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award in May 2009, which honors exceptional community volunteers. She was also honored with the Distinguished Citizen Award by the Temescal District Boy Scouts of America.  Considering all that Linda has done for Corona, the Corona Chamber of Commerce named Linda their 2013 Citizen of the Year. Linda's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. She has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
