 President.  Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri provides that a family may not receive welfare assistance for more than 24 months consecutively, unless the adult is working, or the State has an exemption of the adult for hardship. I would support this amendment if the Senator would require States to offer work to parents. There may be many parents who are willing to work and who wantto work but cannot find a job, or perhaps they cannot find child care for their children so that they can be at work.  The underlying bill says that a mother should not be penalized if she has a child under 11, or if she cannot afford to find child care. This amendment would be inconsistent with the underlying bill. It aims right at the mother. But it hits the child.  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. It goes too far.
