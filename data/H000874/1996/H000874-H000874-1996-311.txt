Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, what are we considering? We are considering, as both gentlemen from Massachusetts have already pointed out, a rule which allows for 1 day of consideration of matters, which means that neither Members nor the public will have an opportunity to review that which is being proposed.  I do not know whether the gentleman representing the majority on the Committee on Rules knows, but perhaps he can inform me at the end of this debate whether or not this kind of rule has ever been proposed prior to June 30 of any legislative year in the history of the Congress.
