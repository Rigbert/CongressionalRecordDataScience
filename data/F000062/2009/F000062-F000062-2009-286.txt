 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prevent the cruel and unsportsmanlike practice of hunting from airplanes.  This practice undermines the hunting principle of a fair chase and often leads to a slow and painful death for the hunted animals.  I firmly believe that slaughter must be the very last option when it comesto wildlife management. Moreover, if slaughter must be carried out, it should be done in the most humane method possible.  In my opinion, allowing private citizens to hunt from airplanes runs contrary to this belief.  Specifically, the Protect America's Wildlife Act closes the loophole in current law that allows private citizens to hunt from aircraft. It limits airborne hunting to employees of state fish and wildlife agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior.  It eliminates the practice of ``land-and-shoot'' hunting by prohibiting the chasing or exhausting of animals from an aircraft.  It provides an exception to allow airborne hunting during biological emergencies, which is defined as a case where a wildlife population's sustainability is significantly threatened by an excess of predators.  It also ensures that this exception only applies to when it is the only way to prevent a biological emergency, and limits the number of animals killed to a minimum.  Finally, it increases fines for violations of the Airborne Hunting Act from $5,000 to $50,000.  It does not preclude States or Federal agencies from carrying out responsible wildlife management programs.  Congress initially passed the Airborne Hunting Act of 1971 as a result of the public's reaction to film of this practice broadcast over television.  Currently, a loophole in the Airborne Hunting Act permits States to allow private citizens to engage in airborne hunting of wildlife--in most cases wolves and bears--under the guise of wildlife management.  It was clear in the 1970's, as it is now, that airborne hunting is inhumane and must be stopped.  In my opinion, aerial hunting methods are cruel and unnecessary for wildlife management--and undermine the principles of sportsmanship.  Since 2003, more than 1,000 wolves have been killed from the air in the State of Alaska. According to the animal welfare group the Defenders of Wildlife, more than 250 wolves have been shot dead during the current hunting season alone.  Aerial hunting is typically carried out in one of two ways:  In the first method, a hunter will shoot the wolf directly from the aircraft while flying overhead. This frequently wounds the wolf, leading to a slow, painful death.  In the second method, known as ``land-and-shoot,'' a hunter flying in an aircraft will chase the wolf until it is exhausted, land, and kill the animal from point-blank range.  So, I am introducing a bill today to close the airborne hunting loophole that allows it to continue.  This legislation would not impinge on legitimate hunting rights.  This bill does not prohibit the use of airplanes for transportation. A hunter would still be able to legally fly anywhere, anytime, and hunt as they otherwise would.  Further, all other legal methods of transportation or hunting may also continue: on foot, by snowmobile, by all-terrain vehicle, etc.  The State of Alaska, where airborne hunting is more prevalent, argues that wolf populations must be limited to support sustainable levels of moose and caribou.  The State continues to carry out airborne hunting by private citizens with authority from the State Department of Game, which argues that the moose and caribou populations must be increased.  It is estimated that the State's resident hunters alone contribute roughly $662 million annually to the economy. The hunting industry also sustains 10,000 jobs.  With this in mind, it is certainly not my intention to prevent Alaska, or any other state for that matter, from maintaining a robust hunting and tourism industry.  This is a balanced bill that will enable states to responsibly manage wildlife populations, while banning the most egregious cases of aerial hunting by civilians.  It limits the practice of airborne hunting to employees of State and Federal wildlife agencies without impinging on legitimate sport hunting practices.  It is also supported by former members of the Alaska Board of Game that agree this practice should be controlled.  I became concerned about inhumane wildlife management practices due to the slaughter of nonnative deer in my own State.  Beginning in the summer of 2007, the National Park Service began culling Axis and Fallow deer at Point Reyes National Seashore near San Francisco. This inhumane shooting resulted in a number of deer dying slow and painful deaths. Some were left to rot in the Park.  Hundreds of constituents from the Bay Area raised an outcry about this practice and I am pleased that the National Park Service has stopped slaughtering the deer.  In conclusion, this bill prohibits the cruel practice of aerial sport hunting, while safeguarding the rights of legitimate hunters and allowing States and the Federal Government to maintain responsible wildlife management.  I am certainly open to the suggestions of my colleagues who have ideas for improving this legislation and look forward to working with them to pass it quickly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1535       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
