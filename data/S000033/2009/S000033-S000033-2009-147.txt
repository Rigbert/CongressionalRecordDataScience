  From its humble beginnings in 1919, when 94 farmers founded Cabot Creamery for $5 per cow plus a cord of wood each, Cabot has grown into one of the strongest and proudest symbols of Vermont. With its cheeses distributed internationally, Cabot is the fastest growing cheddar supplier in the country. Naturally aged from two to 36 months, a process which gives these cheeses their superb taste, Cabot cheddar has won every award, including ``Best Cheddar in the World'' at the 22nd Biennial Cheese Championship. In fact, no other cheese company can make this claim.  For all its successes, the Cabot Cooperative remains firmly grounded in its history and tradition, using time-honored techniques to produce a superior product with no additives or preservatives that is enjoyed across the country; indeed around the world. Family farms remain the backbone of Cabot Creamery Cooperative, much as they have since its founding. As owners of Cabot, every cooperative member has a stake in its success and a say in its governance. Cabot has always valued democratic ideals, civic virtue, and a high-quality product.  Presently, Vermont's dairy farms are experiencing difficult times, with destabilized milk prices and a near monopoly control of milk distribution. For the members of the Cabot Cooperative, however, the milk market that Cabot makes available to its farmers continues to serve as a valuable return on their years of investment in the cooperative.  As Vermonters, we are deeply proud of our tradition of creating exceptional cheddar cheese. Therefore, I wish Cabot Creamery Cooperative continued success on its 90th birthday, and thank them for being an exemplary symbol of our State's commitment to quality and local democracy.                          ____________________
