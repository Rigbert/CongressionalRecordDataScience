President, I would agree with the Senator from Massachusetts, it is time to level with the American people. We tried to subpoena these records last week. We were rebuffed on a party-line vote, with many on the other side saying: But they are going to be forthcoming. We now get 3 out of 23 documents, 2 of which were already on the Internet.  When are they going to be forthcoming? We want to understand what happened. As I said, if you are going to get to the bottom of what happened, you have to start at the top. President Bush has said he wants to get to the bottom of this. I agree with him, but I think we have to start at the top to find out what happened there. And simply prosecuting some corporals and sergeants and privates does not get to the bottom of what happened.
