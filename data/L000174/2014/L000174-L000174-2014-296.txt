President, for almost two decades Judge William Sessions has served as a Federal judge for the District of Vermont. Last month Judge Sessions announced he would take senior status later this year. I have worked with Senator Sanders, Representative Welch, and the Vermont Bar Association to convene a merit commission to find highly qualified candidates to serve on the Vermont District Court so I can then recommend them to the President.  I know I speak on behalf of all Vermonters, no matter what their background, when I thank Judge Sessions for his years of distinguished public service and applaud him for agreeing to continue his judicial service even after he takes senior status this summer. Because of his continued dedication, Vermont will have one of the most highly respected and extraordinarily capable jurists on the Federal bench. I am proud to call Judge Sessions my friend, and I am honored to have cast my vote to confirm his nomination 18 years ago.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the completion of my remarks a Rutland Herald article written by Brent Curtis that recounts his many accomplishments.  There are only two authorized district judgeships in Vermont. We are the second smallest State in the Union. So, when President Clinton asked for my recommendation to fill a vacancy in my native State, I did not take this task lightly. I knew the people of Vermont deserved a judge with integrity, intelligence, and fairness, somebody whom anybody could go before--plaintiff or defendant, rich or poor, no matter their political background--and know they would have a fair hearing.  During my time in private practice as a litigant and then as State's attorney in Vermont, I experienced firsthand the tradition of legal excellence we have in Vermont. I know many Vermont lawyers who are among the best this country has to offer, and Bill Sessions earned a reputation as one of the finest trial lawyers in the State. He was widely respected by prosecutors and defense lawyers, and by the plaintiff and defense bars alike. He was praised by those who had been his co-counsel, by State and Federal judges and prosecutors, and even by those who had been his opposing counsel in court. It was a privilege to submit his name to the White House for nomination to the U.S. District Court. At the time, I told President Clinton this would be one nomination he would never have to question his judgment in making because he would have somebody who would always serve the country so well. The Senate confirmed him unanimously on August 11, 1995.  Judge Sessions received his B.A. from Middlebury College in 1969. Upon his graduation with honors from the George Washington University Law School in 1972, Judge Sessions served his country in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1977 and in active service from 1972 to 1973. He also served as a law clerk to another friend of mine, Judge Hilton Dier of the Addison County District Court. Before his service on the Federal bench, Judge Sessions contributed to his community as an adjunct professor at Vermont Law School; in private practice; as the executive director of the Addison County Youth Services Bureau; and as a public defender in Addison County, VT.  During his years of service on the Federal bench, Judge Sessions has worked tirelessly to ensure that all those who come before him are treated fairly and with dignity. He is a judge who has taken seriously his commitment to both justice and the American people. He served for many years as a member of the Judicial Conference, composed of the leaders of the Federal judiciary.  Judge Sessions also served for a decade on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, eventually serving as its Chairman. Three Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, nominated him to this Commission, and the Senate confirmed him unanimously each time. As a commissioner, Judge Sessions made deeply significant contributions to American sentencing policy. He played an important role in the reduction of the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses. He has done vital work to improve the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. This was especially important following a number of Supreme Court cases that gave judges more discretion in the sentences they impose. Even after his time on the Sentencing Commission, Judge Sessions continued to work for better sentencing policy, publishing an article in a journal of the University of Virginia School of Law that explained how the three branches of government could work together to improve sentencing in America.  Judge Sessions has not forgotten what it is to be a Vermonter. He still finds time on weekends to be at farmers markets around Vermont. He is a familiar face at the booth for Blue Ledge Farm, a small Vermont dairy started by his daughter, Hannah, and son-in-law, Greg. I think of a picture of him holding a grandchild in one hand and making change for one of the customers with the other.  He is one of our country's most respected jurists. He is a lawyer's lawyer and a judge's judge. Marcelle and I think of him and Abi, his wife, as dear personal friends.  Our justice system has benefited a great deal from Judge Sessions' years of service. I thank Judge Sessions for all he has done as a Federal judge. I thank him for continuing to serve as a model jurist.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 16, 2014]            Sessions Reflects on Years On and Off the Bench                           (By Brent Curtis)       U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions III will shift to      senior status.       Long before he was making decisions in a courtroom, federal      Judge William Sessions III was working to keep people out of      them.       With only months remaining before he shifts to senior      status in June, Sessions, who turned 67 this month, can look      back over two     decades of rulings that carried both constitutional and      criminal ramifications.       But before he was tapped by President Bill Clinton to serve      as a federal judge in Vermont in 1995, and before he began a      career as a trial lawyer and civil rights practitioner in the      1970s, Sessions was a teacher and an advocate to troubled      youth and prison inmates.       After earning a bachelor's degree from Middlebury College      in 1969, Sessions went to Washington, D.C., to attend the      George Washington University Law School.       Before his legal studies began, he volunteered to be a      reading and math teacher to inmates in the Washington, D.C.,      prison system.       ``It was a profound experience for me,'' Sessions said in      an interview. ``I was nervous and scared but I learned how to      relate with these guys and I learned and loved their stories,      and decided at that point I wanted to work with kids and      young people.''       He added, ``I had this unbelievably moving experience and      then the question was `How do I get involved in helping young      people so they don't end up in places like prison?' ''       His initial work toward that goal was to open a youth      center for delinquent and troubled kids in Middlebury. But      when a job as a public defender opened up in the mid 1970s,      Sessions said he seized the opportunity and spent the next      two decades blending his humanitarian and legal passions.                             Focused on law       With that kind of background, the role of a judge--whose      job it is to remain impartial during often emotionally and      politically charged proceedings--might seem too restrictive.       But Sessions said that, like all judges, he has strived to      suppress his biases and focus on the law and the legal      questions that have come before him.       The one area where he said his humanitarianism shows in the      courtroom is in the courtesy he strives to show to everyone      who stands before him.       ``I love treating people with respect,'' he said. ``In this      courtroom, I take a great deal of pride in seeing that a      little bit of Vermont takes place in the courtroom. . . .      Each defendant is treated respectfully. I think that's how      people treat each other in Vermont.''       He has also tried to look beyond a person's crime to      consider variables about their risk to commit future      offenses, their rehabilitative needs including mental health      and substance abuse and the message that a potential sentence      might send to the broader public.       ``I would say that I look closely at the nature of the      crime and whether they're taking responsibility for it,'' he      said. ``In all the studies I've read, if someone is      accountable for their crime, they're much less likely to re-     offend.''       ``On the other hand, I feel really strongly that human      characteristics, the need for rehabilitation and the need to      protect society by addressing those issues that a particular      defendant has are also important,'' the judge added.       Over the years, Sessions has heard countless criminal      cases, including the first death penalty case in the state in      more than half a century. In that case, involving convicted      murderer Donald Fell, Sessions ruled in 2002 that the Federal      Death Penalty Act of 1994 was unconstitutional. The 2nd U.S.      Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling and an      appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court wasn't taken up by the      justices. Because Fell's case remains under appeal, Sessions      said he is unable to discuss it.       Sessions also served for 11 years on the U.S. Sentencing      Commission which was established to address disparities in      criminal sentencing.       Politics surrounds the group, with congressmen split over      whether they wanted to create it in 1999 and insistence among      legislators that the commissions members be made up equally      of judges nominated by conservatives and liberals.                             Judges united       But the agendas of the politicians who created the      commission didn't enter into the work of the judges who      Sessions said were routinely united in their opinions on      changes designed to make sentencing guidelines and outcomes      more uniform from state to state.       And in no arena were the judges more in agreement, he said,      than in their work on addressing the disparities in      sentencing for those guilty of possessing crack cocaine.       Prior to the commission's work on crack cocaine sentences,      a 100-to-1 disparity existed between sentencing for crack and      powder cocaine.       A defendant guilty of possessing 5 grams of crack cocaine      faced a five-year minimum sentence while a person would have      to possess 500 grams of powder cocaine to receive the same      punishment.       ``It stemmed from a fear in the 1980s that crack cocaine      was a devastating drug that was much more serious than powder      cocaine,'' Sessions said. ``So the penalties were      extraordinarily high. Five grams of cocaine is an      extraordinarily small amount.''       After it became clear that there wasn't much difference      between crack and powder in terms of ill effects, and after      it became clear that those being sentenced for crack cocaine      possession were disproportionately black people, Sessions      said it became obvious to all the judges on the commission      that their first task needed to be a change to the crack      sentencing guidelines.       ``We went around the room and we were each asked what we      wanted to change first and the judges unanimously spoke of      changing the crack versus powder cocaine disparity,'' he      said. ``The reason really stems not only out of the criminal      justice system but on the impact on minority communities in      the country.''       In 2004, the commission changed the sentencing guidelines      for crack cocaine possession and in 2010 Congress passed      changes to the required amount someone must possess to      receive a minimum five or 10-year jail sentence.       The changes were made retroactively and had the effect, on      average, of reducing jail sentences for crack cocaine      possession by three years.       ``That meant that 20,000 people in prison were resentenced      for crack cocaine and many were released immediately,''      Sessions said, calculating that about 25 cases in Vermont      were affected by the sentencing change.                            National impact       Beyond the criminal cases, Sessions has decided a number of      cases with weighty constitutional import.       Thanks to being in a small state with just two federal      judges, Sessions said he has received a disproportionate      amount of cases with potential national ramifications over      the years.       One of the most far reaching cases he's decided was a 2007      case in which he ruled in favor of Vermont, New York and a      number of environmental groups in a case involving several      automobile manufacturers.       The case was based on regulations passed in California and      then adopted in Vermont and New York that sought to reduce      automobile emissions by establishing higher mileage      requirements for new cars.       ``(The auto manufacturers) sued in each of the circuits and      our case came up first,'' Sessions said. ``It was a question      of whether it was a requirement that was justified      constitutionally.''       Car manufacturers argued that the changes would have a      severe impact on the industry and they argued that global      warming hadn't been established.       Over the course of a six-week trial, Sessions heard from      dozens of witnesses before issuing a 350-page decision that      upheld the state's regulations.       ``I've been told it's in textbooks on environmental law,''      he said.       The shift to senior status will likely reduce Sessions'      workload, as a new federal judge will be appointed to the      district. But while he said he's looking forward to time with      his four grandchildren and hiking and biking with his wife,      the judge said he isn't thinking yet about slowing his work      on the bench.       ``I'm not planning on slowing down at all,'' he said. ``At      this point, I'm a pretty young guy. I'm going to be 67 this      month, but I feel like 50.''
