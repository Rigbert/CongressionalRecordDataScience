Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to point out that there is an existing 30 years of studies on the shelf. Quite literally, thousands of pages and millions of dollars have been spent and the time for action has finally come to move from the studyphase to a consensus-based Federal, State, local, NEPA approved engineering solution. Every day compounds the environmental problems of the sea, adding time and expense to the solution. Act now or the sea dies, period.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman in California (Mrs. Bono).
