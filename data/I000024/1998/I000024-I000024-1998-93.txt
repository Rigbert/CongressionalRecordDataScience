I think there might be some misunderstanding. First of all, we did have a vote back in 1995. That was the resolution of disapproval. And I suggest that we only lost that by three votes. And at that time there was a guarantee it was going to be a 12-month operation, it would not exceed $1.2 billion, all of these things. So predicated on that, the vote took place.  Now we are over there, and, quite frankly, I would have preferred to have an amendment that would require a vote periodically, every 3 months or every 6 months, on approval of leaving them there, because I think that wouldbe much stronger. I think we need to be on record.  But all the Senator is doing is just--he is not saying this is going to be a resolution of disapproval or approval that we are voting on; it is just a vote.
