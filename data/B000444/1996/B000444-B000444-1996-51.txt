 President, there are moments in the history of every legislative body when the members, and the public, are forcefully reminded that the achievements of the body as a whole have depended significantly upon the skills and the leadership of a single individual. One of those moments has arrived for the Delaware State Senate with the decision of State Senator Richard S. Cordrey not to seek reelection in 1996, after 30 years of public service.  That his colleagues have long recognized his outstanding personal qualities is made clear by the fact that for 24 of those 30 years, Senator Cordrey has served as president pro tempore of the Delaware Senate--an exceptional tenure in that office that is unrivaled in Delaware's history or among his counterparts in other States. As no one knows better than those of us who serve in the U.S. Senate, such extended recognition of legislative leadership is a certain sign of a rare and enduring trust, and Senator Cordrey's legislative record demonstrates why he has been for so long accorded that trust--fully 80 percent of the bills he has introduced in the Delaware Senate have been passed by both houses of the Delaware General Assembly and signed into law by one of the five Delaware Governors who have held office since Senator Cordrey first entered the Delaware Senate. I doubt that any of us here, or any of our predecessors in this Senate could claim equivalent legislative success.  A major legacy of that success is Delaware's Rainy Day Fund that sets aside 2 percent of the state's revenues in a fund that can be called upon in the event of a devastating economic recession. Delaware's thriving economy and its solid reputation on Wall Street can be largely attributed to that Cordrey-led initiative in fiscal responsibility. He demonstrated similar economic insight and leadership in shepherding through the general assembly in the 1980's Delaware's landmark Financial Center Development Act and related legislation which has expanded Delaware's thriving financial-services sector and given the State's economy a major boost.  But the hallmark of Richard Cordrey's leadership of the Delaware State Senate has been his character and personality--an honest and affable man with a set of well-defined personal values and an adamant integrity who could nevertheless create bipartisan consensus out of legislative chaos. A Republican colleague, State Senator Myrna Bair, has said of Cordrey, a Democrat, ``He had a way of promoting what he believed while allowing others to vote their way with no hard feelings;'' and a Democratic colleague, State Senator Thurman Adams, has said, ``He always spoke what he thought was the truth. He took time with people, and they developed tremendous trust in him. His word was his bond.''  Mr. President, no legislature would willingly say good-by to a leader who consistently demonstrated such qualities over a quarter-century, and the Delaware State Senate will miss the steady hand of Richard Cordrey at the helm, as will the people of Delaware--but he has chosen to retire from office with the same firmness that characterized him in office and, knowing Delaware will benefit far into the future from the body of law and the style of leadership he has created, we Delawareans all wish him well as he returns to private life.                          ____________________
