Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, in response to the gentleman from New Hampshire, the States have been on notice for 5 years that national policy disfavors taxing access to the Internet. While it is true that the grandfather clause is repealed by this bill, in the State of New Hampshire in 2002 $2\1/2\ million was collected through Internet access taxes. That is 13/100ths of 1 percent of the total revenues of the State of New Hampshire.  Obviously, getting rid of this multiple and discriminatory and regressive tax is something that should be a national policy.  I think the Internet is interstate commerce, not intrastate commerce. And, thus, I believe that the bill ought to be approved.
