 President, it is my sad duty to report to my colleagues on a young Kentuckian who has been lost while serving his country. SSgt Ryan D. Austin of the U.S. Air Force passed away on August 6, 2013, in Maidstone, in the United Kingdom. He had been stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and he was 25 years old.  For his service in uniform, Staff Sergeant Austin received several medals,awards, and decorations, including the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon, the NCO Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert Marksman Ribbon, the Air Force Training Ribbon, and the Cyberspace Support Badge.  Ryan enlisted in the Air Force in January of 2010. He was deployed to Germany with the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing, First Communications Maintenance Squadron.  Ryan's brother Nathan said:       Being with [the Air Force] was the best career move he ever      made. The Air Force gave him the chance to go overseas, learn      new cultures and serve his country just like our father did.      It made him feel he gave something back to his country, as      well as protect America.  Ryan was raised in Laurel County, the son of Karen Long and Doug Austin, who also served in uniform. He graduated from South Laurel High School in 2006. Friends remember that he enjoyed golf, cooking, working for charities, and traveling.  Nathan remembers:       When Ryan was around, he was fun to be with. We included      each other in our hobbies like tennis, basketball and video      games. We had our friends and we always had great times . . .      it's really a heavy burden on my heart to know that I have      lost a brother.  While in high school, Ryan worked as a teacher's aide for Joey Marcum, a science teacher. Joey remembers:       Ryan was such an awesome young man. He was honest,      hardworking and dependable. You could depend on him for      literally anything. He was just a really good guy.  Ryan leaves behind his wife Jessica. The two of them were married on December 6, 2009. At the time of Ryan's death, Jessica was pregnant with their first child. She had a boy, named Brayden Kaine Austin. Ryan ``was really looking forward to being a father,'' his brother Nathan said.  Christa Koeller is a friend of Ryan and Jessica's who lived across the street from them when Ryan and Christa's husband were both stationed at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha. She remembers the couple's joy at learning they would have a baby:       When he found out and Jessica found out that they both      would be parents, they were so overjoyed to start that new      segment of their lives. Ryan was a family man, devoted to his      job, and he was very dedicated as an airman. . . . A baby son      lost his father, and will never know him.  Ryan's funeral service in Corbin, KY, was officiated by Pastor Daniel Carmack of Hawk Creek Church. Firefighters, policemen, county health care workers, friends, family, and even those who did not know Ryan but wished to pay their respects literally lined the town streets as the funeral procession passed by. Ryan received full military honors from the Honor Guard of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  Pastor Carmack said:       Ryan Austin was not only a soldier, but a leader that has      left an indelible mark on this generation.  The Pastor continued:       Ryan will long be remembered as . . . a devoted husband,      loving son, leader to his generation, and always a friend.      Although he was only 25, he have proved the statement true      that ``life is not measured in quantity, but in quality,''      and he lived his life to the full with integrity and honor.  Pastor Carmack, who was Ryan's youth pastor and watched this young man grow up, remembers that ``Ryan was a kid that always served others.'' I think it is clear that as an adult, a husband, a father, and an airman, Ryan's commitment to serving others only grew stronger.  We in the Senate are thinking today of Ryan Austin's loved ones, including his wife Jessica; his son Brayden; his father Doug; his brothers Nathan Austin and Dylon Wall; his sister Rachel Austin; and many other beloved family members and friends. Ryan was laid to rest next to his mother Karen Long.  I would like Ryan's family to know that the Senate honors Sergeant Ryan D. Austin's life of service. We are saddened by this very tragic loss, and we are grateful for his supreme sacrifice, which reminds us all of the meaning of valor.                          ____________________
