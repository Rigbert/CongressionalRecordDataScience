 President, the committee included language in the bill when it was reported to require the Administrative Office of the Courts to do a space utilization study of courtroom space and utilization. Since the bill was reported from the committee, the AOC has been working with the appropriate authorizing committees to review courtroom space and utilization. These issues should appropriately be reviewed in this manner. It is for that reason I am moving to strike this provision.  It has been cleared on both sides.
