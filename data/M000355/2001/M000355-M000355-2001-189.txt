 President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves, I listened carefully to his remarks, and I also say to the Senator from New Jersey that not only were nonseverability clauses a part of the three campaign finance reform bills that left the Senate in 1990, 1992, and 1993, it is a part of the Harkin amendment that we just voted on a couple of hours ago which had the support of 32 Members of the Senate on his side of the aisle.  So the notion that somehow nonseverability is unusual or inappropriate is absurd. It is more often the case that these are part of campaign finance reform bills that we deal with in the Senate.
