President, today, I want to talk about an incredible champion of America's railroads. James A. Stem, Jr., has been a tireless advocate for the men and women who keep our Nation's railroads operating for nearly 50 years. He has done just about every job in the industry and will soon be retiring as the national legislative director of the Transportation Division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, Transportation Workers, formerly the United Transportation Union, UTU.  James began his career in 1966 as a trainman for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in his native Raleigh, NC. He joined the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and worked in numerous capacities including as a trainman, switchman, hostler helper, hostler, fireman, and locomotive engineer. He even holds seniority as a locomotive engineer on a CSX line.  In the 1970s, James became much more involved in rail labor in North Carolina for the United Transportation Union. He was a delegate to five UTU International conventions and was eventually elected as the North Carolina State legislative director in 1984. He would go on to become the UTU alternate national legislative director in 1998, serving alongside a legend, James Brunkenhoefer--also known as ``Brokenrail.'' James was elevated to national legislative director in 2009. In 2011, United Transportation Union and Sheet Metal Workers International Association merged to become the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers. James continued his work with an even larger membership, now more than 216,000 strong.  James has frequently testified before Congress, always advocating for the betterment of working men and women in the railroad industry. He was part of the original 1997 Positive Train Control Working Group sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration.  James has been a great defender of Amtrak and commuter rail and a strong proponent of high speed rail. When cuts threatened the effectiveness of passenger rail, James fought to block them on Capitol Hill. When railroad workers needed improved health and safety benefits, James was there. He has tirelessly advocated for the working men and women on the railroads, making sure they have good paying jobs, proper health care, and a solid retirement.  James' influence can be felt at almost every level of government, within the industry, and inside rail labor. Two of his former UTU colleagues currently serve as Federal Railroad Administrator and Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board. Both will tell you that without James's leadership and friendship, they would not be where they are today.  It is with great pride that I congratulate James A. Stem, Jr. for his long career in the railroad industry and for the incalculable contributions he made there. I wish James and his wife Bonnie well in their retirement and hope they are able to enjoy extended family time with their children and grandchildren.                          ____________________
