Speaker, I join in celebrating the twenty-seventh anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), legislation I was proud to introduce and shepherd to passage with bipartisan support.  Few laws have had as broad an impact as the ADA, which reshaped the very landscape of America for people with differing abilities, literally opening doors and, with them, opportunities. It has enabled millions to live with greater independence and dignity, and it continues to inspire other nations to adopt their own laws guaranteeing equal access and equal opportunity for all.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in both parties to build on the ADA's successes and ensure that the promise of America can be kept in full for those with disabilities.                          ____________________
