Res. 219       Whereas in the United States and around the world, more      than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of      extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of      extinction;       Whereas the actual and potential benefits derived from many      species have not yet been fully discovered and would be      permanently lost if not for conservation efforts;       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping      crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray      wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have      resulted in great improvements in the viability of such      species;       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound      research, careful coordination, and intensive management of      conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness      and education; and       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the      first steps in effectively informing the public about      endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates March 8, 2006, as ``Endangered Species      Day''; and       (2) encourages--       (A) educational entities to spend at least 30 minutes on      ``Endangered Species Day'' teaching and informing students      about threats to, and the restoration of, endangered species      around the world;       (B) organizations, businesses, and agencies with a shared      interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate on      educational information for use in schools; and       (C) the people of the United States to observe the day with      appropriate ceremonies and activities.
