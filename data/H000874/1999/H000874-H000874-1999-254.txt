Speaker, proceeding under my reservation, we obviously will not object. We support not only this resolution but the next two resolutions that will be offered for the purposes of accomplishing the objectives set forth by the chairman. I will not object to the next two and will allow them to pass simply by unanimous consent immediately upon being read.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
