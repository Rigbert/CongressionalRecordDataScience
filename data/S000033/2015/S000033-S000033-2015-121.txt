 President, the amendment we are going to be discussing now--and I will say a few words about it in a moment--deals with one of the most important issues facing our country; that is, the lack of affordability of college and the reality that when millions of our young people graduate school, they are left in crushing debt year after year after year, and they are unable to refinance that debt which has a huge impact on their lives.  I give time now to Senator Warren, who has played a great role in focusing on this issue and has brought forth what I think is an excellent amendment.  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.
