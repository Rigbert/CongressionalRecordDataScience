Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Just in closing, I want to again thank the lead authors. They have both been real players on our subcommittee all year long. I have appreciated their active participation on so many issues. We have worked on a bipartisan basis on virtually everything, and as we look at the end of this legislative calendar year, this is certainly a major success, and I can remember our first hearings when we began this journey to get this legislation done, virtually every single Member, Republican and Democrat, personally had made a E-911 call from their cell phone. We had all had different experiences as we thought about the calls we made in our district. All of us know our district like a blanket. We could tell exactly where we were. But when we are in somebody else's district, whether it be here in Washington, D.C. or I remember the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry), who is also very active on this, when he talked about going from Nebraska to Colorado, he had no clue where he was on that highway, wherever it was, and we all felt very frustrated as we saw these accidents literally appear before us. So this is legislation that perhaps some in the industry were not supportive of at the beginning. We pushed them along. They are now fully on board. We have sent a message to the States: They are collecting money from us in our bills to make sure that this legislation is coming through. Spend it the right way, and if they do not, then they do not participate in this program.  I think, too, the session that we had at the FCC, where the gentleman from Illinois and other Members on both sides of the aisle were there, we embarrassed some of the States that are using the money for other purposes. Let us get this money spent for the reason it is being collected, for the right cause so that we will save the lives that all of us want to save. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
