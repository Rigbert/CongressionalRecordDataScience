Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I would simply say from our side of the aisle, and I know I speak for the leader and myself, in light of the fact that the House has urged the conference committee to report out the Senate bill, and in light of the fact that the Senate passed it 94-2, it would seem to be a relatively easy matter if the conferees followed the instructions of the House to pass the Senate bill. I believe the Senate would probably concur in that judgment, and we could have a bill out of here perhaps as early as next week.
