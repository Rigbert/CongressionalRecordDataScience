Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to the gentleman that his figures are absolutely correct. I am reading from the chart put out by the INS called ``Immigration to the United States, Fiscal Years through 1993.'' Of course, in 1993 we had 904,000 admitted; in 1992, 973,000 admitted; in 1991, 1.8 million; 1990, 1.5 million; 1989, over 1 million. The gentleman is correct, the average has been over 1 million a year.
