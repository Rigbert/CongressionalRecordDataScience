In many cases they want navigators, and now they are being hired from various community organizations, some of which I really wonder about. But in some States where only hundreds have signed up, there will be more navigators than people who have signed up. So obviously it has gotten to the point where everybody has a problem, where insurance ought to have a navigator. This is at considerable expense--I don't remember now how many millions it totals--and a brand new group of navigators is being hired at considerable expense to make this work. And the advertising rolls on, and then the news media discovers more and more about all the problems.  I appreciate the Senator bringing this to the attention of the American people.  I note the distinguished Senator from Nebraska is here, and he even has a chart that will educate the American people.
