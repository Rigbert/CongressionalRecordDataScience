 But if not, as we have in the past, I want to say something; my friends on my side of the aisle know this. I have always found the gentleman from Missouri, the Republican whip, to be open to discussion and reasonable discussion to see if we can move forward.  I don't know what exactly was said on the other side, but I would reiterate that nobody, I think, in this House, as I said in the debate, closing the debate on the CHIP bill when we passed it through this House very handily, that I believe every Member of this House wants to ensure that children have access to health care. And we need to work on how that can be accomplished. We think the bill we passed does that. But we certainly will be available to make sure that happens however we can get it done.
