President, this is the petcoke amendment. There are communities in this Nation--Chicago, Detroit, Long Beach, CA--and it may be coming to other areas soon. Petcoke is the byproduct of Canadian tar sands when it is refined. This pipeline willgenerate 15,000 tons a day of petcoke that has to be stored. We are asking that it be stored responsibly so it doesn't blow through towns and neighborhoods that I and my colleagues represent, and let's establish standards for that purpose. It can still be used legitimately for many products, but let's make sure it doesn't cause respiratory problems for the people we represent.
