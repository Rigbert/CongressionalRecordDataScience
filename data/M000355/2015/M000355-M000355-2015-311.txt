 The chairman of that committee, Senator Kirk, is working with the ranking member to move that bill across the floor next week. They will have a Senate substitute to the bill pending, and Senators will then further amend. If Senators cooperate in moving things along and scheduling votes on amendments to the bill, we can vote on passage on Tuesday night so that Senators can commemorate Veterans Day back home with their constituents.  Obviously, this is going to require some cooperation from all Members. However, I encourage those Senators with amendments to the MILCON-VA bill to work with Senator Kirk and Senator Tester to get them in the queue for floor consideration.  I yield the floor.
