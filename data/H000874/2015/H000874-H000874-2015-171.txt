I don't know whether the gentleman had an opportunity to read an article--it may have been an op-ed, I have got the clip--but I am not sure where it appeared in the paper. But the former Speaker, Newt Gingrich, wrote an article that essentially stood for the proposition that Republicans and Democrats about a decade or a little over a decade ago were able to come together and to take advantage of the research opportunities that Speaker Gingrich, former Speaker Gingrich, said were apparent and possible in today's day. I share that view.  Many people, including your predecessor, Mr. Cantor, were concerned and have recently said that we need to increase substantially the investments and the resources that we have at NIH. Unfortunately, as the gentleman may know, in the allocations to subcommittees that were adopted yesterday in the Appropriations Committee, as I understand it, there was $3 billion cut from the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, which covers NIH, which will make it very difficult to do what Speaker Gingrich, former Speaker Gingrich, suggested we do in The New York Times today.                              {time}  1215  The gentleman, if he hasn't read the article, doesn't need to comment on it, but I want to call to his attention that we are very concerned, but people on your side and your former Speaker are very concerned that we are not investing sufficient sums to take advantage of the opportunities, and it is costing us.  He particularly mentioned Alzheimer's and the extraordinary costs related to Alzheimer's disease and that, if we can either delay the onset of Alzheimer's or prevent Alzheimer's, that we will, in effect, save tens of billions of dollars.  I bring that up simply in the context of we really do need to get the resources into the Appropriations Committee that Mr. Rogers, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a senior Republican in this House, says are necessary to meet our responsibility.  I would hope that the majority leader would be looking at that and would, hopefully, work towards that end.  Let me ask you two more questions, Mr. Leader. The highway bill, as the gentleman knows, expires in terms of its authorization for funding on the 31st of May. It is not on the schedule, obviously, this month, but can the gentleman tell me--we are very concerned, and, as you know, every Governor, every county executive, every mayor--you have talked to them; I have talked to them--are very concerned about the resources that they are going to have available to do bridges and highways maintenance, infrastructure investment.  Can the gentleman tell me when we might, in the 2 weeks that we will have in May, be able to consider the highway bill?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman is correct about the highway funding. We look forward to making sure we get that done on time in a bipartisan manner. We will be continuing to work with you as we move forward.
