President, in the 1996 election cycle, unprecedented amounts of money freely flowed into and out of the campaign coffers of candidates for Federal public office. The time required to raise funds is excessive, and increasingly more expensive election campaigns have fostered the view that spending is out of control.  Campaign finance reform is long overdue. The fact that we are embarking upon an intensive scrutiny of past campaign practices should not impede our effort to move swiftly and concurrently to correct deficiencies in the present system.  We must do more than just point out the errors of the past. We must make changes for the future.  Today, Senator Byron Dorgan and I submitted a resolution stating that it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should proceed to consideration, by no later than May 31, 1997, of comprehensive campaign finance reform that reduces spending on political campaigns and curtails the influence of special interest money in Federal elections, and that the Senate should adopt as a goal the final enactment of such legislation by no later than July 4, 1997.                          ____________________
