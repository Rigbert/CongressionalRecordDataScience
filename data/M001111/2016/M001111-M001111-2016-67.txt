 President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent LTC Edward P. ``Ned'' Ash for his exemplary dedication to duty and service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. Lieutenant Colonel Ash will retire this summer after more than two decades in the U.S. Army.  Entering the Army from Vancouver, WA, Lieutenant Colonel Ash earned a commission from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree in international relations and was commissioned an armor officer in 1994.  Lieutenant Colonel Ash served in a variety of cavalry units and assignments during his 22 years of service. As a lieutenant, he served as a tank platoon leader, scout platoon leader, troop executive officer, and as a squadron staff officer in the 2nd Squadron, 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. As a captain from 1999 to 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Ash remained in a hardship assignment with the 2nd Infantry Division for 3 years to serve in Korea. While assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, he commanded Bravo Troop and Headquarters Troop in the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. After working at the national training center, where Lieutenant Colonel Ash trained units that were preparing to deploy in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment. He deployed with this unit to Iraq while serving as the operations officer and then to Afghanistan as the squadron executive officer.  Lieutenant Colonel Ash spent his last 4 years in the Army as a budget liaison in the office around the corner from mine in the Russell Senate Office Building and has become a fixture in the Halls of the U.S. Senate. My staff have called on him many times to help with issues affecting the soldiers and military families in Washington State and around the country. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has approached every inquiry from my staff, from requisition requests for tents to detailed questions about national strategy, with the same calm wisdom and thoughtfulness that puts serving people and getting results above all else. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has also led the teams that supported the logistic requirements for the funerals of two of my colleagues who served in the Army: Senator Daniel Inouye and Senator Frank Lautenberg. His efforts during these funerals helped ensure that they were conducted with the dignity befitting the memories of these giants of the Senate. I can confidently say that Lieutenant Colonel Ash's leadership has positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors throughout his career.  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending LTC Edward P. Ash for over two decades of service to his country. We wish Ned and his wife, Jamie Skaluba, all the best as they continue their journey of service.                          ____________________
