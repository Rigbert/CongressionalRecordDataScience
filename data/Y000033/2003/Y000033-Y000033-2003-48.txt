Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for yielding me this time, and I would make the usual brief congratulatory comments about the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis). He has done an outstanding job as the chairman, along with the ranking member, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha). They produced a really good defense bill and we are producing this defense bill at a time when the world's attention is not national defense.                              {time}  1115  One of the things that I want to talk about today has to do with those who are providing for our national defense, those soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines and Coast Guardsmen who have been deployed to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Liberia, to wherever else the Nation decided to send them. Unfortunately, there have been casualties. Some have been killed in action, and some have been seriously wounded in action. Many Members know my wife and I visit the wounded at Walter Reed Hospital and at Bethesda Naval Hospital as often as we can, and she more than I.
