 I would like to, first, thank all the people who are here, the staff and the pages. This has been a tough session for many but tougher for many of them than some Members of the Senate because many times they have had to wait until the very last Senator of either political party has finished for the day before they go home. I was reflecting on that yesterday afternoon in the midst of one of the toughest, historic snowstorms in Washington, DC; that hundreds of staff people were waiting at their post, doing their jobs on a Saturday, in the middle of a snowstorm, when virtually every business around Washington was closing down. I wish to thank them and the pages on both sides of the aisle for their patience and commitment to this great country and this great institution.  Why are we here on Sunday? Why were we here on Saturday? Why are we going to take a vote at 1 in the morning on Monday? Good questions, and I am not sure there are satisfying answers. But there are answers. We are here because we are trying to finish health care reform. It has been a project that has been underway for almost a year now, since the President challenged us to do something, and a lot of effort has been expended on both sides of the aisle. But I will say I can speak for our side of the aisle.  Senator Max Baucus came to me more than a year ago and sat down in my office to talk about health care reform. He was preparing for this battle as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and knew he would play a central role, gathering the opinions of members of his committee and Members of the Senate.  Efforts were underway with Senator Kennedy from his remote location in Massachusetts, recuperating from surgery and from cancer therapy, trying to keep his committee on track toward health care reform. He turned over that mantle to Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who did an admirable job with the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
