President, I also have a package of amendments that have been worked out with the other side. One on behalf of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Bumpers; another which adds the term ``education'' to the EQUIP program. A third is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on methyl bromide and a colloquy between Senator Lugar and myself.
