I especially thank Senator Feingold. I have been happy to cosponsor this measure.  I believe, as do many of us today, that the decision to invade Iraq was, in fact, the worst foreign policy decision of our time, maybe beyond that. We will pay a heavy price for it, but we will not pay a price as a nation as great as the price paid by the families who have lost in combat a son or daughter or husband or wife they dearly loved. Those men and women are true heroes.
