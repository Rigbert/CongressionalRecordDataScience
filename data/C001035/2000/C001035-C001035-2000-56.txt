President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Resolution Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This law has had a very positive impact on the lives of millions of disabled Americans. In fact, since its enactment, the number of children with disabilities who complete high school has grown significantly, and the number who enroll in college has more than tripled. Academic achievement is increasing, along withthe nation's expectations about the abilities of children with disabilities. Our commitment to a quality education for everybody now extends to America's six million students with disabilities.  We know that special education is not a ``place'' or a ``label,'' but a set of services that allow children to succeed in school, go on to lead productive lives, and enter the world of work. This is something that matters to me because it means so much to the people in Maine who have been able to lead productive lives because the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act afforded them the quality education they deserved.  This is why we need to increase consistently the Federal financial support for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--so that the Federal Government does, in fact, pay each school in America 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for every special education student enrolled. Washington made that promise to our local communities when it passed IDEA.  For example, this year in Maine, local schools will receive only $702 per special education student under IDEA--$1698 per student less than the $2400 it would receive if the Federal Government paid its share. In total, Maine will receive $60 million less than it was promised. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet amount stands at an astounding $11 billion nationally. We cannot continue to shift this burden to our local communities. We must meet the Federal commitment to help pay for special education costs.  Let us take the 25th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to recognize the positive impact this law has on every community in the United States, but let us not forget our Federal commitment of 40 percent to help our schools and communities implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.                          ____________________
