Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Sylvia and Leroy Fleming are two of these individuals. On September 23, 2008, the Temescal District Boy Scouts of America will host the 2008 Distinguished Citizens Dinner in honor of Sylvia and Leroy.  Sylvia has lived in Corona since 1947 and attended Corona schools including St. Edward Catholic School and Corona Senior High School where she graduated with the class of 1962. Leroy came to California from Iowa in 1963. Sylvia and Leroy met while attending Chaffey College and they were married August 1, 1964. Leroy worked for the Orange County Food Service until Sylvia opened the Via-Ery Park N' Eat Catering in 1974 with two trucks. They now load 60 catering trucks serving the Inland Empire.  Sylvia has been involved in the community for many years. She was president of Triple M, a previous branch of the Women's Improvement Club, a commissioner for the Corona Parks and Recreation, and served on the board of the Corona-Norco PTA Council. She also served as Chairman of the Board for the Foundation for Community Health and was a member of Soroptimist International of Corona where she served as President. Sylvia is the recipient of the Status of Women Award and Women Helping Women Award. She was also a member of the St. Edward School Board and received the Seton award from the Diocese of San Bernardino. Another award Sylvia has received is the Distinguished Graduate Award from the National Catholic Educational Association. Sylvia is a Eucharistic Minister for St. Edward Catholic Church and a member of the Catholic Daughters. She is owner of Sylvia's treasures, a business that donates all profits to charity.  Leroy as well has been involved in Corona for several years; he is a member of the Corona Host Lions where he has served as President. He has received the Outstanding Member of the Year Award and Lion of the Year Award. Leroy is instrumental in securing most of the food for the annual Pancake Breakfast held in September. In 2003, Sylvia and Leroy received the Citizens of the Year Award from the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Leroy and Sylvia are also members of the Navy League of Corona and Leroy spends a significant amount of time raising funds for various charitable organizations. Sylvia and Leroy have three children, two sons-in-Iaws and six grandchildren.  Sylvia and Leroy's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Sylvia and Leroy fellow community members, Americans and friends. I know that many community members are grateful for their service and salute them as 2008 Distinguished Citizens.                          ____________________
