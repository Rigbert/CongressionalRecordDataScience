 President, I heard the comments of the Senators from Arizona and Texas. I want to make it very clear, I have never been against discussion. We put this bill out on the floor last Friday. It has been out here for 3 days. I have continually said I am happy to look at any language any Member brings me on any item of discussion under transportation. What I am against is weakening any of the safety provisions we have included in the committee bill.  The proposal that was given to me by the Senator from Arizona considerably weakens and actually guts many of the safety provisions that Senator Shelby and I put into the underlying bill. That simply is not a path we are going to take on the Senate floor. Our provisions were adopted unanimously in the Appropriations Committee. I am not interested in going into a back room and negotiating a sellout of the committee or of the safety provisions that I believe are extremely important. That is simply a nonstarter for me as manager of this bill.  I do remind all Senators they can offer amendments and this Senator is happy to consider them as the rules allow. As far as the NAFTA provisions are concerned, I will remind all of our colleagues once again, the underlying bill is not a violation of NAFTA. That is very clear. I set that out in my remarks this morning, and I am to go through that again this afternoon.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15, when the Senate reconvenes, the Senator from Illinois be allowed 20 minutes to discuss his issue that he would like to present to us and then Senator Bill Nelson from Florida be recognized.
