Speaker, it is with deep sadness but with great respect that I take this time to remember one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, Mrs. Grace Tyson, of East Chicago, Indiana. Mrs. Tyson's many contributions to the Northwest Indiana community as a civil servant and as a leader within her church are worthy of our deepest admiration. Grace passed away at the age of 103 on Friday, November 25, 2011, but the impact and influence she has had on her community will surely live on for generations to come.  Grace Tyson was born in Unity, Illinois, to Mary and Dee McCondle. She attended elementary school in Unity, Illinois, graduated from high school in Sandusky, Illinois, and later attended college in Carbondale, Illinois. In 1940, she married Charles Tyson and they settled down in the city of East Chicago, Indiana. Grace graduated with distinction from Beauty and Cosmetology School in Gary, Indiana, in 1945. Her lifelong career as a licensed cosmetologist and beautician lasted 51 years, until her retirement in 1996. Grace joined Saint Mark African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in the early 1940s. She became a faithful member of the church and Missionary Society, holding the offices of President and Secretary.  Throughout her life, Mrs. Tyson gave of her time to serve those in need. She was very passionate about helping others, and her life was centered around this type of work. She was one of the very first individuals to serve as a volunteer driver for Meals on Wheels, a position she held for over five years. She was a member of the Women's Improvement Club of East Chicago, for which she served as President, Secretary, and Treasurer. Grace also became the area representative and delegate for senior citizens at the Statehouse in Indianapolis. For her truly impressive determination to improve the lives of so many, she was awarded the Governor's Proclamation for her years of service. Grace was known as a quiet, effective leader who served as a positive role model for many young men and women throughout the community of Northwest Indiana.  While Grace Tyson was always active in her community and her church, she cherished her time with her family the most. She leaves to cherish her memory her nieces, Mary Perry and Martha Brownlee; nephew, Tommy (Gwendolyn) Daniel; godson, Edward Williams; and special neighbor Anna Williams; as well as many grand nieces and nephews. She will also be greatly missed by her many friends, neighbors, club members, and caretakers.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Grace Tyson for her outstanding devotion to her community in Northwest Indiana. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation. Grace's selflessness was an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to have represented her in Congress.                          ____________________
