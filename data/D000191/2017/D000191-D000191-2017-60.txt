Speaker, I rise today to recognize Abby Bernstein, a passionate advocate for the rights of the aviation safety inspector and technician workforce of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Abby is retiring from the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists (PASS) union this month after 33 years of service. I am confident that and all of my colleagues who have worked with her, will miss her wise advocacy and kind demeanor.  Abby's career with PASS began in 1984, when she was the union's first, and only, employee. She remained PASS's only employee and ran the union's legislative and membership departments singlehandedly for many years thereafter. Throughout her career, Abby has fought to ensure safety inspectors and technicians are able to do their important work on behalf of the American people in keeping our aviation system running safely and smoothly.  For years, Abby has fought tirelessly for increased aviation safety inspector staffing and improved FAA oversight of the aviation system, and I hope she will retire knowing that the flying public is safer as a result of her work. She was pivotal in joining my colleagues and me in key legislative efforts at various points in the 2000s to improve the FAA's oversight of maintenance, repair, and overhaul work performed on U.S. airlines' fleets at foreign repair stations. She also worked relentlessly to preserve the inspector workforce from unnecessary delegations of authority to the private sector.  Not only has Abby worked to improve aviation safety, but she has also vigorously protected the rights and interests of PASS's members at every turn. When Congress exempted FAA employees from Federal personnel and procurement rules in 1996, Abby fought hard, and successfully, to preserve the rights of FAA employees to organize and to bargain collectively. From the 1990s to today, Abby has been a key ally in efforts to prevent the privatization of FAA air traffic control jobs. She has remained steadfast in her belief that the employees who safeguard the safety and efficiency of the aviation system must remain Federal employees. I would be remiss if I did not note, in particular, Abby's invaluable assistance in the last Congress to counteract, once again, ill-advised efforts to privatize the air traffic control system.  In my own work with Abby on important issues of aviation safety and policy, I have come to know her as a thoughtful, inquisitive, and intellectually curious advocate. In fact, she has such a strong desire to learn and expand her horizons that, having graduated from the University of Maryland in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in management and consumer studies, she returned to her alma mater and obtained a second degree eight years later in computer and information sciences.  Abby's retirement will mark the end of an era for PASS and, indeed, for all of us who have collaborated with her over the years in pursuit of a safer, better aviation system. Although we will miss her, I hope my colleagues will join me in helping send Abby into retirement with all of our very best wishes and most of all, with tremendous thanks for a job well done.                          ____________________
