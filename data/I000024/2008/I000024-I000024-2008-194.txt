President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his cooperation. As I said, if we have any other Members of our side who wish to come down and talk about this, there was that length of time set aside. So I reserve that time for anybody else who wants to speak. If anybody is listening and they wish to use some of this 30 minutes, they are welcome to do it.  I returned 2 days ago from Iraq. It is my 18th trip in the area, in the theater. Sometimes it was Afghanistan and other areas, but it was in that zone there. I wished to take this opportunity to kind of show where we are today, how we got here, and where we are going to go. Some good things are happening over there. A lot of people don't believe it, and some people don't want to believe it.
