 President, I rise today to express my strong support for legislation to provide $250 million in emergency payments to apple growers. I would like to thank Senators Levin and Snowe for their leadership on this issue.  Rural communities and agricultural producers have not enjoyed America's recent economic prosperity. Around the Nation, nearly all commodity producers are enduring low prices and trade challenges. In Washington State, these problems are compounded by a severe drought, an energy crisis, and fish listings under the Endangered Species Act.  The combined impact is devastating. Apple growers in my State, from Okanogan County to Walla Walla County, are going bankrupt. Many family farmers have given up hope. On land that has produced high quality fruit for generations, farmers are tearing out orchards. Farmer cooperatives and other businesses that have been a part of rural communities for decades have closed up shop. Local governments have seen tax revenue decline. And non-farm businesses have struggled as consumers no longer have the cash to buy their goods and services.  In the 106th Congress, we responded. Last year, I worked with my colleagues to pass a $100 million emergency package for apple growers. In 1999, I worked with the Clinton Administration to end the dumping by Chinese companies of non-frozen apple juice concentrate. And on a host of smaller issues, from fighting pests in abandoned orchards, to securing research funding, to breaking down trade barriers, I worked with the industry and other stakeholders to build a stronger foundation for the future.  We can be proud of what we accomplished. But we still have more to do in the 107th Congress.  If signed into law, this new legislation will provide $250 million in emergency payments to apple growers nation-wide. This emergency legislation will not save every producer. It will give the industry the financial support it needs to get through another year of disastrous prices. It will also give us the time we need to develop long-term solutions as part of the next farm bill for apple and other specialty crop growers.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. And I urge the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee to work with the sponsors of this bill to provide meaningful assistance to all apple growers.                                 ______                                       By
