President, I come to the floor today, as so many of my colleagues have, to reflect on the extraordinary tragedy that took place at Fort Hood, TX, yesterday. It is almost inconceivable such an event could take place.  As we sort through the motives and the rationale, which may take weeks, I think we, obviously, have to extend our deepest, sincerest condolences to the families of these men and women.
