Speaker, I take the floor today to honor Cynthia G. Roth, the recipient of the 2000 ATHENA Award.  The ATHENA Foundation Award Programs originated in 1980 by Martha Mayhood Mertz, who realized that in the 75 years of presenting community awards, her Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce, of Michigan, had only once honored a woman. Mertz recognized that focus had to be given to the incredible professional women in our communities and they had to be incorporated into leadership positions in the local Chambers of Commerce.  Cynthia G. Roth, of my own district of Western Riverside, California, has worked with Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce for 23 years. She started with the Chamber as a receptionist and is now the President and Chief Executive Officer, where she oversees a budget of $1.1 million, supervises a staff of 15 and promotes the Riverside region. Cynthia's 23 years with the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce epitomizes the ATHENA philosophy of leadership that celebrates relationships and services to the community.  Mr. Speaker, my district is fortunate to have the dynamic and dedicated community leader in Cynthia. She has given her time and talents to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations of Riverside. Moreover, she has been an exceptional motivator and inspiration to all young women around her.  Cynthia's outstanding work makes me proud to call her a community member and fellow American. I know that all of Riverside, including myself, are grateful for her contribution to the betterment of our community and salute her on May 10th with the 2000 ATHENA Award.  I look forward to continuing to work with her and the many professional women of Riverside County for the good of our community. I would like to close with the ATHENA Foundation motto by Plato: ``What is honored in a country will be cultivated there.''                          ____________________
