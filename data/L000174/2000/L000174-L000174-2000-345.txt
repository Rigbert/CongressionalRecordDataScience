President, I am perfectly willing, from this side, to work with the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from California on time. I do not expect an enormous amount of time to be consumed. It has not been announced, but there is a certain sense that there may not be any more rollcall votes this week so a lot of people are probably going to be leaving. I will definitely try to accommodate them.  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia does have a statement he wishes to make. I have a statement I wish to make. I am simply trying to protect some others who may want to speak, as I am sure the Senator is on his side. But I will continue to work with the distinguished Senator to cut down this time any way we can.
