President, I suggest that, as the Senator from Arizona returns home, he ignore the 40-percent increase and go home and say $1.11 billion new dollars. Perhaps they can relate to that.  I know Senator Corzine wants to speak and several others want to be heard but not necessarily on the highway bill. At the appropriate time, I will ask unanimous consent that there be a period for morning business.  Before I do that, I see the chairman of the subcommittee is here. I ask Senator Bond if he has anything further to say insofar as the highway bill is concerned.
