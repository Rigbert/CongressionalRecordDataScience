I thank the gentleman. Would it be fair for Members to presume, absent further notice, that we will be meeting, as we have been meeting, on the Tuesday evening, Thursday night schedule? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. As the gentleman knows, the House has been very active this year, and we have gotten a lot of our business done, and there is very important business left, but the requirement for floor time is getting less and less, and we do not want to keep Members here any longer than they have to be. So, yes, we anticipate that the schedule would run at least Tuesday through Thursdays in the weeks ahead, but that could be adjusted, too.
