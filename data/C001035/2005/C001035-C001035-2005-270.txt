President, the Lieberman-Collins amendment No. 220 provides $855 million to restore cuts to vital first responder programs in the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and for port security grants. The amendment provides an additional $565 million for programs that support our first responders, including State homeland security formula grants, Urban Area Security Initiative grants, FIRE Act grants, SAFER grants, Emergency Management Planning Grants, and the Metropolitan Medical Response System. It would restore $140 million for community policing and local law enforcement efforts under the COPS and Byrne Grant programs. It would also provide $150 million for port security grants, ensuring at least the same amount of funding for the Nation's ports as last year.                           amendment no. 217
