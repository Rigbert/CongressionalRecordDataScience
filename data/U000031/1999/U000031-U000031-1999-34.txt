Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 184) expressing the sense of Congress regarding the importance of ``family friendly'' programming on television.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 184       Whereas American children and adolescents spend between 22      and 28 hours per week viewing television;       Whereas American homes have an average of 2.75 television      sets, and 87 percent of homes with children have more than      one television set;       Whereas there is a need to increase the availability      programs suitable for the entire family during prime time      viewing hours;       Whereas surveys of television content demonstrate that many      programs contain substantial sexual or violent content;       Whereas although parents are ultimately responsible for      appropriately supervising their children's television      viewing, it is also important to provide positive, ``family      friendly'' programming that is suitable for parents and      children to watch together;       Whereas efforts should be made by television networks,      studios, and the production community to produce more quality      family friendly programs and to air them during times when      parents and children are likely to be viewing together;       Whereas members of the Family Friendly Programming Forum      are concerned about the availability of family friendly      television programs during prime time viewing hours; and       Whereas Congress encourages activities by the Forum and      other entities designed to promote family friendly      programming, including--         (1) participating in meetings with leadership of major      television networks, studios, and production companies to      express concerns;         (2) expressing the importance of family friendly      programming at industry conferences, meetings, and forums;         (3) honoring outstanding family friendly television      programs with a new tribute, the Family Program Awards, to be      held annually in Los Angeles, California;         (4) establishing a development fund to finance family      friendly scripts; and         (5) underwriting scholarships at television studies      departments at institutions of higher education to encourage      student interest in family friendly programming: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) recognizes and honors the efforts of the Family      Friendly Programming Forum and other entities supporting      family friendly programming;       (2) supports efforts to encourage television networks,      studios, and the production community to produce more quality      family friendly programs;       (3) supports the proposed Family Friendly Programming      Awards, development fund, and scholarships, all of which are      designed to encourage, recognize, and celebrate creative      excellence in, and commitment to, family friendly      programming; and       (4) encourages the media and American advertisers to      further a family friendly television environment within which      appropriate advertisements can accompany the programming.
