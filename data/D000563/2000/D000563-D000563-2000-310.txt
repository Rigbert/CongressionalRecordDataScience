President, if I might address the Senator from Nevada through the Chair, the situation we saw yesterday is clear evidence that we are in the campaign season. Instead of dealing with issues that many of us think are critical for families, such as prescription drugs and gun safety legislation, we are instead talking about further investigations.  I think there is a point where this Congress is expected to legislate rather than investigate. The closer we get to the election, I think the more the American people discount some of the rhetoric they are hearing on this issue.
