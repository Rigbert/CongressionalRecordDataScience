President, I would like to bring to your attention a bill I am reintroducing that would make permanent the current tax provision that allows capital assets on Indian lands to be depreciated on an accelerated schedule.  For many years, the Federal tax code has provided an incentive for businesses to invest in operations on Indian reservations and lands across the country. According to the law, businesses that purchase capital equipment and use it on Indian lands will be able to depreciate it, on average, more than 40 percent faster than would otherwise be allowed.  This tax provision is important to Oklahoma because of our longstanding history and unique relationship with Indian tribes. With our sluggish economy, we need to do all we can to encourage businesses to reinvest in and expand their operations, as this will create sustainable job growth.  The accelerated depreciation schedule gives businesses the opportunity to recover investment dollars in capital assets more rapidly. This frees money that would have been tied up in the value of their capital assets, such as buildings, equipment, and machinery and enables companies to reinvest it more quickly than was available with a slower depreciation schedule.  The Oklahoma Department of Commerce has reported that many companies attribute this provision as a key reason for relocating to and expanding within the State. One Oklahoma food processing plant manager stated that the credit was a significant factor in the company's decision to expand.  Additionally, today's announcement by Macy's, Inc. to locate a new, world class online processing center in Tulsa was justified in part by the Indian lands tax provision. This new 1.3 million square feet facility will employ1,100 people full time and will expand to 2,500 people during peak periods. Construction on this project will begin in 2014, and the facility will open for business in 2015. I could not be more excited by Macy's decision to expand its operations in Oklahoma. It is a testament to Oklahoma's strong, business friendly culture and capable work force.  Although the accelerated schedule is currently allowed, the law states it will expire at the end of this year. The provision has typically been renewed each year, but many business leaders have expressed concern that it is not permanent, including the executives of Macy's.  As a former businessman, I understand the problem of unpredictability and so do Oklahoma's business leaders who have expressed frustration over dramatically changing government policies ranging from environmental regulations to the tax code. This kind of environment makes it difficult for businesses to proceed with investment decisions. Businesses need stability, and this is particularly true during times of economic weakness. We in Congress should take this point seriously, and take a step in the right direction by making permanent this important tax provision.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1834       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
