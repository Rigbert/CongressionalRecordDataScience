Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 360) commemorating the 60th anniversary of V-J Day and the end of World War II in the Pacific.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 360       Whereas the United States entered the Second World War in      December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,      and over the next four years Americans participated in what      was arguably the greatest national endeavor in the Nation's      history;       Whereas the casualty toll of Americans in the Pacific      Theater during World War II was approximately 92,904 killed,      208,333 wounded, and tens of thousands missing in action and      prisoners of war, with civilians and military forces of the      Allied Powers suffering equally devastating tolls;       Whereas Japanese military forces and the Japanese civilian      population also suffered staggering losses;       Whereas on August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito of Japan      announced the unconditional surrender of Japan's military      forces, made formal on September 2, 1945, aboard the U.S.S.      Missouri in Tokyo Bay, Japan; thus ending the most      devastating war in human history;       Whereas Japan is now a free and prosperous democracy, a      valued, durable friend based on shared values and mutual      interests, and a guarantor against despotism and oppression      in that area of the world; and       Whereas the courage and sacrifice of the members of the      United States Armed Forces and of the military forces of the      Allied Powers who served valiantly to rescue the Pacific      nations from tyranny and aggression should always be      remembered: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of V-J Day and the end      of World War II in the Pacific theater;       (2) joins with a grateful Nation in expressing respect and      appreciation to the members of the United States Armed Forces      who served in the Pacific theater during World War II; and       (3) remembers and honors those Americans who made the      ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives for their country      during the campaigns in the Pacific theater during World War      II.
