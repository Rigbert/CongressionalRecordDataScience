It is, if you read the continuing resolution. My point is this--and I think the Senator from Alaska would have to agree--never have we been down to mid-November--to mid-November--with so few--in fact, before Monday I think we had only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills signed into law, and on Monday we had signed 3 of the 13. I guess now we sent down another one. But does the Senator from Alaska remember any time under either Republican or Democratic leadership that we were down to mid-November with only two of the appropriations bills signed into law?
