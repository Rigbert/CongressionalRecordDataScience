President, the Republican efforts to shutdown Senate confirmations of qualified judicial nominees who have bipartisan support do not help the American people. This is a shortsighted policy at a time when the judicial vacancy rate remains almost twice what it was at this point in the first term of President Bush. Judicial vacancies during the last few years have been at historically high levels. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently vacant. Their talk of shutting down confirmations for consensus and qualified circuit court nominees is not helping the overburdened Federal courts to which Americans turn for justice.  In a letter dated June 20, 2012, the president of the American Bar Association urged Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to work together to schedule votes on the nominations of William Kayatta, Judge Robert Bacharach and Richard Taranto, three consensus, qualified circuit court nominees awaiting Senate confirmation so that they may serve the American people. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     American Bar Association,                                       Chicago, IL, June 20, 2012.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell:       Amid concerns that the judicial confirmation process is about      to fall victim to presidential election year politics through      the invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule,'' I am writing on      behalf of the American Bar Association to reiterate our grave      concern for the longstanding number of judicial vacancies on      Article III courts and to urge you to schedule floor votes on      three pending, noncontroversial circuit court nominees before      July and on district court nominees who have strong      bipartisan support on a weekly basis thereafter.       Three of the four circuit court nominees pending on the      Senate floor are consensus nominees who have received      overwhelming approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee.      Both William Kayatta, Jr. of Maine, nominated to the First      Circuit, and Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, nominated to the      Tenth Circuit, have the staunch support of their Republican      senators. Richard Taranto, nominated to the Federal Circuit,      enjoys strong bipartisan support, including the endorsement      of noted conservative legal scholars. All three nominees also      have stellar professional qualifications and each has been      rated unanimously ``well-qualified'' by the ABA's Standing      Committee on the Federal Judiciary.       As you know, the ``Thurmond Rule'' is neither a rule nor a      clearly defined event. While the ABA takes no position on      what invocation of the ``Thurmond Rule'' actually means or      whether it represents wise policy, recent news stories have      cast it as a precedent under which the Senate, after a      specified date in a presidential election year, ceases to      vote on nominees to the federal circuit courts of appeals. We      note that there has been no consistently observed date at      which this has occurred during the presidential election      years from 1980 to 2008. With regard to the past three      election years, the last circuit court nominees were      confirmed in June during 2004 and 2008 and in July during      2000. In deference to these historical cut-off dates and      because of our conviction that the Senate has a continuing      constitutional duty to act with due diligence to reduce the      dangerously high vacancy rate that is adversely affecting our      federal judiciary, we exhort you to schedule votes on these      three outstanding circuit court nominees this month.       We also urge you to continue to work together to move      consensus district court nominees to the floor for a vote      throughout the rest of the session, lest the vacancy crisis      worsens in the waning months of the 112th Congress. With five      new vacancies arising this month and an additional five      announced for next month, this is not just a possibility; it      is a certainty, absent your continued commitment to the      federal judiciary and steady action on nominees.       Thank you for your past efforts and for your consideration      of our views on this important issue.           Sincerely,                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,                                                        President.
