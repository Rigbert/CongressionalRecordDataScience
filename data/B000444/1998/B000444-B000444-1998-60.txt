 President, I particularly want to thank my friend from Arkansas for adding the prohibition, the ability to deny visas to those countries that engage in the heinous practice of engaging in female genital mutilation. I am not one who thinks we should be erecting sanctions all over the world, but there are certain things that are so, so contrary to our basic values--forced abortion, forced sterilization, mutilation of body parts--that I think that it is appropriate that we use sanctions in those circumstances.  I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor.
