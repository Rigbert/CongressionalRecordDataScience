In the other body, as you know, they have more than sufficient votes to override the veto. There are senior leaders in the Senate, very senior leaders in the Senate in the gentleman's party who believe that the President has based his veto on incorrect information and incorrect premises. Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley, both of whom are conservative Republicans, leaders in your party, who believe this bill does, in fact, accomplish what the President said that he wanted to do, at your convention in 2004, that he wanted to add millions of children.  We are hopeful that we can convince some of your ranks not to vote as Republicans or Democrats but to vote in a way that does reflect, I think, what all of our priorities are on the health care of our children. So we understand what your representation is and your confidence level is, but in this case, we hope you are in error.
