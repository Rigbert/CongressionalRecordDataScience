 Senator Reid in the other body has made it pretty clear that he does not believe, again, given the failure to pursue regular order in the Senate, that he will be able to get any bills passed, the Senate appropriations bills.  So one of the factors under consideration by Mr. Obey is that if the Senate is not going to consider any bills, that because they cannot get the bills through the House and to the President--of course, the President sent down a number, said, If you go over that number, I'm going to veto all of the bills anyway. And we had real difficulty last year, as you know, with that happening. That's not happened in my career before. I don't mean that a President hasn't indicated he would veto, but there was always room to work on that.  But that is one of the complicating factors or two of the complicating factors: the President's position and the Senate's position as well.  But I think the major problem is that the regular order Mr. Obey did not feel was being pursued in the committee.
