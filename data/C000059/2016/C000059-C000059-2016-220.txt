Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment to the Corona, California community is truly exceptional. Next week, on January 21, 2016, Sally Carlson will be honored as a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Sally has dedicated herself to the Corona community.  At her core, Sally prioritizes community service and her work. Sally is a mainstay at the Settlement House and has continually shown leadership and compassion to the many families who frequent the Settlement House. Many with whom Sally has worked have described her as a faithful servant that has been determined over the years to ensure children and families are clothed, fed and cared for. Additionally, through her work with Settlement House she has become involved with other similar local organizations to assist local families.  Sally's tireless passion for the families she serves and community outreach has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Sally a friend, fellow community member and great American. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Sally for achieving the Lifetime Achievement Award.                          ____________________
