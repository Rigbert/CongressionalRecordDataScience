 President, tomorrow, following morning business,the Senate will resume consideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental. We had a good start today and will continue to make progress tomorrow. Currently there are three amendments pending to the bill. We will try to have, as Senator Durbin and I were discussing, the first vote at 10:50, or before if all debate is used on the Durbin amendment. As I indicated, if we are unable to vote by that point we will have to delay the vote until sometime shortly after noon. For the remainder of the day we will continue working through amendments to the bill. The chairman and ranking member will be here to receive any amendments. I certainly encourage our colleagues who wish to offer amendments to contact them as soon as possible.  Obviously rollcall votes are expected throughout the day tomorrow as the Senate continues consideration of this important appropriations bill.  Again, we are going to have a busy week as we work toward completion of the Iraq-Afghanistan appropriations measure.                          ____________________[Pages S3502-S3503]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
