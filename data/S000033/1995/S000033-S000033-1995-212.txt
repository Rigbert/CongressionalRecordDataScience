 And I think at the end of that night they walked away with $11 million.  Now why would the largest corporations in America and the wealthiest people in this country contribute to the party? And they doing it because they believe in the Democratic spirit and they just wanted to get involved? Maybe, but I do not think so. I think that there are very smart people who made an investment. They invested in the Republican Party, and the last several months we have seen why they invested. It is a very good investment to buy a ticket for a thousand bucks at a dinner and find out your corporation does not have to pay anything in taxes, or if you are making $200,000 a year your are going to pay $11,000 less in taxes.  But, interestingly enough, the average working persons did not go to that dinner, and you know what the average working person got? Among many other devastating cuts, the Republican proposal cuts back, eliminates, not cuts back, eliminates unemployment insurance-extended benefits. Many areas all over this country where unemployment is very, very high, we have recessions, things get bad, what the Republicans proposal does is make it impossible for a worker to get unemployement after 13 weeks.  What do you do then? Well, how come they go cut   and the rich got tax breaks? Maybe it has something to do that tens of millions of dollars that are now flooding into the Republican Party from some of the wealthiest people in America.
