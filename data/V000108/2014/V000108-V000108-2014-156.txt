Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Colonel John A. Leggieri for his exemplary dedication to duty and his service to the United States Army and to the United States of America. Colonel Leggieri will retire from the Army in December after serving almost half of his 30-year career in Congressional Liaison.  A native of Claverack, New York, Colonel John Leggieri was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant through Sienna College's ROTC program. Initially branched into Air Defense Artillery, John led Soldiers in demanding situations--first with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea and then with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He then transitioned to the Quartermaster Corps, where he led Soldiers for the next decade as a logistician in New York, Nebraska, Virginia, and Arkansas.  In 1999, John began the next phase of his career in Congressional Liaison. He initially served as an Army Congressional Fellow for a year, working in a Member's office on Capitol Hill. For the next 14 years he served in positions of increasing responsibility in the critical, fast-paced arena of Congressional Liaison. He worked as Legislative Liaison Officer for the Chief of the Army Reserve and then as Congressional Budget Liaison Officer for the Office of Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller), working closely with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. There are few who know more about the Congressional budget process and none respected more. After his initial work with Congress, John was selected as a National Security Fellow and studied for a year at Harvard University's prestigious John F. Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The Colonel's next role with Congress was as Chief of Congressional Plans and Strategy for the Army's Chief of Legislative Liaison, where he directed the development of long-range Army wide legislative goals and objectives to help clearly communicate the Army's multi-billion dollar annual budget requests. Finally, Colonel Leggieri served as the Chief of Congressional Budget Liaison, where for the last three years he ensured the Army's budget positions were extremely well represented and articulated to the Congressional Appropriations Committees. John's tenure as the Chief of Congressional Budget Liaison coincided with a particularly challenging fiscal period for the Department of the Defense. Under his leadership, the Army's Congressional Budget Liaison Office navigated dramatically declining defense budgets as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan drew down and sequestration was implemented. In spite of these challenges, John was instrumental in ensuring that Congress was informed of the importance of key programs for the future of the Army.  In his many years in the liaison role, John helped showcase the Army's great accomplishments by leading countless high profile Congressional delegations to locations around the world, including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq, Kosovo, and innumerable other places where dedicated Americans serve our nation. These fact finding missions have been instrumental in improving the United States' foreign and defense policy.  Colonel Leggieri's leadership throughout his career positively impacted his Soldiers, peers, and superiors. His integrity, his exceptional work, and his sense of service are leaving our world improved and they have always served as an example for those he has commanded. To quote Charles Dickens, Colonel Leggieri is, ``as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew.''  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in commending Colonel John Leggieri for over three decades of service to his country. We wish John, his wife Rebecca, herself a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel and now Professional Staff Member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and their two children, Olivia and Gabriel, all the best.                          ____________________
