 President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I also want fire grants. I want everybody to understand that the committee amendment already has $810 million in it for fire grants. That is an increase of $35 million. We just adopted another amendment to add $10 million to this.  The offset that is in this bill will eliminate all the technology development and design to address capabilities. It decimates the counter-improvised explosive device--IED--technology. It specifically eliminates mass transit-specific counter-IED technologies. It decimates cyber-security research and development. The Senate computers are being attacked today. It eliminates the research to make sure we can stop that. It eliminates development and assessment of high throughput cargo screening technology. The list goes on.  I believe we should be doing all we can for our firefighters. Even the International Association of Firefighters does not support this amendment--although I appreciate the Senator offering this amendment, and I agree with what he would like to do. But the offset decimates much of the technology we need to protect our citizens.  I urge a ``no'' vote.
