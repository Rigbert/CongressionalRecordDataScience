This historic achievement is an enormous source of pride for the university that they represent as well as for the people of my entire State.  This championship achieved by the Sooners, under the outstanding leadership of NCAA Coach of the Year Mark Williams, is OU's sixth overall national title and their third in the past 4 years. It was undoubtedly an accomplishment that they earned and grittily sweated out.  The Sooners' dramatic victory over second-place Ohio State came down to the wire with the competition narrowly being determined by the final rotation on the vault. Freshman Jonathan Horton delivered a heroic performance, which secured OU's winning score of 225.675 over the Buckeyes' 225.450.  The tremendous success of the 2005 Sooners gives support to the Sports Illustrated cover's designation of Oklahoma as ``America's Gymnastics Hotbed'' that notably included the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame, the Bart Conner Gymnastics Academy, Nadia Comaneci, Shannon Miller, and the world's largest gymnastics magazine, International Gymnast.  In addition to the national championship, the Sooners boasted six team members who attained a total of 13 All-America honors for OU at the individual event finals. The 13 honors of 2005 added to an already substantial collection of 141 honors garnered by the university over the 39 years of the men's gymnastics program's existence. Moreover, senior David Henderson's 2005 NCAA title on the still rings, gave OU its 18th all-time individual national champion, capping off a brilliant 4 years for this extraordinary young man.  The Sooners' victory is a product of the heart, determination, and teamwork of these exceptional student athletes, and I extend my heart-felt congratulations to the entire team for a job truly well done and well deserved.
