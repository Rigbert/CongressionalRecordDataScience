Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Corporal James Victor Arnaud and Deputy Elizabeth Licera Magruder. These two officers lost their lives in the line of duty on August 29, 2002.  Corporal Arnaud was in the Army for twenty years before retiring and joining the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office. He resided in North Beach, in Calvert County, Maryland and he served as an officer for 13 years before his tragic death. Corporal Arnaud was an excellent officer and he was posthumously awarded the rank of sergeant for his service. He is survived by his wife, Theresa, two children, Jamey and Michael, and two grandchildren, Joseph and Jacob.  Deputy Magruder graduated from the Southern Maryland Criminal Justice Academy on May 3, 2002. She recently bought a house in Clinton, Maryland and is survived by her husband, Derwinn, and her son, Devin. Deputy Magruder loved her job and strived to help other people.  Both of these officers were shot to death while working overtime to serve an emergency psychiatric court order. Serving court orders is considered a routine duty for officers to perform. However, this tragedy reminds us of the terribly high risks that a law enforcement officer faces while doing even routine tasks.  Local law enforcement officers like Deputy Magruder and Corporal Arnaud have such a strong sense of duty to their community that they willingly put themselves at risk every day that they are on the job to protect our lives and make our communities safer. This dedication to duty makes law enforcement officers an integral part of a community's strength.  This is a true meaning of the word ``hero.'' A person who is determined to help others, even if it means sacrificing their lives.  Local law enforcement officers have the courage to guard us, the compassion to help us, and the strength of spirit to do their job, even though they are rarely praised. Corporal Arnaud and Deputy Magruder are a part of this tradition, and they gave their lives in the course of a routine day. We shall not forget them; their bravery and sense of duty are certainly worthy of praise.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the sacrifices of Corporal James Arnaud and Deputy Elizabeth Magruder.                          ____________________
