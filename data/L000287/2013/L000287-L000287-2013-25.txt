Speaker, I rise to recognize the hard work and contributions of Miguel Martinez, a valued member of my staff.  For the past four years, Miguel has served as my tax and benefits counsel; he is my key staff person for Ways and Means Committee tax, retirement, and pension policy. In addition to handling financial services and small business issues, Miguel is a passionate advocate and advisor on LGBT issues and immigration reform. It is rare to find a person who not only understands these complicated issues, but can also simplify their importance for the average person. He is an intellectual with a soul.  We were lucky to find Miguel, who treats every one of my constituents with dignity, respect, and welcomes them with true southern hospitality. An Atlanta native with Caribbean roots in Puerto Rico, Miguel graduated from Emory University and American University's Washington College of Law. Before joining my office, he practiced tax, employee benefit, and commercial transaction at Paley Rothman Law Firm.  Together, we have worked on countless successes--like a tax relief bill for workers affected by airline bankruptcies, improvements and extensions of the homebuyer tax credit, fighting for small businesses and low-income individuals in the tax code. Simply said, Mr. Speaker, Miguel is one of the best congressional staffers with whom I have ever had the privilege and honor of working.  Although Miguel is leaving my office to become the Director of Government Relations and Tax Counsel for the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), he will always remain a part of the John Lewis family. I wish him continued success and happiness in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
