Chairman, I want to know where we are now. I would not have agreed to the unanimous-consent request if I did not think we were going to terminate proceedings of the bill at this time. That was the understanding that I had, and that was the understanding under which I gave unanimous consent.  If that is not the case, I cannot withdraw my unanimous-consent agreement, but that was my understanding, and the bill would proceed much more slowly tonight if my understanding was incorrect.
