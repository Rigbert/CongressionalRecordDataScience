Speaker, I introduce today a constitutional amendment that would, for the first time, allow Congress and the States to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures.  This amendment is necessary because campaign spending in our country is out of control. An estimated $540 million was spent on all elections in the United States in 1976--but by 1992, the amount spent had grown to $3 billion. And in the last House and Senate elections, a total of $724 million was spent--up more than 60 percent just since 1990. Candidates and elected officials have become professional beggars.  Our Nation's elected representatives spend too little time doing the people's business, and too much time raising campaign funds. Yet the Supreme Court has ruled, in the case of Buckley versus Valeo, that campaign spending limits are an unconstitutional infringement on political expression. My amendment would change that by making it clear--as similar legislation introduced in the Senate by Senator Hollings would do--that Congress and the States are free to enact reasonable limits on election expenditures.  I had hoped that a constitutional amendment would not be necessary. But campaign finance reform was conspicuously missing from the Republican Contract With America. And despite the Speaker's telegenic handshake with President Clinton in New Hampshire, where he vowed to develop a bipartisan commission to recommend changes to our system of financing campaigns, the Speaker has now backed off this issue.  But this issue is too important to ignore. If passed, my amendment will go a long way toward rebuilding the public trust in our domestic system of government. To ensure that our Government is truly ``of the people, for the people, and by the people,'' we must end the current practice of allowing elections to be bought by the highest bidder.                          ____________________
