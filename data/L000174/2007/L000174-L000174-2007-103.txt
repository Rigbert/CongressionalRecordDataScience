I was a sponsor of the original authorization of this act in 2004, and I am proud that these programs have helped our State and local governments reduce crime by providing more effective treatment for the mentally ill.  All too often, people with mental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor offenses. Offenders find themselves in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for them. This bill gives State and local governments the tools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the public's safety, and mentally ill offenders. More than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, about 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and almost half the inmates in prison with a mental illness were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. This is a serious problem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement officials and others in Vermont.  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, which can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; create or expand programs to provide specialized training for criminal justice and mental health system personnel; create or expand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; and promote and provide mental health treatment for those incarcerated in or released from a penal or correctional institution.  The grants created under this program have been in high demand, but only about 11 percent of the applications submitted have been able to receive funding due to inadequate Federal funds. This bill would increase funding of these programs and authorize $75 million to help communities address the needs of the mentally ill in our justice system. The bill also provides $10 million for law enforcement training grant programs to help law enforcement recognize and respond to incidents involving mentally ill persons.  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and mental health professionals to help respond to the needs of our communities. They know that the states have been dealing with the unique problems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and that a federal support is invaluable. I look forward to working with them, and with Senators Domenici, Kennedy, Specter, and other Members, to see this bill enacted this Congress.                                 ______                                       By
