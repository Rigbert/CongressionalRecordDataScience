Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3936) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the principal office of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to be at any location in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, rather than only in the District of Columbia, and expressing the sense of Congress that a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center should be provided for that Court and those it serves and should be located, if feasible, at a site owned by the United States that is part of or proximate to the Pentagon Reservation, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3936       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS                    FOR VETERANS CLAIMS.       Section 7255 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by      striking ``District of Columbia'' and inserting ``Washington,      D.C., metropolitan area''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NEW VETERANS                    COURTHOUSE AND JUSTICE CENTER.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Every Article I court of the United States other than      the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is      located in a dedicated courthouse.       (2) The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims      has since its creation in 1988 been located in a commercial      office building in the District of Columbia.       (3) That court should be housed in a dedicated courthouse,      as are all other Article I courts.       (4) A dedicated courthouse for that court constituting a      Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center would express the      gratitude and respect of the Nation for the sacrifices of      those serving and those who have served in the Armed Forces,      and their families.       (5) Location of such a courthouse and judicial center in an      area proximate to the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery,      and the Air Force Memorial (as planned) in Arlington,      Virginia would be symbolically significant of the high esteem      that the Nation holds for its veterans.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center      should be provided for the United States Court of Appeals for      Veterans Claims; and       (2) the Secretary of Defense, in cooperation with the      United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the      Secretary of Veterans     Affairs, and the Administrator of General Services, should      determine the feasibility of locating such a Veterans      Courthouse and Justice Center at an appropriate site owned by      the United States that is part of or proximate to the      Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia.       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Administrator of      General Services shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'      Affairs and the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate      and House of Representatives a joint report on the      feasibility of locating a new Veterans Courthouse and Justice      Center at an appropriate site owned by the United States that      is part of or proximate to the Pentagon Reservation in      Arlington, Virginia.
