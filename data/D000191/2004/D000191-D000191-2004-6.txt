Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would like to reflect on the compromise language he talked about, and, again, since we have not gone through a regular legislative process here, since our committee had no opportunity to review this and it is not amendable on the floor and they would not accept that in good faith, let me point to an unintended effect here.  The way the bill is written, they are granting a blanket exemption to the industry, including paying passengers, until such a point as there is a serious injury or death, and then the full scope of the FAA's current regulations would come to bear.  What the gentleman is proposing here would essentially sanction the experimentation with lighter touch regulation at the outset, and I think that that might actually get us further down this road than what is being proposed here. But the unwillingness of the other side to even consider the implications of extending this to passengers and then whether or not that ever gets sunset or it takes some Member of Congress half a century from now to get that stripped from law, because you know it is 8 years in this bill, but then I can see it being extended and extended and extended and becoming a mature industry, just as the aviation industry did, with that provision still in place, until there is a horrible tragedy.  So I think having this light touch regulation for public interest and safety at the outset, given the expertise of the FAA, would be preferable to all concerned, and it would not stifle or strangle the industry in its nature.
