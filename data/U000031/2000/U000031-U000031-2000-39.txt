Chairman, let me tell Members what this bill does, and I read: ``It shall be the policy of the United States to consider the extent to which major net oil exporting countries engage in oil price-fixing to be an important determinant in the overall political, economic and security relationship between the United States and these countries.''  This bill requires a report. It requires a study. And in fact if it does what I think it will do, it will label these OPEC nations as price-fixing.
