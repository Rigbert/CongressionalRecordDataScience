Elaine Armstrong Vall-Spinosa Cochran Dunkle for her inspiring leadership and devoted service to both her community and country. For the past 54 years she has applied her considerable skill to promoting civil discourse and civic engagement across both state and party lines. She has served, and continues to serve, as a bastion of inspiration for those who adhere to the principle that democracy is not an idle state, but a work in progress that expects our involvement should it seek to endure.  On May 14, 1915, Elaine was born into a society that did not permit women to vote. Five years later, Congress ratified the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote under the U.S. Constitution. Elaine can recall her father giving her mother instructions on how the voting process worked. It was a memory she carried with her when, at age 21, Elaine cast her first ballot for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1936 Presidential election.  After college, Elaine became a history teacher, and it was at the helm of a classroom that she first experienced a deep connection with politics. She felt a tremendous sense of responsibility to the children she taught, and to honor that, took the time to educate herself and them on the great issues of their day, such as Roosevelt's ``New Deal'' and the Marshal Plan. She left teaching, however, to raise her own family and it was shortly thereafter that Elaine was invited to a life-changing meeting of Virginia's League of Women Voters.  Rising the ranks within Virginia's delegation, Elaine soon found herself guiding the League in an attempt to prevent Congress from dismantling price controls in the midst of the Great Depression. Believing that price controls were crucial to keeping household staples affordable for the average Depression-stricken family, she led a motorcade with League representatives from all 48 states to the Capitol. Together, they succeeded in convincing Congress to delay the dismantling of those controls.  Years later, Elaine was still active within the League of Women Voters. Now residing in Maryland, she played a vital role in a countless number of the League's Calvert County endeavors. As President of the Calvert County unit, she oversaw a number of initiatives aimed to increase public awareness of political issues. These included the hugely popular ``Know Who's in Charge'' pamphlet and the Calvert County Voter's Guide. One of her reigning achievements was her League's invaluable role in building the Chesapeake Bay Coalition--a union of five states joined in the fight to preserve and protect America's largest estuary. With the use of independently-funded studies, Elaine and her League members poured endless hours into persuading policymakers that it was the right action to take for our country. They succeeded.  Madam Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once wrote that ``we in America do not have government by the majority--we have government by the majority of those who participate.'' Elaine Cochran Dunkle has spent her life participating and as a consequence has left a lasting mark on our country. I extend my sincerest thanks for her tireless commitment to our nation and for all the many accomplishments that commitment has engendered.                          ____________________
