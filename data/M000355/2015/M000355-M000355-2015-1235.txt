 President, as my good friend, the minority leader, frequently reminded me over the last few years, the majority leader always gets the last word.  Look, his fundamental complaint is he does not get to schedule the Senate anymore. He wanted to kill the President's trade bill, and so he did not like the fact that we moved to the trade bill early enough before the opposition to it might become more severe.  I say to the Senator, the minority leader, he does not get to set the schedule anymore. My observations about the President's foreign policy are directly related to the vote we are about to cast. It remains my view--I know there are differences of opinion, and I respect everybody in here who has a different opinion--that this bill is part of a pattern to pull back, going back to the time the President took office. I remember the speech in Cairo back in 2009 to the Muslim world, which sought to question American exceptionalism. We are all pretty much alike. If we just talked to each other more, everything would be OK. In almost every measurable way, all the places I listed, plus Ukraine--you name them--we have been pulling back. My view with regard to my position and my vote is that this is a step in the wrong direction. But I respect the views of others, and I suspect the minority leader will be happy at the end of the day. It appears to me the votes are probably there to pass this bill, and it will go to the President. I still think it is a step backward from where we are. It has been a great debate. I respect all of those who engaged in it on both sides. I think it is time to vote.  I yield the floor.  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.
