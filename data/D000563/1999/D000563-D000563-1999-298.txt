0 caliber ammunition that has been on the shelf too long and could misfire or is otherwise unserviceable to a private company. That company refurbishes some of that ammunition and sells it to civilian buyers.  Our colleagues in the House, Representatives Rod Blagojevich and Henry Waxman, asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the availability of armor-piercing .50 caliber ammunition in the United States. GAO investigators found that ``U.S.-made armor piercing fifty caliber ammunition is readily available in the United States and that this widespread availability is directly attributable to the little-known Conventional Demilitarization Program within the Department of Defense.''  I want to be sure that my colleagues know what .50 caliber rifles and ammunition can do. They can rip through bullet-proof glass, armor-plated limousines, tanks, helicopters, or aircraft from more than a mile away with deadly accuracy. They can hit targets from four miles away. Their shells can pierce five or six walls with no problem. That is just what the armor-piercing variety can do. The armor-piercing incendiary .50 caliber ammunition can do everything I just mentioned, but then can also start a fire or explode on impact. So if the sniper missed the person inside the limousine or tank or airplane with an armor piercing shell, he could instead shoot an incendiary shell and cause the target to catch fire or blow up.  Nobody goes deer hunting with a .50 caliber rifle. No one shoots a bear with .50 caliber rifle. There would be little left of the hapless animal, although I suppose fragments of it could come already barbecued if a .50 caliber incendiary shell were used.  What is this weapon good for? It is an appropriate and necessary weapon for the United States Armed Forces and has some important law enforcement uses. Its usefulness was demonstrated time and again in the Gulf War to shoot Iraqi tanks, armored vehicles, and bunkers. It is terrific for blowing up land mines and other small unexploded ordnance. The tracer variety is important for military targeting at night.  Otherwise, it is extremely useful for assassins, terrorists, drug cartels, and doomsday cults. Since 1992, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has initiated 28 gun traces involving .50 caliber semiautomatic rifles. Many of these traces led to terrorists, outlaw motorcycle gangs, international and domestic drug traffickers, and violent criminals.  The General Accounting Office conducted an undercover investigation that revealed that ammunition dealers use an ``ask no questions'' approach to the purchase of .50 caliber ammunition. Even after undercover GAO investigators made clear to ammunition dealers that they wanted to be sure the ammunition could pierce an armor-plated limousine or could shoot down a helicopter, the dealers were perfectly willing to sell it.  In fact, there are fewer restrictions on the sale of .50 caliber weapons than on handguns. Yet a leading manufacturer of new .50 caliber ammunition, Arizona Ammunition, Inc., says it does not sell .50 caliber armor piercing, incendiary, and tracer ammunition to the general public ``because they have no sporting application.'' That leavesthe U.S. Department of Defense demilitarization contract as the source of U.S.-made .50 caliber ammunition for the civilian market.  Today I have introduced a bill that would require DoD contractors for the disposal of .50 caliber surplus military ammunition to agree not to sell the refurbished ammunition to civilians. The Defense Department must include in its contract a provision that refurbished .50 caliber may not be sold to non-military or law enforcement organizations or personnel. The Defense Department should no longer be the indirect source of ammunition that could be used for assassination, terrorism, or drug trafficking.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1532       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
