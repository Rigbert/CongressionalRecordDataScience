Speaker, the Trump travesty continues, as it has for the last 12 months. We have heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program. They are very concerned about its passage. Bring it to the floor. It will pass. And I guarantee you it will pass in the Senate.  Your Speaker, our Speaker, said: ``We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.''  Mr. Speaker, that is not what the bill you put on this floor did. It is not what the bill that is on the Senate floor did.  You are right. There is no controversy. Government should not be shutting down. It is the Trump confrontation and chaos that continues. That is why this government is shut down, and the American people are rightfully upset with every one of us; not just Republicans, not just Democrats. They are upset that their government is not working.  Mr. Speaker, bring these issues one at a time to this floor, and some will pass and some will not.  My time has expired, but the people's time is expiring. Let us do our work one issue at a time.                          ____________________
