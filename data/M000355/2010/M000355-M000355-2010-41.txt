 President, I rise today in solemn remembrance of a dear friend of mine from Ashland, KY, who passed away peacefully at his home this Veterans Day. Mr. Charles Wheeler was a consummate small businessman, local official, and advocate for higher education. I knew Charles for over 30 years, and I can tell you that the love he felt for his community in the Commonwealth was surpassed only by his affection for his beloved wife of 60 years, Mary Kathryn Wheeler.  Born in Paintsville, KY, Charles owned and operated a local hardware store in Boyd County for nearly 40 years--helping to build his community and assist all who met him, literally and figuratively. It is no wonder then, that Charles's friendly manner and smart tact got him elected as an Ashland city commissioner by the age of 28. Before long, his friends and neighbors elected him to represent them in the Kentucky General Assembly, where he served for 8 years.  My friend continued to serve his community by serving on the Morehead State University Board of Regents for a decade during a period when that institution saw great growth. His pursuit of excellence in higher education undoubtedly changed the lives of countless students.  I could surely continue to draw to mind the instances when Charles helped meet the need of his community, and this Senator, but I would simply ask that my colleagues join me in remembering the life of a humble man who showed incredible character throughout his entire life. And I would further ask that they join me in expressing my sincerest condolences to Charles's beloved wife, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, siblings and other family members.  The Ashland Daily Independent recently published an editorial that highlights some of Charles Wheeler's accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Ashland Daily Independent, Nov. 17, 2010]Charles Wheeler: He Was a Leader in Business, Politics and Education in                                   Area       Ashland.--Charles Dona Wheeler spent most of his adult life      as a business, political and education leader in this region.      He died quietly at his residence on Veterans Day. He was 81.       As a business leader, he owned and operated Wheeler-     Williams Hardware in Boyd County from 1962 until he closed      the business in 2000. He also was a developer of Southern      Hills Estates, a beautiful, upscale subdivision off Boy Scout      Road.       Wheeler's political career began early in life when he was      elected to the Ashland Board of City Commissioners at the age      of 28. He went on to serve for eight years--or four terms--as      the representative from the 100th District in Kentucky. After      leaving office, he remained a leader of the Republican Party      in Boyd County and in Kentucky for many years.       Although he never earned a college degree, Wheeler helped      open the doors to a college education for thousands of young      people in this region by serving on the Morehead State      University Board of Regents. His decade of service on the MSU      governing body during a time of great growth for the      university continues to benefit this region by the many      students the university has helped train who continue to play      important roles in this area's business, educational,      cultural and social life.       To his wife of 60 years, Mary Kathryn Wheeler, and his      large extended family, Charles Wheeler was a loving husband,      father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother and uncle. To      others in this community, Charles Wheeler was a leader who      made a difference through his many years of quietly working      for the betterment of this community and this region.                          ____________________
