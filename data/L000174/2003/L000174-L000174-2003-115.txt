The lack of enforcement of intellectual property laws is a serious problem. It undermines the rule of law in other nations, and it hurts U.S. economic and cultural interests. Perhaps most importantly, it reduces incentives for Americans to be creative. And, we know that American ingenuity is a major reason that the United States is the Nation it is today.  This amendment will help address some of these problems. It will also help developing nations comply with the WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, and other intellectual property agreements, which is very important.  Some of these nations have problems meeting the most basic needs of their people, and it is safe to say that this assistance could be the difference between the enforcement of these laws or piracy continuing unabated.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Vermont. I agree with what has been said on this by the Senators from Virginia and Vermont. I think this is a good idea, and would like toask, for clarification purposes, a question of the Senator form Virginia. How would this money be spent and what type of assistance would be provided by these funds?
