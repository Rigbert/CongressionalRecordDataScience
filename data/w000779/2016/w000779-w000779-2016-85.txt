President, I regret that due to travel delays on my return from Oregon, I missed the vote yesterday on the confirmation of the nominee, Paula Xinis, to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  Ms. Xinis was nominated more than a year ago. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Xinis ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the district court, its highest rating. She has the support of her home State Senators, Senators Mikulski and Cardin. She was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote on September 17, 2015. In addition, 20 judicial nominees for lower court vacancies that were all voted out of committee by unanimous voice vote are currently on the Executive Calendar. It is important that the Senate work to prioritize filling these vacancies.  For those reasons, had I not experienced travel delays and been present as originally intended, I would have voted in support of her nomination.                          ____________________
