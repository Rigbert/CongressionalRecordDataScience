Johnson. Dylan died 3 years ago today, June 26, 2011, of injuries suffered from an improvised explosive device in Diyala Province, Iraq, in support of Operation New Dawn.  Dylan was born November 07, 1990, in Tulsa, OK. His father Jeff Johnson said Dylan ``had aspired to military service for years and dressed as a soldier for Halloween six years running.'' After Dylan graduated from Jenks High School, he joined the military in August 2009, largely inspired by the men on both sides of his family who served with the military during World War II and Korea.  After completing basic training at Fort Knox, KY, Dylan was assigned to the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, TX.  Specialist Johnson departed on Memorial Day 2011 for his first overseas deployment and arrived in Iraq June 2. On June 26, 2011, Dylan tragically died of injuries he sustained when insurgents attacked his armored vehicle with an improvised explosive device. One other soldier in the vehicle was killed alongside of Dylan.  ``Dylan possessed a kind spirit and was a bit reserved in my world literature class,'' said teacher, Ron Acebo. ``We all ache for the loss of this young life and grieve with his family. As teachers, we all hold hopes and dreams for our students. We do not know what he could have achieved but we are humbled that he had made the supreme sacrifice for his country. . . . and that is how he will be remembered.''  A memorial service was held July 6, 2011, at Kirk of the Hills Church in Tulsa, OK and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on August 9, 2011.  At a ceremony on his birthday in 2013, the State of Oklahoma dedicated to his memory the bridge on U.S. 75 across Polecat Creek, just south of Main Street in Jenks, OK. A sign reading ``Specialist Dylan Johnson Memorial Bridge'' was emplaced on the structure, and his father asked those gathered to remember Oklahoma's other fallen soldiers when they cross it.  Dylans's military honors include the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Iraqi Campaign Medal with Combat Service Star.  In addition to his father, Dylan is survived by his mother Joy Sehl; his stepmother Lynda Johnson; two sisters, Alexandra Johnson and Kathryn Sehl; and two stepsisters, Brittany Dinan and Brooke Dinan. All are of Tulsa, OK.  Today we remember Army SPC Dylan J. Johnson, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Specialist Jordan M. Morris  Madam President, I now wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army SPC Jordan M. Morris. Along with 4 other soldiers, Jordan died August 11, 2011 of injuries he sustained from an improvised explosive device in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Jordan was born in Elk City, OK on February 12, 1988, and later moved to Ripley, OK. While attending Ripley High School, he was a member of the baseball team, National Honor Society, 4-H, and served as Student Council president. He was concurrently enrolled and graduated from the Oklahoma School of Science and Math. As an active member of the Hillcrest Baptist Church, he was very involved with the youth group and enjoyed spending time serving others on various mission trips.  After graduating as class valedictorian from Ripley High School in 2006, he fulfilled a dream he had from the age of 8 as he was accepted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Jordan spent 4 years at West Point, majoring in mechanical engineering. Friend Caleb Eytcheson said Jordan ``wanted to be the best, and he knew West Point is where they trained the best. He wanted to serve his country,'' he said.  Jordan joined the Army in January 2011, serving as an infantryman. After completing training at Fort Benning, GA he was assigned to 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, NY. On May 5, 2011, Jordan deployed to Afghanistan.  Doug Scott, assistant principal of Ripley High School said Morris was intelligent, had a great sense of humor and was very popular in school. ``He showed his unselfish side by going overseas,'' Scott said.  Jordan's baseball coach, Donnie Hoffman said: ``The world is not as good a place, when you lose people with the character that he was. The legacy he leaves behind was the way he led his life, the character, the discipline, the dedication, the honor.''  Jordan was buried August 20, 2011 at Palmer Marler Funeral Home in Stillwater, OK.  Jordan is survived by his parents Brett and Nita (Faber) Morris of Stillwater; two brothers Levi James and Jesse Isaac Morris of Stillwater; grandparents Wilma Faber, of Tulsa, James and Patricia Morris, of Broken Arrow; numerous aunts, uncles, cousins and friends, as well as his former West Point classmates and fellow soldiers in the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division.  Today we remember Army SPC Jordan M. Morris, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                       Specialist Joshua M. Seals  Madam President, I also wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army SPC Joshua M. Seals. Specialist Seals died August 16, 2011 of non-combat injuries at Forward Operating Base Lightening in Paktika Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Oklahoma National Guard.  Joshua was born April 10, 1990, in Glendale, AZ and later moved to Porter, OK. While attending Porter High School he played football, was an honor roll student and a member of the academic team. He was also active in Wagoner County 4-H and showed Dutch rabbits.  He joined the military as a truck driver in 2008 while still in high school. Aunt Trina Seals said ``his mother and father served in the Army, and he felt it was just something he wanted to do.''  ``My thoughts and prayers go out to the Seals family and friends,'' said Maj. Gen. Myles Deering, Oklahoma's adjutant general. ``As we mourn his loss in the days ahead, we will be forever honored and proud that he chose to serve his country and the people of Oklahoma in the National Guard.''  Principal Larry Shackelford described him as a great student and a wonderful young man with a bright outlook.  A memorial and burial service was held August 27, 2011 at Greenwood Cemetery in Porter, OK.  Specialist Seals is survived by his parents Rhonda and Stanley; wife Andrina; and siblings Jeremy, Sarah and James.  Today we remember Army SPC Joshua M. Seals, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                  Specialist James T. Wickliff-Chacin  Madam President, I pay tribute to a true American hero, Army SPC James T. Wickliff-Chacin of Edmond, OK who died on September 20, 2013 serving our nation in Pul-E-Alam, Afghanistan. Specialist Wickliff-Chacin was assigned to 6th Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, Fort Stewart, GA.  James died at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol during combat operations in Pul-E-Alam, Afghanistan on August 12, 2013. He was 22 years old.  Born February 18, 1991 in Venezuela, James moved to Oklahoma with his family in 2006. He graduated from Edmond Santa Fe High School in 2010. After graduation, he enlisted as an infantryman in the Army in June 2010 and arrived at his unit in October 2010.  ``He had a good future,'' his father said. ``He had all the scores to go to whatever college he wanted.'' But James wanted to join the Army. Friends said he was proud of his service even before he graduated from high school.  ``I remember him as a young man who very much wanted to go into the military,'' said his former high school principal Jason Brown. The following year, before graduation, James had asked ahead of time if the school was going to do anything to recognize students who would be serving in the military. ``I told him he would have to wait but he was in for a surprise,'' Brown said. ``During graduation we always asked for those individuals to stand up who wanted to go into the military. I distinctly remember looking for and finding him in the audience and he was smiling ear to ear.''  This was his second deployment; he previously deployed to Iraq from March to June 2011.  In May 2013, James wrote on his Facebook page ``I am proud to carry the legacy of my family. We are warriors at heart that fight against all odds to protect those who need us. There is nothing else that I would rather be doing with my life.''  James was laid to rest at Fort Sill National Cemetery, Elgin, OK on October 3, 2013. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Army Commendation Medal of Valor.  Today we remember Army SPC James T. Wickliff-Chacin, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
