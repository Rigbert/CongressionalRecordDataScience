 President, I rise today to offer this amendment. I recognize that the leadership is not accepting amendments. I accept that. I am a supporter of the treaty, and I am happy to cast my vote for it.  But there is one significant omission from this treaty, and I want to point out that omission. That omission is that we have literally thousands of nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert. The Russian Federation has thousands of nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert. This treaty does not take that into consideration and does not urge or does not certify a reduction of the alert status of these missiles. I believe if we fail to address this issue, we risk the lives of millions of people over what may turn out to be a simple miscalculation.  People hearing me might say, how can that possibly happen? I would like to explain how it can happen.  On the morning of January 25, 1995, the Russian military initially interpreted the launch of a U.S. weather rocket from Norway as a possible nuclear attack on the Russian Federation. That is just 8 years ago. Thankfully, the true nature of the launch became known and a catastrophic mistake was averted. Nevertheless, then-President Yeltsin and his advisers had only minutes to decide whether the launch of a weather rocket was a surprise attack because Russia, like the United States, maintained and continues to maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on high alert status, ready to be launched at a moment's notice.  This was not the only instance in which both countries have come close to the unthinkable. On at least two occasions in the United States and at least one occasion in Russia, false alarms could have led to the accidental launch of nuclear weapons.  Today, Russia and the United States are entering into a new era of relations. We do so with the advent of this treaty. A deliberate nuclear strike by either side is unthinkable. In fact, the administration states the brevity of the Moscow Treaty and the lack of verification, timetables, and a list of specific weapons to be destroyed, is due to the fact that Russia and the United States are no longer strategic competitors but today we are strategic allies. So fear and suspicion have been replaced by trust, cooperation, and friendship.  It is surprising, then, that the United States and Russia continue to maintain their nuclear arsenals on this highalert status. It is surprising the Moscow Treaty, a symbol of the new relationship, in the words of the administration, does not address this issue. In the past, President Bush has recognized the dangers of high alert status and the need to reevaluate our nuclear weapons. As a candidate, he stated in a speech on May 23, 2000:       Keeping so many weapons on high alert may create      unacceptable risks of accidental or unauthorized launch.  Experts on nuclear weapons issues have expressed similar concerns. In his testimony on the Moscow Treaty before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former Senator Sam Nunn stated that the alert status:       . . . may well be more important to stability and security      than the actual number of nuclear weapons.  He likened the issue to two families who have agreed to reduce the number of high-powered automatic weapons aimed at each other in several years' time but in the meantime decide to keep the weapons loaded with a finger on the trigger.  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry testified that the Moscow Treaty's failure to address the alert status of the United States and Russia's nuclear weapons represented a significant missed opportunity. He concurred with retired Air Force GEN Eugene Habiger, former commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, who recommended that the United States take a first step by immediately standing down all nuclear weapons systems that will not be operationally deployed under the Moscow Treaty.  If you will note, the amendment I have sent to the desk does not say this should be unilateral, on our part only; it says a bilateral reduction of alert status of operational nuclear weapons deployed today.  I believe we should take the words of the general, of the very respected Senator Nunn, and former Defense Secretary Bill Perry and take some action. A miscalculation, in Senator Nunn's scenario, would result in the loss of a few lives from these automatic weapons in a family feud situation, but a miscalculation between Russia and the United States could result in the loss of millions of lives. De-alerting will give the leaders of the United States and Russia sufficient time to evaluate fully a situation before making a decision on a nuclear response in a matter of minutes or seconds, and it would greatly reduce the possibility of an accidental nuclear launch due to false alarm and miscalculation.  The amendment I sent to the desk encourages the President, within 180 days of exchange of instruments and ratification, to initiate in a safe and verifiable manner a stand-down from alert status of all nuclear and Russian nuclear weapons systems that will not be operationally deployed under the treaty.  In other words, the treaty calls for removing the operational deployment. But in the meantime all these missiles remain on high alert status--hair trigger alert status.  The amendment would urge the President to call on the Russian Federation to reciprocate in kind, and the amendment asks that a representative of the executive branch of the Government offer regular briefings to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on three specific topics: First, the alert status of the nuclear forces of the United States and Russia; second, any determination of the President to order a standdown of the alert status on the U.S. nuclear forces; third, any progress in establishing cooperative measures with Russia to effect a standdown of Russia's nuclear forces.  There is a precedent for de-alerting our nuclear weapons and prompting the Russians to do likewise. In 1991, as the Soviet Union began to crumble, then-President Bush ordered a unilateral standdown of the U.S. strategic bombers and de-alerted some missiles scheduled for deactivation under the START treaty. Soviet President Gorbachev at that time reciprocated with similar measures, and the world breathed a little easier during those turbulent times. So there is precedent for their de-alerting missiles. And I believe that this Moscow Treaty, which is based on friendship, trust, and cooperation, necessitates an increased de-alerting status of the literally thousands of nuclear weapons that remain in their silos on a hair trigger alert.  The amendment is simple and straightforward. We can take it very easily. I very much regret that we are in a no-amendment scenario. What I hope to do and my cosponsors hope to do is enter into a colloquy in the Record indicating support for this measure and, second, we will draft a letter and try to get as many signatures from other Senators as we can.  I believe this treaty, which should be ratified by this Senate today, has this significant oversight. I believe that to leave these missiles on hair trigger alert status when we enter into this treaty really downgrades the treaty. If we truly trust, if we truly want to be cooperative, and if we truly are friends, friends don't aim loaded guns at each other with the triggers pulled back.  I am hopeful that the administration would respond and begin a discussion between President Putin and President Bush to see if we cannot reach a bilateral de-alerting of the literally--probably more than--10,000 missiles that will remain with nuclear warheads on hair trigger alert.                      Amendment No. 251 Withdrawn  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn.  I yield the floor.
