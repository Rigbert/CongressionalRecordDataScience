President, I would like to commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for his bipartisan efforts which resulted in the passage of section 1425 of H.R. 4868, the Miscellaneous Tariff Act. This section is intended to address an unfortunate situation involving the imposition of antidumping duties on a number of entries of conveyor chain from Japan. At the time of these entries, the applicable antidumping duty cash deposit rate was 0 percent. As a result, no cash deposits were made on these entries by the U.S. importer. Through no fault of the U.S. Customs Service, the antidumping duties and interest subsequently imposed when these entries were liquidated as a result of the Department of Commerce administrative review process now represents a severe and unanticipated hardship on the U.S. importer, Drives, Inc., based in Fulton, Illinois. This legislation is intended to address this situation by having the Customs Service reliquidate the entries at the antidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry.
