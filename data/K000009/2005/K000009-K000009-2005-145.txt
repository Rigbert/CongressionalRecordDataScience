Speaker, this week Matthew Drake, a soldier who had been serving our Nation in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart for grave injuries he sustained on October 15, 2004, in Anwar Province, Iraq. May I please extend to him and to his family warmest congratulations and deepest gratitude on behalf of the people of the United States.  Private First Class Drake, a resident of Toledo, Ohio, and graduate of Sylvania North High School, while driving a 6-ton truck became the only survivor of a bombing. Comatose, he had a fractured skull, severe head injuries, multiple back injuries, many broken bones, and damage to his right arm and shoulder. He underwent many surgeries while hospitalized in Germany at both military as well as German private hospitals and more after traveling to Walter Reed Army Hospital here in Washington where he remained in a coma for many weeks.  Matthew Drake survived by all accounts miraculously and will undergo rehabilitation for a very long time. He has been courageous in his journey. He said this week that on receiving this Purple Heart he wanted to be able to stand from his wheelchair in order to have it pinned on him.  Throughout the months since Matt was wounded, his family has struggled to afford what is necessary to help him to travel to the hospitals on our coasts where people have been trying to help him. For his family to be near him and to help his very long rehabilitation, a fund was established at Sky Bank in Toledo, Ohio, on his behalf.  Last week, I attended a spaghetti dinner which was a fundraiser arranged by Matt's family and friends to raise the money, at least part of it, required for this son of our Nation to continue his progress with the support of his family. And before I left, they gave me this T-shirt to remember Matt. And it says on it, ``The Long Road Home, Matthew Drake, Army Special Forces Injured in Iraq. He was there for us. October 15, 2004.''  Matthew Drake was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1983. He was raised in Sylvania and attended Maplewood Elementary School. He played soccer and was a Boy Scout and a member of Olivet Lutheran Church. While a student at Northview High School, Matthew was a wrestler and excelled in gymnastics. He trained in the martial arts, played guitar, and was an honor roll student.  After graduation, he started college at Bowling Green University and worked for the United Parcel Service, but 1 year later he felt duty-bound to serve our country. He left college and enlisted in the United States Army on October 13, 2002. Following training, he was assigned to Special Forces Bravo Company and sent to Iraq on September 7 just having turned 21. Not 6 weeks later he was promoted to specialist and 2 days after that the attack that changed his life forever occurred.  Now facing the greatest challenge of his young life, to return from a nearmortal head and bodily injuries and trying to regain as much strength as he can, Matthew Drake's dream of becoming a physical therapist have turned to dreams of gaining inches of recovery day by day. He had always planned to work in a profession where he could be of help or service to other people. Yet his commitment to his family, his feeling responsible to protect his younger siblings brought him to a most dangerous place. He felt he had a job to do, and he did it.  How many times have we heard that sentiment echoed by the families of the more than 11,000 service members injured in Iraq? Matthew Drake joins the 6,050 of those who were not able to shortly return to duty and whose future in service to America and their God will take another form.  Matthew faces struggles of rehabilitation most of us cannot imagine. Even swallowing whole food is still not possible. Matthew's story represents one family's heroic struggle multiplied by more than 11,000 families whose loved ones have been injured and the over 1,550 who have had to lay their loved ones to rest.  Our government must assure that we properly care for and fully compensate these young people through their entire recuperation and lifetimes. Why should a family have to have spaghetti dinners in order to have the funds necessary to travel to be with one of these severely injured veterans who have come home?  Matthew is a quiet and shy young man who loves to laugh, especially enjoys children and animals, and who joined the Army to make the world safer. He represents the citizenship ideals of hundreds of thousands of service members whose value we should not forget.  The explosion that so injured Matt on October 15, 2004, killed all his colleagues but him. His injuries were grave. He was never expected to live. Matthew Drake survived by miracle and support of his family. His mother, Lisa, has never left his bedside since he has returned Stateside, and his father Tom has traveled time and again to be with him.  On April 18, 2005, with his mother and father by his side, along with his immediate family and friends, Matthew was awarded the Purple Heart. Matthew had made a promise to his parents that no matter what he would try to stand dressed in his uniform to receive this special honor. He needed help to do that, but he did it.  Four Star General Douglas Brown, who presides over the Special Operations Units for all branches of the military, was given the honor of presenting the Purple Heart Award to Specialist Matthew T. Drake.  Our hearts swell with Matt and his family, not only because he was awarded such a prestigious and significant medal but because he lived to receive it and understands the meaning of words duty, honor, and country.  Congratulations to Matt. We love you.                 [From the Toledo Blade, Oct. 19, 2004]  Sylvania Soldier Survives Suicide Attack; Northview H.S. Grad is in           Coma, with Skull Fracture, Injuries to Arm, Shoulder                     (By Elizabeth A. Shack Blade)       A Sylvania soldier was seriously hurt in a car bombing in      Iraq on Friday that killed four other people, and his family      and friends are anxiously awaiting word on his recovery.       Pfc. Matthew T. Drake, who is in an Army Psychological      Operations unit based at Fort Bragg, N.C., arrived at      Ramstein Air Base in Germany last night on his way to      Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.       On Friday, Private Drake was driving a truck near the town      of Qaim near the Syrian border. Two other psychological      operations soldiers, a Marine, and an Iraqi translator were      killed in the suicide attack.       Private Drake was in a coma when he reached a military      hospital and also has injuries to his head, right arm, and      shoulder, including a fractured skull.       ``It's an unbelievable miracle that he survived,'' his      aunt, Linda Marie Domini, said.       He has had several surgeries for his head injuries and will      have more surgeries when he is in a more stable condition. He      will eventually be transferred to Walter Reed Army Medical      Center.       Private Drake graduated from Sylvania Northview High School      in 2001 and attended Bowling Green State University for a      year. In October, 2002, he left to join the Army.       He wanted to protect his younger siblings, Heather      Schuster, a sophomore at Northview, and Michael Schuster, a      sixth grader at Arbor Hills Junior High.       ``He really felt called to serve,'' his aunt said, ``He      wanted to go fight the terrorists over there rather than have      them come over here.''       A member of the 9th PsyOp Battalion, Bravo Company, Private      Drake left for Iraq on Sept. 7, two days after his 21st      birthday, assigned to a three-man psychological operations      unit. He drove an armored six-ton truck with a speaker.       His aunt said he felt that he had a job to do and he was      going to do it, and he promised his mother, Lisa Schuster,      that he'd come home. His father is Thomas Drake of Toledo.       ``He's coming home a Purple Heart veteran,'' his aunt said,      her voice breaking.       Private Drake, who was a wrestler his junior and senior      years in high school and is a certified personal trainer, was      thinking of becoming a physical therapist, Mrs. Domini said.       Friends and family described Private Drake, who belongs to      Olivet Lutheran Church in Sylvania, as a kind, funny, and      generous man.       Matt Serror, who has known Private Drake since they played      soccer together in elementary school, said he was quiet and      shy in high school but always helped people out, whether he      was shoveling snow for an elderly neighbor or dropping a      dollar in a can by a cash register.       ``It's the little things you might not think about,'' Mr.      Serror said. ``He's one of those people that doesn't come      around every day.''       When his aunt's 150-pound Rottweiler was recovering from      surgery, Private Drake carried him outside when needed to go      outdoors.       In an e-mail to his mother a week before the attack, he      wrote that he had befriended a feral dog that ran around the      encampment where he lived with two other men in a room the      size of a two-car garage.       ``We pray that when he does come out of his coma that he's      still Matthew,'' Mrs. Domini said.       Sky Bank branches are accepting donations to the Matthew T.      Drake fund. His aunt said that if he doesn't survive, the      money will go to families of other wounded soldiers.       But she said their family is one of strong faith, and they      believe he's going to make it.       ``We certainly ask for people who believe in prayer to pray      for his recovery,'' Mrs. Domini said.                          ____________________[Pages H2132-H2133]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         HONORING MATTHEW DRAKE
