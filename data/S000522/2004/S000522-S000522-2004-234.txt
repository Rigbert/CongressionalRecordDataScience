Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 378) calling on the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to immediately and unconditionally release Father Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 378       Whereas in February 2001, Father Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly, a      Roman Catholic priest was formally invited to testify before      the United States Commission on International Religious      Freedom but was denied permission to leave the Socialist      Republic of Vietnam and thus, instead, submitted written      testimony critical of Vietnam which was read into the      Commission record on February 13, 2001;       Whereas Father Ly's testimony before the Commission      documents numerous specific actions of the Government of      Vietnam against religious freedom which he classified as      collectively being ``extremely cruel'' and requiring a ``non-     violent and persistent campaign'' to achieve full religious      freedom for all people in Vietnam;       Whereas Father Ly has been detained by the Government of      Vietnam since February 2001, when it placed Father Ly under      administrative detention--as a direct response to his      testimony, branding him a traitor for ``slandering'' the      Communist party and ``distorting'' the religious policy of      the Government of Vietnam;       Whereas the Government of Vietnam issued a second decree      suspending Father Ly's ability to ``carry on any religious      responsibility and functions'' and later formally removed      Father Ly from his church, detained him, and denied him      access to adequate legal counsel;       Whereas on October 19, 2001, the Thua Thien Hue Provincial      People's Court convicted Father Ly of all charges after a one      day, closed trial, without the benefit of counsel and      sentenced him to two years in prison for violating the terms      of his administrative detention, thirteen years in prison for      ``damaging the Government's unity policy'', and 5 years of      administrative probation upon release from prison;       Whereas after pleas from United States Government officials      and the world community Father Ly's sentence was reduced by 5      years;       Whereas in June 2001, Father Ly's nephews Nguygen Vu Viet,      age 27, and Nguyen Truc Cuong, age 36, and his niece Nguyen      Thi Hoa, age 44, were arrested for allegedly being in contact      and receiving support from organizations in the United States      concerning the religious situation in Vietnam and      disseminating information concerning the detention of Father      Ly;       Whereas after their cases generated much concern in      Congress, Nguyen Thi Hoa, Nguyen Vu Viet and Nguyen Truc      Cuong all have been or are expected to be released shortly;       Whereas on November 27, 2003, the United Nations Working      Group on Arbitrary Detention issued Opinion No. 20/2003      stating ``the Group is convinced that [Father Ly] has been      arrested and detained only for his opinions . . . [and] the      deprivation of the liberty of Father Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly      is arbitrary, as being in contravention of Article 19 of the      Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of Article 19 of      the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights'';       Whereas Father Ly has been deprived of his basic human      rights by being denied his ability to exercise freedom of      opinion and expression; and       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment and the violation of the      human rights of citizens of Vietnam are sources of      continuing, grave concern to Congress;       Whereas continuing concerns regarding human rights in      Vietnam were recently highlighted by large demonstrations in      the Central Highlands on April 10 and 11, 2004, in which      thousands of Montagnards gathered on Easter weekend to      protest their treatment by the Government of Vietnam,      including the confiscation of tribal lands and ongoing      restrictions on religious activities; and       Whereas although the Government of Vietnam has attempted to      control information about the April 2004 protests and access      to the Central Highlands, reputable human rights      organizations have reported that the protests were met with a      violent response and that many demonstrators were arrested,      injured, or are in hiding, and that others were killed: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) Congress--       (A) condemns and deplores the arbitrary detention of Father      Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly by the Government of the Socialist      Republic of Vietnam and calls for his immediate and      unconditional release;       (B) condemns and deplores the violations of freedom of      speech, religion, movement, association, and the lack of due      process afforded to individuals in Vietnam;       (C) strongly urges the Government of Vietnam to consider      the implications of its actions for the broader relationship      between the United States and the Socialist Republic of      Vietnam, including the impact on trade relations;       (D) urges the Government of Vietnam to allow unfettered      access to the Central Highlands by foreign diplomats, the      international press, and nongovernmental organizations; and       (E) condemns the extent of the violence used against      Montagnard protesters on April 10 and 11, 2004, and the use      of any violence against peaceful protests and demonstrations;      and       (2) it is the sense of Congress that the United States--       (A) should make the immediate release of Father Ly a top      concern;       (B) should continue to urge the Government of Vietnam to      comply with internationally recognized standards for basic      freedoms and human rights;       (C) should make it clear to the Government of Vietnam that      the detention of Father Ly and other persons and the      infliction of human rights violations on these individuals      are not in the interest of Vietnam because they create      obstacles to improved bilateral relations and cooperation      with the United States; and       (D) should reiterate the deep concern of the United States      regarding the continued imprisonment of Father Ly, and other      persons whose human rights are being violated, and discuss      their legal status and immediate humanitarian needs with the      Government of Vietnam.
