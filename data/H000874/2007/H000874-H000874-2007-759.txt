Pursuant to the rule that was adopted today, we will be moving the six items that we obviouslycampaigned on, told the American public that we would move on within the first 100 hours.  We believe almost all of those items have been broadly discussed, considered, not only in the election process of approximately 6 months in duration or longer, but also, for instance, the 9/11 Commission report which we will consider in the first order of business next week, vetted by the bipartisan commission, the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Governor Kean and co-chaired by Mr. Hamilton, so that the gentleman's assumption is correct.  But that does not mean, I want to make it very clear, that does not mean that when we get through those items which essentially were the items focused on during the course of the election, that we will not hew to what we believe to be a positive step forward in including both sides in deliberations, in conference reports, in committees and on the floor.
