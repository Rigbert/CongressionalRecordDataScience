 President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky recently lost a remarkable man and a longtime public servant, Earl Fields. At the age of 96, Earl passed away earlier this month. My friend and fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Hal Rogers, called Earl, ``one of our region's greatest treasures.'' I couldn't agree more, and today it is my privilege to honor his memory.  A member of the Greatest Generation, Earl left his position as a school teacher in 1942 to join the U.S. Navy. During his 4 years of service aboard the U.S.S. Nicholson, Earl served in 10 major conflicts and engaged both German and Japanese enemy forces. As a Navy radioman, he was tasked with copying incoming coded messages. Among his many experiences during his service, Earl remembered receiving the fateful news of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in 1945.  After the war, Earl returned home and married Gloria, the love of his life. Together, they raised six children and built a life together in eastern Kentucky. In subsequent years, Earl once again felt called to public service, and he ran to become the Leslie County clerk. He won his race and served his community in the role for 24 years.  When Earl left the clerk's office, he moved to Laurel County to enjoy his retirement. That doesn't mean he slowed down, however. Earl kept a number of hobbies, including hunting, fishing, and beekeeping, throughout the rest of his life.  Elaine and I would like to extend our condolences to Earl's wonderful family and his many devoted friends. His life impacted our country and so many communities in eastern Kentucky, and he will surely be missed. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a great man, Earl Fields.                            ____________________
