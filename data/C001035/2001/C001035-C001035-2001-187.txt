President, in 1993, Congress created the Community Empowerment Program to provide communities with real opportunities for growth and revitalization. The program challenged local jurisdictions to develop strategic plans for the future and rewarded the communities that have developed the best plans with a ten-year designation as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. Once a designation is awarded, communities receive Federal support to assist local efforts to promote economic opportunity and implement strategies designed to help communities obtain their development goals. When it authorized the program, Congress also provided, in one appropriation, the funding necessary to support the communities for the full life of the ten-year designations.  In response to the initial success of the Community Empowerment Program, Congress authorized a second round of the Enterprise Community designations in 1998, creating an additional 20 Enterprise Communities. These designations were awarded to deserving communities shortly thereafter by the Department of Agriculture.  When Congress authorized a second round of Enterprise Communities, it only appropriated funding for the program in Fiscal Year 1999. Consequently, communities have had to rely on funding added in conference to the VA-HUD appropriations bill in each of the subsequent fiscal years.  This last minute approach to funding these communities is not at all conducive to the strategic planning that the Community Empowerment Program is supposed to encourage. We cannot expect local leaders to effectively implement their plans if the Federal support they have been promised is still in question. I believe it is time for Congress to demonstrate its support for the Round II Enterprise Communities by setting aside, as it did in Round I, the funding necessary to sustain this important program.  Today, I am introducing legislation that would ensure that Congress keeps its commitment to the Round II Enterprise Communities by authorizing a one time appropriation to the States through the Social Service Block Grant program to support the remaining years of the designations. My bill, the Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act of 2001, also authorizes the States to make annual grants for each of the seven remaining years of the program of $500,000 for each of the 20 Round II Enterprise Communities. By guaranteeing funding, Congress would demonstrate its support for the work being done by these communities and provide local leaders with the assurance that Federal dollars will be available as they make their plans for the future.  The Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act will also allow for more local control over how the annual funding is used. My bill allows communities to use funds to capitalize local revolving loan accounts should community leaders deem such accounts as an important part of their economic development efforts.  I have long been a strong supporter of Empower Lewiston--the local effort that secured and is implementing the Enterprise Community designation for the city of Lewiston, Maine. Thousands of local people and dozens of organizations worked together for a year to develop a strategic plan for the city as a whole and those neighborhoods most affected by poverty. The plan includes proposals to enhance lifelong learning and employment opportunities, improve the community's housing, and revitalize the city's downtown.  Empower Lewiston has been able to leverage its funding by more than 50 to 1, generating more than $11 million in public and private investment in the community. Included among the projects that have been funded are investments in a local employment firm that created 60 new jobs and in the Seeds of Change program that enhances outreach among community residents. Looking ahead, Empower Lewiston will be developing a community resource center, working to develop safe and affordable housing, and expanding education programs that target the needs of local residents.  Empower Lewiston provides a wonderful example of what the new Enterprise Communities are able to accomplish. By passing the Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act, Congresscan ensure that communities such as Lewiston will have the resources they need to complete their missions and create a brighter future.                          ____________________
