Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding time.  Mr. Speaker, the manufacture of cloned human beings rightly alarms an overwhelming majority of Americans. Some 90 percent oppose human cloning, according to a recent Time/CNN poll. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission unanimously concluded that ``Any attempt to clone a child is uncertain in its outcome, is unacceptably dangerous to the fetus and, therefore, morally unacceptable.'' That is why this bill prohibits all human cloning.  A partial ban would allow for stockpiles of cloned human embryos to be produced, bought and sold without restrictions. Implantation of cloned embryos, a relatively easy procedure, would inevitably take place. Once cloned embryos are produced and available in laboratories, it is impossible to control what is done with them, so a partial ban is simply unenforceable.  It has been argued that this bill would have a negative impact on scientific research, but this assertion is unsupported, both by the language in the bill and by the testimony received by the Subcommittee on Crime during two hearings. The language in the bill allows for research in the use of nuclear transfer or other cloning techniques used to produce molecules, DNA, cells, tissues, organs, plants or animal. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, there is no language in the bill that would interfere with the use of in vitro fertilization, the administration of fertility-enhancing drugs, or the use of other medical procedures to assist a woman from becoming or remaining pregnant.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and oppose the substitute.
