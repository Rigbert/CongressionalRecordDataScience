 Section 108 prevents the President from siphoning off funds from critical Army Corps projects to build a border wall. These include important flood control projects to protect and restore communities from natural disasters and navigation projects to keep our ports moving commerce.  Our bill protects more than $20 billion in disaster funding appropriated since February of last year to rebuild damaged Corps projects and speed up flood control projects all over the country, including in my colleague's home State of Texas, which has been so hard hit.                              {time}  2000  It also protects funding for Corps projects that are currently underway, or soon will be, including projects in every district across America. Without this language, the President can raid funding from any Corps water infrastructure project he wants and divert those funds to a border wall.  Earlier this year, when it became public that the President was considering using the Corps' Civil Works fund to pay for a border wall, the backlash was swift and strong, with bipartisan opposition.  In fact, a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including those from Texas, tweeted that they had secured the commitment of the White House that the President would not raid disaster funding for their Harvey relief projects. If approved, this amendment would strike the language in the bill that protects those projects.  So I remind my colleagues that a ``yes'' vote on this amendment is a vote signaling that they are fine with the President raiding Corps water infrastructure projects in their district to build a border wall.  The President, on hundreds of occasions, may I remind you, promised that Mexico would pay for any border security necessary to restore order at our shared border. We cannot allow the President to dip into accounts with infrastructure funds to assist ravaged communities across our Nation.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.  And I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano), my esteemed colleague, chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Water Subcommittee.
