I know it is very scarce, but I felt compelled, Mr. President, to make a couple of comments about what was not in the State of the Union Message last night.  One of the most disturbing things was that out of 1 hour and 20 minutes, only about less than 90 seconds were devoted to our Nation's defense. We are facing a crisis, and it is on two fronts. And I, just briefly, would like to submit a couple things for the Record and discuss those two things.  First of all, not many Americans realize that we do not have a national missile defense system. And that is to say, Mr. President, that if a missile is fired from anyplace in China at Washington, DC, it takes approximately 35 minutes to get over here. Now, the average person would think, well, if it takes 35 minutes to get over here--and we can remember the Persian Gulf war--we know you can knock down missiles with missiles, therefore, we have a defense. But, in fact, we have zero defense.  We don't have any defense at all. And the reason is that when you have a trajectory, where a missile is fired in one area, it goes up, it is out of the atmosphere, and by the time it comes back in, it is coming at a velocity that is faster than anything we have in our arsenal; and, consequently, we have no defense.  So you might ask the question, well, is there really a threat out there that is facing us that is imminent today? And I have to say that there is. I know that it sounds extreme to say this, but I have often said--and others are now agreeing--that I look back wistfully on the days of the cold war where there are two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America; and we knew what they had, they knew what we had. And we had this great agreement that was put together, not by Democrats but by Republicans, called the ABM agreement of 1972 that said: ``I will make you a deal. If you agree not to defend yourself, we'll agree not to defend ourselves, therefore, if you shoot us, we'll shoot you, and everyone dies and everyone's happy.'' That was something I didn't agree with at that time, but, however, today it makes absolutely no sense at all.  I would like to repeat something that was said recently by Henry Kissinger, who was one of the architects of that ABM Treaty of 1972, when he said it no longer has any application today. Today, when you are looking at the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, when you see countries like Russia and China that have missiles that will reach any city in the United States of America from anyplace in the world, that is a very, very serious thing. And that means that there is not just one entity out there from which we must defend ourselves.  I can remember--I am old enough to remember--the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when all of a sudden hysteria set out in the United States of America. We discovered that there were 40 medium-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, that were Soviet missiles, on the little island of Cuba, 90 miles off of our shore, and they could reach any city outside of the States of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. And I would say now the crisis is even worse because they can reach anywhere. And we still have no defense at all.  I want to submit for the Record--to evaluate this, we on the Armed Services Committee have the nine most professional people, most knowledgeable people on missiles anywhere in the world--and it was chaired by Don Rumsfeld--and they put together an assessment of what our threat really is.  A lot of times people say the threat is not imminent when they talk about indigenous capabilities. In other words, if Iran were trying to develop a missile to reach us, it would take them 5 or 6 years to do it. On the other hand, we know that Iran is trading, as we speak, with China, trading technology, trading systems. And they have one that could hit us today. So I only read the Executive Summary concluding paragraph:       Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses,      practices and policies that depend on expectations of      extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as      appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment      in which there may be little or no warning.  I ask unanimous consent to have that material printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Executive Summary of the Report of the Commission To Assess the              Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States                             July 15, 1998                         ii. executive summary     A. Conclusions of the Commissioners       The nine Commissioners are unanimous in concluding that:       Concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potentially      hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological      or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United      States, its deployed forces and its friends and allies. These      newer, developing threats in North Korea, Iran and Iraq are      in addition to those still posed by the existing ballistic      missile arsenals of Russia and China, nations with which we      are not now in conflict but which remain in uncertain      transitions. The newer ballistic missile-equipped nations'      capabilities will not match those of U.S. systems for      accuracy or reliability. However, they would be able to      inflict major destruction on the U.S. within about five years      of a decision to acquire such a capability (10 years in the      case of Iraq). During several of those years, the U.S. might      not be aware that such a decision had been made.       The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities      is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has      been reported in estimates and reports by the Intelligence      Community.       The Intelligence Community's ability to provide timely and      accurate estimates of ballistic missile threats to the U.S.      is eroding. This erosion has roots both within and beyond the      intelligence process itself. The Community's capabilities in      this area need to be strengthened in terms of both resources      and methodology.       The warning times the U.S. can expect of new, threatening      ballistic missile deployments are being reduced. Under some      plausible scenarios--including re-basing or transfer of      operational missiles, sea- and air-launch options, shortened      development programs that might include testing in a third      country, or some combination of these--the U.S. might well      have little or no warning before operational deployment.       Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses,      practices and policies that depend on expectations of      extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as      appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment      in which there may be little or no warning.                                  ____                     Resumes of Commission Members       The Honorable Donald H.
