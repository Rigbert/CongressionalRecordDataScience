Speaker, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary man from my district, Mr. Art Edgerton. Art unexpectedly passed from this life on Tuesday, September 26, 2000 in his home in Perrysburg, Ohio. Art exemplified artistry, humanitarianism, and zest in every aspect of his being.  Well known to Northwest Ohioans, Art was a most talented and accomplished musician who made his mark nationwide. Though he began his professional career as a drummer at the tender age of nine, Art's piano playing was legendary and he played with various bands through the early 1950s. Even after settling in Toledo, Ohio and pursuing other employment, Art continued playing the piano, entertaining audiences in his adopted hometown.  In 1957, Art entered into a new career, that of broadcasting. Beginning as a part time disc jockey with the former WTOL radio station, he soon transitioned to a report for both radio and television covering civic affairs. Art broke into this field at a time when his race and his disability made this pursuit very difficult. Still he persevered, enduring prejudice with grace, covering the 1963 March on Washington and, blind since birth, taking notes in Braille. An early colleague best summed up Art's style: ``. . .   a very accomplished reporter. He was extremely sensitive at a time when being a black reporter presented him with a lot of obstacles.'' The colleague noted how it was not easy for many people to accept Arts' use of Braille writing as he reported an event, and highlighted ``Art's ability to maintain his composure and to deal fairly with everyone he dealt with, even if they didn't deal fairly with him.'' Even as he continued in his journalism and music careers, Art took on a new challenge in the late 1960's becoming an administrative assistant in the external affairs office of the University of Toledo and later, the Assistant Director for Affirmative Action.  Active in community affairs as well, Art served as Board President of the Ecumenical Communications Commission of Northwest Ohio, Board Member of the Greater Toledo Chapter of the American Red Cross, member of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, President of the Northwest Ohio Black Media Association, and the National Association of Black Journalists. In 1995 he was inducted into that organization's Regional Hall of Fame. Among all of his awards and accolades, Art was perhaps most proud of receiving the 1967 Handicapped American of the Year Award which was presented to him personally by Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Coming from an unhappy childhood in which his parents could not accept his blindness, his wife explained why this particular award affected him so deeply, ``With his upbringing, how he had to scuffle, he just figured he would never be recognized. The fact that somebody recognized what he done gave him that much more determination to continue and do better.''  Mr. Speaker, Art Edgerton was a friend and a trusted advisor throughout the years I have served in this House. I shall miss deeply, as will our entire community. He made us better through his caring and talents spirit. He always advocated for the rights of people with disabilities. Exceedingly gracious, completely endearing, unfailingly honest, yet with a core of steel, Art Edgerton was a man among men. We offer our profoundest and heartfelt condolences to his wife of 35 years, Della, his sons Edward and Paul, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May their memories of this truly great man carry them forward.                          ____________________
