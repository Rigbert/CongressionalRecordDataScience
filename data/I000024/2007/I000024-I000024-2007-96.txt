President, this morning, as I do every morning, I was taking my aggressive walk around the Capitol. I walked in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I looked up at the eight pillars facing west, and I said audibly, ``Help is on its way,'' in the form of a young jurist from Oklahoma named Tim DeGiusti.  I pause for a moment to thank, certainly, Senator Specter for his help. I single out Senator Leahy, who gave me his word a long time ago that this would happen before the August recess. I say the same thing about the majority leader, Senator Reid. I thank him for his assistance.  I know my junior Senator would like to say a couple of words and will talk about the qualifications of this man. He has highest ratings in everything. He has strong support from Democrats--our Democratic Governor, and my predecessor here, David Boren, a Democrat.  On a personal note, 41 years ago, I was elected to the State house of representatives with a very bright guy named Ralph Thompson. He ended up being one of the most renowned Federal district judges in the history of Oklahoma. He and his family are watching us right now from a reunion in Ohio. I only suggest, through the Chair, that Ralph Thompson and his wife Barbara had three beautiful little girls. His daughter Elaine married Tim DeGiusti. So there is a connection there. You have a great jurist in RalphThompson, and then you have the next generation, his son-in-law, Tim DeGiusti, whose nomination is before us now.  I am so honored to have the opportunity to call for this vote in a few minutes for Tim DeGiusti to be a Federal district court judge in Oklahoma.
