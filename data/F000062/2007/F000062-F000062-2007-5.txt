 President, I rise today to speak about agricultural inspection at the Department of Homeland Security.  I believe there is a serious problem with agriculture inspections at the Department of Homeland Security.  The causes are many. The stakes are high. The impact is potentially devastating.  Here are the facts--documented in a 2006 GAO report, a 2007 Congressional Research Service memorandum, and a 2007 report prepared for the House Committee on Agriculture.  Agriculture inspection at several key American points of entry has significantly decreased. Inspections decreased in Miami by 12.7 percent, in Boston by 17.9 percent, and San Francisco by 21.4 percent; the number of quarantine significant pest interceptions has declined by 31 percent since its high of nearly 74,000 in 2002; 22 percent of agricultural specialists' time is spent on duties other than agriculture inspection; and agriculture inspection at DHS is subordinate to the Department's other priorities for drug and weapons enforcement.  As the senior Senator from California, the largest agriculture State in the Nation--a $32 billion industry--I cannot stand by while three infestations of Medfly have occurred in my State just this year.  And other States have similar problems. Florida has seen a 29-percent increase in pest outbreaks over the last 4 years.  It was my intention to offer an amendment to move the agriculture inspection function back to the USDA--and I want to thank my lead cosponsors on this amendment, Senator Martinez and Senator Casey.  However, I recognize there is strong objection to considering my amendment in the Senate.  I have had multiple discussions with Secretary Chertoff on this issue, and he has agreed to take action to improve agriculture inspection.  Specifically, he has agreed to create a new Deputy Executive Director for Agriculture Operational Oversight that is responsible for: managing the joint Customs and Border Protection and USDA Agriculture Quality Assurance program; monitoring agricultural inspection performance for risk and efficiency; securing appropriate staffing and budget allocation for agriculture inspection; ensuring that all directives and policies specific to the agricultural programs are executed in compliance with the agriculture mission; and ensuring there is open dialogue with State and Federal counterparts to assure agricultural inspection activities are being properly handled at ports of entry.  Additionally, he has assured me that the agriculture inspectors' time will no longer be used for anything other than agriculture inspection.  So in light of those commitments, I have agreed to defer the amendment.  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the December 13 letter from Secretary Chertoff, and the accompanying two documents, which are copies of the two memoranda from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, establishing the actions to which we have agreed.  But I will watch carefully to see that what the Secretary has agreed to is implemented in the Department.  I want to thank the California Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, the State Departments of Agriculture and their association, the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance, and the many farm organizations that supported this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the documents to which I have referred and the list of these organizations that wrote in support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                U.S. Department of                                            Homeland Security,                                Washington, DC, December 13. 2007.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I appreciate the discussions we      have had over the last few weeks concerning the agricultural      mission within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). I      want to inform you of two actions the Department of Homeland      Security is taking to address the concerns you have raised.       First, at my direction, the Assistant Commissioner of Field      Operations at CBP has sent a memo to all field offices      (attached) reaffirming that the Agriculture Specialists are      to be specifically assigned to agricultural inspection      activities and will be dedicated to the mission of protecting      the Nation's food supply and agricultural industry from      pests, diseases. and related bio-threats, absent exigent      operational circumstances. To promote consistent      implementation of this policy, the memo also outlines      measures that CBP is taking to ensure that the activities of      Agriculture Specialists are accurately recorded in CBP's      Overtime and Scheduling System.       Second, as of January 2, 2008, a new position will he      established within CBP to improve oversight of the      agricultural mission across all CBP field offices. Named the      Deputy Executive Director, Agriculture Operational Oversight,      the new position will report to the Executive Director for      Agriculture Programs and Trade liaison at CBP headquarters.      The Deputy Executive Director will be charged with ensuring a      more consistent application of agriculture inspection policy      across all ports. The position will also serve as a primary      point of contact for Joint Agency Task Force coordination      issues for the Department, the Animal and Plant Health      Inspection Service (APHIS) within the Department of      Agriculture and stakeholders, and it will be responsible for      outreach to Federal and State officials on border inspection      issues. The Deputy Executive Director will oversee the Joint      CBP/APHIS Agriculture Quality Assurance program and monitor      agricultural performance measures for risk and efficiency.      This office will also ensure compliance with all directives      and policies specific to the agricultural programs, to      include conducting field audits and reviews of Agriculture      Specialist activities, and correcting deficiencies. In      addition, the Deputy Executive Director will work to ensure      that Agriculture Specialists have the equipment and resources      needed to perform the agricultural inspection function. (A      memo to field offices describing the new position in more      detail is attached.)       I greatly appreciate your engagement on these critical      issues, and I look forward to continuing our discussions with      respect to your questions on agricultural referrals to      secondary inspection. The measures we are undertaking are a      direct result of our constructive dialogue, your dedication      to the agricultural community, the essential work done by CBP      Agriculture Specialists, and the desire to protect American      agriculture from harmful pests and diseases.           Sincerely,                                                 Michael Chertoff,     Secretary.                                  ____         U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and            Border Protection,                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2007.     Memorandum for: Directors, Field Operations; Director,          PreClearance.     From: Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations.     Subject: Utilization of Agriculture Specialists and Related          Time and Attendance Information (TC-FY-08-0222).       The purpose of this memorandum is two-fold, first, to      ensure that Agriculture Specialists (CBPAS) are performing      inspectional activities directly related to the protection of      American agriculture; and second to provide clear guidance on      the utilization of Cost Management Information System (CMIS)      codes housed within COSS that are specifically designed for      use by CBPAS.       Directors, Field Operations must ensure that CBPAS are      assigned to agricultural inspectional activities at the      individual ports of entry. It is imperative that assignments      for these employees are dedicated to the mission of      protecting the Nation's food supply and agricultural industry      from pests and diseases absent exigent operational      circumstances.       Clear guidance on the use of CMIS codes are housed in the      Customs and Border Protection Overtime and Scheduling System      (COSS) and are structured to reflect the range of operational      functions combined within CBP. CMIS codes are focused on      Customs, Immigration- and Agriculture-related functionality      to reflect and define the totality of services offered by      CBP. CMIS aids the Agency in aligning the personnel labor      information in COSS to CBP financial reporting requirements.      Further, CMIS enhances the Agency's ability to track User      Fee-related activity costs, provide more accurate cost      information to external parties (i.e. Congress), and help to      establish baseline cost information necessary for developing      and monitoring annual budgets.       CBPAS perform the mission of protecting American      agriculture from harmful pests and diseases. Further, this      work must be accurately recorded in COSS using the      appropriate CMIS codes. To accomplish this, Directors of      Field Operations (DFOs) shall ensure that CBPAS are assigned      and utilized in alignment with that mission.       As part of the continuing Unified COSS Location Rotation      Process (UCLRP) (TC-06-1630), Directors, Field Operations      (DFO) are responsible for monitoring and overseeing this      process to ensure agriculture-related work activities are      accurately recorded. For your convenience, the UCLRP tasking      and CMIS codes are posted to the CBPnet under the OFO tab. As      part of the UCLRP, DFOs must continue to complete the      quarterly analysis and submit findings to Headquarters for      analysis.       For clarification, CMIS codes beginning with the letter      ``Q'' should be utilized to capture agriculture-related      activities. The role of the CBPAS is to interpret and enforce      agricultural regulatory requirements through agricultural      inspections of travelers and cargo. Appropriate activities      are listed in the CBPAS position description and in Appendix      2 and 3 of the DHS--USDA Memorandum of Agreement of 2003      (attached).       I am directing all DFOs to ensure that CBPAS are assigned      to agricultural inspectional activities at the individual      ports of entry. Assignments for these employees must be      dedicated to the mission of protecting the Nation's food      supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases,      absent exigent operational circumstances.       If you have any questions regarding this matter, please      have a member of your staff contact Ava Fleming.     Thomas S. Winkowski.                                  ____     From: Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations.     Subject: Establishment of Deputy Executive Director,          Agriculture Operational Oversight, Agriculture Programs &          Trade Liaison (APTL).       This memorandum addresses the establishment of a Deputy      Executive Director position in the Agriculture Operational      Oversight position within the Agriculture Programs & Trade      Liaison (APTL) division within Customs and Border protection      (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO).       In order to address the concerns of agricultural      stakeholders and to provide better operational oversight for      the Agricultural Mission within CBP, I am creating a new      Deputy Executive Director, Agriculture Operational Oversight      position in APTL. The Deputy Executive Director will report      to the Executive Director for APTL.                   BENEFITS OF CREATING NEW POSITION       CBP is creating a new position and office in OFO      Headquarters that will be charged with further coordinating      agricultural activities. Establishing this position will      result in more consistent application of agriculture      inspection policy across all ports. It will also provide a      primary point of contact for Joint Agency Task Force (JATF)      coordination issues for APHIS, USDA, UHS, and agriculture      industry stakeholders.       Program improvements that will be realized are coordination      and implementation of the JATF Action Plans, Agriculture      Partnership Council and stakeholder outreach. This position      will oversee the Joint CBP/APHIS Agriculture Quality      Assurance program and monitor agricultural performance      measures for risk and efficiency. It will allow CBP to      utilize trend analysis and redirect targeting and resources      to areas of highest risk. The office will also ensure that      all directives and policies specific to the agricultural      programs are executed and in compliance with CBP agriculture      mission.       To enhance operational oversight this office will ensure      resources are available for agriculture programs in the      field. This specific responsibility will ensure that all      Agricultural Specialists will have all the equipment and      other resources needed to facilitate and improve the      agricultural inspection function. Additionally, this Deputy      Executive Director will ensure appropriate staffing levels      and budget allocation for agricultural programs as well as      initiate and monitor special agricultural operations. The      Deputy Executive Director will meet regularly with state and      federal counterparts to maximize efficiencies. Emphasis will      be placed on ensuring that CBPAS are specifically assigned to      agricultural inspectional activities at the individual ports      of entry.       The new office will issue memoranda, musters, and conduct      conference calls, to clarify the expected activities, duties,      functions, roles and responsibilities of the Agricultural      Specialist (AS) in conducting CBP's mission. This individual      will ensure that AS accurately record agriculture inspection      activities in the CBP Overtime and Scheduling System (COSS).      This will better align the personnel labor information in      COSS to CBP financial reporting requirements. Furthermore,      the Deputy Executive Director will enhance the Agency's      ability to track User Fee-related activity costs and help      establish baseline cost information necessary for developing      and monitoring annual budgets. He will visit and conduct      field audits and reviews of the AS activities and compliance      with the CBP Agricultural commitment.                            CHAIN OF COMMAND       The new Deputy Executive Director will work through the      current chain of command in the field and is not in the      supervisory chain for field Agriculture Specialists.                 TIMEFRAME FOR CREATION OF NEW POSITION       The new Deputy Executive Director will be in place and the      office will be operational no later than January 2, 2008.                                  ____       American Beekeeping Federation.
