 Leahy, and Mr. Biden) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                               S. Res. 115       Whereas, the political, economic, and social situation in      Macedonia has steadily deteriorated since February 2001;       Whereas, ongoing fighting between the National Liberation      Army and the Government of Macedonia presents a clear and      present danger to the viability of Macedonia;       Whereas, a Macedonian civil war exacerbates tensions in the      region and could trigger additional incidents of violence in      the Balkans;       Whereas, the ongoing fighting has displaced at least 18,000      people inside Macedonia, and forced another 40,000 people to      flee into neighboring countries;       Whereas, political parties in Macedonia are negotiating a      political solution to the current crisis;       Whereas, a cease-fire and dialogue between the parties are      essential to preventing full scale inter-ethnic warfare in      Macedonia; and       Whereas, a unified and independent Macedonia is in United      States national security interests: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) encourages a lasting cease-fire, and calls upon the      Government of Macedonia to ensure the protection of the lives      and property of all citizens of Macedonia;       (2) commends the political parties in Macedonia for seeking      a political solution to the current crisis, and encourages a      continued commitment to dialogue by those parties;       (3) calls upon the Government of Macedonia to address the      concerns of all citizens of Macedonia in a fair and equitable      manner;       (4) recognizes that the United States and other countries      must assume a more pro-active role in aiding the Government      of Macedonia and the political parties in Macedonia to secure      and maintain a lasting solution to the conflict; and       (5) pledges its support for additional United States      assistance for programs and activities that contribute to      reconstruction in Macedonia and a resolution of inter-ethnic      tensions in that country.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy, Senator Biden, and I submit this resolution as an indication of our support and encouragement for continued negotiations between ethnic-Albanian and Macedonian political parties. A unified and independent Macedonia is in the best interests of all the citizens of Macedonia, neighboring countries, and the United States.  The news this morning of renewed fighting in the wake of stalled talks is deeply troubling. Continued armed conflict serves only to exacerbate an already difficult and tense situation. American leadership and engagement is essential in resolving the current crisis. We must be clear: a lasting cease-fire and peace can only be secured through dialogue and disarmament.  Frustrations on both sides of the negotiating table are growing daily. However difficult and dire the situation may seem today, it will only get worse if the talks completely collapse. The stakes are indeed high, and call for cooler heads and responsible, and responsive, leadership.  Make no mistake, the long standing and legitimate grievances of ethnic-Albanians must be on the table for discussion, and successful resolution. While the rights and lives of all Macedonian citizens must be protected and guaranteed, Macedonian officials must be particularly vigilant in ensuring that ethnic-Albanians are not targeted for retribution, as has unfortunately been the case in the past. The foundation of peace and stability is nothing less than equality for all citizens of Macedonia under the law and genuine respect for democratic processes, institutions, and the rule of law.  We hope that all parties at the negotiation table in Skopje understand that in their hands rests the fate of the country. We stand ready to support U.S.-funded programs and activities that contribute to the reconstruction and a resolution of inter-ethnic tensions in Macedonia.
