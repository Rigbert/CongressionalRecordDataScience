President, October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and 2005 marks more than 20 years that National Breast Cancer Awareness Month has educated women about early breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet, more than three million women currently live with breast cancer and the causes of this disease are still mostly unknown. While we have made significant advances in treatment, so much more needs to be done when it comes to prevention of this often fatal disease.  The Breast Cancer Environmental Research Act, S. 757, would enhance breast cancer environmental research across the country. This bill which is modeled after the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program, would over 5 years, invest $30 million through a peer-reviewed grant process to establish a multi-disciplinary approach.  At this time, four research centers study prenatal-adult environmental exposures that may cause breast cancer. And while this is a good start, we need a nationally focused, collaborative and comprehensive strategy to approach this and the Breast Cancer Environmental Research Act would do just that.  This country has great resources when it comes to medical and scientific research. I believe this bill would provide an efficient and effective strategy for developing research in the environmental causes of this tragic disease.                          ____________________[Page S12003]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                BREAST CANCER ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACT
