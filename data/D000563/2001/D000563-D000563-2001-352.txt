I see the Senator from Minnesota is here seeking recognition.  Let me say, this is one of the most important debates of the year. Until the Senate leadership changed 2 weeks ago, this bill was buried in committee. The health insurance companies had us right where they wanted us. They stuck this bill in committee and said: You will not hear a national debate about the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a new day in the Senate. There is new leadership, and there is a new agenda. I am proud of the fact that my party has brought forward as the first bill that we will debate a Patients' Bill of Rights. I am proud of it because I believe that is what we are all about.  Frankly, on a bipartisan basis with Senator McCain and Congressman Norwood and others, we are making this a strong bipartisan fight. It isn't a fight so that at the end of the day we can say our party won; this politician won. It is a fight so that at the end of the day Roberto Cortes has a chance, and his mom and dad can focus on this little boy's life and that daily struggle, not a struggle with the health insurance companies.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Minnesota.
