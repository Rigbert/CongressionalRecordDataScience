In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the Hammond Public Library and presided over by Magistrate Judge Paul R. Cherry, will be held at Harrison Park in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for their families. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America, that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize the great things America has to offer. They realize that nowhere else in the world is the opportunity for success and a better life available to them than here in America.  On July 4, 2008, the following people will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Mindi Thi Bul, Lidia Quinonez, Claudia Rodriguez, Maria de la Luz Godinez, Venkat Santhosh Reddy Poddutur, Juanita Martinez, Chu-Mei Peng, Pantelis George Baramantas, Teresa Fernandez, Jose Cruz Alvarez Martinez, Iris Xiomara Sierra, Nada Jerkovic, Juan Tellez Rangel, Sarp Kocak, Juana Ramirez de Pantoja, Aurelio Jimenez, Michal Armatys, Rosy Oliva Arreaga, Stevanda Vukicevic, Tanuja Reddy Poddutur, Genoveva Atilano, Lelis Estella Lizama, Arel Cherry, Dejan Lukich, Silvia Vazquez, Monica Leticia Dominguez, Rodolfo Macias, Snezana Krkobabic, Mario Gonzalez Salgado, Victor Manuel Garcia Garcia, Maria Carmen Avina, Cristina Varzoaba, Filiberto Corona, Ma Melorie Villagracia Rodriguez, Hilda Gonzalez, Gregorio Martinez Sanchez, Maria de Jesus Alvarez, Orlando Jiminez Serna, Diana Lewis, Jose Antonio Saldana, Ivanja Corak, FaridaBegum, Elva Miriam Reyna, Fidelina Rodriguez, Beatriz Anaya Vargas, Efren Carranza, Arturo Cantero Paredes, Carlos Nicolas Perez Aranda, Maria Stoneburner, and Alma Della Rangel.  Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for educational or occupational opportunities or for the opportunity to offer their families a better life, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation, and by seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice whatever religion they choose to practice, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  On July 4, 2008, we will welcome these newly naturalized citizens to enjoy the same freedoms and liberties that all Americans take pride in and cherish. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. These individuals, representing many nations throughout the world, will be called upon to declare their allegiance to the United States of America.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who will become citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2008, the day of our Nation's independence. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
