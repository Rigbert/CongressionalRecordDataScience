President, the bill also includes several floor amendments to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995. One relates to Palestinian Authority offices in Jerusalem. Under the Israel-Palestinian agreements, the Palestinian Authority may only maintain offices in the areas under its jurisdiction, which do not include Jerusalem. Recently, Israel and the Palestinians satisfactorily resolved questions that had been raised about existing Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. The amendment included in the bill would deny assistance to the PLO if it were to fund a new office in Jerusalem that did not conform to Israeli-Palestinian agreements and understandings. A second amendment included in the bill requires the PLO to cooperate fully with the United States on the provision of information on U.S. nationals known to have been held by the PLO or its factions. This amendment would cut off U.S. assistance if the PLO is not responsive to further, specific U.S. requests for information that may be in its possession.
