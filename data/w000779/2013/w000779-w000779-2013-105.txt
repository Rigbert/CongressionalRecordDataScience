President, today I would like to reintroduce an important piece of forest legislation for my home State of Oregon.  This is legislation that I introduced in the last two Congresses. The legislation gained the support of the administration through a number of improvements, but unfortunately it failed to get passed. I have since made a few more updates and improvements as I continue talking to stakeholders who worked with me on this legislation. I am introducing the bill today to reinvigorate the discussion and get stakeholders to finalize any outstanding issues so we can finally get this bill done this Congress. I am sending the message that restoring these forests in Oregon is an urgent priority that needs to get done an I am going to keep at it until this issue gets addressed  I am pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley has again joined me today in introducing this bill. He also recognizes the urgent needs to restore Oregon's forests and help forest dependent communities and I am glad he is part of this fight.  Oregon's historic war over its forests restyled in gridlock that led to millions of acres of Oregon's Federal forest landscape containing choked, overstocked stands that are at great risk of uncharacteristic catastrophic fires, insect infestations and disease. The outcome of the decades of conflict is very evident in Eastern Oregon's forests.  That is why I introduced legislation in the last two Congresses to tackle the challenges facing Oregon's Eastside forests and why I reintroduce this legislation again today.  The legislation I first introduced in 2009 reflected an agreement reached by leaders on both sides of these difficult issues Intense negotiations resulted in that legislation with the goal of bringing jobs and a healthier tomorrow to the 8.3 million acres on the 6 Federal forests in eastern and central Oregon. That agreement has already resulted in progress being made on forestry issues in Eastern Oregon. Already there is more collaboration, less gridlock, more timber harvests and forests gradually beginning to get restored.  But we can't stop there. Since the last Congress, discussions and negotiations with interested stakeholders have continued. Today's bill reflects some of those discussions as well as some of the real progress seen on the ground in Eastern Oregon, but it also preserves the core elements of the agreement that I crafted with the stakeholders to this agreement--a push to increase the timber produced from our national forests, landscape scale restoration efforts and protections for watersheds and old growth.  Eastern Oregon today is down to only a small handful of surviving timber mills. Yet those mills are urgently needed to process saw logs and other merchantable material from forest restoration projects. Without them, there will be no restoration of Oregon's Eastside forests. But without far greater certainty of merchantable timber supply, more mills will close.  That's why we not only need to introduce legislation today, we need to pass it this Congress. Because time is not on our side and at risk forests and mills won't wait forever for the perfect consensus.  Fortunately leaders on both sides of this issue recognize that Oregon's forests will pay the price if more mills close. That recognition is what brought us to the landmark agreement in the first place.  I expect continued discussions as the Senate process advances over the best way to craft the bill to reflect current reality on the ground but I want to build on the progress that has been made to this point.  I also want to point out that none of our efforts will succeed unless Oregon Federal forests are also adequately funded to properly manage and restore these valuable Federal assets. I will fight, along with Senator Merkley and other stakeholders, for the funding to put our people back to work and restore the health of our forests.  I thank the stakeholders that have continued to spend time and energy engaged in discussions with me on the details of this legislation. I know there is further work ahead, and I look forward to working with them to get the legislation ready for passage.  I want to also express my gratitude to Governor Kitzhaber, who also understands the importance of advancing efforts to treat and restore Oregon's forests. He went to bat to putting state funding behind these efforts so I want to ensure that the Federal Government is also honoring its commitment to manage these Federal treasures and be a good neighbor to state and private lands. I appreciate his efforts and look forward to continuing to work with him.  I am pleased to reintroduce this legislation today, and I intend to keep working with all the folks in my State who are willing to talk in good faith about restoring our Eastside forests. I want to continue to get input from stakeholders on any further revisions to the bill and get a final product that will pass this Congress.                                 ______                                       By
