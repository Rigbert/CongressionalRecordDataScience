 Among the most appalling spectacles we have witnessed on the Senate floor in recent years is that of Senators standing around casting judgment on whether particular ads by citizens groups transgress some notions of what is appropriate.  Sham issue advocacy is the reformer's favorite pejorative term of art for first amendment protected speech which those pushing the regulatory scheme in McCain-Feingold and the Snowe substitute do not regard as legitimate. They say it is sham speech because--brace yourself--it might actually affect an election. Well, by all means.  We are admonished that any communication by a private citizen or group that might have any impact on a Federal election should be regulated by the Federal Government, should be reported to the Federal Election Commission. The citizens who gather together to pay for it to exercise their constitutional right of association ought to be disclosed to the Federal Government, so the argument goes, so that they may be judged.  Many in the media beat the drums for Government regulation of this so-called sham issue advocacy. Roll Call last month actually had the audacity to besiege the Congress to get this speech--now listen to this--to get this speech under control. Of course, if you really want to have influence, if you really want to affect the course of an election to favor certain candidates over others, repeal certain legislation or certain issues and you are wealthy, you can always buy a newspaper or become a newspaper editor, write editorials, headlines, stories.  A lot of people would like to get those sham editorials under control. I thought about that from time to time over the years, but the first amendment would not allow it, and I don't know of anyone advocating it, certainly not Roll Call.  Fortunately for the media, they benefit from a provision in the Federal Elections Campaign Act, I might call it a loophole, that exempts their issue advocacy, their express advocacy, and only theirs, from the definition of expenditure.  The presumption underlying the notion that issue advocacy needs to be gotten under control is a remarkably arrogant one, or perhaps, in some instances, an ignorant one. The premise is that the politicians, all of us, own these elections and, therefore, politicians must control them, and politicians must not be drowned out by all this other independent speech issue advocacy by private citizens and groups.  Good heavens, the politicians may wish to keep the race on a particular issue or two or perhaps they rather not talk about legislative issues at all. Perhaps they prefer to keep the emphasis on personality, resume or some other nonissue qualities.  And there could be some citizen group with all their ``sham" issue advocacy spoiling the election, messing the election up, fussing the election up with issues, for goodness sake--with issues. A group of citizens may feel strongly that character is an issue, one that should be injected into a particular race, and so they broadcast, through paid ads, some misdeed of a candidate because it is relevant to character. Reformers write such communications off as ``negative'' and somehow unbecoming in a democracy.  They do this without the candidate's permission. The temerity of these folks presuming they have a constitutional right to participate in elections, to weigh in on issues, to influence public opinion. Private citizens and groups interjecting themselves into American elections? How dare they do that. What do they think this is? A democracy?  A so-called compromise is being shopped around--actually it is the one we are considering--it is a compromise insofar as it seeks to pick up some additional Republicans, enough to invoke cloture at some point down the road. Its proponents claim it addresses the constitutional shortcomings of McCain-Feingold. Its authors have created a new label, a sort of new category of speech that exists nowhere save for the talking points here on the floor. They rephrase ``sham'' issue advocacy, calling it instead ``electioneering.''  Electioneering. What sinister overtones this term must evidently hold to reformers. This is positively subversive stuff, this ``electioneering.'' It warrants, in the reformer view, Federal regulation. Those who contribute to it should, we are told, be disclosed to the Federal Government.  We are advised by proponents of McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords substitute or addition, that this ``sham'' issue advocacy, this ``electioneering'' is a new phenomenon, a new scourge which must be routed out, regulated, and disclosed to a Federal agency, the FEC.  Here is a news flash: Issue advocacy--``sham'' or otherwise--is neither novel nor ripe for Federal regulation. The legal minds at the Brennan Center who are building the case for McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords proposal do not like the Buckley case. They do not respect the Buckley case. And their mission is to overturn the Buckley case.  Their theory--really a desperate hope, actually--is that the Court will look at 20 years of election activities since the Buckley decision and decide things differently, even obliterate the ``bright-line'' standard, the ``express advocacy'' tripwire.  More likely is that the Court will go the other way toward my view and that of those who think the first amendment that passed back before 1800 is America's premier political reform--not the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.  The Court is not going to look at the proliferation of issue advocacy and say, ``Whoa, we need to get that under control.'' No. I think the Court is going to say, ``We told you so.''  The Court, in Buckley two decades ago, anticipated that which the reformers now identify as a horrible ``loophole,'' which has recently opened up somehow and must be closed.  In Buckley, the Court anticipated exactly what we are discussing this afternoon. It said in that case:       It would naively underestimate the integrity and      resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy      influence to believe that they would have much difficulty      devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express      advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the      candidate's campaign.  The Court was emphatic in Buckley that issue advocacy--``sham'' or otherwise--was at the core, the very core, of the first amendment. To regulate it in any way is unconstitutional, even a ``reform'' so seemingly innocuous as ``disclosure'' of donors.  In NAACP v. Button, in 1963, which was quoted in Buckley, the Court said:       Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to      survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow      specificity.  The Court went on to say in Buckley:       . . . the distinction between discussion of issues and      candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates      may often dissolve in practical application.  So the Court anticipated exactly what has happened.       Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to      public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions.  The Court said in Buckley:       Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their      positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves      generate issues of public interest.  The Court went on the say:       [W]hether words intended and designed to fall short of      invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent      and effect. No speaker, in such circumstances, safely could      assume that anything he might say upon the general subject      would not be understood by some as an invitation. In      short, the supposedly clear-cut distinction between      discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation      puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the      mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers and      consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to his      intent and meaning.       Such a distinction offers no security for free discussion.      In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty whatever may      be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and trim.  The Court went on:       The constitutional deficiencies described in Thomas v.      Collins can be avoided only by reading [the 1974 independent      expenditure provision regarding advocacy of election or      defeat] as limited [very limited] to communications that      include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a      candidate. . .       . . . in order to preserve the provision against      invalidation or vagueness grounds, [it] must be construed to      apply only to expenditures for communications that in express      terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified      candidate for federal office.  So, Madam President, the Court understood that an issue advocacy was very much to be, to some viewers or listeners, indistinguishable from express advocacy that they said the first amendment requires its protection.       So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate, [the Court said] they are free [I      repeat, free] to spend as much as they want to promote the      candidate and his views. The exacting interpretation of the      statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional      vagueness thus undermines the limitations's effectiveness as      a loophole-closing provision . . .       . . . yet no societal interest would be served by a      loophole-closing provision . . .  So summing up Buckley's observations about issue advocacy, they anticipated this. They wanted people to have wide latitude to discuss the issues or the pros and cons of candidates for office, up to and including proximity to an election. And they wanted them to be able to do that without having to file with the Federal Election Commission or to conduct their speech with hard-money dollars.  The Supreme Court reiterated the explicit words requirement for a determination of express advocacy in the 1986 Massachusetts Citizens for Life case--citing, again, footnote 52 as a guide. And here is what they said:       Buckley adopted the ``express advocacy'' requirement to      distinguish discussion of issues and candidates from more      pointed exhortations to vote for particular persons. We      therefore concluded in that case that a finding of ``express      advocacy'' depended upon the use of language such as ``vote      for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' etc.  Now, those who advocate McCain-Feingold and the Snowe-Jeffords proposal, which involve regulatory regimes, have precious few court cases upon which to base their arguments. Most prominent among these is the ninth circuit's Furgatch decision, dating back to 1987, which my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, made reference to a few moments ago. Frankly, it is a mighty slim reference. The Furgatch limb upon which their issue advocacy regulation case rests is a pretty weak limb.  While Furgatch is not my favorite decision, it is certainly not the blank check for reformers who seek to shut down issue advocacy either. Furgatch was an express advocacy case. It hinged on the content of the communication at issue--words, explicit terms--just as the Supreme Court required in Buckley and reiterated in Massachusetts Citizens for Life.  The words in Furgatch were not those contained in Buckley's footnote 52. Indeed, no one--least of all the Supreme Court--ever intended that the list, typically referred to as ``footnote 52'' was exhaustive. That would defy common sense.  Desperate for even the thinnest constitutional gruel upon which to base their regulatory zeal to extend their reach to everyone who dares to utter a political word in this country, the FEC leapt at Furgatch and will not let it go. FEC lawyers misread it, misrepresent it, and are rewarded with loss after loss after loss in the courts.  In last year's fourth circuit decision, which Senator Enzi referred to, ordering the FEC to pay one of its victims, the Christian Action Network's attorney's fees, the ``Furgatch-as-a-blank-check-for-issue-advocacy-regulation'' fantasy, was thoroughly dissected, debunked and dispensed with.  The court in the Christian Action Network case puts Furgatch in the proper perspective.  And let me read some portions of the Christian Action Network case.       On the authority of Buckley v. Valeo and FEC v.      Massachusetts Citizens for Life, the district court dismissed      the FEC's action against the Network for failure to state      a claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that,      as ``issue advocacy intended to inform the public about      political issues germane to the 1992 presidential      election,'' the advertisements were ``fully protected as      `political speech' under the First Amendment.''  Further on in the case, Madam President, the Court said:       Because the position taken by the FEC in this litigation      was foreclosed by clear, well-established Supreme Court      caselaw, and it is apparent from the Commission's selective      quotation from and citation to those authorities that the      agency was so aware, we conclude that the Commission's      position, if not assumed in bad faith, was at least not      ``substantially justified''. . .       Seven years later, and less than a month following the      Court's decision in MCFL, the Ninth Circuit in FEC v.      Furgatch, could not have been clearer that it, too, shared      this understanding of the Court's decision in Buckley.      Although the court declined to ``strictly limit'' express      advocacy to the ``magic words'' of Buckley's footnote 52      because that footnote's list does ``not exhaust the capacity      of the English language to expressly advocate election or      defeat of a candidate,'' curiously, the Ninth Circuit never      cited or discussed the Supreme Court's opinion in MCFL,      notwithstanding that MCFL was argued in the Supreme Court      three months prior to the decision in Furgatch and decided by      the Court almost a month prior to the Court of Appeals      decision. The Ninth Circuit does discuss the First Circuit's      opinion in MCFL, but without noting that certiorari had been      granted to review the case. Thus, the Furgatch court relied      upon Buckley alone, without the reaffirmation provided by the      Court in MCFL, for its conclusion that explicit ``words'' or      ``language'' of advocacy are required if the Federal Election      Campaign Act is to be constitutionally enforced.       The entire premise of the court's analysis was that words      of advocacy such as those recited in footnote 52 were      required to support Commission jurisdiction over a given      corporate expenditure.                           *   *   *   *   *       The Court explained that individual words or sentences of      the message cannot be considered in isolation, but, rather,      must be considered together with the other words and      sentences that appear in the communication, in determining      whether the message is one of election advocacy:                           *   *   *   *   *       Then, although noting how ``[w]ords derive their meaning      from what the speaker intends and what the reader      understands,'' the court declined to place too much      importance on intent because ``to fathom [the speaker's]      mental state would distract [the court] unnecessarily from      the speech itself.'' And, finally, although the Court refused      to foreclose resort to contextual considerations external to      the words themselves, it explained that external context must      necessarily be an ``ancillary'' consideration because it is      ``peripheral to the words themselves,'' and it pointedly      noted that such ``context cannot supply a meaning that is      incompatible with, or simply unrelated to, the clear import      of the words.''       Having established that the emphasis must always be on the      literal words of the communication, with little if any weight      accorded external contextual factors, the court proceeded to      outline what it considered to be ``a more comprehensive      approach to the delimitation of `express advocacy.' '' In so      doing, the court repeatedly emphasized that the message of      candidacy advocacy must appear in the speech, in the words,      of the communication if the expenditure of corporate funds      for that communication is to be prohibited:       The court's almost exclusive focus on ``speech,'' and      specifically ``speech'' defined as the literal words or text      of the communication, could not have been clearer. . . .       This standard can be broken into three main components.      First, even if it is not presented in the clearest, most      explicit language, speech is ``express'' for present purposes      if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous, suggestive of      only one plausible meaning. Second, speech may only be termed      ``advocacy'' if it presents a clear plea for action, and thus      speech that is merely informative is not covered by the Act.      Finally, it must be clear what action is advocated. Speech      cannot be ``express advocacy of the election or defeat of a      clearly identified candidate'' when reasonable minds could      differ as to whether it encourages a vote for or against a      candidate or encourages the reader to take some other [kind      of] action.       We emphasize that if any reasonable alternative reading of      speech can be suggested, it cannot be express advocacy      subject to the Act's disclosure requirements.  It is plain that the FEC has simply selected certain words and phrases from Furgatch that give the FEC the broadest possible authority to regulate political speech and ignored those portions of Furgatch quoted above, focusing on the words and text of the message. The ninth circuit did not use other soft language when describing the framework within which the express advocacy determination is to be made. Madam President, let me just say the case is replete with refutation of the Furgatch decision. Clearly, the Furgatch decision is not controlling when it comes to reaching a decision about the appropriateness of the language in the Snowe-Jeffords proposal.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the excerpts of this case that I was going to cite be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Excerpts       434(c) so as to prevent speech that is clearly intended to      affect the outcome of a federal election from escaping,      either fortuitously or by design, the coverage of the Act,''      id. at 862. Under the facts of the case, these broader      observations were obviously dicta.                           *   *   *   *   *       . . . to the extent that they do represent an intentional      departure by the Ninth Circuit from the standard set forth by      the Supreme Court in Buckley and MCFL, they were just that.                           *   *   *   *   *       Against this overwhelming weight of (and, in the case of      the Supreme Court decisions, dispositive) authority, the FEC      argued before the district court and before us the concededly      ``novel'' position, . . . that, even though the Christian      Action Network's advertisements did not include any explicit      words or language advocating Governor Clinton's defeat, the      expenditure of corporate funds for these advertisements      nonetheless violated section 441b because, considered as a      whole with the imagery, music, film footage, and voice      intonations, the advertisements' nonprescriptive language      unmistakably conveyed a message expressly advocating the      defeat of Governor Clinton. That is, the FEC argued the      position that ``no words of advocacy are necessary to      expressly advocate the election of a candidate,'' . . .                           *   *   *   *   *       Stripped of its circumlocution, the FEC's argument was (and      is) that the determination of whether a given communication      constitutes ``express advocacy'' depends upon all of the      circumstances, internal and external to the communication,      and could reasonably be considered to bear upon the      recipient's interpretation of the message. The right to      engage in political speech would turn on an interpretation of      the ``imagery'' employed by the speaker. . . . It would      depend upon the perceived ``charge'' of the ``rhetoric'' used      . . . and upon the timing of the communication . . . The      right would be contingent upon one's mere identity or      association, as the following exchange between the court and      FEC counsel reveals.       ``The Court: And [the advertisement is] only bad if you      believe that the voters disagree with the message about      homosexuality there. For those voters who agree with the      message, why is it a negative ad?       ``Mr. Kolker: Well, I think, I think it's clear to a      reasonable person that the Christian Action Network thinks      these things are bad . . . I think that the ardent gay rights      activist would view this ad as a message from the Christian      Action Network to vote against Clinton. That they believe his      views on homosexuals are wrong. . . .       ``The Court: That's only if you bring to the table an      understanding of what the Christian Action Network is:                           *   *   *   *   *       ``Mr. Kolker: It's a self-defined group using the label      Christian Action.''       The FEC thus argues that ``[w]hen included as part of the      message, the speaker's identity becomes part of the      communication itself, and what matters is not what the viewer      or the courts will infer about the speaker's intent, but what      a reasonable person, informed about the speaker's identity      (and thus potential biases and passions), understands the      communication to mean.''       . . . Under certain circumstances, as the following      exchange shows, the right could even be withdrawn merely      because the speaker expresses disagreement with a candidate      over a particular issue:       ``Mr. Kolker: . . . If all you're doing is mentioning an      issue to say that their candidate's position on it is wrong,      it is not a real discussion of the issue, the focus of the ad      is the candidate----       ``The Court: --So you can't link the candidate with the      issue, that's what----       ``Mr. Kolker: No, I think you can but not if all you're      doing is saying the candidate believes X and X is the wrong      position. . . .                           *   *   *   *   *       ``Mr. Kolker: [I]t's clear from the ad that the way that      final [rhetorical] question [in the television ad] forcefully      is spoken, that from the speaker's perspective, it's the      wrong vision. And what I'm saying is the candidate has a      position, he's wrong on the position. There's no real issue      discussion. It's just an attack on the candidate.'' Oral Arg.      Trans. at 15-16.       To quote the following passage, in which the FEC      articulates some of the multitude of factors that would be      considered under its interpretation in determining whether a      given communication was prohibited, is to appreciate the      breadth of power that the FEC would appropriate to itself      under its definition of ``express advocacy'':       ``[E]xpress electoral advocacy [can] consist[ ] not of      words alone, but of the combined message of words and      dramatic moving images, sounds, and other non-verbal cues      such as film editing, photographic techniques, and music,      involving highly charged rhetoric and provocative images      which, taken as a whole, sen[d] an unmistakable message to      oppose [a specific candidate].''       Opp. Mem. at 8. This is little more than an argument that      the FEC will know ``express advocacy'' when it sees it.       C.       The FEC's enforcement action against the Christian Action      Network in this case brings into relief the extent to which,      under the FEC's interpretation of ``express advocacy,''      political speech would become hostage to the vicissitudes of      the Commission, because, although a viewer could interpret      the Network's video as election advocacy of the defeat of      Governor Clinton, another viewer could just as readily      interpret the video as issue advocacy on the question of      homosexual rights. Indeed, the commercial and advertisements      that the FEC here contend fall squarely within its regulatory      purview are precisely the kinds of issue advocacy that the      Supreme Court sought to protect in Buckley and MCFL; and the      FEC's interpretation of these advertisements is exactly that      contemplated by the Court when it warned of the      constitutional pitfalls in subjecting a speaker's message to      the unpredictability of audience interpretation, . . .                           *   *   *   *   *       Yet, the FEC would have us confer power upon it to regulate      these advertisements because, in its assessment, ``[t]o the      ordinary viewer in 1992, the CAN video unmistakably      encourages voters to defeat Bill Clinton. The video      communicates the following: A group explicitly aligning      itself with Christian, heterosexual, and traditional family      values graphically depicts a specific presidential candidate      supporting homosexual men vividly asserting their sexual      preferences; the message attacks Clinton's moral judgment and      alleged policy agenda; those positions involve steps that      only a federal elected official could take; the message is      delivered to viewers who live in states where Governor      Clinton has no contemporaneous authority to set policy; the      message is televised shortly before the presidential      election; and the message employs powerful symbolism and      persuasive devices unique to the medium of video. . . . The      video admittedly contains no literal phrase such as ``Defeat      Bill Clinton.'' But it contains a special kind of charged      rhetoric and symbolism that exhorts more forcefully and      unambiguously than mere words.''       Appellant's Br. at 37-38. Or, because, in the words of the      ``expert'' whom the FEC retained to assist it in its action      against the Christian Action Network.       ``[T]his 30 second television spot expressly advocated the      defeat of candidates Clinton and Gore in the upcoming      presidential general election. It did so by employing the      techniques of audio voice-overs, music, visual text, visual      images, color, codewords, and editing. In their totality,      these techniques said voters should defeat Clinton and Gore      because these candidates favor extremist homosexuals and      extremist homosexuals are bad for America.''                           *   *   *   *   *       . . . the FEC's position was based not only ``on a      misreading of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Furgatah,'' but      also on a ``profound misreading'' of the Supreme Court's      decision in both Buckley and MCFL.       From the foregoing discussion of Buckley and MCFL, it is      indisputable that the Supreme Court limited the FEC's      regulatory authority to expenditures which, through explicit      words, advocate the election or defeat of a specifically      identified candidate. In the portion of Buckley in which the      Court addresses the overbreadth of the Federal Election      Campaign Act and adopts its limiting construction of section      608(e)(1)'s term ``relative to,'' the Court does not even use      the phrase ``express advocacy,'' upon the purported      ``ambiguity'' of which the FEC builds its diffuse definition.      In this most important portion of the opinion, cf. DNC Br. at      5, the     Court only refers to ``explicit words of advocacy,''      ``express terms'' and ``express words of advocacy.'' See      Buckley, 424 U.S. at 43-44. It is not until the Court      interprets the statutory term ``expenditure'' in section      434(e) to include the same limitation as in section      608(e)(1), forty pages later in the opinion, that the Court      even uses the phrase ``express advocacy,'' see id. at 80. But      even there, the Court confirms through footnote 108's cross-     reference to footnote 52, in which the Court lists the kinds      of words that would warrant exercise of the FEC's regulatory      authority, that it meant by the phrase ``express advocacy''      nothing more or less than ``express words of advocacy.'' In      other words, the Court itself in Buckley confirmed that it      intended the phrase ``express advocacy'' simply as a      shorthand for the ``explicit words of advocacy of election or      defeat'' ``of a clearly identified candidate for federal      office,'' which it had held earlier in the opinion were      required in order to save the Act from constitutional      infirmity.       Were this alone not sufficient to establish that the Court      meant by ``express advocacy'' ``express words of advocacy,''      then the Court's subsequent discussion in MCFL removes all      doubt. There, because it was interpreting the statutory term      ``expenditure,'' the Court cited to Buckley's discussion of      section 434(e), rather than to that case's discussion of      section 608(e)(1), and used the shorthand phrase ``express      advocacy.'' See MCFL, 479 U.S. at 248-49. The Court then went      on to define ``express advocacy,'' again through citation to      its footnote 52 in Buckley, to mean ``express words of      advocacy.'' See id. at 249 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44      n.52). It even stated that in Buckley it had concluded ``that      a finding of `express advocacy' depend[s] upon the use of      language such as `vote for,' `elect,' `support,' etc.'' MCFL,      479 U.S. at 249 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44 n.52)      (emphasis added).       The FEC is fully aware that the Supreme Court has required      explicit words of advocacy as a condition to the Commission's      exercise of power, as evidenced by its own dissembling before      this court.                           *   *   *   *   *       The FEC argues throughout its submissions that the Supreme      Court ``never suggested that communications can constitute      express advocacy only if they include specific words from a      special list.'' Appellant's Br. at 23. This is true, but it      is a red-herring. Most certainly, the Court never said this.      But, just as certainly, the Court never suggested that      communications with no words of advocacy at all can      nonetheless be considered ``express advocacy.'' In fact, as      we show, it actually held precisely the opposite.                           *   *   *   *   *       The agency even goes so far as to quote the very sentence      from page 80 of Buckley in which the Court uses the phrase      ``express advocacy'' and defines that phrase in the      sentence's footnote 108 to mean ``express words of      advocacy,''                           *   *   *   *   *       The FEC resorts to the same slight-of-hand in its      discussion of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Furgatch.      According to the FEC, the court of appeals in that case said      that ``courts must take care to avoid an unnecessarily narrow      application of express advocacy to prevent `eviscerating the      Federal Election Campaign Act.''' Appellant's Br. at 18. In      fact, what the Ninth Circuit said was that ``[a] test      requiring the magic words `elect,' `support,' etc., or their      nearly perfect synonyms for a finding of express advocacy      would preserve the First Amendment right of unfettered      expression only at the expense of eviscerating the Federal      Election Campaign Act.'' 807 F.2d at 863. In light of our      discussion herein, the difference is of enormous      significance.                           *   *   *   *   *       That the Commission knows well the Court's holdings in      Buckley and MCFL is further confirmed by the agency's      subsequent action in Furgatch, which we referenced supra at      8-11. Because Furgatch, despite its narrow holding, does      include broad dicta which can be read (or misread) to support      the FEC's expansive view of its authority, the agency      vigorously opposed certiorari in the case. Wishing to have      the opinion preserved intact, the Commission in its      submissions there, in contrast to its submissions before this      court, quoted Buckley as ``requir[ing] `explicit words of      advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.''' . . . The      Commission even took the position that Furgatch did, as we      noted above, interpret the Federal Election Campaign Act's      corporate disclosure statutes as ``narrowly limited to      communications containing language `susceptible to no other      reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote,'''       . . . Moreover, the FEC argued to the Supreme Court that      Furgatch was fully consistent with Buckley and MCFL precisely      because the opinion focused on the specific language of      Furgatch's advertisement and concluded that express advocacy      existed only because the advertisement ``explicitly      exhorted'' voters to defeat then-President Carter. Thus,      there is no doubt the Commission understands that its      position that no words of advocacy are required in order to      support its jurisdiction runs directly counter to Supreme      Court precedent.                           *   *   *   *   *       . . . the Supreme Court has unambiguously held that the      First Amendment forbids the regulation of our political      speech under such indeterminate standards. ``Explicit words      of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate,'' ``express      words of advocacy,'' the Court has held, are the      constitutional minima. To allow the government's power to be      brought to bear on less, would effectively be to dispossess      corporate citizens of their fundamental right to engage in      the very kind of political issue advocacy the First Amendment      was intended to protect--as this case well confirms.  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.
