 President, I rise today in strong support of the business tax provisions in this legislation. In particular, I want to speak about a tax item that I had an opportunity to help include in the legislation. People from my State of Iowa, and other farm States, have been actively seeking tax relief. This tax bill is a giant step in the right direction.  In particular, young farmers and all consumers will benefit from the inclusion of legislation that we call the Aggie Bond Improvement Act, S. 1674. Young farmers will benefit from the improved access to the farming profession. Consumers will benefit from the addition of a new generation of farmers into the profession that guarantees the flow of cheap food into our Nation's supermarkets.  Aggie bonds are tax exempt bonds used for first time farmers. I introduced the Aggie Bond Improvement Act with Senators Pressler, Baucus, and Moseley-Braun in order to improve the popular first time farmer programs administered by various state authorities. These authorities issue tax exempt bonds to finance loans for first time farmers. With the help of the authorities, these usually younger farmers must secure a participating private lender. This legislation protects the Government's interests because this is a Government and private sector partnership where the private sector lender assumes all of the risk.  However, problems exist in the current program, and this legislation corrects some of those problems. The biggest problem is that the current first time farmer program does not allow a young farmer to purchase the family farm. Because the success of our Nation's farming industry has followed from passing our farmland to succeeding generations, the current program discriminates against families and thereby discourages success.  Under current law, a son who is farming with his father, and meets certain eligibility tests, may qualify to use aggie bond financing to buy farmland from a stranger, but not from his father, or even his grandfather. Ironically, the father or grandfather could also use the aggie bond program to sell farmland to any qualified beginning farmers, as long as that farmer is not related to him. Thus, fathers or grandfathers and sons can use aggie bond financing, but not if the transaction involves the sale of the family farm from one generation to the next.  This imposes an unfair burden to family farms when compared to nonfarm family businesses. In nonfarm family businesses, such as manufacturing or retail businesses, inter-generational sales can use all of the tax and purchase benefits that are available in sales between unrelated parties. Thus, when purchasing the family business, children of nonfarm business persons compete fairly with the open market place.  However, children of farm families do not have a level playing field when compared to unrelated buyers. Instead, they have a huge financial burden on them. This is easily explained by the fact that they have to pay a higher rate of interest to get loans to buy the same farmland that unrelated persons can buy.  I will add that there is an aging generation of farmers on the land thatwould like to retire, but cannot because the next generation cannot afford the capital to buy the land. In my State of Iowa, and I think in most agricultural States, the average age of our farmers is in their upper fifties. In 5 to 6 years we will have 25 percent of our farmers wanting to retire. This legislation to improve the State aggie bond programs simply makes the necessary transactions possible. Though it is only a small provision in the greater bill, the aggie bond legislation in this Small Business Job Protection Act is extremely important to farm States and consumers alike. Therefore, the tax legislation in the Small Business Job Protection Act earns my resounding support.  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record after my remarks a letter that I received from a resident of Knoxville, IA. Her name is Leslie Miller, and I think that she does an outstanding job of quantifying and personalizing the importance of this aggie bond legislation.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Iowa State Savings Bank,                                      Knoxville, IA, July 8, 1996.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to express support for      H3448 because it contains provisions originally included in      your bill, S1674. The most important of these provisions      would expand the use of tax-exempt aggie bonds to include      financing the sale of farmland between related parties. These      important changes are needed to ease the financial burdens      involved with shifting family farming operations from one      generation to the next.       Iowa State Savings Bank has frequently used aggie bond      financing (through Iowa's Beginning Farmer Program) to lower      interest costs to beginning farmers. We have found this      program successful in helping young farmers acquire the base      they need to survive in farming. We have been frustrated that      this program has not been available to finance transactions      between related parties, particularly sales between parents      and children.       Under current law, a son who is farming with his father,      and meets certain eligibility tests, may qualify to use aggie      bond financing to buy farmland from a stranger, but not from      his father (or even his grandfather). Ironically, the father      (or grandfather) could also use the aggie bond program to      sell farmland to any qualified beginner farmer, as long as      that farmer is not related to him. Thus, fathers (or      grandfathers) and sons can use aggie bond financing, but not      if the transaction involves the sale of the family farm from      one generation to the next.       This inequity imposes an unfair burden to family farm      businesses when compared to family businesses that are non-     farm in nature. In non-farm family businesses, such as      manufacturing or retail businesses, inter-generational sales      can use all of the tax and purchase benefits that are      available in sales between non-related parties. Thus,      children of non-farm businesspersons compete fairly with the      open marketplace, when purchasing the family business.       However, children of farm families to do not have a ``level      playing field'' when compared to non-related buyers. Instead,      they have a huge financial burden placed on them that can be      best explained by the following examples. These examples use      average land values from the 1995 Iowa Land Value Survey,      released in December, 1995 by Iowa State University. The      values are based on estimates as of November 1, 1995, as      compiled by Mike Duffy, an extension economist in Farm      Management at ISU.       Example 1: Assume that a farmer wants to sell his 270 acre,      average-sized, Marion County farm. He prices the farm at      $1200 per acre (the county average price) which totals      $324,000. He is willing to take 20% down payment and will      finance the sale with a 25-year contract. If he sells this      farm using the aggie bond program, his interest is tax-     exempt, so he could charge about 6.5% interest. If he sells      the farm to his son, the interest cannot be tax-exempt, so he      will have to charge 9.03% interest (the higher interest is      needed for the father to receive the same amount of after-tax      money that he would get under the aggie bond program).       Under these conditions, the non-related buyer would pay the      father a total of $531,426 over the life of the contract. On      the other hand, the son would wind up paying $661,583 over      the life of the contract. This means the son would pay      $130,157 more to buy the farm, than a non-related person      would pay. The difference is an extra $5206 per year (or an      extra $19.28/acre per year), which places the son at a huge      financial disadvantage.       (Note: If the father charges his son the same 6.5% interest      rate, then he must sell the farm to his son for $1386/acre to      get the same after-tax dollars from his 25-year contract.)       Example 2: Assume the same size farm, but use the Iowa      state average of $1,455/acre. This brings the purchase price      to $392,850. Also assume a 20% down payment and a 25-year      contract. Under these conditions, a non-related buyer, paying      6.5% interest will pay $644,353 over the life of the      contract. A son, paying a taxable 9.03% interest, will pay      $802,169 over the life of the contract. Thus, the son would      pay $157,816 more than a non-related person would pay for the      same farm. This is a difference of $6,313, per year (or      $23.38/acre per year). Again, the extra dollars make it      difficult for the son to survive in farming.       We believe that the changes proposed in H3448 will affect      15 to 18% of our borrowers. This number can only increase as      other children recognize that it may be possible for them to      buy their family farm. H3448 can also be of immediate benefit      to farmers in poor health, who are reluctant to sell their      farm to strangers, but might sell it to a child willing to      start farming.       We ask that you share the information in this letter with      those who would not support the changes proposed in H3448.      Thank you, once again, for your diligent work on behalf of      beginning farmers and farm families everywhere.           Sincerely,                                                 Leslie S. Miller,                                                   Vice President.                  contributions in aid of construction
