President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch today in offering this bill to increase criminal penalties against those who monopolize or restrict the market using unfair and illegal business practices.  In an age that combines robust levels of international trade with the threats of Enron-style accounting, we must be increasingly vigilant to the threats of white-collar crime to our economy. Legitimate business can only thrive when bad actors realize that violations of antitrust law will be met with the strictest of penalties. Our bill increases the maximum sentence for a violation of the Sherman antitrust laws from 3 to 10 years. Fines to corporations are increased tenfold to a maximum of $100 million per infraction. This increase will make it clear to corporate wrongdoers that no antitrust violation is affordable. These changes bring antitrust penalties in line with other white-collar crimes and send a clear message that the United States will not allow any company to abuse its consumers by misusing market power.  Our bill also repeals an old and rarely used provision, the Antidumping Act of 1916. Congress must eliminate this provision in order to come into compliance with a ruling by the World Trade Organization. The U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Justice both support the repeal of this act, and indeed have made a joint request for such legislation to the Congress.  I am pleased to have worked with the chairman on this important legislation and urge my colleagues to support this bill.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the joint request by the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Justice.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, the United States            Trade Representative,                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2001.     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,     President of the Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting the enclosed draft      bill to repeal a provision of law enacted on September 8,      1916, regarding prevention of unfair methods of competition      (15 U.S.C. Sec. 72, c. 463, Title VIII, Sec. 801, 39 Stat.      798). That provision provides for a private right of action      for treble damages, as well as for criminal penalties in an      action brought by the U.S. government, for international      price discrimination.       The Administration proposes repeal of this provision      because it is redundant of other U.S. laws providing remedies      for international price discrimination. To our knowledge,      during the past 85 years no plaintiff has obtained a final      judgment on the merits under this rarely-invoked law and no      government enforcement action has been taken. Furthermore,      this provision is inconsistent with the obligations of the      United States under the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the      World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement).       We would appreciate it if you would lay the draft bill      before the Senate. An identical proposal is being transmitted      to the Speaker of the House.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection to the presentation of this proposal to      Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the      program of the President.           Sincerely,     John Ashcroft,       Attorney General.     Robert B. Zoellick,       United States Trade Representative.                                 ______                                       By
