 President, it is not just the AARP that holds that view. It is dozens and dozens of senior organizations all across the country. Let me read very briefly from a letter written by the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, dated October 9, 2014. It is a letter that goes to the President--to President Obama. What it says is:       We urge you to include a non-controversial, commonsense      legislative adjustment in your 2016 budget for Congress to      temporarily reallocate the Social Security payroll      contributions to address the anticipated shortfall in the      Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. We also      strongly urge you to reject proposals to cut Social Security      benefits, coverage, or eligibility.  That is the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations.  I ask unanimous consent that letter also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, Debra B.            Whitman, Chair,                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2014.     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Obama: On behalf of the Leadership Council      of Aging Organizations (LCAO), a coalition of national not-     for-profit organizations representing over 60 million older      Americans, we write to ask you to maintain a vital part of      our Social Security system in your 2016 budget proposal. We      urge you to include a non-controversial, commonsense      legislative adjustment in your 2016 budget for Congress to      temporarily reallocate the Social Security payroll      contributions to address the anticipated shortfall in the      Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. We also      strongly urge you to reject proposals to cut Social Security      benefits, coverage, or eligibility.       Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) fund reserves      are projected to be depleted in 2016, at which point revenue      coming into the system would cover only 80% of benefits. This      projected shortfall is not a surprise and Congress should      rebalance income across the Social Security Trust Funds, as      it has done 11 times before, to cover the anticipated      shortfall. As Treasury Secretary Lew stated in July, ``it's      going to be important for there to be legislation that does      reallocate the payroll tax to support the disability fund.''       A modest, temporary reallocation of part of Social      Security's 6.2% tax rate from the Old-Age and Survivors      Insurance (OASI) fund to the DI fund would put both funds on      an equal footing. Congress has rebalanced tax rates between      the two funds 11 times since the DI trust fund was      established in 1956. About half the time Congress increased      the share going to the OASI fund and about half the time it      increased the share for DI. Congress has never failed to act      when it was necessary to rebalance the two funds, and it has      consistently done so in a bipartisan basis. It is time to do      so again, and can be done today without compromising the      ability of the overall Social Security program to pay full      benefits from both trust funds for the next 20 years.       When Congress acted to rebalance the two funds in 1994, it      was clear it would have to take action again in 2016. The      1995 Social Security Trustees Report showed that the DI      reserves would be depleted in 2016, primarily due to a rapid,      but temporary, increase in the number of DI beneficiaries as      baby boomers passed through their 50s and early 60s when the      risk of disability is greatest.       The typical DI beneficiary is in his or her late 50s.      Seventy percent are over age 50, and 30 percent are 60 or      older. These beneficiaries depend on Social Security for a      significant portion of their income. Without benefits, fifty-     five percent of families with a disabled worker would have      incomes below the poverty line. And, since the benefits they      receive continue as they grow older, the DI program helps to      ensure that these disabled workers don't fall into poverty as      they age.       Another factor that has led to an increase in the number of      DI beneficiaries is a rise in the full retirement age. When      DI beneficiaries reach Social Security's full retirement age,      they begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits      rather than DI. The increase in the full retirement age to 66      has delayed that conversion. In December 2013, more than      450,000 people between ages 65 and 66--over 5 percent of DI      beneficiaries--collected DI benefits. Under the rules in      place until 2003, they would have received retirement      benefits instead. This is just one example of how closely the      retirement and disability components of Social Security are      interwoven.       The growth in DI is leveling off as boomers enter      retirement and shift to OASI benefits. The need to rebalance      by 2016 reflects a long-anticipated, but temporary, shift in      the funding requirements of the two funds. Rebalancing would      not affect the long-term financing of the combined Social      Security system, which would remain solvent through 2033.      Rebalancing can and should be done without cutting benefits      or narrowing coverage or eligibility. This sensible action      will give policymakers ample time to strengthen Social      Security for the long-term.       For these reasons, the undersigned organizations urge you      to include a legislative proposal to rebalance the Social      Security funds in your 2016 budget, and to exclude proposals      to cut Social Security benefits, coverage or eligibility.
