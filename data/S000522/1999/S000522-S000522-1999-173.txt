Mr. Speaker, when information reached me that the Clinton administration is working hard at the United Nations to undermine and to utterly trash the role of parents throughout the world, I was outraged. Five years ago at the Cairo Population Control Conference Al Gore led an unsuccessful effort to get abortion on demand throughout pregnancy declared an international right. Now Bill Clinton and Al Gore's hand-picked negotiators at this week's 5-year follow-up meeting on the Cairo conference are at it again. They are formally pushing to delete from the proposed implementation document the only two references urging, quote, respect for the rights, duties and responsibilities of parents in the critical areas of sex education and reproductive care for adolescents.                              {time}  1030  Ironically, while these anti-parent proposals are being aggressively pushed at the U.N., the House is poised to takeup legislation to protect minor children from abortion through parental notification or consent. Despite broad support for the bill and wide recognition of the unique importance of parents, this administration is threatening to veto this legislation.  Now, by their delegates' activities at the U.N., Bill Clinton and Al Gore are demonstrating that they are not satisfied with undermining parental rights at home. They want to impose this policy on foreign nations abroad.                          ____________________
