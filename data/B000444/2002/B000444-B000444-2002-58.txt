 President, I rise today to call attention to Section 2202 of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act which directs the President--in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Education--to review all Federal drug andsubstance abuse treatment, prevention, education and research programs and make recommendations about how to ``streamline, consolidate, coordinate, simplify, and more effectively conduct and deliver'' these services.
