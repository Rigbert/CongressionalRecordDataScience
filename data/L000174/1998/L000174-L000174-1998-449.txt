President, I tell my friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, we have a matter that I think has been somewhat of a regional and local controversy about to be worked out. I advise the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I think within a matter of minutes we will be able to move on that.  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
