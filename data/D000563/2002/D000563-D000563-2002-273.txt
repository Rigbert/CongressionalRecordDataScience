He was the negotiator, the one who put together this legislation with President Bush and the White House. Aren't we also imposing some obligations on school districts across America to have more teachers certified in certain subjects so that they will teach math and science, for example, computer skills, because they also have the skills and training to do it? Aren't we saying to school districts in the next few years, we want you to have more and more certified teachers, qualified teachers, standing in the classrooms?  I hear that when I get back to Chicago in the State of Illinois. They say: That is a good goal. We want to meet that goal. But understand that takes an investment in teacher education and training; that takes resources for the school district to attract these good teachers and keep them. Aren't we, in the Bush bill, Leave No Child Behind, creating a goal of more certified teachers in the classroom and then in the Bush budget not putting in the money to achieve that goal?
