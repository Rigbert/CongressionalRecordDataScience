I rise today to recognize and honor one of those individuals: Richard ``Dick'' Scott Alden. Dick passed away at his home on Monday, September 20, 2010. He will be deeply missed.  Dick Alden was born July 27, 1931, in Hibbing, Minnesota and is the son of Alvin and Verne Alden. As a young man his family moved to Pasadena, California. Dick was a student in the Pasadena school system and upon graduation, served honorably in the United States Air Force.  After his service in the Air Force, Dick earned his college degree from Woodbury Business School in Los Angeles. He began working for Union Oil and later moved his young family to Riverside acquiring what eventually became Empire Oil Company.  During his active life in Riverside, Dick, along with building Empire Oil into a major petroleum and chemical distributor, devoted his time and resources to a number of community-based charitable organizations. He also was active in Republican politics and various local sports programs. Dick was known for his generosity to many charitable organizations and those who know him remember his sense of humor.  Mr. Alden is survived by his son Eric Alden of Huntington Beach and wife Martha; Daughter Michelle Fisher of Aliso Viejo; Daughter-in-law Ann Alden of Riverside; five grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Also surviving are Dick's sister Barbara Meza of San Clemente and a brother Gayle Alden of Auburn, Washington. Dick was preceded in death by his son Scott, who played an important role in the building of Empire Oil, and by his granddaughter Jennifer Stevens. Dick was especially impacted by the death of his son and granddaughter, two individuals that were remarkable in their own right. Dick will be buried in Olivewood Memorial Park, the same cemetery where Scott and Jennifer were laid to rest.  On October 2, 2010, a memorial service celebrating Dick's extraordinary life will be held at the Salvation Army Chapel in Riverside. Dick will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, love of family, and sense of humor. His dedication to his family and community, especially the Salvation Army, are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Dick's family and friends; although Dick may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
