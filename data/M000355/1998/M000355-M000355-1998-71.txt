 President, in fact, I ask the Senator from Utah, was it not envisioned by the framers of our Constitution and the founders of this country that America would, in fact, be a seething caldron of interest groups, all of which would enjoy the first amendment right to petition the Congress; that is, to lobby, to involve themselves in political campaigns, and to try to influence, in the best sense of the word, the Government? And in today's America where the Government takes $1.7 trillion a year out of the economy, I ask my friend from Utah, is it not an enduring and important principle that the citizens should be able to have some influence on the political process and the government that may affect their lives?
