President, this is an amendment that can derail and even kill this bill--a bill that would otherwise help our recovering economy, unleash innovation and create the jobsthat are so desperately needed. I have worked for years against Patent Office fee diversion, but oppose this amendment at this time. Its formulation was rejected by the House of Representatives, and there is no reason to believe that the House's position will change. Instead, for ideological purity, this amendment can sink years of effort and destroy the job prospects represented by this bill. So while I oppose fee diversion, I also oppose the Coburn amendment.  I kept my commitment to Senator Coburn and included his preferred language in the managers' amendment which the Senate considered last March. The difference between then and now is that the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives rejected Senator Coburn's formulation. They preserved the principle against fee diversion but changed the language.  The language in the bill is that which the House devised and a bipartisan majority voted to include. It was worked out by the House Republican leadership to satisfy House rules. The provision Senator Coburn had drafted and offers again with his amendment today apparently violates House Rule 21, which prohibits converting discretionary spending into mandatory spending. So instead of a revolving fund, the House established a reserve fund. That was the compromise that the Republican House leadership devised between Chairmen Smith, Rogers and Ryan. Yesterday I inserted in the Record the June letter for Congressmen Rogers and Ryan to Chairman Smith of the House Judiciary Committee. Today I ask consent to insert into the Record the commitment letter from Chairman Rogers to Speaker Boehner.  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, continues to make important improvements to ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are used for Patent and Trademark Office activities. That office is entirely fee-funded and does not rely on taxpayer dollars. It has been and continues to be subject to annual appropriations bills. That allows Congress greater opportunity for oversight.  The legislation that passed the Senate in March would have taken the Patent and Trademark Office out of the appropriations process, by setting up a revolving fund that would have allowed the office to set fees and collect and spend money without appropriations legislation and congressional oversight. Instead of a revolving fund, the House formulation against fee diversion establishes a separate account for the funds and directs that they be used for U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The House Appropriations Chairman has committed to abide by that legal framework.  The House forged a compromise. Despite what some around here think, that is the essence of the legislative process. The Founders knew that when they wrote the Constitution and included the Great Compromise. Ideological purity does not lead to legislative enactments. This House compromise can make a difference and make real progress against fee diversion. It is something we can support and there are many, many companies and organizations that do support this final workout in order to get the bill enacted without further delay, as do I.  The America Invents Act, as passed by the House, creates a new Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund (the ``Reserve Fund'') into which all fees collected by the USPTO in excess of the amount appropriated in a fiscal year are to be deposited. Fees in the Reserve Fund may only be used for the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office. Through the creation of the Reserve Fund, as well as the commitment by House appropriators, H.R. 1249 makes important improvements in ensuring that user fees collected for services are used by the Patent and Trademark Office for those services.  Voting for the Coburn amendment is a vote to kill this bill. It could kill the bill over a formality--the difference between a revolving fund and a reserve fund. It would require the House to reconsider the whole bill again. They spent days and weeks working out their compromise in good faith. And it was worked out by the House Republican leadership. There is no reason to think they will reconsider and allow the original Coburn language to violate their rules and avoid oversight. They have already rejected that language, the very language proposed by the Coburn amendment.  We should not kill this bill over this amendment. We should reject the amendment and pass the bill. The time to put aside individual preferences and ideological purity is upon us and we need to legislate. That is what the American people elected us to do and expect us to do. The time to enact this bill is now. Vote no on the Coburn amendment.  I have listened to the Senator from Oklahoma, and no matter what we say about it, his is an amendment that can derail and even kill this bill. He expresses concern as to why the bill should be sought because somebody objects to the bill. I sometimes ask myself that question. Of course, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has objected to many items going forward on his own behalf, but this is an amendment that could derail or even kill the bill. This is a bill that would otherwise help our recovering economy to unleash innovation, create the jobs so desperately needed.  I probably worked longer in this body than anybody against Patent Office fee diversion. As the Senator from Oklahoma knows, I put a provision in the managers' package to allow the fees to go to the Patent Office. Now it is a lobby to keep that in in the other body. Its formulation was rejected by the House of Representatives.  There is no reason to believe the House position will change. I checked with both the Republican and Democratic leaders over there. There is no reason to believe their position will change, but we insist on ideological purities--including something I would like. The amendment would take years of effort, destroy the job prospects represented by this bill. While I oppose the fee diversion, I also oppose this amendment.  Does this bill have every single thing in it I want? No. We could write 100 patent reform legislations in this body where each one of us has every single thing we want, and we would have 100 different bills. We only have one. It does not have all the things I like, but that is part of getting legislation passed.  I did keep my commitment to Senator Coburn. I kept his language in the managers' amendment, and I caught a lot for doing that--I am a member of the Appropriations Committee--but I kept it in there. The difference between then and now is that the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives rejected Senator Coburn's formulation. They preserved the principle against fee diversion but changed the language. In doing that, however, it is not a total rejection. They actually tried to work out a compromise. The language of the bill, which the House devised--a bipartisan majority voted to include--was worked out by the House Republican leadership to satisfy the House rules.  The provision that Senator Coburn has drafted and offers, again, with his amendment today apparently violates House rule 21 which prohibits converting discretionary spending into mandatory spending.  What the House did--and actually accomplished what both Senator Coburn and I and others want--instead of a revolving fund was to establish the reserve fund. That was the compromise that the Republican House leadership devised between Chairman Smith, Chairman Rogers, and Chairman Ryan.  Yesterday, I inserted into the Record the June letter from Congressmen Rogers and Ryan to Chairman Smith to the House Judiciary Committee.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the commitment letter from Chairman Rogers to Speaker Boehner.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2011.     Hon. John Boehner,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Eric Cantor,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor: I write regarding      provisions in H.R. 1249, The America Invents Act, affecting      funding of the Patent Trademark Office (PTO). Following      constructive discussions with Chairman Smith of the Judiciary      Committee, this legislation now includes language that will      preserve Congress' ``power of     the purse,'' under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the      Constitution. The language ensures: the PTO budget remains      part of the annual appropriations process; all PTO collected      fees will be available only for PTO services and activities      in support of the fee paying community; and finally, this      important agency will continue to be subject to oversight and      accountability by the Congress on an annual basis.       To assure that all fees collected for PTO remain available      for PTO services, H.R. 1249 provides that if the actual fees      collected by the PTO exceed its appropriation for that fiscal      year, the amount would continue to be reserved only for use      by the PTO and will be held in a ``Patent Trademark Fee      Reserve Fund''.       At the same time, consistent with the language included in      H.R. 1249, the Committee on Appropriations will also carry      language that will ensure that all fees collected by PTO in      excess of its annual appropriated level will be available      until expended only to PTO for support services and      activities in support of the fee paying community, subject to      normal Appropriations Committee oversight and review.       I look forward to working with the relevant stakeholders in      efficiently implementing this new process.       I believe this approach will help U.S. innovators remain      competitive in today's global economy and this in turn will      contribute to significant job creation here in the United      States, while holding firm to the funding principles outlined      in the Constitution.           Sincerely,                                                    Harold Rogers,                      Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations.
