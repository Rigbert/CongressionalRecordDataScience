 No, I am not a lawyer. I was a preschool teacher, and one of the things I do know is that I wanted my students to know it is not OK to bully. You have to take a pause and do what is right.  But let me tell you, what I would want for every one of the kids I have ever taught in preschool is to know that if anything they deeply care about--an issue or they themselves--ever appears in a court, then they should feel, in the United States of America, that they would be given a fair shot, and win or lose, the judge presiding over them would leave them with that feeling at the end of the day. That, to me, is why temperament is so important.  If Americans lose the sense that no matter who they are or what their issue is or where they come from or how much money they make in our court of law, they stand a chance to be heard, even if they lose or if they win--that is why temperament is so important to me as a nonlawyer and someone who cares deeply about this country.
