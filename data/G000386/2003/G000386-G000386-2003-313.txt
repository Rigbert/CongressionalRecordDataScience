 But the fact is, CMS has told us it is physically impossible to get this benefit up and running in the year 2004. Now, knowing that, we have provided a prescription drug discount card, starting on January 1, 2004, in order to get immediate relief from the high cost of prescriptions for our seniors.  The amendment would spend close to $24 billion in fiscal year 2004--the amendment that is before us--and that is money that is not in the budget. We deal with the needs of our seniors in a fair way with this bill, the discount card, and the $600 help for them for each of the next 2 years. So I urge my colleagues to take all this into consideration and oppose the amendment.  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
