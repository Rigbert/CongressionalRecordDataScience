Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I want to give an example of why this bill is necessary. Again, there is a differentiation between what Republicans and Democrats are saying here. The Democrats want to have a victim first before somebody is deported. Republicans want to make sure that there isn't a victim by making them excludable and, if they are caught, kicking them out.  So let's talk about domestic violence. On Monday, 2 days ago, the strangled and battered body of an as yet unidentified woman was found in a subdivision about 20 miles south of Denver. An orange tow rope was found around her neck, and her face was unrecognizable. Preliminary autopsy results indicated that the woman died of asphyxiation and head injuries after being dragged along a road for more than a mile.  A suspect was arrested Tuesday night in that case. Jose Luis Rubi-Nava, age 36, is being held without bail on a first degree murder charge at the Douglas County, Colorado, jail. The New York Times reported this morning that Mr. Rubi-Nava is an illegal immigrant. News reports suggest that the victim was his girlfriend.  Records obtained by KUSA-TV, the Denver NBC affiliate, showed that Rubi-Nava was arrested on April 1 and charged with false identification and driving without a driver's license and proof of insurance, but was let go.  If local law enforcement had detained this illegal immigrant for ICE, he could have been removed from the United States. He was not, and now there is a woman that is dead. If this bill had been law and there had been a voluntary agreement between local law enforcement and the Federal Government, this horrible crime could have been avoided.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
