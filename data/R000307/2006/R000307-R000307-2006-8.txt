President, today I congratulate a Kansan, and a friend, Earl McVicker, whose hard work, perseverance, and dedication has earned him recognition by those in his profession. Last month, Earl, who started his banking career at a bank in a town of 400, was elected chairman of the American Bankers Association. I join his friends, family, and colleagues in extending my congratulations and best wishes to him during the upcoming year.  Earl's career in the banking industry began shortly after his graduation from Kansas State University, home of the always optimistic and fighting Wildcats. Although Earl earned an engineering degree from K-State, he had taken a few business classes and a course on rural banking, which captured his interest. His first job was at the Bazine State Bank. Earl worked hard, learning the banking business from the ground up. His strong work ethic paid off, and he rose steadily in the banking industry, moving on to banks in Colorado and Kansas before becoming CEO of Central Bank and Trust, in Hutchinson, KS. By this time, Earl was looking for more than just another job at another bank. He was looking for the opportunity to make policy decisions, and he knew the only way to achieve that was to buy a bank.  Well, Earl succeeded in this goal, in part, by doing something we should all take a lesson from. When he became CEO at CB&T, he made the decision that he would continue to live off the amount of his previous salary and save and invest the difference in order to buy CB&T stock. This self-discipline, along with some help from his parents and a loan from another bank, allowed Earl to continue buying stock in CB&T, eventually gaining majority ownership. Further, the loan that he took out, that he hoped to pay off in 10 years? He paid it off in 5. Earl acknowledges that he risked everything on this one venture, but it is certainly a risk that has paid off.  Perhaps the quote that Earl has framed and hanging in his office best sums up what guides him. The quote, by President Calvin Coolidge, reads: ``Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan `press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.''  Earl's own hard work, persistence, and willingness to take risks gives him an understanding and an empathy for people who are looking to start and own their own business. His commitment to promoting entrepreneurship, his willingness to help individuals start a business, and his ability to recognize the potential of these individuals, even those who may not have business experience, makes him unique and reminds us all of the important role hometownbanks play in a community. They understand the needs of the customers, their community, and know that their role in helping individuals and businesses succeed is vital to economic health.  Now, I don't want to leave you with the impression that Earl is just another skilled businessman, although over the past 14 years, his private investment company, Central Financial Corp., has grown to include banks in a dozen States and has outperformed Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, as well as the Dow and the S&P 500. In fact, Earl wears several hats, including a Stetson when he is out horseback riding with his wife Molly or helping out on his parent's farm near Ness City. And he's particularly fond of the motorcycle helmet that he wears when he takes his Harley for a ride up to Sturgis, SD. Maybe not what you expected from the incoming ABA chairman.  Earl has reached a milestone in his career, but in this success, he has also helped others succeed in starting and growing their businesses and has taken an active role in helping communities like Hutchinson thrive. I am proud to call Earl a friend. I know he will approach his year as chairman of the ABA by expanding his ``commitment to community'' philosophy throughout the country. It is this commitment, working as a partner with his community, that has made him a leader in the banking profession.                          ____________________[Pages S10963-S10964]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       RECOGNIZING EARL MCVICKER
