Mr. Speaker, it is our sacred responsibility to make sure that all of our children have an equal opportunity to learn. But today I rise to express my deep concern that the Republican leadership does not share this commitment. While Democrats have been working night and day to improve education, to put more teachers in our schools and to reduce class sizes, the Republican leadership have been trying to take money out of the schools and away from the majority of this country's children.  The Republican plan is not just. The Republican plan is not right. We should be building up our schools, not knocking them down. For the sake of our children, all of our children, we must fight for our schools.                          ____________________
