 Unfortunately, once again, instead of standing up for workers, some of my Republican colleagues are bound and determined to defend the biggest corporations that have an interest in keeping wages low and denying workers a voice to improve their workplace.  President Obama vetoed this resolution. I urge my colleagues to sustainthat veto to ensure workers are able to exercise that right. The National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, helps to ensure that workers have a fair up-or-down-vote. Unfortunately, too often big corporations take advantage of loopholes in the current election process to delay a vote on union representation.  The NLRB was absolutely right to carry out its mission to review and streamline its election process to bring down those barriers for workers who want a fair vote. These updates will make modest but important changes to modernize and streamline the process. They will reduce unnecessary litigation on issues that will not affect the outcome of the election. The new process will bring the election process into the 21st century by letting employers and unions file forms electronically. Instead of attacking workers who just want a voice in the workplace, I hope my colleagues will support President Obama's veto.  I truly hope we can break through the gridlock and work together on policies that do create jobs and expand economic security and generate broad-based economic growth for workers and families--not just the wealthiest few.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
