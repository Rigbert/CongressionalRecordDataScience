Speaker, I regret to inform you I have been unavoidably detained, due to airline transportation delays, and will not be present for votes today, April 7, 2003.  However, if I had been present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall vote Nos. 109, 110, and 111.                          ____________________
