 What my friend from Connecticut is talking about is poll workers; in other words, workers who will go work for one candidate or another. We know Federal employees are overwhelmingly Democratic, Federal employee unions are overwhelmingly on the Democratic side.  In effect, what the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting is that Federal union employees be given a paid holiday by the taxpayers of the United States to go out and work for Democratic officials on election day. I strongly urge this amendment be defeated.
