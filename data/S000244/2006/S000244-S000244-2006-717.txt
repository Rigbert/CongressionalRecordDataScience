Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, the leader on the Democratic side has given two speeches. The speeches are supposedly in support of the bill, but then there is a whole long list of problems with it. Now we cannot make the perfect the enemy of the good when we are trying to protect children.  This is a bill that gives school districts the tool to get additional information on people who might try to harm children. So I think our committee has done a very good job in considering this legislation and making it not maybe a perfect bill but a very, very good one. We do not need a conference. We ought to pass it today, and then the other body ought to pass it and let's get on with it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller).
