Speaker, this Congress is faced with a very imperfect situation, a President who has deeply disgraceed our Nation and an independent prosecutor who has compromised the integrity of the investigative process.                              {time}  2145  The damage both men have rendered is strewn across the American landscape, and now the Committee on the Judiciary of this House has produced a one-sided, rampantly partisan option for this membership to consider.  Healing our Nation must be the paramount consideration of this body, and our people must be spared from further division. Even though it appears that President Clinton lied under oath, which could be a high crime, proving perjury in a court of law is a highly technical legal matter not easily established.  On the other hand, a Senate trial would not require the same level of judicial proof, but it is unlikely the Senate will be able to assemble a working supermajority for any of the impeachment charges.  The House of its own accord can act to resolve this situation assigning proper penalties and punishments butlikely will fail to do so placing this entire matter in the netherworld between the Senate, unlikely to reach a conclusion and a legal system in which wrongdoing will be difficult to prove.  Our Nation needs to move forward. I am left with no option but to vote against the committee's recommendations in spite of my disdain for the President's actions.  Mr. Speaker, this Congress is faced with a very imperfect situation.  A President who has deeply disgraced our Nation, and an independent prosecutor who has compromised the integrity of the investigative process. The damage both men have rendered is strewn across the American landscape. Now, the Judiciary Committee of this House has produced a one-sided, rampantly partisan option for the membership to consider.  Healing our Nation must be the paramount consideration of this body. The American people must be spared from further divisions.  Even though it appears President Clinton lied under oath which would be a high crime, proving perjury in a court of law is a highly technical legal matter not easily established. On the other hand, a Senate trial would not require the same level of judicial proof, but it is unlikely the Senate will be able to assemble a working supermajority for any of the impeachment charges.  The House of its own accord can act to resolve this situation, assigning proper penalties and punishments, but likely will fail to do so, placing this entire matter in the netherworld between a Senate unlikely to reach a conclusion and a legal system in which wrong doing will be difficult to prove. To drag our nation through further partisan wrangling in the Senate seems very unwise.  [Thus] I conclude further Congressional deliberations on this set of charges are not in the nation's interests. Though the charges against President Clinton are serious, they are best adjudicated in the courts where regular rules of evidence and due process apply. Since other alternatives are not available to this House as a result of the Judiciary Committee's flawed proceedings, I am left with no option but to vote against the Committee's recommendation, in spite of my disdain for the Presidents' actions and his failure to take responsibility for them. Our Nation needs to move forward.  Mindful of the strongly divided opinion of the American people and citizens of my home district regarding the pending set of votes on the four Articles of Impeachment against President Bill Clinton, it is my obligation to state publicly my reasons for voting as I will today. In this regard, partisanship is irrelevant. Personalities are irrelevant. Healing our nation must be paramount. Carrying out the nation's regular business must proceed. In regard to the Clinton charges, we must respect the rule of law, administer it to preserve the integrity of the Constitution, and recommend proper judicial proceedings to resolve the matter at hand. Throughout this process, I have weighted: ``To what extent do the President's actions, along with those of the investigative processes that have led to our current predicament in the House, undermine or strengthen the Constitutional standards I am sworn to uphold?'' In an expeditious manner, we must resolve this situation in the nation's best interests. I believe the nation must be spared further divisions on this matter.                              the process  President Bill Clinton has deeply disgraced our nation by his conduct, and unwillingness to assume responsibility for his actions. Over one year ago, he should have exercised a more honorable course and spared our nation the wrenching that has affected every family in America and politically split the nation into two warring camps. Further, the behavior of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and his careless, and at times willful manipulation of the investigative process, has compromised the integrity of these proceedings, leaving the American people and this Congress divided. Neither of these men has acted in the national interest. The damage they have rendered is strewn across our landscape. Likewise, the Judiciary Committee in its deliberations has been rampantly partisan. The recommendations it has produced for House consideration are one-sided and only partly represent the courses of action deemed worthy of debate by the full House. So we are left with a very imperfect situation.  President Clinton will have much accounting to do in the years hence. I have concluded in the national interest that final resolution of any legal charges against him is best left in the courts. Here he should be afforded a fair and impartial trial by jury where proper rules of evidence apply, outside the limelight that has convoluted this entire process. Any penalties and punishments placed on the President should be commensurate with proven charges.  Regarding the role of the Independent Prosecutor, and the behavior of Mr. Staff and his investigators, no instrumentality of our government should be above the law. Accordingly, many questions arise as to the propriety and fairness of the Independent Prosecutor's investigative proceedings to date, as well as about the raw partisanship of the Judiciary Committee's deliberations. By whose authority and under what constraints were key witnesses wired and testimony obtained by the Independent Prosecutor? Why were there so many leaks of privileged information from the grand jury--everything from the evidence about the blue dress to a broadened investigation that began with Whitewater but led to the investigation of the President's personal affairs? In Ohio, breaches of grand jury secrecy are prosecutable. Mr. Starr's own ethics advisor Sam Dash resigned over concerns that the Independent Counsel had exceeded his mandate to simply report to Congress on any impeachable offenses he discovered. Dash said he had ``no other choice but to resign'' because of the independent counsel's abuse of office. Much of the behavior of the Independent Prosecutor was as irresponsible as the President's, and both have led to public cynicism about the integrity of our political and judicial systems. Accordingly, Congress immediately should examine the procedures employed by Mr. Starr to gain evidence and administer the duties of his office. He and future Independent Prosecutors should be held accountable for the breaches of integrity associated with the investigative process.                             legal options  I hold the highest respect for our nation's judicial system. It is my duty to uphold it against all enemies foreign and domestic. My job includes preventing its abuse. In this regard, President Bill Clinton has much accounting to do. Yet, in spite of President Clinton's egregious, dishonorable, irresponsible and, yes, alleged criminal behavior, he should not be held to either a higher nor a lower standard than any American in the administration of justice. He deserves his day in court with a judge and jury sworn to administer justice fairly. But as President, it is not unfair for us to expect more of him and hold him to a higher moral standard.  In my judgment, the crimes of which President Clinton is accused do not meet the Constitutional standard for conviction based on ``bribery, treason, or high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Though his dishonorable behavior has wounded our nation's moral sensibilities and, tragically, he has reduced the honor associated with the office of President--and, in fact, elected office as a profession--in my judgment these circumstances do not rise to a ``high crime'' against the state as such, as I read the Constitution.  However, reading the Starr Referral and the Committee documents and studying the law has convinced me that the perjury charges are the most serious rendered against the President. They go to the heart of our judicial system's foundation--telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' Perjury is a felony, a crime against the state, and strikes at the core of our judicial system. By his moral position as the secular leader of our nation, President Clinton sets a standard, whether he wishes so nor not. Even though it appears President Clinton lied under oath, proving in a court of law that he perjured himself if a highly technical legal matter not easily proven. In a court of law, proving such would be fraught with inference, innuendo, in the end likely yielding not enough proof with corroborating witnesses to convict on the basis of perjury. On the other hand, a Senate trial would not require the same level of judicial proof, thus holding the possibility of placing penalties and punishments on the President commensurate with proven charges of damage to the republic. However, it is unlikely the Senate will be able to assembly a working majority for any of the impeachment charges. The House of its own accord could have acted in order to resolve this situation, assigning proper penalties and punishments, but will fail to do so, placing this entire matter in the netherworld between a Senate unlikely to reach a conclusion and a legal system in which wrong doing will be difficult to prove. Yet, to drag the nation through more legal wrangling in the Senate seems very unwise, especially in view of the politics and partisanship that will rue the day.  For the record, let me point out the role of the House in impeachment differs from the Senate. The House acts almost like a grand jury, with each of us behaving like judges in a civil proceeding. Yet, the House is hampered Constitutionally in its ability to discover evidence, call witnesses, and cross examine. Thus, the Committee, by it very nature, has put forward a report that contains only partial findings of alleged wrongdoing. Our vote will be to refer those partial findings and charges to the Senate for an actual trial. It is in the Senate that full evidence is weighed, witnesses are called, and cross-examination occurs. No Member of the House has been afforded the benefit of a full range of witnesses, with the opportunity to cross-examine, with rules of evidence being respected. Further, the partisanship of the Judiciary Committee hasbeen extremely troubling with the end result being that the full House is not afforded a range of proposals on which to vote to apply the proper judicial remedy relating to the President. Unlike previous impeachment hearings in the House--such as Andrew Johnson's in which the Committee studied the referral for eight months and defeated the resolution by a two to one margin, and at the hearings relating to President Nixon in which the House deliberated for six months and accepted the Committee report on a vote of 412 to 3--this process has been fraught with raw partisanship. The Committee has deliberated for a month, votes in the Committee have been strictly along party lines, and for the most part votes in the full House will mirror that pattern. Thus, this Member has little confidence the Committee has acted responsibly and with due process. Nonetheless, I believe the Judiciary Committee's findings to be serious, particularly relating to the articles of alleged perjury and obstruction of justice.  The allegations of perjury in Articles 1 and 2 are indeed serious since perjury, if proven, is a felony and, in my opinion, rise to the Constitutional standard of a high crime. But, proving perjury is a highly technical matter. Evidence and testimony in this regard are critical. The House Committee report has not proven perjury. To commit perjury, an untruth must be knowingly stated, under oath at an official proceeding. And that statement must be material with regard to the matter at hand. Since the Paula Jones case has been dismissed, the matter at hand would only involve the Lewinsky situation. Regarding the President's testimony before the grand jury in this regard, the legal question, as aside from the moral question, becomes, Did President Clinton lie, or did he simply exercise his rights under the law not to volunteer more details? Just because he didn't testify as much as some may have wanted, does not mean he perjured himself. The evidence against him in this care must be compelling and the judicial standard to measure perjury is not ``preponderance of evidence'', nor is it ``clear and convincing evidence.'' But, rather, the standard is the highest one of ``evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.'' The fact that the House is wresting with the evidence means there is a reasonable doubt, and thus a judicial finding of perjury will be difficult to obtain. In addition, some of the allegations in the Committee's report suggest that the definition on ``sexual relation'' President Clinton used before the grand jury was one with the intent to give perjurious statements. A lawyer would ask, where is the evidence of intent? Decisions of perjury cannot be made on the basis of conclusions nor suppositions, only on the basis of fact. One cannot assume an inference on an inference. Otherwise the evidence is inadmissible. Further, the report charges President Clinton ``didn't recall'' matter on several occasions. But what evidence do we have that demonstrates this. Again, this painstaking evidence must be collected, presented, rebutted. Otherwise, the charge cannot be sustained. In any case, the legal process will ensure for quite some time in resolving these questions. Moreover, convincing a defendant on perjury is most difficult where proof of falsity rests with contradictory statements of just one other person other than the defendant. In such cases, the defendant cannot be convicted. This means that just one other material witness with a contradictory story would not be enough to prove falsehood by the President. Additional witnesses, unlikely to be found, would have to come forward. This legal precedent actually dates back to Mosaic law. However, if the defendant changes his/her story and contradicts him/herself, then they can be convicted. This is not likely to happen, given the President's adherence to his original statement before the grand jury.  In anticipating the likely outcome of such a proceeding, if a jury of 12 persons, knowing the strict legal standards for conviction on perjury, were faced with the evidence in this case and asked ``did he lie'', ``did he knowingly do it'', and coupled this with Monica Lewinsky's testimony wherein the definition of sexual relations is brought into question, it is doubtful a jury would convict him of perjury beyond a reasonable doubt because of the substantial weight of circumstances evidence and lack of other credible witnesses. Again, there is a distinction between what is legally provable and what the public may demand as morally right.  Further, in meeting the Constitutional test of conviction based on ``bribery, treason, high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors of open to interpretation. Most scholars agree that these crimes would gravitate to crimes against the state or the government--such as bribery by a foreign interest, or outright treason. But again the Constitution does not say outright high crimes against the state. So, much is left to interpretation, and this is why this case is so important. Depending on how the House acts, a legal standard and process will be established against which future Constitutional questions regarding impeachment for inappropriate conduct that may be morally reprehensible, but not necessarily criminal, that affects the functioning of the apparatus of the state beyond the ``bribery, treason and high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard.                               conclusion  In summary, though President Bill Clinton has deeply offended the moral character of the nation, his acts cannot be termed high crimes against the interests of the state. Further, proving perjury from a legal standpoint will be exceedingly difficult in a regular court of law. But his case appropriately should be remanded there. Using the Senate as the venture for resolution risk further damaging to the national interest. One certainly can question whether President Clinton's personal, reckless behavior bordered on being a security risk, and this is a serious matter. But no apparent weakening of the state's direct interest resulted from his actions.  Regarding the interests of the state and our nation, we have reached the point where it becomes compelling for the public good for Congress to stop rendering this matter in public. Further proceedings in the Senate are unlikely to yield the 2/3 votes necessary to pursue any conclusive course of action.  Thus, I conclude that further Congressional deliberations on this set of charges are not in the nation's best interests. Though the charges against President Clinton are serious, they are best adjudicated in the courts where regular rules of evidence and due process apply. Since other alternatives are not available to this House as a result of the Judiciary Committee's flawed proceedings, I am left with no option but to vote against the Committee's recommendations, in spite of my disdain for the President's actions. The nation needs to move forward.
