Speaker, I rise to celebrate and recognize Jim Xinis and his twenty-five years at the helm of Calvert Memorial Hospital. Jim has been a tireless fighter to ensure the best service for the people of Calvert County and throughout southern Maryland.  Jim is an honest, confident, creative, and inspiring leader. He's been an effective manager and a visionary. His twenty-five years leading Calvert Memorial Hospital have been a period of growth and change that have increased quality, efficiency, and innovation for the benefit of patients and their families.  I will never forget how, in the summer of 2009, when the nation was engaged in a heated debate over passage of the Affordable Care Act, I asked Jim to facilitate a town hall meeting at North Point High School so I could hear from residents of the Fifth Congressional District on this important issue. It was quite a meeting with over 1,500 in attendance--and Jim displayed such grace and tact in keeping the meeting focused over several hours on the issues at hand and making sure everyone had a chance to weigh in. It was no easy task.  But Jim has never been one for easy tasks. Recognizing the challenge of rising health care costs and affordability, Jim created Calvert Healthcare Solutions, which serves the uninsured throughout the county. And under his leadership, Calvert Memorial Hospital has been the lowest cost hospital in Maryland for twenty consecutive years, with a reputation for providing a full range of services at a very high quality of care. At the same time, he has worked to preserve its warm community spirit, where patients can feel comfortable, cared for, and empowered. Jim's good humor and positive attitude have surely contributed to his effective leadership and his reputation for excellence.  I wish him well in retirement and thank him for his extraordinary service to Calvert County, to Maryland, and to our nation.                          ____________________
