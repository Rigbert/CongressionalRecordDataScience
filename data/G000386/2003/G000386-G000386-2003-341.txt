 We have several Democrat amendments pending. There is nothing wrong with that. It hasn't hurt the process at all. But I think it would be fair for me to remind the Members of the Republican caucus if they have amendments to propose, come over and do it. It will speed up the process and I think be considered a little more fair by everybody here. I will not object.
