McConnell, Admiral McConnell, whose op-ed I read this morning. And as the gentleman knows, I would reiterate, had we extended by 21 days the Protect America Act, which all of your Members voted against, had we done that, the immunity which was provided in that would have continued. As the gentleman also knows, that the only issue here is whether or not the administration has to go to the trouble to go to the FISA Court, which it has done so over 16,000 times, not this administration but the previous administration, and only had its request rejected five times; 99.9 percent of the time the FISA Court has approved. And once it approves, the telecoms, the telecommunication companies, acting in response to that court order are not liable for their actions. Therefore, we regret that we have not extended that, but, as I said, I am meeting today, we will be meeting through the next days, to try to come to an agreement.  Because the Senate delayed its action for 3 months after we passed our bill, it presented us with a bill that you wanted us to take as a fait accompli, without going to conference, without having the opportunity to discuss it. We think that was unreasonable and we didn't agree. So we're going to pursue this process and we are all in agreement that we ought to get this done.
