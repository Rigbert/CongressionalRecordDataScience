Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the McGill Manufacturing Company will be celebrating their 100th Anniversary on Friday, August 5, 2005, during an Open House and luncheon at the McGill Manufacturing Plant in Valparaiso, Indiana.  James H. McGill founded the Crescent Company in Chicago, Illinois. In 1905, he moved his company to Valparaiso, Indiana where it continued as the Crescent Company until December 1, 1910, when the name was changed to McGill Manufacturing. The first products produced by the company were for the electrical industry, and included wire guards for lamps, cord spools, socket handles, coloring fluid for incandescent light bulbs, Chatterton compound, and other specialty products.  The McGill Metal Company was then formed, and among other products, they developed a line of bronze retainers for ball bearings that were sold to the Strom Bearing Company in Chicago, Illinois. In 1924, a number of ex-Strom employees moved to Valparaiso, Indiana and interested James McGill in producing bearings using the aluminum bronze retainers formerly sold through the Strom Company. The initial production was under the trademark of ``Shubert,'' but in late 1926 all bearings were marked with the McGill name.  Hardwork and dedication led McGill to become a nationally-recognized leading source of precision bearings. After their incorporation, McGill expanded and built additional plants in Indiana, Texas, and Taiwan. In 1990, McGill was sold to Emerson and McGilll/EPT in Valparaiso is the headquarters of the Emerson Power Transmission Division.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending McGill Manufacturing/EPT for their outstanding contributions. The proud history of this outstanding company deserves to be honored by Congress. This company has contributed to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to honor them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
