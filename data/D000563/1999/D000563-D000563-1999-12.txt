We haven't missed it, as the Senator from Nevada knows very well. This is the third rail for a lot of politicians around here because you have to start to talk about things that cost a lot of money. Doing nothing costs a lot more money. People get ill, they have to go to the doctor, and to the hospital. When they need to have serious treatment, or hospitalization, that is very expensive, too.  It strikes me that those of us who sought this office to serve in the Senate or the House of Representatives did not do it just to collect a paycheck and accumulate years toward a pension but to do something to help families across this country. This is the No. 1 concern of families across the country.  If you have a child reaching the age of 23, and all of a sudden it dawns on you: Where is my daughter going to get her health insurance? I can't bring her under my policy. You start thinking. I am sure the Senator from Nevada has. I have. As a parent, every day I call my daughter in Chicago, who is an art student, and an artist, and say, ``Jennifer, are you insured this month?'' ``Yes, dad.'' But I have to ask the question because health insurance is not automatic.  This Congress has done little, if anything, to help families across America who struggle with this every single day--not to mention those with preexisting conditions. If you have a preexisting condition and it is a serious one, and you have to change insurers, good luck. Most people find themselves being discriminated against.  I agree with the Senator from Nevada. We have been here day in and day out, and I have heard literally nothing suggested by the Republican leadership to deal with this.
