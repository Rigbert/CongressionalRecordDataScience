Fourteen years ago I introduced the DREAM Act, and I got into a spat with a Republican Senator, Mr. Hatch, who said: That is my idea.  I said: Fine. Then it will be the Hatch-Durbin DREAM Act.  And we introduced it 14 years ago, and it has not been enacted into law. Senator Hatch now has some misgivings over this issue, but I have stuck with it for 14 years. And the majority leader joined me in sending a letter to President Obama asking that he create this Executive order of protection.  I would like to say a word about Executive orders. Republicans come to the floor and suggest that when a President of the United States issues an Executive order, it is an unconstitutional exercise of power. You hear it over and over again.  If you step out of this Chamber and take just a few steps toward the staircase, you will see this magnificent, historic painting of Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation. It is historic because, with the signature of President Lincoln, 3 million American slaves were freed--an Executive order. And it was an order which had the force of law. It was signed by President Lincoln--an Executive order.  It was not the only one. You think back in history to the historic Executive orders, and you have to think of Harry Truman. After World War II Harry Truman stepped up and said: We are going to integrate the Armed Forces of the United States of America, and I will not wait for Congress. Give me the pen and paper to sign the Executive order to achieve it.  So if President Lincoln can liberate 3 million American slaves, if President Truman can sign an Executive order integrating the Armed Forces, how can the Republicans come to the floor, one after the other, and say the use of an Executive order by the President is unconstitutional and want to hold President Obama accountable for their misguided thinking? It does not make sense.  I might just say--and I thought perhaps the Senator from Nevada was going to say it as well--if none of the Republicans like what President Obama has done on immigration, can I remind them they are now in majority control of the House and the Senate? If they think it is better to have a law enacted--despite the fact that for 2 years the House of Representatives refused to even call the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform--if they think it is proper and right for a law to be enacted on immigration, theAmerican people have given them the majorities in both Houses to do it.  So instead of cursing the darkness and failing to fund the Department of Homeland Security, why don't they roll up their sleeves and go to work as Members of the House and Senate and pass immigration reform? I think that is worthy of this great body and the one across the rotunda. But to underfund the Department of Homeland Security that protects us from terrorism? What are they thinking?  I thank the Senator from Nevada for returning. It feels great to have you back in your capacity here as our leader on the Democratic side and as my friend.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Georgia.                          ____________________
