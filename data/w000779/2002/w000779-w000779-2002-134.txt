President, in Oregon, the penalty for registering dogs that have become so famous, the monetary penalty is something like ten times the amount in this bill. When fraud happens with the vote-by-mail system, it is caught and it is stopped. Our penalties prove it. Any way you slice it, making it harder to vote isn't the way to deter fraud.  I come back in closing to why the American Association of Retired Persons and senior citizens groups feel so strongly about this amendment. They like voting by mail. It is convenient for them. They and millions of Americans are saying make it easier to vote. Congress should do everything possible to make it easier to vote rather than to make it harder. I don't think this body this morning should make it tough for those who saved our democracy in World War II to participate in our democracy in the days ahead.  I urge my colleagues to strongly support the amendment, and I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from New York.
