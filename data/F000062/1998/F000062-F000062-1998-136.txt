 I am also glad that the Senator from Utah is mentioning this, because one of the most discouraging things here has been the rush to judgment, has been the feeling of many people, very well-meaning, very much wanting to see legislation in place, that if you pause to consider these impacts, somehow you are un-American, somehow you are pro-tobacco. And yet, as we know, the devil is in the details with all of these things. It really is the long-term effect of a bill that we need to consider carefully.  That is one of the reasons I have been, frankly, opposed to the speed with which this bill is being pushed, and I think it is being pushed so that we don't have this information in front of us, so that we don't understand the repercussions, so that a bill gets passed and everybody can pound their chests and say what a wonderful job we have done and then, boom, in 4 years, there can be a cataclysmic event like a big black-market operation.
