 I am referring to today's BBC article entitled ``Burma Renews Suu Kyi Isolation.''  I want to be very clear to the repressive State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the Administration, and the international community--particularly Japan--that the level of engagement with the hard liners in Rangoon should be conditioned on concrete, political progress following Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release. Intimidating and punishing any Burmese who meets with democracy leader Suu Kyi--as has already occurred--or continuing to restrict her movements is wholly unacceptable and must not be tolerated.  The State Department made a grave mistake in allowing a Burmese colonel to visit Washington last month. The regime exploited this mistake when it touted in a press statement: ``This was our first conversation at this level with American authorities since 1988.'' We should not allow an illegal military junta to spin our intentions--or our policy.  It is my expectation that the junta will allow Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy to conclude its assessment of Burma's humanitarian needs before moving forward on any new programs or initiatives. Restricting Suu Kyi's access to U.N. offices in Rangoon serves no logical purpose.  Those of us who have long championed freedom and democracy for the people of Burma must be vigilant in the days, weeks, and months ahead. It is premature for the Washington--or any other foreign capital--to be considering ``rewards'' for the SPDC: 1,500 political prisoners have yet to be released; forced labor continues unabated; ethnic nationalities suffer horrific human rights abuses; and, dialogue between the NLD and the regime has not resumed.  The State Department would be wise to withhold requests to Congress for expanding narcotics cooperation with the Burmese--including the use of training facilities in Thailand--lest they be guilty of premature jubilation in Burma.  As I wrote to President Bush last month, the SPDC should be judged not by what they say, but rather by what they do. It does not look like the tiger in Burma has changed its stripes.                          ____________________
