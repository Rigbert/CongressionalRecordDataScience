 The Dole proposal, as we understand it, benefits only 19 States. My amendment benefits all States. I would be happy to debate it. If I am wrong, I would be happy to admit it. This is our belief. Our formula would benefit 27 States, beyond those in the Dole bill, and would hold everybody else harmless. So nobody would go below what their 1996 level is.
