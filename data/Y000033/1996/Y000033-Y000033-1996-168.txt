Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I want to congratulate the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] for introducing this amendment.  I am still very frustrated that one person's name was used over and over and over again. What happened to the five landowners, the little ones, 125 acres, 151 acres, 527 acres? There are no trees on those lands. Contrary to what the gentleman from Washington says, there is in fact with the Fish and Wildlife, you cannot do anything on that land if they designate it might disturb the murrelet. The murrelet is not endangered. It is not endangered, I say to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks]. It is all over the area. But the Fish and Wildlife says it is endangered. So we bow and we scrape to the Federal Government, the almighty Federal Government.  Yet these people, this lady in the wheelchair, these people on this little ranch with their kids, they are browbeaten by this Government saying you must meet our requirements. With what? Has the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks] ever been on a farm? No. Does he know anything about farming? No.
