 We would like to pass it. We would like the House to pick it up quickly--either agree to it, amend it, or whatever, and get it to the President. The sooner, the better.  This is not a perfect piece of legislation, but overall it has a lot of good things in it. I certainly urge my colleagues to support it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
