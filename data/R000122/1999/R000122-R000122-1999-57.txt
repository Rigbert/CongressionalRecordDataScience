President, I rise today to recognize the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island's celebration of October as Polish American Heritage Month.  Famous leaders, musicians and scientists of Polish descent have made numerous contributions to society. Pope John II, of Wadowice, Poland was the first non-Italian Pope chosen by the Roman Catholic Church in more than 400 years. Fryderyk Chopin of Zelazowa Wola, Poland is remembered for his unique approach to the piano and is considered one of the greatest composers of all time. Marie Curie, of Warsaw, Poland was awarded a Nobel Prize for physics in 1903 and in 1911, a second Nobel Prize for chemistry. Madame Curie is still the only woman in history to be awarded two Nobel Prizes.  The Polish heritage is so alive today because Polish Americans play an active role in their cities, towns and communities. Millions of Polish immigrants have settled in cities like Pawtucket all across America. The Polish people brought their traditions, faith and pride to communities across the country and established schools, churches and organizations to help celebrate their heritage in America. With over 47,000 people of Polish descent in Rhode Island alone, one cannot talk about the history of Rhode Island or the history of America without recognizing the contributions of people of Polish descent.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join with the Polish community of Pawtucket in celebrating the city's Polish American Heritage Month.                          ____________________
