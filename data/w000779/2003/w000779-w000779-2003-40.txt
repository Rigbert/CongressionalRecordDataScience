To get this done, there are some difficult choices that have to be made. One that would be very painful for me, given my involvement in the original law, would be to accept some sort of time limit rather than make it permanent.  I say to the Senate, I am willing to look at that in the name of trying to find common ground. What we can't have as we go through this is to have DSLs, this tremendously exciting service which in so many instances is going to be the key for folks getting Internet access in a wireless fashion, hammered again and again in the future. We are going to see if we can find common ground.  The point of this law more than 5 years ago was to ensure technological neutrality so the Internet and the various ways it is delivered would not, in some way, advance some at the expense of others. We still have to find a way for that technological neutrality.  We may be able, given the fact that the staffs are working now to have a breakthrough on this in the next half an hour, but as the author of the original law in the Senate, I want to make it clear that I am open to trying to find some common ground and make some significant concessions to do it. That is what we are considering now.  I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding.
