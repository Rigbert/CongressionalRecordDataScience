President, improving public safety, growing our economy, increasing energy independence, and protecting the environment have always been among my top priorities as a Senator. Today, the very first bill I am introducing in this new Congress will advance all of those goals by allowing the heaviest trucks to travel on our Federal interstate highways in Maine rather than being forced to use secondary roads and downtown streets.  I am delighted to have the senior Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, as my Democratic cosponsor, and my good friend and colleague from Maine, Olympia Snowe, also as an original cosponsor. Vermont has the same problem as we do in Maine. Thus the bill I am introducing applies to our two States.  In 2009, I authored a law to establish a 1-year pilot project that allowed trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to travel on Maine's Federal interstates--I-95, 195, 295, and 395. According to the results of a preliminary study by the Maine Department of Transportation, this pilot project, which ran until mid-December of last year, helped to preserve and create jobs by allowing Maine's businesses to receive raw materials and to ship their products more economically.  Also important, the pilot program improved safety, saved energy, and reduced carbon emissions. Let me give a specific example. On a trip from Hampden to Houlton, ME, the benefits are obvious. A truck traveling on I-95 rather than on Route 2 avoids more than 270 intersections, 9 school crossings, 30 traffic lights, and 86 crosswalks. In addition, the driver also saves more than $30 on fuel. Given the cost of diesel, it is probably even higher than that now. Additionally, 50 minutes is saved by traveling on Interstate 95 rather than on the secondary road of Route 2.  Unfortunately, despite the clear success of this pilot project and the strong support of the administration and many of my colleagues in the Senate, the House of Representatives failed to include my provision making the pilot permanent in the Federal funding bill. As a result, for both Maine and Vermont, the program expired on December 17 and the heavy trucks are once again unable to use our most modern, safe, and efficient highways.  It is important to emphasize that our legislation does not increase the size or the weight of trucks in our States. Maine law already allows trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to operate on State and municipal roads. Heavy trucks already operate on some 22,500 miles of non-Interstate roads in Maine, in addition to the approximately 167 miles of the Maine turnpike. But the nearly 260 miles of non-turnpike interstates that are the major economic corridors in my State are off limits. This simply makes no sense.  Furthermore, trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are already permitted on many Federal interstates in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, and the neighboring provinces in Canada. So that puts Maine and Vermont at a distinct competitive disadvantage. All around us, the States and our Canadian counterparts allow the heavier trucks to use the Federal interstates, but unfortunately Maine and Vermont have been excluded. That is why my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has joined me in this effort to help provide a level playing field for our States.  Here are a few more important points about our bill.  The 100,000-pound trucks are no larger or wider than 80,000-pound trucks. This change would remove an estimated 7.8 million truck miles from our local roads and streets. Increasing the truck payloads by 35 percent would reduce the overall number of trucks needed. In addition to saving fuel by traveling fewer miles, the steady pace of interstate driving improves the fuel economy of trucks by 14 to 21 percent. And the Maine Department of Transportation's engineers say they are confident our interstate bridges are safe and can handle the additional weight in the State of Maine.  Countless Maine small business owners have told me how this change would improve their competitiveness. For example, at a recent press conference, Keith Van Scotter discussed the savings his company accrued under the pilot project. Under the pilot project, his company Lincoln Paper and Tissue was able to save 1.1 million billable truck miles, a 28 percent decrease from the year before. These savings are the equivalent of the company being 220 miles closer to its primary market. Also, the owner-operator of a logging business in Penobscot County said that being able to transport his pulpwood to the mill on I-95 rather than on secondary roads would save his company at least 118 gallons of fuel each week. That benefits not only this small business but also our Nation as we seek to reduce our overall fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions.  The pilot program has also made a dramatic improvement for some of our communities. According to the Maine DOT, before the pilot program began last December of 2009, more than 200 heavy trucks heading north on Route 201 crawled through downtown Vassalboro a small town of about 4,000--each day even though I-95 runsparallel just a few miles away. During the span of the pilot program, the number of northbound trucks on Route 201 decreased by roughly 90 percent. These trucks were using the interstate where they belong.  I will tell you that since the pilot project expired, so many of my constituents have talked to me about the return of these heavy trucks to the residential neighborhoods in which they live, to downtown Portland, Orono, Brewer, Freeport, and other towns throughout our State. The fact is, this kind of road congestion caused by diverting these heavy trucks into downtowns and along secondary roads can lead to tragedy. A study conducted by a nationally recognized traffic consulting firm found that the crash rate of semitrailer trucks on Maine's secondary roads were 7 to 10 times higher than on the turnpike. It estimated that allowing these trucks to stay on the interstates could result in three fewer fatal crashes each year. Public safety agencies in Maine, including the Maine State Police, have long supported my efforts to bring about this change. In fact, Bangor's police chief joined me at a press conference last week where he spoke eloquently about the safety implications for downtown Bangor.  In 2010, as a result of this pilot project, people throughout our State saw their roads less congested, our States safer, our air cleaner, and, most important, our businesses more competitive. That is why I am so committed to ensuring that these improvements are allowed to continue and are made permanent.  This legislation simply is common sense. It will benefit our economy as well as lower fuel costs and make our roads safer for most tourists and pedestrians. Most important, we now have the concrete evidence from this pilot project showing why this bill should become law.  I am grateful for the support and leadership of my colleague from Vermont and the steadfast support from Maine's senior Senator as well. I urge its swift passage. This is the highest priority I have for the State of Maine this year.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of letters I have received endorsing this bill. These letters are from the Maine Motor Transport Association, the City of Bangor's chief of police, the Professional Logging Contractors, the Northeast Region for the Forestry Resources Association, and from a well-known trucking firm in Maine, H.O. Bouchard.  In addition, I expect to have a letter from the Governor of Maine later today that I will also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.                                  ____                            Maine Motor Transport Association,                                 Augusta, Maine, January 21, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Your introduction of the bill to      permanently increase the truck weight limit on Maine highways      comes as great news for the trucking industry, for shippers      and consumers who rely on efficient transportation of goods      and for the people of our state who utilize these roads. We      have heard from many of our members who were thrilled to      operate on the entire interstate system in Maine under the      recently-expired pilot project, as well as hearing from      citizens who live along the previously traveled truck routes      who were happy to have them off Maine's secondary roads. Your      support for this common sense solution has been tremendous      and we very much appreciate your continued efforts to educate      your peers in the Senate.       As you know, when Federal Highway froze interstate weight      limits in 1998 and allowed the Maine Turnpike and southern      portions of 1-95 to be grandfathered, there was much concern      about the same things that concern some people from other      states now--safety and the impact on our infrastructure.      Results in Maine have shown these concerns were unnecessary      as there is ample proof of the improved safety and      infrastructure costs and all we ask is for Maine to close the      donut hole that puts us at a competitive disadvantage with      our neighbors all around us. New Hampshire, Massachusetts and      Canada already have permanently higher weight limits on their      entire interstate system which put our businesses at a      disadvantage, a fact not lost on the hundreds of small      trucking companies hauling raw materials to the few mills      still left in this state. A strong argument can be made that      this is an economic development issue with many jobs at stake      for the mills that rely on efficient transportation with both      their inbound freight and the outbound movement of goods to      markets outside Maine.       Your proposal to allow for a more productive vehicle      configuration makes sense for both state and federal roads.      More efficient configurations mean fewer trucks on the road.      Fewer trucks on the road reduce engine emissions and promote      fuel conservation, all while lessening our dependence on      foreign oil. The whole notion that heavier trucks will use      more fuel and pollute more is inherently false, especially      since it would take approximately three trucks operating at      80,000 pounds to replace two trucks operating at 100,000      pounds to haul the same amount of freight.       In fact, a study by the American Transportation Research      Institute (ATRI) commissioned by the Maine DOT found that the      fuel efficiency of these rigs would improve up to 21 percent      by allowing state weight limits on the entire highway system      and emissions would decrease from 6 to 11 percent.      Extrapolating their findings over an entire week resulted in      savings of as much as 675 gallons of fuel, up to 6.8 metric      tons of CO2 and almost 94 grams of Particulate Matter. Yes,      that's each week and only from trucks shifting from Route 9      to 1-95 once the weight limit exemption pilot project went      into effect. This efficiency has gone away now that the pilot      project has expired.       Safety, however, is the most important reason to embrace      this pilot project and we are proud that the safety record of      the trucking industry continues to improve. Federal Highway      Administration statistics tracking truck-involved crashes has      shown consistent improvement by the trucking industry, with      current crash rates at the lowest levels since the U.S.      Department of Transportation began tracking large truck      safety records in 1975. Not resting on our accomplishments,      the trucking industry is actively working on ways we can      improve highway safety by improving driver performance with      rigorous licensing and training, focusing on equipment      improvements and by giving carriers access to the proper      tools that are critical for them to fulfill their      responsibility to the safety of the motoring public.       Allowing these trucks to use the safer interstate system      would also decrease the interactions with other vehicles and      pedestrians if they are able to avoid secondary roads and      having to go past driveways and through towns to deliver      their goods that move the Maine economy. A four lane divided      highway with all traffic going in the same direction at      relatively the same speed has been statistically proven to be      the safer road for all vehicles--not just trucks.       It's hard to find a topic that garners widespread and      bipartisan support these days when partisan bickering and      political polarization are the norm. This issue is not only      strongly supported by groups you would expect like the      trucking, oil dealers and forest products industries, but it      also finds support from the Maine Legislature,      municipalities, the Maine DOT, Maine Department of Public      Safety as well as the Maine State Police and many local and      regional chambers of commerce. We all may not see eye-to-eye      on every public policy issue, but we are in lock step on this      one.       There may never be a better opportunity than now to enact a      permanent solution relative to vehicle productivity. The      Maine Motor Transport Association, our members and our      partner trade associations will work diligently to provide      you with additional statistics and information as they become      available. Your work on this issue, especially getting the      pilot project implemented last year, has not gone unnoticed      by our members and we continue to appreciate your efforts to      address it in your recently proposed bill.       If Maine is going to be able to compete in a regional and      global economy, it is essential that we encourage efficient,      effective and safe transportation solutions such as the one      you have proposed. Thank you.           Sincerely,                                                   Brian D. Parke,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                            City of Bangor, Maine,                                            Police Department,                                                 January 24, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirkson Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: First and foremost, thank you again      for being a champion for the effort to increase the truck      weight limits on Maine's interstate highways. Without your      diligence and dedication to this extremely important matter,      any further progress to correct the inconceivable injustice      of the current law would be most assuredly abandoned for the      foreseeable future. Your legislation, which would allow      trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds on all of Maine's      Interstate highways, would correct this injustice once and      for all.       I would like to reiterate what I have previously stated      regarding the present law that forces trucks weighing over      80,000 pounds off Maine's interstate highways. These trucks      do not belong on Maine's city streets and secondary roads,      just as they do not belong on those of New Hampshire,      Massachusetts, and New York. I, along with other Maine chiefs      of police across the state, believe that these trucks pose a      significant risk to the safety of citizens as they travel      upon the populated city streets and narrow and winding rural      roads of Maine's cities and towns. We have seen, first hand,      the dangers these trucks pose to Maine citizens as they      travel on our secondary roads. The constant changing of      speeds and their repeated starts and stops cause regular      disruption to the flow of local traffic, and their presence      have resulted in traffic accidents and tragedies.     During the winter months, Maine's secondary roads become much      narrower, rural roads are more slippery, and speed limits are      reduced, thereby increasing the danger to pedestrians and      other drivers. No matter how experienced the truck driver may      be, they cannot stop these trucks on a dime; they cannot      anticipate every situation that can occur in heavily      populated areas; and they cannot prevent the shifting of      their heavy loads from occurring.       It is important to do everything possible to insure safety      for the public. Therefore, I offer my utmost support for your      legislation that will keep these heavy loads on Maine's      interstate highways where they belong. I continue to      encourage you and others, like Senator Leahy of Vermont, to      continue your efforts to keep these 100,000 pound trucks on      interstate highways, and off our local streets and rural      roads.           Sincerely,                                                 Ronald K. Gastia,     Chief of Police.                                  ____                             Professional Logging Contractors,                             New Gloucester, ME, January 24, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express the      Professional Logging Contractors of Maine's full support for      your proposed legislation to permanently allow trucks      weighing up to 100,000 pounds to use federal Interstate      highways in Maine and Vermont.       Our logger members rely on trucks to deliver their logs,      chips and biomass to market. We are surrounded by states and      provinces which allow higher Interstate truck weights,      putting loggers in rural Maine at a significant competitive      disadvantage. Many of our members are small business owners      for whom the increased costs of being forced to make longer,      less efficient trips on secondary roads could make the      difference between profitability and unprofitability. This      could lead some business owners to exit the market place,      costing jobs and placing an additional strain on wood      supplies.       Interstate highways are designed and built to handle higher      truck weights and wherever possible trucks should be able to      utilize this system, taking unnecessary traffic off of state      and local highways and out of our communities. PLC of Maine      believes each state should have the right to adjust the      weight limits on Interstates within its borders to meet the      needs of its people.       Last year's pilot project in Maine, allowing 100,000 pound      trucks to access Interstate highways, was tremendously      successful. The loss of the pilot in December was a real blow      to our loggers, the forest products industry, and our rural      communities as well.       Restoring the terms of the pilot is one action Congress can      take that would immediately benefit industry and the public,      without imposing new burdens on taxpayers. The benefits of      the increased weight limits are clear:       Safety--Fewer miles travelled, on safer roads, with reduced      contact with pedestrians, automobiles, rail crossings and      school zones;       Environmental--Reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions      from start and stops; and       Economic--Reduced secondary road and bridge wear, improved      truck efficiency for loggers.       Please let me know if there is anything the Professional      Logging Contractors of Maine can do to promote your      legislation. Thank you again for your continued support for      Maine's loggers.           Sincerely,                                             Michael A. Beardsley,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                  Forest Resources                                            Association, Inc.,                                     Holden, ME, January 21, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express the Forest      Resources Association's full support for your proposed      legislation which would permanently allow trucks weighing up      to 100,000 pounds to use federal Interstate highways in Maine      and Vermont.       Our members--forest landowners, loggers, truckers, wood-     using mills, and associated businesses, as well as our      families and neighbors--all rely on safe and efficient      transportation of goods and services by truck for our      livelihoods.       Our industry relies on trucks to deliver raw materials from      the forest to our mills and shipment of finished product to      market. We are surrounded by states and provinces which allow      higher Interstate truck weights, putting our industry in      rural Maine at a significant disadvantage.       The federal Interstate system is designed and built to      handle these loads, as are Maine highways and wherever      possible trucks should be able to utilize this system, taking      unnecessary traffic off of state and local highways and out      of communities. FRA believes that, within reasonable      guidelines, each state should have the right to adjust weight      limits on Interstates within its borders to conform with its      needs.       By all accounts, last year's pilot project in Maine and      Vermont allowing these trucks to access Interstate highways      was tremendously successful. Attached is a Forest Resources      Association Technical Release presenting testimony on the      pilot's benefits. The loss of the pilot in December was a      real blow to our industry and rural communities.       Restoring the terms of the pilot is one action Congress can      take which immediately benefits both industry and the public      without imposing new burdens on taxpayers. The benefits are      clear:       Safety Benefits--Fewer miles travelled, on safer roads,      with fewer exposures.       Environmental Benefits--Reduced fuel usage, reduced      emissions.       Economic Benefits--Reduced wear on secondary roads,      improved efficiency for haulers.       Please let me know if there is anything FRA can do to      promote your legislation--and thanks again for your continued      support for Maine's forest products community .           Sincerely,                                                     Joel Swanton,     Region Manager.                                  ____                                                     H.O. Bouchard                                      Transportation Services,                                    Hampden, ME, January 21, 2011.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirkson Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of H.O.      Bouchard in favor of allowing trucks weighing up to 100,000      pounds gross vehicle weight on Interstates in Maine. We are a      major motor carrier in Maine whose fleet is made up of 6-axle      units transporting heavy bulk products throughout Maine,      Canada, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New      York. These products include: cement powder, liquid asphalt,      fuel oil, road salt, raw forest products, chemicals, logs and      machinery. We have done this safely for 27 years.       I ask that you help those who are not from this area to      understand that the whole New England area (with the      exception of Vermont), New York and Canada allow up to at      least 99,000 pounds on 6 axle combination units. New York      allows more than 100,000 pounds and Canada allows more than      109,000 lbs. on 6 axles. The only areas that do not are a      very small slice of Maine that is Interstates 95, 295, 395      and interstates in Vermont. Presently the freight moves on 6      axle units, but on secondary roads. Commerce to and from      Bangor to Aroostook County must travel on secondary Route 2,      rather than 1-95, which runs parallel. To go the same      distance takes 50 minutes longer at a cost of approximately      $70.00 more. This is multiplied by hundreds of trips daily of      fuels, logs, lumber and many other consumer commodities. This      commercial traffic is very noticeable in all of the small      towns where the trucks must constantly stop and start for RR      crossings, crosswalks, school buses and emergency vehicles.      That same truck traffic was not even noticeable when it was      on the interstate, a road that can handle much more traffic      with ease. We have paid for the best roads and cannot use      them.       The future of our nation must include increased      transportation productivity to keep from clogging highways      and slowing the economic recovery. Using 2 trucks to haul the      freight of 3 is a simple, safe, cost effective way to      accomplish this. Your proposal to allow 6-axle vehicles      weighing up to 100,000 pounds to use the interstate system in      Maine and Vermont (99,000) is all benefit at no cost. It is      simply good business.       Thank you for your support in helping with this important      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                   Brian Bouchard,                                                        President.
