Speaker, in support of our ``Come Shop with Me'' campaign, the New York Times fortunately ran a story this month on the business page with the subtitle ``Low Wages Would Foreign Business, But the Price Is Worker Poverty.'' The story, which I will enter in the Record tonight, describes how a 22-year-old Indonesian man named Tongris was dismissed from his job making Nike shoes for export to the United States because he was organizing his fellow workers to demand more than the government-dictated poverty wage.  How much was Tongris and his co-workers getting paid to make Nike shoes? Twenty cents an hour. And that is with no benefits.  More than 5,000 workers turn out Nike shoes at this plant in Indonesia, shoes which often sell for over $100 a pair here in the United States. Nike and thousands of other manufacturers have been lured to set up business in Indonesia by the pitifully low wage level, along with the assurance by the Indonesian government that it will tolerate no strikes or independent worker associations. But as the Indonesian government itself admits in the article, it sets its wage purpose fully extremely low to only provide the minimum calories the worker need to survive each day.  My friends, this is no different from how plantation owners though about feeding their slaves. Feed them enough so that they will not die on the job. In fact, I remember visiting the Auschwitz death camp and reading the sign above the entry gate that read ``Work will make you free.''  Nike would like you to believe that they are truly a great American company. Nike in fact has been spendingover $250 million a year in advertising to sell you, the consumer, the message that they are a good American corporate citizen. Nike has virtually bought off the entire American sporting world. Just look at how many college coaches and athletes in the NCAA basketball tournament now being played have been paid to wear Nike's trademark, the Gold Swoosh. Your people across this Nation are literally killing people to acquire Nike products.  The truth of the matter is, Nike does not produce one athletic shoe in this country, not one. It has shut down all its U.S. production while siphoning off billions of dollars in this marketplace through sales. But it employs 75,000 workers in places like Indonesia and China, hidden from view of the news media of this country. And they pay their workers exceedingly low wages, 10 cents an hour in China, 20 cents an hour in Indonesia, work them 7 days a week, under complete control of those employers. And yet though the shoes cost only $6 to make and ship to the United States from Indonesia, we end being asked to pay up to $150 a pair.  So it is fair game to ask who is benefiting from this kind of production system? It is not the American worker who is no longer employed making Nike shoes. It is not the worker in Indonesia or China who earns poverty wages. Finally, it is not the American consumer, who is being gouged to pay outrageous prices for Nike.  As Hakeem Olajuwon, the star basketball player from the Houston Rockets courageously pointed out when he refused to endorse Nike shoes, he said, I saw the prices go from $40 to $90 to $150, and in full cognizance that people were dying for these shoes, including inner-city kids, the kids that Nike was targeting with their inner-city role models. There is one sports figure with a conscience in this country. Thank God for that.  We as American workers and consumers could do one better. We could stop buying Nike shoes until Nike pledges allegiance again to the workers of this country and to its producers around the world. Is it not time we put a little bit of conscience back into corporate America?  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the New York Times article.               [From the New York Times, March 16, 1996]                An Indonesian Asset Is also a Liability                         (By Edward A. Gargan)       SERANG, Indonesia.--Many days Tongris Situmorang, in his      blue baseball hat with a large X on the front hangs around      the gates of the enormous Nike sport shoe factory here,      talking to friends leaving the assembly lines at the end of      the work day.       The gangly 22-year-old used to work inside the well-guarded      gates, but five months ago he was dismissed for organizing      workers to demand more than the 4,600 rupiah they are paid      each day, about $2.10, the Government-dictated minimum wage.      Then, after being dismissed, he was locked in a room at the      plant and interrogated for seven days by the military, which      demanded to know more about his labor activities.       ``We went on strike to ask for better wages and an      improvement in the food,'' Mr. Situmorang explained ``Twenty-     two of us went on strike. They told us not to demand      anything. They said we wouldn't get any money. But I have      sued to get my job back.''       Low wages are a big attraction for foreign companies doing      business in Asia as high labor costs in the industrialized      nations make the manufacturing of many consumer goods      uneconomical. Like a wave washing over Asia, labor-intensive      factories have swept south and west as incomes and living      standards have risen from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea,      across Asia to China, Vietnam and Indonesia.       And across the region, businesses in developing economies      are felling pressure from workers like Mr. Situmorang to lift      wages. Clashes erupt between workers who want more and      businesses and governments that fear that rising wages will      drive away jobs to even-lower-wage countries. As strikes and      worker-organizing attempts have increased here, the      Government has taken a harsher line by cracking down on      workers with police and military force.       For some companies, like Levi Strauss, worker complaints,      were enough to prompt it to leave Indonesia two years ago.      But others, like Nike, whose shoes are made in 35 plants      across Asia, have expanded in the region to take advantage of      cheap labor.       For the Indonesian Government, the long-term solution may      be to find manufacturers of products that can support higher      wages. ``Our strategy is to improve our products so we are      not producing products that are made in China, Vietnam, India      or Bangladesh,'' said Tunghi Ariwibowo, the powerful Minister      of Industries and Trade. ``We cannot compete on wages with      them.''       More than 5,000 workers churn out Nike shoes here, shoes      that often sell in stores in Asia, Europe and North America      for perhaps $100 a pair. Nike and thousands of other      manufacturers have been lured to set up business in Indonesia      by the low wages--and the assurance that the Government will      tolerate no strikes or independent unions.       Yet even at a little more than $2 a day, there is a      widespread sense in Government circles that even that is too      high for Indonesia to stay competitive.       As the Government tries to hold down wages--wages the      Government admits provide only 93 percent of the earnings      required for subsistence for one person--strikes and worker      organizing have increased. And with the increase in labor      agitation have come harsher crackdowns by the Government.       A spokeswoman for Nike in the United States, Donna Gibbs,      said she was not aware of Mr. Situmorang's case or of the      detention and interrogation of workers for a week. However,      when pressed, she said, ``Our information is that workers      were not held for a week.''       All the plants that manufacture Nike shoes in Asia, Ms.      Gibbs said, are owned by subcontractors, mostly Koreans. Each      subcontractor is required to adhere to a code of conduct      drawn up by Nike, she said, and managers from Nike are      involved in the daily oversight of subcontractors'      operations, including not simply quality control matters, but      the treatment and working conditions of the labor force.       Nike's code of conduct, Ms. Gibbs said, requires compliance      with all local laws, the prevention of forced labor,      compliance with local regulations on health and safety and      provisions of workers insurance. She said she was unaware of      13- and 14-year-old girls working at the Nike plant here.       ``Certainly we have heard and witnessed abuses over time,''      she said ``and typically what happens is that we ask the      contractor to rectify the situation and if it is not resolved      we can terminate the business.       Ms. Gibbs said Nike has four to six subcontractors in      Indonesia, a number that varies according to production      needs. She said the minimum monthly wage was 115,000 rupiah,      about $52.50, although the average was 240,000 ripiah, about      $110. For a pair of shoes costing $80 in the United States,      she said, labor accounts for $2.60 of the total cost.       ``The problem is that the minimum wage does not provide for      minimum subsistence,'' an Asian diplomat here said. ``And      beyond that, the companies don't always pay what is required      by law. The level of unrest is not reported, but there are      lots of reports from around the country of strikes.''       ``The philosophy of the minimum wage is to make sure the      minimum calorie need per day is fulfilled,'' said Marzuki      Usman, who heads the finance and monetary analysis body for      the Finance Ministry and was the first chairman of the      Jakarta Stock Exchange. ``That is the formula.''       On April 1, the minimum wage is to rise in many places to      5,200 rupiah, about $2.37.       ``There are so many labor strikes,'' said Apong Herlima, a      lawyer for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation who      specializes in labor cases in Jakarta. ``Employers always      call the police and they come and interrogate the workers.      Then, the workers are fired.''       Because Indonesia's press treads carefully around sensitive      issues--and social unrest is among the tenderest of      subjects--it is difficult to gauge precisely the level of      labor unrest. The Government reported that there were 297      strikes last year, although it did not provide the number of      workers involved. Independent labor organizes insist the      actual number is far higher.       ``The number of strikes is increasing,'' said Leily      Sianipar, a labor organizer in nearby Tangerang. ``Most      factories don't actually pay the minimum wage.      Garment factories should pay 4,600 rupiah each day, but      there is usually underpayment. So there are strikes. We      try to organize workers. The factory owners use the police      and the military to crack down. They try to intimidate the      workers.''       The Indonesian Government recognizes only one Government-     sponsored union, the Federation of All Indonesian Workers      Union. But most workers and independent activists maintain      that the Government union does nothing to represent      Indonesia's 40 million workers.       ``Since they don't come from the bottom, and they aren't      elected by the workers, there is no hope for the Government      union,'' said Indera Nababan, the director of the Social      Communication Foundation, a labor education group sponsored      by the Communion of Churches of Indonesia. ``I don't think      over 10 years there has been any considerable change. The      workers have no rights here to argue for their rights.''       Not far from the Nike factory here, Usep, a lean man of 25,      leaned against the cement wall of the tiny room he shares      with his 19-year-old wife, Nursimi. Together, said Mr. Usep,      who like most Javanese has only one name, the couple earn      about $4.10 a day--or $82 a month. Of that, they must pay      about $23 for the 6-foot-by-6-foot cement room they live in,      with the remainder for their food and other needs.       A single bare bulb dangles from the ceiling, its dim glare      revealing a plain bed, a single gas burner, and a small      plastic cabinet. Their room, one of a dozen in a long cement      building, is provided with one container of water daily. If      they want more water, each jug costs 100 rupiah, about 5      cents.       ``Of course we're not satisfied with this,'' Mr. Usep said,      his words coming quietly. ``We     tried to talk to friends about this, but there is no      response. Probably they are worried they will lose their      jobs.''       It is workers like these whom Ms. Sianipar has been trying      to organize for the last seven years, a task that entails the      constant risk of arrest.       ``If we have a meeting, the police take us to the station      and want to know if we want to make a revolution,'' she said,      a laugh breaking over her words. ``We had a meeting here last      week and the police came. So we changed the topic of the      meeting, but they took me to the station anyway. The police      got angry and banged the table. But they let me go at 4 in      the morning. They had the idea that we were doing underground      organization.''       Still, she admitted, the attitude of the police has      moderated somewhat over the years. ``Five years ago,'' she      said, ``we would have had much more trouble.''       Not all foreign investors who use cheap Indonesian labor      have ignored workers' complaints. In 1994, the American      clothing company Levi Strauss withdrew its orders from a      local garment contractor after reports that the management      had strip-searched women to check if they were menstruating.       But many factories that manufacture clothing, shoes or      electronic goods for American companies are owned by Taiwan      or Korean companies, and labor organizers contend that      conditions in these factories are much worse than in      factories directly owned by Americans.       ``American companies are here because they have to pay very      little,'' said an American who works for a private aid      organization, but who did not want his name used. ``But      American companies are not the worst violators of basic      working conditions. The Koreans really stand out for poor      conditions in their factories.''       Outside the Nike factory, Mr. Situmorang continues his      vigil, waiting for a court decision on whether he can get his      job back. ``I've gone to the labor department and the      court,'' he said. He paused and sighed. ``I really don't      think in the end I will get my job back. This is Indonesia.''                          ____________________
