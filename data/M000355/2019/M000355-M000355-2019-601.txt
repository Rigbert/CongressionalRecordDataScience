 President, great works of artistic expression are so much more than something simply to look at or listen to. They are often a reflection of the artist, her community, and a unique culture. Kentuckian Cornelia Dozier Cooper recognizes the encouraging effect of creative works, and she has spent her lifetime promoting them in eastern Kentucky. It is a privilege to recognize my dear friend Cornelia, who was recently selected to receive our Commonwealth's highest artistic honor: the Milner Award. In tribute to her accomplishment and philanthropy, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations for this well-deserved honor.  Born in Madisonville, KY, Cornelia developed a passion for the arts at an early age. Supported by her parents and a fostering education, she grew her skills in both visual and musical arts. She was quickly recognized for her talent and studied English watercolor at the prestigious Oxford University. I have had the privilege to visit Cornelia's home, where I admired her beautiful watercolors up close. Her own artistic works, in which she hopes to display the glory of God's creation, were just the beginning of her contributions to Kentucky.  With her husband, Richard Cooper--brother to another outstanding Kentuckian, Senator John Sherman Cooper--Cornelia's devotion to the arts extended far beyond her own brush and canvas. She sought to give her fellow Kentuckians the opportunity to create great works of art and to be inspired by them in their communities. Cornelia worked with several organizations, including as a founding member of the Kentucky Arts Council, promoting aspiring talents in her home of Pulaski County and throughout the Commonwealth. She also established the Cornelia Dozier Cooper Endowment Fund for the Arts, providing grants to support a variety of eastern Kentucky artists. The endowment is funded, in part, by the proceeds from the sale of her own watercolors.  At a ceremony in the Kentucky Capitol Rotunda, surrounded by artistic works celebrating the Bluegrass State's illustrious history, Cornelia received her Milner Award. Even at the age of 93 Cornelia still brings the same enthusiasm to promoting young artists. To many throughout Kentucky, she is a mentor and a creative inspiration. Her selfless philanthropy will certainly continue to encourage young artists to develop their talents and follow their passions. I am grateful to Cornelia for her friendship and her lifetime spent enriching our home State. She has certainly earned this distinction. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating this remarkable Kentuckian, Cornelia Dozier Cooper.                          ____________________
