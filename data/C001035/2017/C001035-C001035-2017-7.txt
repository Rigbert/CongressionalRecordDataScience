While it is by no means perfect, on balance, this reform bill will provide much needed tax relief. It will benefit lower and middle-income families, while spurring the creation of good jobs and greater economic growth.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I write to express my deep      concerns with the Congressional Budget Office's determination      that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to      be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be      triggered by the passage of tax reform legislation as a      result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though      there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.       Since I do not believe it is anyone's intention to allow      automatic cuts to Medicare to occur, I urge swift action to      waive the PAYGO requirements. Medicare provides essential      benefits to our nation's seniors, and we must remove      immediately the threat that an automatic reduction in the      program's funding could occur.       Since PAYGO was enacted, sixteen laws that would have      otherwise triggered PAYGO's automatic spending cuts have      included provisions to exclude all or part of the law's      budgetary impact, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act      of 2012 that was enacted under the previous Administration.       I look forward to working with you to ensure that no      Medicare cuts are triggered under PAYGO, a goal I believe is      supported by members on both sides of the aisle. Thank you      for your attention to this critical issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Susan M. Collins,     United States Senator.                                  ____                                 U.S. Senate, Majority Leader,                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter expressing      concern about the across-the-board spending cuts. You will be      pleased to know that Speaker Paul Ryan and I issued the      following joint statement earlier today:       ``Critics of tax reform are claiming the legislation would      lead to massive, across-the-board spending cuts in vital      programs--including a 4-percent reduction in Medicare--due to      the Pay-Go law enacted in 2010. This will not happen.      Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,      which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is      no reason to believe that Congress would not act again to      prevent a sequester, and we will work to ensure these      spending cuts are prevented.''       Again, thank you.           Sincerely,                                                  Mitch McConnell,                                                  Majority Leader.
