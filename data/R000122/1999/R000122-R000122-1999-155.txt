President, I rise today to introduce legislation to support and strengthen America's school libraries.  The school library plays a vital role in the education of students. It is where reading skills are reinforced; the laboratory where ideas taught in class are explored and tested; the arena in which children explore new ideas and learn on their own; and a vital bridge to the remarkable and growing resources of the information age.  Research shows that well-equipped and well-staffed school libraries are essential to promoting learning and achievement. Indeed, a 1992 study found that students in schools with well-equipped libraries and professional library media specialists perform better on achievement tests for reading comprehension and basic research skills.  This finding was echoed in a 1994 U.S. Department of Education report on the impact of school library media centers which noted that the highest achieving students tend to come from schools with strong libraries and library programs.  And, a 1993 review of research studies concluded that free voluntary reading is the foundation for good grammar, writing, and reading comprehension abilities. For the average American student, the school library is the single most available source of reading material.  Mr. President, with our ever-changing global economy, access to information and the skills to use it are vital to ensuring that young Americans are competitive and informed citizens of the world. That is why the school library is so important in supplementing what is learned in the classroom; promoting better learning, including reading, research, library use, and electronic database skills; and providing the foundation for independent learning that allows students to achieve throughout their educational careers and their lives.  While the promise of a well-equipped school library is limitless, and its importance greater than ever, the condition of libraries today does not live up to that potential. As Linda Wood, a school library media specialist from South Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, recently noted during a Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing, school library collections are outdated and sparse. Indeed, schools across the nation are dependent on collections purchased in the mid-1960s under the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  As a result, many books in our school libraries predate the landing of manned spacecraft on the moon, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the end of Apartheid, the growth of the Internet, and advances in DNA research. In a rapidly changing world, our students are placed at a major disadvantage if the only scientific, historical, and geographical materials they have access to reflect times long gone by.  In sum, school library funding is grossly inadequate to the task of improving and supplementing collections. Library spending per student today is a small fraction of the cost of a new book. Indeed, while the average school library book costs $16, the average spending per student for books is $6.73 in elementary schools; $7.30 in middle schools; and $6.27 in high schools.  Consequently, many outdated books that should be removed from shelves cannot be, since there is no money to replace them. One case in point is California which in response to its fourth-graders being ranked second to last among 39 states on last year's National Assessment of Educational Progress has begun an effort to restock school library shelves in order to weed out old and inaccurate books, including those rife with racial stereotypes and those which proclaim ``one day, man might go to the moon''. For a long time, according to a recent Los Angeles Times article, California school librarians could not afford to take such a step because there would be no books left on the shelves. Too few states, however, are taking similar steps to improve school libraries.  My home state of Rhode Island is working on an innovative effort to ensure that students gain access to materials not available in their own school libraries. RILINK (the Rhode Island Library Information Network for Kids) gives students and teachers 24-hour Internet access to a statewide catalog of school library holdings, complete with information about the book's status on the shelf. RILINK also allows for on-line request of materials via interlibrary loan, with rapid delivery through a statewide courier system, and provides links from book information records to related Internet research sites, allowing a single book request to serve as a point of departure for a galaxy of information sources.  Unfortunately, such innovations, which could benefit schoolchildren across the nation, cannot be expanded without adequate library funding. Indeed, the only federal funding that is currently available to school libraries is the Title VI block grant, which allows expenditure for school library andinstructional materials as one of seven choices for local uses of funds. This program is slated for elimination under the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget and Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization proposal.  Mr. President, well-trained school library media specialists are also essential to helping students unlock their potential. These individuals are at the heart of guiding students in their work, providing research training, maintaining and developing collections, and ensuring that a library fulfills its potential. In addition, they have the skills to guide students in the use of the broad variety of advanced technological education resources now available.  Unfortunately, only 68% of schools have state certified library media specialists, according to Department of Education figures, and, on average, there is only one specialist for every 591 students. This shortage means that many school libraries are staffed by volunteers and are open only a few days a week.  Mr. President, the bipartisan bill I am introducing today, along with Senators Cochran, Sarbanes, Wellstone, Kennedy, Daschle, Reid, and Murray, would restore the funding that is critical to improving school libraries. The Elementary And Secondary School Library Media Resources, Training, And Advanced Technology Act directs funding to schools with the greatest need and would ensure that students have access to the informational tools they need to learn and achieve at the highest levels by providing funds to update library media resources, such as books and advanced technology, train school library media specialists, facilitate resource-sharing among school libraries, and improve collaboration between school library media specialists and teachers.  The bill also establishes the School Library Access Program to provide students with access to school libraries during non-school hours, including before and after school, weekends, and summers.  Providing access to the most up-to-date school library collections is an essential part of increasing student achievement, improving literacy skills, fostering a love of reading, and helping students become lifelong learners. The Elementary and Secondary School Library Media Resources, Training, and Advanced Technology Act, which is strongly supported by the American Library Association, will help accomplish these essential goals. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation and a letter of support written by the American Library Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1262       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Elementary and Secondary      School Library Media Resources, Training, and Advanced      Technology Assistance Act''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to improve academic achievement of students by      providing students with increased access to up-to-date school      library materials, a well-equipped, technologically advanced      school library media center, and well-trained, professionally      certified school library media specialists;       (2) to support the acquisition of up-to-date school library      media resources for the use of students, school library media      specialists, and teachers in elementary schools and secondary      schools;       (3) to provide school library media specialists with the      tools and training opportunities necessary for the      specialists to facilitate the development and enhancement of      the information literacy, information retrieval, and critical      thinking skills of students; and       (4)(A) to ensure the effective coordination of resources      for library, technology, and professional development      activities for elementary schools and secondary schools; and       (B) to ensure collaboration between school library media      specialists, and elementary school and secondary school      teachers and administrators, in developing curriculum-based      instructional activities for students so that school library      media specialists are partners in the learning process of      students.

American Library Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1999.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I would like to take this opportunity to      thank you and Senator Thad Cochran for your bi-partisan      support of school libraries as you introduce the Elementary      and Secondary School Library Media Resources, Training, and      Advanced Technology Assistance Act of 1999. This bill would      provide assistance to the nation's school libraries and      school library media specialists at a time when they are      laboring mightily to cope with the challenges of increasing      school enrollment, new technology and the lack of funding for      school library resources.       As a school librarian myself in Juneau, Alaska, I know      personally how this legislation will contribute to effective      learning by our school children. Many of the nation's school      libraries have collections that are old, inaccurate and out      of date. How can we encourage children to read and continue      to be life-long learners if the material we have available      for them is inadequate?       Your legislation proposes to upgrade collections, encourage      and train school librarians, effect greater cooperation      between school professionals directly involved in teaching      children--school library media specialists, teachers and      administrators, and encourages the sharing of resources      electronically. This critical legislation should be included      in the reauthorization process now going forward in the      Senate. The school children of today deserve the best      resources we have to give them.       On behalf of the 57,000 school, public, academic and      special librarians, library trustees, friends of libraries      and library supporters, I thank you for your efforts to      improve the resources in school libraries. We offer the      support of our members in working towards passage of the      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    Ann K. Symons,                                                        President.                                 ______                                       By
