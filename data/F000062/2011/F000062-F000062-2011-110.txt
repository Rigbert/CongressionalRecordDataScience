 President, I am very pleased to introduce today the Data Breach Notification Act of 2011.  This bill would require that consumers be notified when their sensitive personally identifiable information has been exposed in a data breach and also that law enforcement receive notice of major breaches of data security.  In 2003, California was the pioneer in requiring data breach notification. Forty-six States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands now have similar laws.  Consumers in all states deserve to benefit from these protections; businesses should not be subject to 46 different and at times conflicting laws; and Federal law enforcement critically needs to receive information about major breaches occurring across the country.  I have introduced data breach notification legislation in several prior Congresses. During the last Congress, that legislation, called the Data Breach Notification Act, S. 139, passed through the Judiciary Committee and was reported to the Senate floor. Unfortunately, the bill stalled there and went no further.  President Obama included similar data breach notification provisions in his broad cybersecurity proposal, released just last month.  The bill I am introducing today is identical to the bill I have introduced in the past. This legislation is long overdue and should finally be enacted now, during this Congress.  I have 3 points to make about this bill.  First, this bill will protect consumers, who need to know when their sensitive data has been exposed so they can take measures to protect themselves.  According to the Federal Trade Commission, between 8 and 10 million American consumers are victims of identity theft each year.  In April of 2007, a Zogby survey found that an astonishing 91 percent of adult users of the Internet said they wereconcerned that their identities might be stolen.  They have good reason to be concerned.  According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, over 500 million records containing sensitive personally identifiable information have been exposed in data breaches since 2005.  Earlier this year, a giant security breach at Epsilon, an online marketing firm, exposed the personal information of millions of American consumers, along with information about stores where they had been customers. The breach raised serious concerns that data thieves would use this personal information to subject consumers to targeted, fraudulent e-mails, used to try to trick people into turning over even more personal information.  Last year, data thieves acquired identity data on roughly 3.3 million student loan borrowers from the Educational Credit Management Corp.--a number that accounts for almost five percent of all Federal student loan recipients. The data included names, addresses, social security numbers, and other personal data, creating the opportunity for identity theft.  In 2009, Federal officials indicted three men on charges of stealing data linked to more than 130 million credit cards by hacking into five major companies' computer systems. The companies were Heartland Payment Systems, 7-Eleven, the Hannaford Brothers supermarket chain, and two other companies not named in the indictment.  The problem is getting worse, not better. Recently, one major breach hit Citibank, exposing information of more than 360,000 bankcard customers. Another massive data breach exposed information about more than 100 million Sony customers.  Nor is the problem limited to businesses. In my home state of California, the state Department of Public Health was hit by its second major data breach in this year alone, affecting thousands of current and former state employees.  It is long past time for Congress to pass a national breach notification standard to ensure that when consumers' information is at risk, they know it and can take the necessary steps to protect themselves.  Second point: what works for consumers here also is a winning proposition for the business community.  Under some estimates, the business community loses as much as 48 billion dollars each year in fraudulent transactions involving stolen identities.  Additionally, under the current legal framework, businesses must comply with 46 different State laws to determine what kind of notice is necessary when a breach occurs. As long as it is not watered down, one Federal standard makes much more sense than 46 different State laws. It would ensure consumers are notified about dangerous breaches and can protect themselves, while also giving companies one clear law to follow.  Third and finally, this bill will help Federal law enforcement officials as they work to protect our cyber security.  Jeffrey Troy, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Cyber Division, urged businesses in 2009 to support Federal breach notification legislation. As he explained, Federal officials need to receive information about data breaches in order to link those attacks to others and potentially stop similar attacks at other organizations. ``Connecting the dots'' is critical to this effort.  We live in a new world today, where attacks come not only through traditional means but also through cyberspace with hackers breaking into our electrical grid or viruses like the Conficker worm making their way through private computers across the country. It is essential that we give the FBI and other law enforcement agencies the tools they need to identify and eliminate potential cyber-threats.  The Federal Trade Commission, former President George W. Bush's Identity Theft Task Force, and the Business Software Alliance have all called for federal data breach notification legislation. The Data Breach Notification Act also has been supported by the Consumers Union and the Information Technology Association of America.  This bill will protect consumers, cut costs for businesses, and give law enforcement officials additional resources they need.  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1408       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
