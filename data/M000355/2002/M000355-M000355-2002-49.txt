 President, the news from Egypt this morning is both disappointing and disheartening. Egyptian democracy activist and academic Saad Eddin Ibrahim was sentenced to 7 years in jail following a retrial for charges, according to the BBC, ``of tarnishing the country's image abroad and other offenses.''  Many believe that the case against Mr. Ibrahim, who is a dual Egyptian-American citizen, is politically motivated and a not-so-veiled effort to stifle political debate in that country. Unfortunately, today's verdict only underscores that the rule of law and democratic institutions continue to be weak and non-functioning in Egypt.  It is my hope and expectation that Secretary Powell will clearly, publicly and forcefully register the concerns of the United States with Mr. Ibrahim's case to senior Egyptian leaders. I would offer that it is not Mr. Ibrahim but the Egyptian government--and its weak judiciary, irresponsible and anti-Semitic media, and questionable ties with North Korean missile technicians--that consistently tarnishes the country's image abroad.  To put it simply, the United States must expect more from its ally in the Middle East.                          ____________________
