President, let me associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from New Jersey. I agree with him on the seriousness of the tragedy that befell his constituents in New Jersey. Several years ago, in Rhode Island, we had a similar tragic experience at another Dominican college, Providence College, where many students were injured and several were practically killed. All of us in America extend our sympathy to these families in New Jersey and to the Seton Hall University academic community.                          ____________________
