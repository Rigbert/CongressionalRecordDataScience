  As I noted yesterday, Ms. Rushing comes with significant appellate experience and has filed 47 briefs in the U.S. Supreme Court. It is clear to me, as it was to a majority of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, that she would make a fine addition to the Federal bench. So I will support her confirmation later today, and I recommend that each of our colleagues do the same.                     Nomination of Chad A. Readler  Madam President, following Ms. Rushing, the Senate will consider Chad Readler of Ohio to serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Readler is a two-time graduate of the University of Michigan, earning his J.D. with honors in 1997. Following law school, he held a clerkship on the Sixth Circuit and has built a longstanding reputation in private practice as a consummate legal professional.  Mr. Readler is also active in pro bono work, including for the United Way of Central Ohio, and his nomination earned a ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association.  So I look forward to advancing yet another of President Trump's impressive judicial nominees later this week.                                 H.R. 1  Madam President, on another matter, this week the House will be devoting floor time to the Democrat politician protection act. That is what I call the signature effort that Speaker Pelosi has given top billing--top billing--as H.R. 1, because this new House Democratic majority's top priority is apparently assigning themselves an unprecedented level of control over how they get elected to Washington, along with how, where, and what American citizens are allowed to say about it. That is their priority No. 1.  Over there, across the Capitol, more than anything else, Washington Democrats want a tighter grip on politicaldebate and the operation of elections nationwide. But the Democrat politician protection act is just part of a trio of massive, unprecedented government takeover schemes that Democrats have already rolled out just this Congress.  On its face, this proposal might seem less outrageous than Medicare for None or the so-called Green New Deal. It wouldn't seem to impact the middle-class families as directly as making private health insurance plans illegal or sending the U.S. economy on a nosedive in the name of tackling carbon emissions while China goes roaring right by.  Here is the thing. Those two proposals are just terrible policy. Bad policy can be stopped or undone through the political process, but H.R. 1 isn't just terrible policy. It is an attempt to rewrite the underlying rules of that political process itself and skew those rules to benefit just one side--that side.  By every indication, the Democratic politician protection act is a massive, partisan solution in search of a problem. Democrats want to convince everyone that our Republic is in crisis, but when you scratch the surface of these scare tactics, their two main complaints seem to be that Democrats don't win enough elections, and people Democrats don't like also happen to have First Amendment rights.  Just look at the data. In 2016, turnout reached its third highest rate since the 1960s. Turnout was very high. By the sheer number of Presidential ballots cast, an all-time record was set, and these numbers were hardly a fluke. Last November, the midterm turnout rate set a new 50-year record for off-year elections.  Nevertheless, the Democrats are intent on fixing our elections even though they aren't broken.
