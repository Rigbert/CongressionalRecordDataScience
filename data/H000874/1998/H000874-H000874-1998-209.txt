Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and certainly want to associate my comments with his.  Section 203 also is of some concern in that it impacts on the premium pay that is earned by Customs employees. I would say to my friend from Florida, who is managing the bill, and my friend from California, I intend to vote for this bill when it comes up for a vote, voice vote or however it will be. But I will be watching very closely, as the gentleman from California indicates, what happens in conference.  Very frankly, what was done as it relates to the employees and to the integrity of the contracts that they have negotiated and entered into gives me great concern. That is not the thrust of this bill, but it is one of the tangential impacts that I think should give everybody in this House concern. I hope that in conference these concerns will be addressed, this facet of it will be fixed, so that the very positive aspects of this bill can go forward.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
