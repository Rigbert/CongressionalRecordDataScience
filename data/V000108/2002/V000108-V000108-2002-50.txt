Speaker, it is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate Mr. James ``Butch'' Blevins for histhirty-seven years of dedicated service to Ironworkers Local #395 in Hammond, Indiana. James will be honored for his strong commitment to the Ironworkers at a retirement party to be held on Saturday, April 20, 2002 at the St. Elijah Serbian-American Hall in Merrillville, Indiana. His leadership and desire for excellence in all of his activities have made James a popular figure among his fellow members, and his departure will be felt throughout the organization.  Throughout its seventy-eight year history, the devoted members of Ironworkers Local #395 have displayed the commitment and work ethic that we in Northwest Indiana value so highly. I can remember as a child hearing my father, an Ironworker himself, tell us the stories of his friends and their experiences together in the workplace. Ironworkers are a loyal, hard-working, dedicated group of individuals who strive to produce the highest quality product that is possible. James ``Butch'' Belvins has exemplified these characteristics for thirty-seven years at Local #395.  During his thirty-seven years as a member of Ironworkers Local #395, James served as an elected officer for twenty-one years. He currently holds the title of Business Agent, and also serves as the Trustee to the Health and Welfare Plan, as well as the Trustee to the Northwestern Indiana Building Trades. His active role in these positions has been a tremendous asset to his fellow union members as well as to the entire Northwest Indiana community. James also served as a Hammond Precinct Committeeman and as President of the Hammond Economic Development Committee. His personal commitment and dedication to the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional district has been outstanding.  Although he has been a devoted worker and union member, James has always put his family first. He, along with his wife, Sally, takes great pride in raising their three children, Jim, Chad, and Eric. James' retirement will allow him to spend even more time with his loved family, something he eagerly awaits.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. James ``Butch'' Blevins on his retirement after thirty-seven years of faithful and diligent service to Ironworkers Local #395 in Hammond, Indiana. James has been a valuable member to his union as well as to his community, and his service to Northwest Indiana will be greatly missed. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors, and I hope that he enjoys his retirement for many years to come.                          ____________________
