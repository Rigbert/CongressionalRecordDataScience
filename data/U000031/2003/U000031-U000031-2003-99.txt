Speaker, I rise today to recognize the brave men and women of the 415th Civil Affairs Company of the U.S. Army Reserve in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Often overlooked, our Reservists provide an invaluable service to our country and to our Armed Forces. The 415th Civil Affairs Company has been on continuous deployment for the better part of the last decade, separated from families, careers, and livelihoods. Now, these folks are being deployed to Kosovo to help keep the peace in an uncertain world. Freedom isn't free; it comes at a price--and individuals like these are the ones who bear the cost. I wish them a safe return.                          ____________________
