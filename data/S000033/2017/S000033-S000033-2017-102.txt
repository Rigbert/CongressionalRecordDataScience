 President, my staff recently had the pleasure of visiting with Jen Kimmich of The Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, VT.  The Alchemist owners Jen and John Kimmich are model employers who have shown considerable dedication toward creating positive working conditions for their employees. Their workers receive excellent benefits and working conditions, including livable wages, paid sick days, vacation time, health insurance, wellness opportunities, paid family leave, and generous retirement benefits. The Alchemist not only produces an internationally award-winning product, but it has also fostered a workplace culture where people are put before profits.  Further, I would like to thank Jen for her statewide leadership championing workers' rights. She serves on the State Workforce Development Board helping to create opportunities for good jobs in Vermont. Through her volunteer work with Main Street Alliance, Jen has advocated for paid sick leave and paid family leave legislation.  I also commend the company for developing The Alchemist Foundation.The Foundation provides college scholarships and career pathway opportunities for area youth.  I am grateful for all that they do for their employees, their community, and the entire State of Vermont. Companies across the Nation should follow in The Alchemist's footsteps by supporting workers' rights and creating a positive workplace.                          ____________________
