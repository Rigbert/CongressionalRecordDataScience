Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church as they join together in the celebration of their 75th anniversary. The festivities will begin on Saturday, January 8, 2005. The parish community of St. Francis will also host a variety of activities throughout the entire year of 2005.  In 1882 there were two churches, Catholic and Methodist that existed in Lake Station, Indiana. The first Catholic Church was located at a Way Station on the Stage Line that operated between Michigan and Joliet. It stood on the identical spot which the present church now occupies. The Way Station was listed on railroad bulletins as Lake Station. The Michigan Central Railroad was built from Detroit to Chicago in 1852, and at this time the structure was not known as a parish church but as a chapel. This building was in existence before the railroad. The original bell from the structure was stored when the building was razed and is now still in use at the present church.  Father Francis Xavier Guerre was the pastor of St. Mary of the Lake in Miller, Indiana. He was persuaded to start a mission parish in East Gary. Father Guerre founded the mission parish of St. Francis Xavier in 1930, and Bishop John F. Noll dedicated the church in 1931. The name St. Francis Xavier was in honor of Father Guerre's patron saint. The parish continued as a mission until 1941, when Bishop appointed Father Francis Quinn as its resident pastor.  In 1950 Father Koors planned for the enlargement of the existing church and the erection of a Parochial School. However, Father Koors needed a written guarantee that nuns would be available to teach in the school. Six orders of nuns were contacted before a written guarantee was received from Mother Emily of the Poor Sisters of St. Francis of Seraph. Mother Emily persuaded her Council to give the necessary written guarantee for the Sisters to teach at St. Francis Xavier. On September 5, 1956, the St. Francis Xavier School was officially opened for classes. The School was dedicated and blessed on November 11, 1956 by Bishop Pursley.  In 1984, Father Robert Evers became the Pastor of the St. Francis. Father Evers reopened the ``Center'' and procured the help of the Jesuits to service the Spanish community with week-end and daily masses. When the Jesuits left, liturgies were again celebrated in the main church. Father Evers retired in June 2004 after serving the parish for 20 years. The proud parishioners are thankful for the spiritual and emotional leadership he and the previous pastors have provided during the years.  The present church's beautiful interior features sculptured statues of the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the Infant of Prague, and St. Theresa. The beautiful, dimly-lit interior is illuminated by sunlight through the stained-glass window and dozens of votive candles flicker through ruby and sapphire tinted globes. The present pastor, Reverend J. Anthony Valtierra and his congregation continue to serve the needs of the citizens of Northwest Indiana. By offering service and guidance to others, the members of St. Francis Xavier Church have proven their sincere dedication and motivation for assisting others in need.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. Francis Xavier Church on their 75th anniversary. They have provided support and guidance for all those in the community. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E8]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]         75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.
