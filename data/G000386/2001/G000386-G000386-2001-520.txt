 REID. If I could say to my friend, it was just brought to my attention that there could be some parliamentary move, for example, to table the Smith amendment and that, of course, would not be in keeping with what the Senator just said. The intent is to have a vote on or in relation to the Smith amendment first. That would be the regular order.
