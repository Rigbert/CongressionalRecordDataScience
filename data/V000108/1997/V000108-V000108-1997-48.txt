Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and unable to vote on rollcall Nos. 523 through 525. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall No. 523, the Rangel amendment to H.R. 2646; ``no'' on rollcall No. 524, passage of H.R. 2646; and ``yes'' on rollcall No. 525, in support of House Resolution 276, offered by Democratic Leader Gephardt regarding the Sanchez-Dornan case.                          ____________________
