To me, this amendment is compatible with what he is trying to do. It merely defines an earmark as an appropriation that has not been authorized.  My junior Senator said on the Senate floor a year ago that, in a way that is good, because if a bad earmark comes up, we have two shots at it--one on authorization and one on appropriation. Senator Toomey, Senator McCain, and others have been supportive of the idea that we should go back to authorizing.  We have been fighting this battle since 1816, and it is time we end it. This is a way of doing it, merely defining it as an earmark that hasn't been authorized. I retain the remainder of my time.
