I just took her phone calls and talked to Mr. Pallone and talked to Mr. Shimkus from time to time. Mary Frances Repko is one of the hardest working staff members. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mary Frances for the work that she did to get us to where we are. It is not perfect, as she and I agree, but it is a bill that will be better than what we have.  I want to thank, of course, Ranking Member Pallone; my dear friend, Chairman Upton; my friend, John Shimkus, the chairman of the committee; and Mr. Tonko, who is not for this bill. He worked hard to get it to this place. He didn't get there, but he worked hard on that effort.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a work product that has been sincerely achieved by people of goodwill, and it is adjudged by the President of the United States and the administration and by the director of the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as a significant and important step forward. That is a good deal for the American people.
