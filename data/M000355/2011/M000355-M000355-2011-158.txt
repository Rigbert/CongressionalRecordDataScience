 It is with great sadness that I report to my Senate colleagues that Owsley Brown II of Louisville, KY, passed away September 26 at the age of 69. He will be mourned and missed by many, not only by his family and those fortunate enough to know him but also by the countless Louisvillians who did not get to meet the man personally but benefited from his numerous volunteer efforts and initiatives on behalf of our community.  Owsley Brown II was born in 1942, the son of William Lee Lyons Brown and Sally Shallenberger Brown, who herself passed away just a few months ago at the age of 100, as I noted at the time on the Senate floor. After graduating from Yale University and Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, Owsley spent 37 years at Brown Forman, the company his great-grandfather founded, including 12 years as chief executive and 12 years as chairman. He started at Brown Forman in 1961 as a summer employee.  Owsley continued a family legacy that dates back to Brown Forman's founding in 1870. Brown Forman is one of Louisville's most significant companies and a major corporate citizen of our community. It provides almost 1,200 local jobs and still makes whiskey in Jefferson County.  As CEO, Owsley was a visionary in expanding the company's international footprint and modernizing the marketing of its brands. As a result, labels such as Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort are now recognized worldwide. Under his leadership, Brown Forman stock more than quadrupled in value.  But to describe Owsley as merely a businessman, even a brilliant one, would be to just scrape the surface of the ice cube in a tall glass of Old Forester bourbon with water--Owsley's favorite drink. With his wife Christy, he did much to improve the quality and character of life in Louisville. He led organizations to support art and music, historic preservation and environmental protection. He was a leader in the founding of Actors Theatre of Louisville and a longtime board member. He served on the board of the Speed Art Museum and was active in the Fund for the Arts and River Fields. His family's Owsley Brown Charitable Foundation, of which he was president, gave millions of dollars to local churches and community groups.  Owsley did a lot more than just write checks. He was passionately involved in everything he took part in. As the Actors Theatre board president, he was often seen cleaning the windows or moving props. His deep knowledge of art came in handy on visits to art fairs on behalf of the Speed Art Museum. He could inspire others to donate more of their time, efforts, and resources on behalf of the causes he cared so deeply about just by setting the example.  I first met Owsley more than 30 years ago and saw then that he represented the very best Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky have to offer. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to his family, including his wife Christy, his three children: Owsley III, Brooke Barzun, and Augusta Holland, and his many other beloved family members and friends.  Madam President, the Louisville Courier-Journal published recently an obituary of Owsley Brown II that only begins to describe a full life well lived. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Courier-Journal, Sept. 29, 2011]                            Brown, Owsley II       Brown, Owsley II, 69, died September 26, 2011, in      Louisville with his family by his side.       Mr. Brown was born September 10, 1942, the son of William      Lee Lyons Brown and Sara ``Sally'' Shallenberger. He was a      graduate of Woodberry Forest School, Yale University, where      he received his B.A. in history in 1964, and Stanford      University's Graduate School of Business.       The great-grandson of Brown-Forman Corporation founder      George Garvin Brown, Owsley spent 37 years of his      professional life with the company, starting as a summer      employee in 1961. He became president in 1983, chief      executive officer from 1993-2005 and chairman from 1995 until      2007. While at the helm of the company, he led efforts to      dramatically expand its international presence and      significantly modernized its marketing efforts. The strategy      worked exceptionally well, as brands such as Jack Daniel's,      Southern Comfort and Finlandia became internationally      recognized names, producing stellar financial returns.       He served as an Army intelligence officer at the Pentagon      from 1966-1968 and in 2010 was appointed by the Obama      Administration to serve on the U.S. Department of Defense      Business Board. In addition to his service on the Brown-     Forman board, Owsley served on the board of NACCO Industries,      Inc.       Owsley was a leader in the founding of Actors Theatre of      Louisville and a longtime board member, twice serving as      president during major fund drives as it built its      facilities. He served on the boards of the Speed Art Museum,      where he most recently headed up the Capital Campaign and      Building Committee for its expansion; Fund for the Arts (as      chairman and president); Kentucky Center for the Performing      Arts; and Partnership for Creative Economies. Previous boards      he served on include River Fields, the Advisory Council of      the Yale School of Forestry and Environment and the National      Council of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He      also served on the International Council of Trustees for the      World Conference of Religions for Peace. He was a former      director of the Louisville Gas and Electric Company and its      successor LG&E.       He received the Governor's Milner Award, Kentucky's highest      award for contributions to the culture of his state, and this      year received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate      Citizenship. Also this year he and his wife Christy received      the Greater Louisville Inc.'s Gold Cup Award for      distinguished service to Louisville. He earned the J. Russell      Groves Citizens Laureate Award, honoring individuals who      consistently encourage quality architecture in their      communities. His lifetime interest in historic preservation      was demonstrated in many projects, including the restoration      and expansion of Actors Theatre of Louisville.       He is survived by his wife, Christina Lee; son, Owsley III      (Victoire) and their children Chiara, William and Catalina;      daughters, Brooke Barzun (Matthew) and their children,      Jacques, Eleanor and Charles; and Augusta Holland (Gill) and      their children Cora, Owsley and Lila; brothers, W. L. Lyons      Brown Jr. (Alice Cary) and Martin S. Brown; sister, Ina Brown      Bond (Mac); brother-in-law, O'Donnell Lee (Jeanie); and      numerous nephews, nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces.       Owsley will be remembered as profoundly wise, earned from a      life of curiosity, honesty, and discipline. From his wisdom      flowed humility and passionate kindness. It made him a great      leader, father, husband and friend, and it made him a great      man.       He loved and supported the things that enrich the soul and      spirit--his wife and children, the creative arts, the natural      world, public-spirited enterprises, and, above all,      Louisville. Nothing pleased him more than bringing all these      things together at a party--welcoming all with his special      brand of Kentucky hospitality. He knew how to find joy in      work and obligations. Owsley knew when to listen and when to      laugh.       He will be missed.       The funeral will be celebrated 10 a.m. Friday at Christ      Church Cathedral, Episcopal, 421 S. Second St., with private      burial to follow. Visitation will be 3-6 p.m. Thursday at the      Speed Art Museum, 2035 S. Third St. Funeral arrangements are      being handled by A.D. Porter & Sons, Inc.       In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy may be made to      either Fund for the Arts or Metro United Way.  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
