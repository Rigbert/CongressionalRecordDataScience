President, now that we have passed legislation to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, it is time for the Senate to consider another bill of critical importance to America's businesses: The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507.  The patent bill has been stalled by Republican holds for over a year. It is time that the Senate turn to it and reform our patent laws. The patent bill was based on a proposal submitted by the Clinton Administration several years ago. It was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 22, 1997, with a favorable vote of 17-1 and has the support of every Democrat on the Committee. Its co-sponsors, in addition to myself, include Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin and Lieberman.  The patent bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. It would slash red tape in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); ensure that American inventors are not disadvantaged as compared to foreign inventors by requiring patent applications to be published in the U.S. at the same time they are published abroad; reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; and require the PTO to develop statewide computer networks with remote library sites to enhance access to electronic patent information for independent inventors and small businesses in rural states.  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill be one that helps them just as much as it helps the larger companies. I talked to independent inventors and representatives of smaller companies to see what reforms they recommended. I invited the President of the Vermont Inventors Association to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on this bill, and I have tried to make sure that the sound recommendations of small businesses and independent inventors were incorporated in the Hatch-Leahy substitute that the Judiciary Committee reported to the Senate over one year ago.  The White House Conference on Small Businesses, which consists of over 2,000 delegates elected from hundreds of thousands of active small businesses nationwide; the National Association of Women Business Owners; the Small Business Technology Coalition; National Small Business United; the National Venture Capital Association; and the American Small Business Coalition for Patent Reform have concluded that, if enacted, this bill will be of great benefit to small businesses.  What is holding up floor consideration of the bill? I think it is time to debate this bill on the merits. The Senate Republican leadership should schedule prompt action on this important measure.  Our nation's economic prosperity in the coming years will depend on our abilities to invent and protect those inventions through our intellectual property laws. American innovators face global competition, and they need updated laws to continue to lead the world. This modernization of our patent laws is an important component of that essential effort. Along with the legislation the Senate recently approved to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, this bill goes a long way to protecting American ingenuity in the next century. Democrats have been ready to proceed to consider this measure for over a year. With less than 53 legislative days left in this session, I urge the Republican leadership to work with us to schedule action on this important bill.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of letters of support for the patent bill and a few examples from those letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  List of Letters of Support of the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507       White House Conference on Small Businesses.

Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The White House Conference on Small      Business consists of over 2000 delegates elected from      hundreds of thousands of active small businesses nationwide.      We are the elected technology chairs of the WHCSB and we are      charged with, among other things, representing the interests      of small business on matters of intellectual property      protection.       The issue of patent reform is one of great concern to small      manufacturers and technology enterprises. Over the past two      years, we have been working to make modifications to the      patent reform bills in both Houses so that they are small-     business friendly.       We are pleased to hear that an amendment has been offered      addressing our concerns with S. 507. We believe that S. 507,      as amended, will lower the litigation costs for small      business, make it easier to know what areas of technology are      open for innovation, and will go a long way towards giving us      a more level playing field vis-a-vis our foreign competitors.      We wholeheartedly support passage of the bill and appreciate      the attention and support you have given to small business.           Sincerely,         The White House Conference on Small Business Technology            Chairs: Pat McDonnell, Region I; Ed Wenger, Region II;            Jim Woo, Region II; Bill Budinger, Region III; Wanda            Gozdz, Region IV; Rob Risser, Region V; Wayne Barlow,            Region VIII; Marianne Hamm, Region IX; Chuck Harlowe,            Region X.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                        Women Business Owners,                                     Silver Spring, June 23, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Attached please find a copy of the      April 28 letter sent to Senator Orrin Hatch by NAWBO      leadership. This letter expresses the position of NAWBO, on      behalf of our membership, regarding S.507 and its impact on      small business. The letter contains a series of proposed      amendments that NAWBO feels are in the best interest of small      business owners and for which we would greatly appreciate      your support in the upcoming debate on this legislation.       On behalf of NAWBO members and other small business owners,      thank you for your time and efforts regarding this issue. If      we may be of further assistance please feel free to contact      Debra Hickerson in our national office at (301) 608-2590.           Sincerely,                                      Diahann W. Lassus, CPA, CFP,                                                        President.                                       ____                                           National Association of                                        Women Business Owners,                                Silver Spring, MD, April 28, 1998.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: The National Association of Women      Business Owners (NAWBO) and its alliance The Small Business      Technology Coalition (SBTC) met with the White House      Conference on Small Business (WHCSB) Technology Chairs to      review S. 507 and its impact on small business. NAWBO      supported intellectual property protection as one of the      issues at the White House Conference.       The issue of patent reform is one of great concern to small      manufacturers and technology enterprises and to all small      businesses in general. When a new patent is filed it provides      the potential for a new product to come to market. This in      turn gives small and medium size businesses the opportunity      to be awarded contracts that generate and provide jobs that      stimulate our economy.       America's 8 million women business owners are primarily      small and medium size companies that generate $2.3 trillion      dollars in sales and employ 18.5 million people in the United      States. Therefore, in order to insure the growth of the      American economy we need to protect our inventors.       It is, therefore, our belief that the proposed series of      amendments to S. 507 which if enacted, would make this bill      of great benefit to small businesses.       There are three amendments:       1. Title IV--Prior Domestic Commercial Use. We offer an      amendment in the form of a substitution. The amendment      reorganizes, clarifies and simplifies the wording. The      substantive difference is that the amendment removes the      opportunity which is presently in S. 507 to use a PDCU      defense when the prior user has only made ``effective and      serious preparation'' to commercialize the invention. With      this section removed, the prior use defense only applies to      technology that was actually reduced to practice at least one      year prior to the patent priority date and in commercial use      before the patent's priority date. With this amendment, PDCU      performs its important function of preventing patents from      being mis-used to take the property of others.       2. A new title adding language to 102(g)--Section 104 of      the existing U.S. patent law arguably allows a foreign      inventor to dodge the restrictions that 102(g) places on a      U.S. inventor. The suggested change to 102(g) will make it      clear that foreign inventors are also subject to the      restriction of 102(g) so that they cannot claim priority      dates to inventions that they have abandoned, suppressed or      concealed.       3. Title I--The make-up of the Management Advisory Board.      We add language to ensure that the proportion of      representatives on the board from small and large entities      reflects their respective proportion of patent applications      filed.       With these changes, we believe that S. 507 will lower the      litigation costs for small business, make it easier to know      what areas of technology are open for innovation, and will go      a long way toward giving us a more level playing field vis-a-     vis our foreign competitors.       With these changes, we will enthusiastically support S.      507.           Sincerely,         Barbara Kasoff, VP, Public Policy Council; Carol Barrows,            Secretary, Public Policy Council; Janie Emerson,            Director, Public Policy Council; Joan W.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The Small Business Technology Coalition      is made up of research-intensive, technology-based small      business leaders. We serve as a voice for the interests of      small high-technology firms both in Washington, DC and      throughout the United States.       The issue of patent reform is one of great concern to our      members. Since our formation 2 years ago, we have spent a      great deal of time examining the various patent bills in both      Houses. We have met with several groups including the IPO,      21st Century Patent Coalition, NAM and AIPLA and have come to      consensus on issues surrounding the bill.       We understand that an amendment has been offered and      believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the litigation      costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas      of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way      towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our      foreign competitors. We wholeheartedly support passage of the      bill and appreciate the attention and support you have given      to small business.           Sincerely,                                                     James T. Woo,     Chairman.                                  ____                               National Small Business United,                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: National Small Business United is      America's oldest, bipartisan, advocacy association and      represents the interests of 65,000 small businesses. Many of      our member companies are in the high-technology sector. The      issue of patent reform is one of great concern to small      manufacturers and technology enterprises. We have worked      closely with both the White House Conference on Small      Business (WHCSB) Technology Chairs and the Small Business      Technology Coalition, and share their views on pending patent      reform legislation.       We are pleased to hear that an amendment, incorporating the      changes requested by the WHCSB Technology Chairs, has been      offered addressing small business concerns with S. 507. We      believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the litigation      costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas      of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way      towards giving American small business a more level playing      field vis-a-vis our foreign competitors.       Again, as a representative of small business who rely on      the patent system, NSBU wholeheartedly supports and urges the      passage of the bill and appreciates the attention and support      you have given to small business.           Sincerely,                                                   Todd McCracken,     President.                                  ____                                                  National Venture                                          Capital Association,                                                     May 29, 1998.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Shelby: Over the past several years the      National Venture Capital Association has actively worked to      enhance the existing patent term in a manner that would      permit biomedical companies to enjoy full 20 year patent      protection. In this regard, NVCA has long supported S. 507,      the patent reform bill which, in part, would give biomedical      companies a greater opportunity to fall within the full 20      year patent protection granted under the GATT/TRIPS law      enacted in 1994.       A significant portion of venture capital investments in the      United States are made in the biopharmaceutical and medical      device fields. In fact, almost one-quarter of the $12 billion      invested by venture capitalists last year in emerging      companies went into these fields. These companies are the      cutting edge of biotechnology and medical innovation. They      are giving new and renewed hope for people across virtually      the entire spectrum of diseases and afflictions.       To venture capitalists, patents play a fundamental and      critical role in the availability of capital and our      willingness to invest in biotechnology and medical devices.      The reason for such dependency upon patents is that they      provide the favorable economics required to justify      substantial capital investment for successful product      development. The lack of, or the shorter the term of, a      patent decreases the attractiveness of a company from the      investors' perspective.       S. 507, voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a      17-1 vote, gives the NVCA members the confidence to invest in      medical-based companies. The bill is vital to biotechnology      patents. NVCA, as well as many in the high technology and      inventor communities believe that the few remaining issues      can be quickly resolved. Questions regarding contentious      matters such as prior user rights can be addressed and      debated on the Senate floor through a carefully planned time      agreement. Moreover, the prior user rights provision could be      modified on the Senate floor to address the concerns of those      who still have questions about the provision. However, none      of this can be accomplished without an agreement to bring S.      507 to the Senate floor for debate and a vote.       It was unfortunate that S. 507 could not have been part of      the highly successful Senate ``Technology Week'' that      Majority Leader Lott orchestrated several weeks ago, as S.      507 truly is of concern to the high technology community.      Moreover, the overwhelming support witnessed in the House      combined with the clear mandate the Senate Judiciary      Committee voiced in approving this patent legislation      demonstrates the wide and bi-partisan support for patent      reform.       On behalf of emerging growth companies, we urge you to      support S. 507 and work to see that it can be brought to the      Senate floor for debate and a vote as soon as possible.           Sincerely,                                              M. Kathleen Behrens,     President.                                  ____                                                      21st Century                                             Patent Coalition,                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 1997.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: We, the chief executives of 48 American      companies, are writing to express our strong support for S.      507 (Hatch/Leahy), the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997'', and to      urge you to schedule a vote before the Senate adjourns this      fall.       S. 507 makes several major improvements in U.S. patent law      that will greatly benefit American companies and inventors.      The bill (1) insures at least 17 years of exclusive rights to      diligent patent owners, (2) eliminates wasteful duplication      of R by requiring early publication of patent applications     that are also published in foreign countries, (3) protects      investments in processes and factory equipment of American      manufacturers by creating a prior user defense, (4) provides      a low-cost, speedy alternative to district court litigation      by strengthening the Patent and Trademark Office's      reexamination procedure, and (5) improves efficiency of the      Patent and Trademark Office.       The substance of this bill has been debated in many      Congressional hearings since the beginning of the 104th      Congress. The House passed a companion bill earlier this year      and S. 507 was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary      Committee by a vote of 17 to 1.       S. 507 enjoys strong bipartisan support, despite the      substantial misinformation that has surrounded it. It is time      for the Senate to vote on this bill, which will strengthen      the U.S. economy and keep jobs in America.
