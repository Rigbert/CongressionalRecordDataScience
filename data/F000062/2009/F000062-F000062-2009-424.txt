 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Accelerated Retirement of Inefficient Vehicles Act.'' This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Susan Collins and Charles Schumer. A companion bill is also being introduced today in the House of Representatives by Mr. Israel and Mr. Inslee.  Let me first acknowledge the important role of one of my colleagues, Senator Salazar, who initiated much of the thought and drafting for this legislation at the end of the last Congress. I thank him for his leadership, and I thank him for letting us take up the work needed to move this bill forward as he begins to transition into his new role with the incoming Obama administration.  Last Congress, we successfully enacted legislation--which I authoredwith Senator Snowe and others--to improve the fuel efficiency of America's fleet of new cars, trucks and SUVs by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years, or from 25 miles per gallon to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.  But the fact is that we face real challenges with trying to encourage drivers to trade in their older, less fuel efficient vehicles for a cleaner and more fuel efficient vehicle--particularly in this tough economic climate.  This bill is designed to address that problem.  First, let me explain this legislation.  This bill would establish an incentive program at the Department of Energy to provide a voucher, or coupon, of between $2,500 to $4,500 to a consumer who trades in an inefficient, used vehicle for a much more efficient car, truck, or SUV.  The traded-in vehicles--which must be then dismantled or scrapped--must meet the following requirements; have a fuel economy of no more than 18 miles per gallons, be in drivable condition, and have been registered for at least the past 120 days.  To receive the benefit of the coupon, purchased vehicles must exceed Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, Standards for that class of vehicle by at least 25 percent and have a suggested retail price below $45,000.  The size of the coupon varies based upon the expected oil savings created by trading in the vehicle.  The voucher program will be set up to provide larger credits to new, more recent vehicles that would otherwise be on the road for many more years, while older ``clunker'' models would be eligible for smaller credits.  The bill specifies that during the first year of the program, vouchers will be issued for the following amounts: For model year 2002 and later: new vehicle: $4,500, used vehicle: $3,000, transit fare credit: $3,000. For model year 1999-2001: new vehicle: $3,000, used vehicle: $2,000, transit fare credit: $2,000. For model year 1998 and earlier: new vehicle: $2,500, used vehicle: $1,500, transit fare credit: $1,500. In each subsequent year, 2010, 2011, and 2012, the model years would be advanced by 1 year.  Vouchers would be eligible for redemption for up to 2 years after the date of issuance, and no individual would be eligible to obtain more than one voucher in any 3-year period.  Dealers, dismantlers and scrap recycling facilities would also be eligible for a payment of $50 per vehicle, or an alternative amount to be specified by the Secretary of Energy.  Simply put, this legislation offers a unique opportunity to both stimulate automobile industry sales and reduce vehicular oil use, creating a win-win policy for all involved.  As we know, our Nation's automobile industry is in serious trouble.  Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford have all asserted in their recent viability plans that their dire financial situation is a direct result of the collapse in automobile sales.  The new car sales rate has dropped to less than 11 million vehicles sold annually, compared to the 16.2 million vehicles sold in the United States in 2007.  The major Detroit and Japanese carmakers all reported double digit sales drops for December. General Motors reported sales dropped 31 percent; Ford Motor Co. reported a drop of 32 percent; Chrysler LLC reported sales plummeted 53 percent; Honda Motor Co. said its sales fell 34 percent; Nissan North America said its sales fell 30 percent and Toyota Motor Co. said its U.S. sales fell 37 percent.  Bottom line: The automobile companies are all in trouble because far fewer people are buying automobiles.  According to J.D. Power and Associates, this has produced dealer lots full of vehicles that can't be sold. Over the past year the number of days that a vehicle sits on a lot has almost doubled.  The problem is most severe for Chrysler, GM and Ford. Their vehicles all sat on dealer lots for in excess of 100 days last year.  By encouraging automobile sales, this legislation would go a long way to addressing the significant troubles that America's once mighty car industry now faces.  While emergency bridge loans help auto companies make payroll, only stimulating automobile sales will cure the disease that confronts the automobile sector.  By creating a voucher system for the purchase of a vehicle with certain attributes, this legislation would stimulate sales at precisely the right moment.  Perhaps that is why General Motors went out of its way to endorse this kind of program in its recent Viability Plan, recommended ``tax credits for scrapping older, higher-carbon emitting vehicles.''  This legislation would also assist owners of the least efficient vehicles who are least likely to trade their cars in for something more efficient.  The trade-in value of inefficient vehicles has plummeted, making a trade-in financially difficult.  In a November 2008 analysis, Kelley Blue Book concluded: ``[T]his year's vehicles with the lowest retained value include vehicles that are not fuel friendly with large V-8 engines. . . . These gas misers . . . will only maintain 20 percent of their original value after five years of ownership.''  Bottom line: The legislation is stimulus of the most important kind. It would provide incentives for new vehicle sales, incentivize the trade-in of inefficient vehicles, and reward consumers who want to reduce their oil use and carbon footprint.  This proposal also provides important benefits for the environment--and addressing the challenges of climate change.  I have been a long time champion of increasing fuel economy standards, and I was extremely proud to have authored the new fuel economy law with Senator Snowe, which was enacted by Congress and signed into law in December 2007.  But new CAFE standards will not take effect until model year 2011. They cannot make up for our failure to increase standards for the past 3 decades.  The bill we are introducing today would target the very vehicles that CAFE standards are unable to reach: older fuel-inefficient cars, trucks and SUVs  It will provide incentives to consumers who wish to buy the most efficient vehicles available during the 2 years before the new CAFE standards will require improvement.  It will provide incentives to remove the most inefficient vehicles that would have never been part of the fleet had Congress acted to increase CAFE standards 5 years ago.  The result is considerable oil savings and significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.  According to analysis by the non-partisan American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, ACEEE, by 2013 this legislation would prompt the trade in of between 500,000 and 1 million of the dirtiest, least efficient vehicles on the road today.  As a result, by 2013 between 40,000 and 80,000 fewer barrels of oil per day will be burned; between 6.6 million metric tons and 13.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year will not be emitted.  This is the equivalent of removing between 1.1 million and 2.2 million cars from the road.  In our current economic and environmental circumstance, there are few opportunities to both help the automobile industry evolve and improve the fuel economy of the fleet.  This idea--providing consumers with an incentive to trade in their inefficient vehicle for something far better--will stimulate the economy and save oil, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  I strongly encourage the Obama administration and the Appropriations Committee to authorize and fund this proposal in the stimulus.  I am committed to advancing the goals of stimulus and fuel savings, and have put what I believe to be the best proposal to meet these goals.  I understand that within the details of this idea, there may be different views. I am open to suggestions that improve the structure of the program proposed by this legislation, and ask my colleagues to communicate their thoughts soon.  Finally, I hope non-related matters--such as trade policy--will not prevent my colleagues from supporting this legislation.
