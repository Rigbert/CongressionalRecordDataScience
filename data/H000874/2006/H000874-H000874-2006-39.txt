I understand there are a lot of bills that are possible, and we appreciate that fact and appreciate his working with us to try to accommodate Members on both sides.  Two last things. Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Peterson have been very concerned, as you know, about the drought and the stress that many of our farmers in rural areas of our country have been experiencing. There has been a lot of discussion about assistance that we could give. Is there any contemplation that next week we might be able to consider an emergency disaster assistance bill, H.R. 5099, that will help our farmers and ranchers who have been badly hurt by floods, droughts and other natural disasters?
