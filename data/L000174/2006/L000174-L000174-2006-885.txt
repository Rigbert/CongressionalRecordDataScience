President, will the Senator yield on that one point? I totally agree with what he said about Senator Specter, who has been an example not just to the other 99 Senators but to the whole country.  I am going to be honored to present him with an award, Tracy's Kids, awarding him for, among other things, primarily the example he has set for the rest of the country that somebody can face a very serious crisis and handle it with courage, dignity, and stalwartness. To all the people who suffer various forms of cancer--the distinguished Senator knows personally, and I know a dear member of my family--this kind of inspiration helps a great deal.  I cannot thank the Senator from Alaska enough for the words he just said.
