 President, 204 years ago, Thomas Jefferson took the oath of office as President of the United States in this very Capitol. He was the first President ever to do so. As he walked from a boardinghouse on Pennsylvania Avenue toward this building on the morning of his inauguration, he must have marveled at what was about to take place.  For the first time in American history, power was changing hands from one party--the Federalists--to the other, the Democratic-Republicans. John Adams willingly left office. No shots were fired, and no monarchs were hanged. Unlike their brethren in Europe, Americans, under our glorious Constitution, had mastered the peaceful transfer of authority from one faction to another. Jefferson called his election the ``revolution of 1800,'' brought about ``by the rational and peaceful instruments of reform, the suffrage of the people.''  But America's tradition of this peaceful transfer of power is now being challenged.
