President, I rise today to commend the communities of St. Louis and Southwestern Illinois region for winning the Air Mobility Command Community Support--Award also known as the Abilene Trophy--for their support of Scott Air Force Base in 2012.  The Abilene Trophy is presented annually to a civilian community recognized for providing outstanding support to a nearby US Air Force Air Mobility Command base. The award has been presented every year since 1998 and highlights the role our communities play in support of our service men and women and their families.  Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, IL, is home to the 375th Air Mobility Wing, the Air Force Reserve Command's 932nd Airlift Wing, and the Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing. Scott Air Force Base also headquarters major military organizations such as USTRANSCOM, the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center, and the Air Mobility Command. Winning the prestigious Abilene Trophy is particularly meaningful, given the multiple missions supported there.  The nomination package for the Abilene Trophy cited over 270 examples of how the surrounding communities have supported military personnel at the base, including in-kind donations such as $500,000 worth of documented material aid through the H.E.R.O.E.S. Care program. Partnerships were built that could help servicemembers and their families find appropriate resources. Servicemembers and their families were recognized by major league sports teams such as the Cardinals and the Rams and by community schools and businesses. Countless other examples of generosity, support and gratitude from the community have provided financial, physical, and emotional support throughout the year.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who have sacrificed their lives or go to work every day to protect our country. I am proud to support those who have done so much for our Nation and am just as proud of those communities that do the same.  Congratulations to the Southwestern Illinois and St. Louis regions on winning the Abilene Trophy. Tomorrow's awards ceremony reminds us of your commitment to our servicemembers at Scott Air Force Base and to our military families.                          ____________________
