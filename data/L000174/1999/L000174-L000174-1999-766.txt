President, on March 16, the American Ireland Fund hosted a dinner to honor Senator Edward Kennedy and his longstanding efforts to promote peaceful and constructive change throughout Ireland. The individuals that gathered together that night--Taoiseach Bertie Ahearn, Nobel Prize Winners John Hume and David Trimble, Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlan, among many others--are the best indication of the significant progress that has been made to replace violence and mistrust with cooperation and dialogue. It is also an indication of the Irish community's high esteem for Senator Kennedy and his key role in bringing the parties to the negotiating table. While differences still impede full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, pride in Ireland's past and present, and a strong commitment to a peaceful and prosperous future was the common bond that united all of those in attendance on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day.  Mr. President, Senator Christopher Dodd was among those who introduced Senator Kennedy that night, and I ask that Senator Dodd's insightful remarks from the evening be printed in the Record.  The remarks follow:       Members of the clergy, leaders of Ireland--both north and      south--with a particularly warm welcome to the Taoiseach,      Bertie Ahern, my colleagues from Congress, members of the      diplomatic corps, members of the Kennedy family--Eunice      Kennedy Shriver, Ethel Kennedy, my colleague in the House of      Representatives, Patrick Kennedy, and a special welcome to      the former American Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith, and a      warm welcome to the light of our honoree's eyes, Vicki      Kennedy; distinguished guests and friends, and, while he is      not with us this evening, a particularly warm greeting to the      President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton;      and, last but not least, our honoree, the recipient of the      National Leadership Award, my colleague and best friend in      the Senate, Ted Kennedy.       At the outset, I want to commend the American Ireland Fund      for the marvelous work it has done on behalf of the people of      Ireland;       Secondly, I want to pay a special tribute to the two most      recent recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize who are with us      this evening and ask you to join me in expressing our      admiration for the work that these two men have done for      peace in Northern Ireland and will continue to do--John Hume      and David Trimble.       As we gather here tonight on the Eve of Saint Patrick's Day      to honor Ted Kennedy with the International Leadership Award,      I want to begin by recalling the ancient Kennedy/Fitzgerald      Gaelic Prayer:     For you who are with us, may God turn your fortunes bright;     For you who are against us, may God turn your hearts toward            us;     And if God cannot turn your hearts, may He at least turn your            ankles,     So we may know you by your limp!       I have the unique pleasure of presenting to you tonight a      man with whom I have served in the United States Senate for      nearly twenty years.       Most of you know the classic story of success in American      politics:       Born of a poor and obscure family; deprived of all but the      barest necessities; forced to quit school to support the      family and finally overcoming all odds working his way      through College by waiting tables in the cafeteria.       You know that story. So does Ted Kennedy. But he never let      it get in the way. He knew there was another way to do      things. And somehow even through he did none of those things,      he got elected to the Senate in 1962 when the previous      Senator changed his address. And for these past 37 years what      a record he has compiled.       He was a friend of Ireland when friends of Ireland were      few. In fact, he--and his family--have presided so long and      so firmly at the confluence of Ireland and America that a      writer in the Irish Times recently observed that it was      sometimes difficult to tell whether Senator Kennedy's      distinguished sister was the United States' Ambassador to      Ireland or Ireland's Ambassador to the United States.       There is a reason for this, and it's quite simple.      Throughout the adult lives of most people in this room, Ted      Kennedy has worked unremittingly, day in and day out, to      better the lot of the least fortunate of our fellow men and      women. Ted Kennedy's efforts regularly reach across the      borders of nation, race and religion.       It was only natural, then, that the conflict and injustice      in Northern Ireland would make a claim on Senator Kennedy's      conscience. His unceasing interest in achieving peace in      Northern Ireland was, and is, the one constant over the many      ups and downs on the still fragile road to resolving that      conflict.       Ted Kennedy's efforts to find the path to peace have not      been limited by the category of nationality. He labors not      only as a distinguished representative of the United States,      and a loyal son of Ireland, but as an ambassador from what      the Irish poet Seamus Heaney refers to as ``the Republic of      Conscience.''       ``The Republic of Conscience'', according to Heaney's poem      of that name, is a quiet place, and one where you might meet      some of your ancestors. According to Heaney's narrator:     When I landed in the Republic of Conscience;     It was so noiseless when the engines stopped;     I could hear a curlew high above the runway.     At Immigration, the clerk was an old man;     Who produced a wallet from his homespun coat;     And showed me a photograph of my grandfather.       When Heaney's narrator was leaving the republic, that old      man told him what all of us here tonight would tell Senator      Kennedy, namely that he is a ``dual citizen'' and, therefore,      on permanent assignment. Heaney's narrator put it this way:      The Republic of Conscience     . . . Desired me when I got home;     To consider myself a representative;     And to speak on their behalf in my own tongue.     Their embassies, he said, were everywhere;     But operated independently;     And no Ambassador would ever be relieved.       Teddy, you will never be relieved of your portfolio to      speak on behalf of the ``Republic of Conscience'' for the      rights of those least able to speak for themselves, and to      continue your splendid work in furthering peace and      reconciliation in Ireland and in the United States.       Reflecting on the way you have led so many of your      colleagues over so many years--many of whom are here      tonight--down the tortured path that must inevitably lead to      peace, I am reminded of the figure of the great Irish poet,      William Butler Yeats, standing amidst the portraits of his      contemporaries in the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Art, and      urging history to judge him not on this or that isolated deed      but to:     Think where man's glory most begins and ends;     And say my glory was I had such friends.       I know that all of us here tonight are proud to say that it      is our glory to have you, Teddy, as our friend, and      unstinting friend of the United States, an unwavering friend      of Ireland, and an Ambassador from the ``Republic of      Conscience'' who will never be relieved.                          ____________________
