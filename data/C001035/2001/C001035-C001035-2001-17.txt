Our goal, which I know the chairman and ranking member share, is to ensure that homeless individuals have access to substance abuse treatment. While their most apparent need is decent shelter, homeless men and women often require treatment for the underlying problem that has kept them on the street, which in many cases is drug and alcohol abuse. Compounding the problem is the reality that homeless people often have difficulty accessing mainstream treatment services. What is needed are treatment programs specifically tailored to our homeless population.
