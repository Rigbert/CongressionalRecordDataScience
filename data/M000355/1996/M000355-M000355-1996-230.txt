 President, I thank my staffers, Tamara Somerville and Lani Gerst for their good work on this most important issue. Tam and I have been through these battles a few times, including staying up all night, a couple years ago. She has been a great help. I have enjoyed working with her on this and thank her for her service to the Nation.
