Speaker, the end of the year 2002 brings with it the retirement of a distinguished public servant in Ohio. William Copeland will be retiring as a Lucas County, Ohio, Commissioner, bringing to a close 28 years in service to the people of our region.  Raised in Toledo, Ohio, Bill was a stand-out baseball and basketball player at Woodward High School and gained All-City recognition. After high school, he earned a degree in education from South Carolina State University. Following college, Bill played basketball for New York's Komedy Kings, a semiprofessional team, which won sixty consecutive games during Bill's tenure. This feat earned Bill an invitation to join the Harlem Globetrotters.  During this time, Bill was also working in Toledo and a member of the Laborers UnionLocal 500. For over 30 years he served the union as representative, business manager, and business agent. Funds were raised under his stewardship to build a hall which now bears his name in thanks from his union brothers and sisters.  In 1974, Bill was persuaded to run for Toledo City Council and won. In 1983, having been the highest vote-getter, he was elected by his council colleagues as Vice Mayor. With his 1985 election as county recorder, Bill became the first African-American to hold a county office. He was appointed to the Board of Lucas County Commissioners in 1990--again making history as the first African-American County Commissioner. For many years, he was the only African-American serving on a board of county commissioners among Ohio's 88 counties. Commissioner Copeland has handily won reelection to three successive terms. He diligently pursued many major projects including new home ownership and housing rehabilitation initiatives, a regional water study, new ballpark, juvenile justice center, and the establishment of the Corporation for Effective Government to name but a few.  An integral member of our community, Bill Copeland has devoted himself to public service while actively participating in numerous organizations. While an elected official, Bill worked with the Toledo Zoological Society, Kidney Foundation, Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church, Lucas County Democratic Executive Committee, YMCA, NAACP, Labor-Management Citizens Committee, AFL-CIO, Frederick Douglass Community Center, American Heart Association, Old Newsboys, COMPASS, Toledo Jazz Society, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, and Toledo Civic Breakfast Club. It was often said and very true, that Bill Copeland was everywhere.  Though he will receive dozens of accolades upon his retirement, I believe a statement made by Toledo Blade associate editor Rose Russell sums up Bill Copeland best: ``With so much power at his fingertips for more than two decades, he will go down in Toledo history as a political stalwart who hasn't found it necessary to boast, be arrogant, or snub anyone. He merely has gone his way and worked for the people who elected him.''  Humbly, quietly, with grace, honor, kindness and dignity always, Bill Copeland went about the job he was elected to do. Lucas County government will miss his dignified presence and thoughtful governance. Politically, Bill spurred people to get out and vote, giving people in the central city the inspiration to change their lives through their power at the polls. These skills are his true legacy, and I join with the chorus from our community in a heartfelt ``Thank You.''                          ____________________
