President--and the Senator has been very gracious to do this with me this morning--with why it would be important to have a bipartisan initiative now. As we have discussed, the conventional thinking is that the Congress can't deal with something such as this now; that this will be for the next President. But I think the two of us would very much like to bring the Senate together behind what the country wants to do today, which is to fix health care.  I have always gotten the sense that when you have divided Government--the President of one party, the Congress of another--that is the ideal time to try to bring the Congress together to tackle a big issue, and there is nothing bigger than health care at home. I think it would be appropriate.  I appreciate the Senator from Utah for coming and for his support, to hear his thoughts on bringing the Congress together and the country together to finally deal with an issue where there has been so much polarization in the past.
