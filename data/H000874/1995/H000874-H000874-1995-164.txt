Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, there was a discussion about keeping our government alive by the gentlewoman from Nevada who chairs one of our subcommittees. The gentlewoman is right. That is what this is intended to do.  At the beginning of this Congress and throughout the course of this Congress, we have had a discussion about the Contract With America. Two of the first three items in the contract talk about responsibility, fiscal responsibility and personal responsibility. I suggest that every Member of this House ought to reject this continuing resolution, because I suggest to you it is fiscally irresponsible and personally irresponsible.  Now, why do I say that? Historically, both sides of the aisle have agreed that when the Congress could not accomplish its work in a timely fashion that it then should keep the Government running, because no one in this Congress or in this country intends to shut down all of government. They may not want all of it, but they do not intend to shut it down. Therefore, as a result of us not doing our work, we pass a continuing resolution which says we want the government to continue.  Usually, we agree that it ought to be a clean CR. What does that mean? That means that there should not be extraneous, non-appropriation, additional matters added to that continuing resolution. Why? Because all we are saying is we have not done our work. Government, you stay in operation at a certain level, 90 percent below what you did last year or some figure as that, while we continue in the democratic political process to debate the issues, to contend with one another as to our priorities, to level the funding and to matters that ought to be included in those bills.                              {time}  1845  Now, the fact of the matter is the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook], who just spoke about his amendment, speaks of it as an amendment that, gee, just ought to be done because we are giving taxpayers' money to lobbyists. That is not true, of course. That is a crime if they use money that the Federal Government gives them to lobby the government.  The chairman, the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] is a former prosecutor. I suggested that he bring to the attention of the appropriate U.S. Attorney any instances that he knew of where that was occurring. To my knowledge that has not yet been done.  Mr. Speaker, the chairman of this committee, the same gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], said some months ago we ought not to put extraneous legislative matters on appropriation bills. We ought not to put these on. Why did he say that? Because he thought that would impede the legislative process, and, indeed, it has.  There is only one Republican on the conference committee that agrees with the Istook-Ehrlich amendment. Forget about the Democrats. They do not have a majority of their own party in the Senate on this amendment. And the Republican leadership knows that the President has said he will veto this bill if this is attached.  This is a blatant irresponsible attempt to bulldoze the President of the United States into signing something that he vigorously disagrees with, and he will not do it, but that does not seem to matter. The Treasury-Postal bill has been pending, ladies and gentlemen, for 50-plus days, and the President says he will sign it, but the Republicans cannot agree on the Istook amendment so it has not been added.  As a result, Mr. Speaker, the Treasury-Postal bill sits stuck in the mud of political partisanship. That is unfortunate. I do not think my chairman wants that to happen. I will not ask him to comment on that. If we want to be fiscally responsible and personally responsible, we will adopt the Obey legislation, which says pending our getting our work done in the Congress of the United States we will pass a clean continuing resolution to make sure the government continues to operate. I urge my colleagues to follow that responsible path.
