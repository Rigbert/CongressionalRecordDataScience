Speaker, my remarks this evening will focus on the crisis facing Ukraine and our world, the most significant test of the will of liberty-loving people since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.  The events halfway around the world remind us how precious our own liberties are and how important it is for the world community of liberty-loving nations, those that respect human life and those that believe in democratic advancement. We have common cause with those who stood in the streets in the subzero temperatures of Ukraine, whose futures are uncertain as I deliver my remarks this evening.  The world community of liberty-loving nations and those that respect treaty obligations and their roles as members of the United Nations Security Council cannot let the kind of illegal invasion of another country stand. Russia, one of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, has invaded a sovereign country, violating her territorial integrity and putting off the day that Ukraine can handle its own internal affairs in order to get rid of the corruption of the former regime and allow the voices of people who so very much want to live in a free society to fully develop.  Our Nation and the world have to stand up for freedom, democracy, and human rights in Ukraine. These precious values will be diminished everywhere if we fail to raise our voices insupport of those whose lives are at risk. The West, involving our allies from around the world, has to exert strong diplomatic initiatives, economic reform, including a financing package that the International Monetary Fund and other nations are putting together, humanitarian relief, if requested, and military assistance to strengthen our NATO alliance and the protection of borders.  Recently, the Ambassador from Ukraine to the United States, Ambassador Motsyk, wrote a letter to Members of Congress, and tonight I am going to read it into the Record so every American can hear it:       Dear Members of the United States Congress:       I would like to begin by thanking the United States of      America, and specifically the United States Congress, for the      unwavering support of Ukraine at these challenging times.       For the past couple of months, Ukraine has been in the      world's headlines. The whole world saw the determination of      hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who took to the streets      to stand for a better life--for freedom, democracy, and the      end of blatant corruption that stifled our country for far      too long. Yet the Yanukovych regime tried to silence the      protesters with guns. Peaceful and unarmed demonstrators were      met by special forces with snipers who shot dead almost a      hundred people and wounded hundreds more.       In an attempt to prevent further bloodshed and resolve the      crisis, on February 21, 2014, leaders of the opposition      Vitali Klychko, Oleh Tyahnybok, and Arsenii Yatsenyuk on one      side, and the corrupt regime of Viktor Yanukovych on the      other, signed an agreement that had been negotiated with the      help of foreign ministers of Poland, Germany, and France.      Russia's Special Envoy, Vladimir Lukin, was present, but      refused to sign it. Therefore, the suggestion by the Russian      side that the opposition failed to implement the agreement is      groundless.       The agreement called for an end of violence, restoration of      the Ukrainian Constitution of 2004 and early presidential      elections. However, on February 22, 2014, President Viktor      Yanukovych fled the capitol and de facto removed himself from      his constitutional authority. Therefore, on February 27,      2014, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine was the only legitimate      authority in Ukraine at that time, given the resignation of      the government and the President's self-removal from      exercising his functions, and restored the 2004 Constitution      (approved by 386 votes out of 450), recognized that Viktor      Yanukovych removed himself from his constitutional duties      through unconstitutional means by 386 votes, including 140      votes from the pro-Yanukovych Party of Regions, and set the      early elections of the President of Ukraine on May 25, 2014      (328 votes).  That was 328, a vast majority of members of their Congress, of their Rada, voted for that.       According to Article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine of      2004, in case of early termination of powers of the President      of Ukraine, the functions of the President of Ukraine shall      be carried out by the speaker of the Parliament until a new      President is elected and inaugurated, the only legitimate      supreme authority in Ukraine is the Verkhovna Rada of      Ukraine.  The Verkhovna Rada is their Congress.       The Rada elected its new speaker, Mr. Oleksandr Turchynov      (by 288 votes), who acts as the President of Ukraine until      the elections, and appointed Mr. Yatsenyuk as the Prime      Minister (by 371 votes). These actions were made in full      compliance with Ukrainian laws.  That is over three-quarters of the membership. As the American people listen to what is happening there, you are watching a country trying to hold its government together. It was like at the beginning of our Republic when we weren't quite sure exactly how it was all going to be put together, but we were trying mightily to create a republic. However, even after the Ukrainian Congress did that, Russia did not recognize these changes and considers the former President, Viktor Yanukovych, its legitimate President, despite the votes of the Parliament, the highest standing body in the Nation of Ukraine.       Producing a piece of paper purporting to be Mr.      Yanukovych's letter asking Mr. Putin to send Russian trips to      Ukraine, the Federation Council of Russia, upon Mr. Putin's      request, approved such a decision.  Some of us who are old enough to remember, remember what it was like living with the Soviet Union, a Soviet Union that invaded its neighbors, a Soviet Union that moved its tanks across Europe, a Soviet Union that killed over 14 million of its own people. There are some Americans old enough to remember that.  Now, the former President of Ukraine, Mr. Yanukovych, who stole from his own people--those are my words, not the Ambassador's--        Mr. Yanukovych is no longer the President of Ukraine,      particularly after his escape from Kyiv on February 22, 2014.      Therefore, none of his statements have any significance under      either Ukrainian or international law. But in any way, even      if the legitimate President of Ukraine called upon a foreign      country to intervene with its armed forces in Ukraine, such a      statement would also be worth nothing, because under the      Constitution of Ukraine, Article 85, only the Verkhovna Rada      of Ukraine, its Congress, can approve decisions on admitting      units of armed forces of other states to the territory of      Ukraine. The Rada clearly stated it had not made any such      decisions.       Seeing that Ukraine is determined to pursue its European      course, Russia, under the completely trumped up pretext,      invaded Crimea with its armed forces.  People of Hungarian-American ancestry understand what it is like to be invaded. People of Polish-American heritage understand what it is like to be invaded. People of Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian heritage understand what it is like to be invaded by the Big Bear. There are plenty of American people who understand what the Ukrainian people are facing right now.       The Russian forces are seeking to establish complete      control over Ukraine's military facilities in Crimea, trying      to block and disarm Ukrainian military garrisons and border      guard bases, blocking airports and ships. The Russian troops      and armored vehicles are moving uncontrollably around Crimea,      one of Ukraine's states, and numerous Russian military planes      and helicopters violated Ukrainian airspace.  Russia's power far outweighs Ukraine, which is nearly defenseless facing this massive force, and yet, Ukrainian soldiers have hunkered down in army bases, in air control stations, trying to stand up as they are surrounded; what courage. What courage.       By countless provocations, Russian military is seeking to      instigate an armed conflict and replicate in Ukraine the      Abkhazia and South Ossetia scenario. However, Ukrainian      servicemen act with utmost restraint and don't react to such      provocations, but there's a threat that Russia may engineer      provocations against its own troops, and blame them on      Ukraine.  Don't forget, Russia's President was head of the KGB, their secret police. He knows these techniques well.       There is also an ongoing accumulation of Russian equipment      on the Russian territory in close proximity to the border of      Ukraine in the Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk and Chernihiv      oblasts.  What does that mean?  These actions may indicate preparedness of the Russian side for possible intervention into the Ukrainian territory across the land border.       The military intervention is accompanied by a huge outburst      of fabrications. I can assure you that Russian-speaking      citizens of Ukraine enjoy the same rights and freedoms as      other citizens of my country. Nobody has ever forbidden,      forbids, or will forbid the use of the Russian language, as      the Russian propaganda tries to demonstrate.  In fact, if you go to Ukraine, people speak many languages. They speak Ukrainian, they speak Russian, some speak a combination. Some speak Polish as well. Some speak German. There are many languages spoken in the nation of Ukraine.       As of today, there is no proof of any violations of Russian      minority rights in Ukraine; there were no appeals to the      relevant Ukrainian authorities, neither from those allegedly      affected nor from Russia's officials. In accordance with the      Memorandum of Understanding between the Parliamentary      Commissioner on Human Rights of Ukraine and the Ombudsman of      the Russian Federation in case of such appeals to the Russian      side, they are transferred to the Ukrainian Ombudsman.       The actions by the Russian Federation constitute an act of      aggression against the state of Ukraine. Russian Federation      brutally violated the basic principles of Charter of the      United Nations obliging all member states to refrain from the      threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or      political independence of any state.  What has happened is serious.       Ukraine in the strongest possible terms protested such      actions, but Russia officially rejected Ukrainian proposals      to hold immediate bilateral consultation (under article 7 of      the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership      between Ukraine and the Russian Federation of 1997).  Again, another treaty violation.       Russia's actions pose a serious threat not only to the      sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also to      the peace and stability in the whole region. Moreover,      Russian's action provoke a disbalance in the international      security system, and can lead to violations of the regime of      international nuclear nonproliferation on a global scale.       When in 1994, Ukraine became a party to the      Nonproliferation Treaty and voluntarily surrendered the      third-largest nuclear arsenal     in the world, it did so exclusively under certain conditions.      These conditions envisaged granting security assurances to      Ukraine by the five nuclear states. On December 5, 1994, the      United States, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom      signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances to      Ukraine. The French Republic and the People's Republic of      China support the memorandum by signing separate      declarations.       Ukraine has thoroughly implemented its commitments under      the Nonproliferation Treaty and has taken and fulfilled      additional obligations by getting rid of all of its      stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.                              {time}  1945       Today, we witness the situation when the Russian Federation      attempts to undermine the NPT regime not only by violating      the Budapest Memorandum, but also by violating the      Nonproliferation Treaty, which clearly states in its preamble      that ``States must refrain in their international relations      from the threat or use of force against the territorial      integrity or political independence of any state, or in any      other manner.''       Nonadherence by one guarantor state--the Russian      Federation--to its commitments under the Budapest Memorandum      by the military invasion in Ukraine creates a situation when      the threshold states may consider international legal      instruments insufficient to ensure security, territorial      integrity and inviolability of their borders.       We rely on the commitments contained in the Budapest      Memorandum of 1994 and the Charter on a Distinctive      Partnership between NATO in Ukraine, as well as the U.S.-     Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership and other bilateral      documents.  Ukraine is asking the world community to pay attention.       We need help from the guarantor states, the United Nations,      NATO, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe--  Who, by the way, have been denied access on repeated attempts to enter Crimea unarmed to observe, Russia has denied them entry.       --the European Union, all civilized nations to protect our      sovereignty and territorial integrity by all available means      and to prevent a war which would shatter peace in Europe and      will have grave and irrevocable consequences for peace and      security on a global scale.  Ambassador Motsyk goes on:       The aggression must be stopped, and we rely on the strong      and unified position of the global community.       Military units deployed from Russia must leave the      territory of Ukraine immediately, and those belonging to the      Russian Black Sea Fleet must return to their barracks. Armed      gangs that came from Russia must also immediately leave      Ukraine.       Crimea is an inalienable part of Ukraine, with citizens of      all ethnic backgrounds.       All issues should be resolved through negotiations. There      is no alternative to a peaceful and diplomatic solution of      the crisis. We hope that wisdom will prevail.       We need America's help, and we count on it.       Sincerely yours,       Olexandr Motsyk       Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States  I also want to say that there has been some conjecture in the news that we have heard the President of Russia say that Crimea really doesn't belong in Ukraine because, back in the 1950s, when there was a Russian leader by the name of Nikita Khrushchev, that he got drunk one night and he kind of consigned Crimea to Ukraine by accident--by accident--because he wasn't thinking.  There are also very interesting facts contained in a book published in Moscow in 2003 entitled ``Ukraine is not Russia.'' Do you know who it was written by? It was written by the former President of Ukraine, President Leonid Kuchma.  In chapter 14 of that book, President Kuchma devoted 13 pages to trace the history of Crimea and Ukraine. He called it the ``Crimean knot.''  The former President said--when he discusses the politics around the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, he says the then-transition to Ukrainian administration after Ukraine became independent and how he dealt with separatist forces during his tenure as President.  Kuchma maintains that the transfer of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine came in response to petitions from the Crimeans themselves, who felt Moscow was too far away and insufficiently responsive to their everyday concerns, where their own country, their own capital of Kiev, was likely to be more attentive, particularly on issues of water and other utilities; so they could provide for Crimea better than Moscow, located far, far away.  Crimea then, Kuchma writes, was a desert and frontier land. He is referring back to the post-World War II period, particularly after the devastation of World War II.  That area was just violated and leveled to such an extent. It is hard for people in the West who have never experienced that to fully accommodate what happened there.  The residents believe Ukraine would be a better fit administratively, so he says--President Kuchma who had headed that country--the story of a drunken Nikita Khrushchev ceding Crimea to Ukraine as a gift is a fairytale. Those are his own words.  In 1954, right after Stalin's death--and what a butcher he was--Khrushchev hardly had the unbridled authority to make such unilateral decisions. At the time, he was vying for power inside his own country.  The actual act of transferring Crimea to Ukraine was signed by the head of what was called the Presidium, Kliment Voroshilov, not Khrushchev.  So the President of Russia maybe didn't read history, I don't know; but the point was the transfer to Ukraine came in 1954. It was a consequential date, and it has remained in Ukraine as part of that region for the entire second half of the 20th century and the first decade of this century. I thought it was important to put that on the Record.  I also wanted to say, as a Member of Congress, I am so very, very proud of the work that has been done by the Verkhovna Rada, the legal authority in Ukraine that is holding that Nation together. They are our counterpart. They are a legislative branch of their government, just as we are here.  We for many years now, since 1999, have had a parliamentary exchange with Ukraine, founded and signed by all of our Members, with the former speaker of their Parliament, Mr. Oleksandr Tkachenko, and our Speaker here for many congresses back, Speaker Dennis Hastert. That agreement lives today.  Over the last decade and a half, we have had many parliamentary exchanges. We have had teleconferences. We have had journeys by Ukrainian parliamentarians here and American Members of Congress there.  We believe that the collective intelligence of Ukraine is contained in that Rada. We are very proud of the work they are doing, and we want to continue working with them.  Our agreement says that we want to build upon the strategic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, first established in 1996, and that our parliamentary exchange would serve as a conduit in further developing and continuing economic and political cooperation between our two countries.  The types of discussions that we have held--and will continue to do in the future--will encompass economic relations, trade, space exploration, health care, the environment, agriculture, natural resources, and any other matter important to the promotion of close ties between the United States and Ukraine.  This is a moment for more robust engagement with the Parliament of Ukraine and our own Congress. The idea is that we can learn from one another, we can be mutually supportive, and we know how important legislative bodies are to nations that actually expand freedoms, rights of free speech, rights of assembly, rights of free press, rights of free expression of religion, and we are very proud to be partnered with the Verkhovna Rada.  I would also like to read this evening from an excellent article that was written for The New Republic by Yale scholar Dr. Timothy Snyder, the author of a recent bestseller called ``Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,'' during World War II. It is incredible work.  But in this particular article, he talks about where Putin is vulnerable, where his soft spots are. He states at the beginning of the article:       In dispatching troops to Ukraine, Russia has violated      international law, flouted multiple treaty commitments, and      set the stage for a European war.  It is right that the American people are paying attention; it is right that we are using our power to try to put the bear back where it belongs and to try to move the situation to stability. The price of poor diplomacy, I think, would be catastrophic.  In this article, Dr. Snyder ends by saying:       Russian propaganda derides Europeans as fey and helpless,      and we too often tend to agree. But the European Union does      have instruments of influence. Its greatest power, of course,      is its attractiveness to societies on its borders, such as      Ukraine. But even where membership is not an option, and the      European Union faces unambiguous hostility, it can act.      Russia's very contempt for the European Union might force      Europeans to undertake a more active foreign policy and to      take responsibility for their neighborhood.  The United States has to use our power to help push the situation in that direction.  I just wanted to ask if our dear colleague from Iowa, does he have his own Special Order, or does he wish to join in this Special Order? Congressman King of Iowa.
