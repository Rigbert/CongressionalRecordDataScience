 In closing, let me just say that I welcome my friend's comments. I would only say that we can now refer to ``the other body'' as ``the Senate.'' We changed the rules beginning with this Congress, so we do not need to damn the other side by saying ``the other body;'' we can now thank them for their efforts, and this is maybe the first time that has ever happened. But we applaud their efforts led by Chairman Stevens and others in the Senate.
