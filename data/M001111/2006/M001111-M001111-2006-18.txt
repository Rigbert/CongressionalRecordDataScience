 President, it is my understanding that under the current consent agreement, following me on this side is Senator Harkin and Senator Menendez, with Republicans in between.  I amend that consent and ask unanimous consent that following Senator Menendez, Senator Landrieu be allowed to speak for 15 minutes, Senator Salazar for 15 minutes, Senator Lautenberg for 15 minutes, with Republicans in between, as per their request.
