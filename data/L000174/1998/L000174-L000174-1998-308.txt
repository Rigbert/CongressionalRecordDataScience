President, I am pleased today to introduce the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation and Registration Simplification Act (TLT Act). The TLT Act, which will implement the Trademark Law Treaty of 1994, is an important step in our continuing endeavor to harmonize trademark law around the world so that American businesses--particularly small American businesses--seeking to expand internationally will face simplified and straightforward trademark registration procedures in foreign countries.  This bill is one of a series I have supported which protect American trademark holders in a world of rapidly changing technology and international competition. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1727, legislation authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights owners. Moreover, I supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, which was enacted into law last Congress. This legislation provides intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. Together, these measures represent efforts to refine American trademark law to ensure that it promotes American interests.  Today more than ever before, trademarks are among the most valuable assets of business. One of the major obstacles in securing international trademark protection is the difficulty and cost involved in obtaining and maintaining a registration in each and every country. Countries around the world have a number of varying requirements for filing trademark applications, many of which are non-substantive and very confusing. Because of these difficulties, many U.S. businesses, especially smaller businesses,are forced to concentrate their efforts on registering their trademarks only in certain major countries while pirates freely register their marks in other countries.  The Trademark Law Treaty will eliminate many of the arduous registration requirements of foreign countries by enacting a list of maximum requirements for trademark procedures. Eliminating needless formalities will be an enormous step in the direction of a rational trademark system which will benefit American business, especially smaller businesses, to expand into the international market more freely. Fortunately, the Trademark Law Treaty has already been signed by thirty-five countries, has already been ratified by ten countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, and has already been reported favorably to the full Senate by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.  As the United States is already in accordance with most of the Trademark Law Treaty requirements, the TLT Act would impose only minor changes to U.S. trademark law. The Patent and Trademark Office, the International Trademark Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association have indicated their support for the TLT Act.  I hope the Senate will consider and pass this bill expeditiously.                          ____________________
