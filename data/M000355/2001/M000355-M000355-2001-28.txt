 He and I and the Senator from Maryland have had some great debates on the issue of section 907 of the Freedom of Support Act in previous Congresses, but I do believe we have been able to work out an approach that both allows the administration to engage with these areas in a way that facilitates the fighting of the war and also preserves section 907 to be dealt with at a later date when the final settlement comes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which will obviously happen on another day. I think this is a compromise that is worthwhile, and I am happy to support it.  I yield the floor. I see Senator Kerry here, the original author of section 907.
