President, I understand. I gave this to the majority leader maybe 45 minutes ago at most. I certainly didn't want to try to surprise him and mislead him because I think this is a matter that is very important. I sincerely hope we can clear this tonight. If we are unable to clear this and pass this legislation--or even if we do--I urge Michael Chertoff, Secretary of the Homeland Security Department, to grant this status to Lebanon and to do it immediately--immediately. The people of Lebanon cannot wait until Congress returns to Washington in September. And his immediate action will save lives and give peace of mind to a lot of our friends from Lebanon and to their families who live in the United States.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S8775-S8776]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3765
