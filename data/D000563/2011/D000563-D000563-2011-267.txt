President, I wish to take those who are following this debate on a little trip through the world of plastic. I am talking about the world of credit cards--in this case, specifically about debit cards--because something happened over the weekend which has changed that world dramatically, and it is important for consumers, retailers, and voters across America to understand what happened.  On October 1--on Saturday--the rules on how much a credit card company and a bank that issues a debit card can collect every time we use the debit card changed.
