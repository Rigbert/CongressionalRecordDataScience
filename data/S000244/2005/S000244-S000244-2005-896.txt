Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is a good amendment and ought to be supported. It makes important changes to the reference in the forfeiture statute to the definition of international terrorism from the definition of domestic terrorism.  There are various definitions of terrorism under Federal law. In title XVIII there has been a confusion over a new definition created in the USA PATRIOT Act for domestic terrorism. That provision is supposed to be used for administrative procedures such as nationwide searches, but another part of the PATRIOT Act, section 806, uses the reference for asset forfeiture, which is more of a penalty. This has raisedconcerns about those who exercise their first amendment rights. As a result, groups from both sides of the political spectrum have wanted to change the definition of domestic terrorism.  The amendment fixes the problem by changing the reference in section 806, asset forfeiture, to the definition of a Federal crime of terrorism under section 2332b(g)(5)(B) instead, which lists specific crimes that constitute terrorism. Thus the more general definition may still be used for administrative purposes and the more narrow definition for penalties and criminal prosecutions.  I believe that this is a good amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).
