Chairman, I rise today to object to yet another attack by the Republicans on America's most vulnerable citizens. This time, the target is low income and elderly Americans who rely on public housing assistance. Last week, House Republicans reported a rescission package totaling $17.3 billion dollars. Forty percent of the cuts came from one Department; the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
