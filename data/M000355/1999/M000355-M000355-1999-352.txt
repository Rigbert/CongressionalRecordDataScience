 President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a dynamic Kentucky judge-executive and dedicated teacher, Wilbur MacDonald Norris, Jr.  Wilbur ``Buzz'' Norris served the State of Kentucky for 39 years, first as a teacher of government and politics for 30 years at Daviess County High School, and then for 9 years as Daviess County's judge-executive, the county's highest ranking elected official. Buzz also served his country with service in the United States Army for two years.  Buzz is truly a product of Kentucky. He completed his undergraduate degree at Kentucky Wesleyan College, and received a master's degree from Western Kentucky University. Buzz's deep-rooted background in Kentucky certainly served him well in his years of commendable service to our great state.  Buzz's career in Daviess County politics was marked by his willingness to fight for what was best for the county. He was heralded for his ability to work with county officials of both parties, and was effective numerous times in bringing the sometimes opposing sides together in a compromise that pleased almost everyone and was always of benefit to Daviess County.  Buzz was praised for bringing hundreds of jobs to the county with the creation of MidAmerica Airpark and bringing Scott Paper, now Kimberly-Clark, to Daviess County. It is widely speculated that, without these two companies' presence in Daviess County and Buzz's essential role in bringing them to the Owensboro, the county's economy would never have reached its current level of growth.  The legacy Buzz has left in Kentucky county politics also includes his efforts to build and maintain a much-needed landfill in Daviess County. The completion of the landfill will save the county countless dollars in fees in the future, and leaves yet another lasting impact from Buzz's priceless leadership.  Aside from Buzz's successful career holding county office, some of his proudest accomplishments come from his 30 admirable years as a teacher. Buzz taught high school politics and government classes at Daviess County High School and served the county by teaching a ``Problems in Government'' class for the Daviess community. Students in the class followed Buzz' example and plunged into the politics of local concerns, impacting decisions about topics such as highways and downtown revitalization.  Buzz Norris left his mark on Daviess County, and I have no doubt he will continue to contribute his time, effort and energy to the community for many years to come. I thank Buzz for his service to Kentucky, and I am confident my colleagues join me in my commendation of his work.                          ____________________
