  Let me be very frank. This is a very expensive amendment. It is also, literally, priceless. It makes good on this commitment: So long as a single American soldier or marine remains in Iraq, we will provide him or her with the best protection this country can provide.  Let me start with the basics. There are two critical issues facing our soldiers and marines today: improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. IEDs are planted in roads and on the side of roads to hit the bottom of vehicles with powerful explosives. EFPs are shaped charges that come into the side armor of vehicles at high speeds.  We know that IEDs now cause about 70 percent of all American fatalities. Since 2003, in any given month, IEDs have caused between 30 and 76 percent of American fatalities. For every death, there are usually 2 to 10 Americans wounded. Over the past year, we have also seen a growing threat from EFPs. They are not yet everywhere in Iraq, but they are spreading and they are very lethal.  The military has a strategy for dealing with both. First, they seek to disrupt the organizations that produce IEDs and EFPs. They go after the people and the supplies. Second, they attempt to use tactics and technology to prevent IEDs and EFPs from being activated when American personnel are close enough to be harmed. Third, they attempt to survive a direct hit. It is the third area where we could and should have done much more to make a difference years ago but where still today we can and must make a difference.  The military has tested, both at testing centers and in the field, the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, also called an MRAP. The MRAP provides dramatically improved protection against IEDs. The military has said that it is four to five times as good as an up-armored HMMWV. More important, military commanders tell us that it will reduce deaths and casualties from IEDs by 67 to 80 percent. The Brookings Institution found that 1,400 Americans died in Iraq due to IEDs from March of 2003 through June of 2007. If we had had MRAPs in the field from the start--and we could and should have--938 to 1,120 Americans would be alive today.  And let me just clarify for my colleagues that this is not new technology. It has been used successfully in Africa, by nations much poorer than ours, since the 1970s. I don't want to get bogged down in history, but this is not rocket science. Every day we delay, another soldier or marine is killed or injured by an IED. If we just look at this year, IEDs killed 309 Americans; 207 to 247 would still be alive today if they had been in MRAPs. We need to make sure that for the second half of 2007, those MRAPs are there and those lives are saved.  What about the threat from these shaped charges that come in from the side, the EFP? The Army's Rapid Equipping Force and the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization started working on that last year. In conjunction with industry, they produced a vehicle nicknamed ``the Bull'' and officially called the Highly Survivable Urban Vehicle Ballistic Protection Experiment Program. This vehicle was tested and shown to defeat EFPs and also tested against the first level of MRAP requirements. That testing was completed in March of this year. For some reason, the military has not asked for another vehicle to do the MRAP level two tests. So we do not actually know how capable this vehicle might be for all threats, but we know it works against EFPs. Instead of trying to get ahead of the enemy and get this technology into the field, the military seems to be sitting on its hands while the EFP threat has increased. Why wouldn't you field something you know works?  The perfect vehicle would be a complete MRAP with EFP protection, but that appears to be many months away, although some MRAP producers tell me that their vehicles have survived EFP hits in the field. So again, we do not have the complete picture. We have also been told that Frag-Kit-6 armor can defeat EFPs, but it is too heavy for MRAPs. So vehicles must be redesigned and retested. This will take time. I understand that and support that effort, but Americans are dying today. Again, as with the MRAP, we have a technology that could keep them alive, and we should be using it while we work to perfect it.  I do not know if all of my colleagues saw the USA Today article that appeared on Monday detailing some of the history surrounding the MRAP. I will summarize a few points but will ask to have the entire article printed in the Record.  This article details efforts to get MRAPs going back to 2003. It also details the reasons for delay, and that is what I want to point out to my colleagues.  First, apparently, the leadership at the Pentagon did not expect this war to last this long. Well, that is no surprise. We all remember the ``Mission Accomplished'' speech and the promise of roses in the streets. We remember Vice President Cheney telling us that the insurgency was in its death throes. We remember Secretary Rumsfeld telling us that crime in Baghdad was not any worse than that in Washington, DC. I remember all of that. Sadly, none of those leaders remember the hearings that Senator Lugar and I held before the war began that predicted the need for a long-term American presence and engagement. They don't remembersome of us, starting before the war, repeatedly urged the President to level with the American people about the likely duration, cost, and danger of this war. Perhaps even more tragically, this uncertainty about future force levels continues to limit the military commitment to fielding more MRAPs and EFP protected vehicles.  Second, these vehicles were seen as contrary to Secretary Rumsfeld's vision for the transformed military, a lighter, more agile force. While it depends on what armored humvee you are talking about, many believed that MRAPs were heavier and slower than humvees. The stifling effect Secretary Rumsfeld's views and management style had on military leaders is well known to everyone who follows military issues. In this instance, it meant that officers were predisposed against the heavier vehicle and didn't push the issue when our forces in the field asked for MRAP technology. Instead, they focused on the first two parts of the anti-IED strategy I talked about earlier.  Finally, and most disturbing to me, many believed that Congress would not support funding the MRAP while also fielding better armored humvees. I do not know of a single wartime funding request that Congress has denied. There have been some items added to the supplemental bills that were clearly not urgent or war related, but nothing directly linked to current operations was refused. Nonetheless, it appears that the military did not believe that our support for needed equipment was for real. Even today, I hear that leaders are concerned that they must cut multiple existing programs to pay for this growing MRAP requirement. There may be programs that we could all agree are not as vital for a wartime Army, but I do not want that debate and concern to slow lifesaving equipment.  I understand that this program will be the third largest procurement program in the Pentagon. As I said, it is very costly. We can work together in the future to find the lower priority programs that simply should not be funded if they are competing with lifesaving programs. We do not have any more time to delay spending the money needed to buy these vehicles, however, if we are going to save lives.  Leadership is about making hard choices, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to do whatever it takes. I am even willing to cut programs I support because saving lives and limbs under fire today must truly be our first priority. So, today, with this amendment I hope we can make it clear that we will provide whatever funding is needed, so that military leaders do not fear being honest about their needs.  In addition to the issues brought out in the article, I have also heard a regular concern that some in the military do not believe MRAPs will be needed in the future--that when we leave Iraq, we will leave most of these vehicles behind. I was happy to see the Secretary of the Army, Peter Geren, state clearly in his confirmation hearing that he believes MRAPs will be needed in future conflicts. It is clear to me that until we show America's enemies that we can handle IEDs, they will continue to use them throughout the world. We are already seeing an increased use of IEDs in Afghanistan.  It is also clear to me that those who worry about what the military will be driving in 5 years are missing the boat here. I understand that there are great advancements being developed for our future force. But we have a sacred trust to those on the front lines today, right now. Right now, we are saying to them: If you survive this war, we will get you really good protection for the next one. Give me a break. To paraphrase a former Secretary of Defense, you fight the war you are in, not the war you might be in down the road. Ideally, you do both, but your priority has to be protecting the men and women under fire now. End of story. Can anyone imagine Roosevelt saying, ``Listen, we may not need some of those boats after Normandy, so maybe we should not build so many?'' Of course not. War is inherently wasteful and this war is no exception. I am willing to waste money and equipment if it means we don't waste lives and limbs. The fact that we may not need all of the vehicles we buy today in 5 years, is no reason to shortchange the soldiers and marines who truly need the vehicles today.  I have given my colleagues some of this history so they will understand why we must stand up for our marines and soldiers on this issue. We must cut through the ``business as usual'' bureaucracy. I applaud Secretary Gates for making MRAPs the top priority of the military, but I am concerned that even now, some of the same problems continue. After all, Army commanders in Iraq concluded that they need 17,700 MRAPs. That is 15,200 more than currently being bought. We must act now to put money in the pipeline to order the additional vehicles and expand production capacity.  Instead, we find out that 2 months later, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council has yet to approve the Army request as a ``validated joint requirement.'' I don't get it.  The President tells us that the most important thing in this war is the judgment of our commanders in the field. Now, I may disagree with the policy being executed, but I would agree that when it comes to tactical decisions about the best way to implement our policies, this is the right approach. Apparently, others feel that the commanders should only be listened to selectively, when it does not cost too much money.  The commanders in the field have said that they need an additional 15,200 mine resistant vehicles for the Army. They have also said that they need thousands of vehicles with EFP protection. So, why the delay?  No one from the Pentagon has been able to explain it to me.  Last, some argue that the real problem is production capacity. I simply don't buy it. We are being told that American industry cannot handle this or does not care enough about our soldiers and marines to do it. I don't buy it. These are purely military vehicles. If the military does not place the orders, industry will not build them, and they certainly won't create new production capacity. They cannot sell the extras to your neighbor or mine. So we must put the money up front and challenge our companies to deliver quickly. We did that on the supplemental where Congress accepted my amendment adding $1.2 billion. Because that led to increased production capacity, Secretary Gates has reprogrammed another $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2007 to take advantage of that new capacity.  We made it to the Moon by putting money up front and challenging Americans to do their best to get there. MRAPs and EFP protected vehicles are basically modified trucks. America knows how to make trucks and how to make a lot of them. As I said before, this is not rocket science. If we buy it, they will build it.  What if they cannot? What if industry can only get 15,000 or 20,000 of the 23,000 we need built by the end of fiscal year 2008? Well, I tell my colleagues, than we will know that we gave them every chance to succeed. More important, we gave our soldiers and marines their best chance to survive this war.  And the downside is simply that all of the funds we provide cannot be spent in 1 year and all of the vehicles cannot be purchased. In that situation, all we have to do is authorize reprogramming the unspent funds for the next fiscal year. Compared to taking a chance on saving our kids, that is an easy downside to accept.  I opened by saying that this was a very expensive amendment, and it is. Let me be clear. It provides $23.6 billion for Army MRAPs, enough money to buy the 15,200 the commanders in the field are asking for. The amount is based on the last cost estimate I was given by the Pentagon on July 9. The amendment also provides an additional $1 billion that I have been told is needed for the purchase of 7,774 MRAPs currently planned for and funded in this bill. The increased funds are needed for airlift, training, and maintenance costs not originally included in the program budget.  In addition, the amendment provides $400 million for EFP protection. Half is to field 200 of the vehicles already tested and half is for the joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization to continue to work on and field better vehicles. The Bull may not be the perfect answer, but it gives us a chance to save American lives today. While we work on the perfect solution, an MRAP with EFP protection, we should still be giving our soldiers and marines the best we have today. The military needsto see if the Bull can provide full MRAP protection. They also need to look at other ideas for improving MRAPs, but while they do, we should take advantage of the proven technology we have at hand.  Last, this amendment asks Secretary Gates to report back to us within 30 days on any legal authorities he needs to produce and field these protective vehicles faster.  Let me also clarify what we are adding these funds to. The Armed Services Committee added $4.1 billion to the President's initial request for a mere $441 million for MRAPs in this bill. At the time, that was all that was thought to be needed to meet the 7,774 requirement and I applaud the committee for meeting that need. The situation has changed since the bill came out of committee. We now know that the Army commanders on the ground want far more. We cannot get such a large order produced if we continue to delay.  For me, this is very simple. I believe that when our sons and daughters are getting blown up and we have vehicles proven to dramatically improve their odds of survival, we must get the vehicles to them. This amendment allows us to do that. When the Senate returns to debate on the Defense Authorization Act, I hope all of my colleagues will support it.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, July 16, 2007]   Pentagon Balked at Pleas From Officers in Field for Safer Vehicles         (By Peter Eisler, Blake Morrison and Tom Vanden Brook)       Pfc. Aaron Kincaid, 25, had been joking with buddies just      before their Humvee rolled over the bomb. His wife, Rachel,      later learned that the blast blew Kincaid, a father of two      from outside Atlanta, through the Humvee's metal roof.       Army investigators who reviewed the Sept. 23 attack near      Riyadh, Iraq, wrote in their report that only providence      could have saved Kincaid from dying that day: ``There was no      way short of not going on that route at that time (that) this      tragedy could have been diverted.''       A USA TODAY investigation of the Pentagon's efforts to      protect troops in Iraq suggests otherwise.       Years before the war began, Pentagon officials knew of the      effectiveness of another type of vehicle that better shielded      troops from bombs like those that have killed Kincaid and      1,500 other soldiers and Marines. But military officials      repeatedly balked at appeals--from commanders on the      battlefield and from the Pentagon's own staff--to provide the      lifesaving Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, or MRAP,      for patrols and combat missions, USA TODAY found.       In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates late last      month, two U.S. senators said the delays cost the lives of an      estimated ``621 to 742 Americans'' who would have survived      explosions had they been in MRAPs rather than Humvees.       The letter, from Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and Kit Bond,      R-Mo., assumed the initial calls for MRAPs came in February      2005, when Marines in Iraq asked the Pentagon for almost      1,200 of the vehicles. USA TODAY found that the first appeals      for the MRAP came much earlier.       As early as December 2003, when the Marines requested their      first 27 MRAPs for explosives-disposal teams, Pentagon      analysts sent detailed information about the superiority of      the vehicles to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, e-mails obtained      by USA TODAY show. Later pleas came from Iraq, where      commanders saw that the approach the Joint Chiefs embraced--     adding armor to the sides of Humvees, the standard vehicles      in the war zone--did little to protect against blasts beneath      the vehicles.       Despite the efforts, the general who chaired the Joint      Chiefs until Oct. 1, 2005, says buying MRAPs ``was not on the      radar screen when I was chairman.'' Air Force general Richard      Myers, now retired, says top military officials dealt with a      number of vehicle issues, including armoring Humvees. The      MRAP, however, was ``not one of them.'' Something related to      MRAPs ``might have crossed my desk,'' Myers says, ``but I      don't recall it.''       Why the issue never received more of a hearing from top      officials early in the war remains a mystery, given the      chorus of concern. One Pentagon analyst complained in an      April 29, 2004, e-mail to colleagues, for instance, that it      was ``frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees      while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that      would provide more protection.''       The analyst was referring to the MRAP, whose V-shaped hull      puts the crew more than 3 feet off the ground and deflects      explosions. It was designed to withstand the underbelly bombs      that cripple the lower-riding Humvees. Pentagon officials,      civilians and military alike, had been searching for      technologies to guard against improvised explosive devices,      or IEDs. The makeshift bombs are the No. 1 killer of U.S.      forces.       The MRAP was not new to the Pentagon. The technology had      been developed in South Africa and Rhodesia in the 1970s,      making it older than Kincaid and most of the other troops      killed by homemade bombs. The Pentagon had tested MRAPs in      2000, purchased fewer than two dozen and sent some to Iraq.      They were used primarily to protect explosive ordnance      disposal teams, not to transport troops or to chase Iraqi      insurgents.        The goal: Iraqis ``stand up'' so U.S. can ``stand down''       Even as the Pentagon balked at buying MRAPs for U.S.      troops, USA TODAY found that the military pushed to buy them      for a different fighting force: the Iraqi army.       On Dec. 22, 2004--two weeks after President Bush told      families of servicemembers that ``we're doing everything we      possibly can to protect your loved ones''--a U.S. Army      general solicited ideas for an armored vehicle for the      Iraqis. The Army had an ``extreme interest'' in getting      troops better armor, then-brigadier general Roger Nadeau told      a subordinate looking at foreign technology, in an e-mail      obtained by USA TODAY.       In a follow-up message, Nadeau clarified his request:      ``What I failed to point out in my first message to you folks      is that the U.S. Govt. is interested not for U.S. use, but      for possible use in fielding assets to the Iraqi military      forces.''       In response, Lt. Col. Clay Brown, based in Australia, sent      information on two types of MRAPs manufactured overseas. ``By      all accounts, these are some of the best in the world,'' he      wrote. ``If I were fitting out the Iraqi Army, this is where      I'd look (wish we had some!)''       The first contract for what would become the Iraqi Light      Armored Vehicle--virtually identical to the MRAPs sought by      U.S. forces then and now, and made in the United States by      BAE Systems--was issued in May 2006. The vehicles, called      Badgers, began arriving in Iraq 90 days later, according to      BAE. In September 2006, the Pentagon said it would provide up      to 600 more to Iraqi forces. As of this spring, 400 had been      delivered.       The rush to equip the Iraqis stood in stark contrast to the      Pentagon's efforts to protect U.S. troops.       In February 2005, two months after Nadeau solicited ideas      for better armor for the Iraqis and was told MRAPs were an      answer, an urgent-need request for the same type of vehicle      came from embattled Marines in Anbar province. The request,      signed by then-brigadier general Dennis Hejlik, said the      Marines ``cannot continue to lose . . . serious and grave      casualties to IEDs . . . at current rates when a commercial      off-the-shelf capability exists to mitigate'' them.       Officials at Marine headquarters in Quantico, Va., shelved      the request for 1,169 vehicles. Fifteen months passed before      a second request reached the Joint Chiefs and was approved.      Those vehicles finally began trickling into Anbar in      February, two years after the original request. Because of      the delay, the Marines are investigating how its urgent-need      requests are handled.       The long delay infuriates some members of Congress. ``Every      day, our troops are being maimed or killed needlessly because      we haven't fielded this soon enough,'' says Rep. Gene Taylor,      D-Miss. ``The costs are in human lives, in kids who will      never have their legs again, people blind, crippled. That's      the real tragedy.''       Not until two months ago did the Pentagon champion the MRAP      for all U.S. forces. Gates made MRAPs the military's top      priority. The plan is to build the vehicles as fast as      possible until conditions warrant a change, according to a      military official who has direct knowledge of the program but      is not authorized to speak on the record. Thousands are in      the pipeline at a cost so far of about $2.4 billion.       Gates said he was influenced by a news report--originally      in USA TODAY--that disclosed Marine units using MRAPs in      Anbar reported no deaths in about 300 roadside bombings in      the past year. His tone was grave. ``For every month we      delay,'' he said, ``scores of young Americans are going to      die.''       One reason officials put off buying MRAPs in significant      quantities: They never expected the war to last this long.      Bush set the tone on May 1, 2003, six weeks after the U.S.      invasion, when he declared on board the aircraft carrier      Abraham Lincoln that ``major combat operations in Iraq have      ended.''       Gen. George Casey, the top commander in Iraq from June 2004      until February this year, repeatedly said that troop levels      in Iraq would be cut just as soon as Iraqi troops took more      responsibility for security. In March 2005, he predicted      ``very substantial reductions'' in U.S. troops by early 2006.      He said virtually the same thing a year later.       Casey wasn't the only optimist. In May 2005, Vice President      Cheney declared that the insurgency was ``in its last      throes.''       Given the view that the war would end soon, the Pentagon      had little use for expensive new vehicles such as the MRAP,      at least not in large quantities. The MRAPs ordered for the      Iraqis were intended to speed the day when, to use Bush's      words, Iraqi forces could ``stand up'' and the United States      could ``stand down.''       Nadeau, who wrote the e-mail that led to MRAPs for the      Iraqis, explains why he did so: ``The U.S. government knows      that eventually we're going to get out'' of Iraq. The United      States wants ``to help get (the Iraqis) in a position to take      care of themselves.''       For U.S. forces, however, the answer was something else:      adding armor to Humvees. Nadeau and others say the choice      made sense because Humvees were already in Iraq and the      improvements--adding steel to the sides, upgrading the      windows and replacing the canvas doors--could be made      quickly, and far more cheaply. Adding armor to a Humvee cost      only $14,000; a Humvee armored at the factory cost $191,000;      today, an MRAP costs between $600,000 and $1 million, though      some foreign models cost only about $200,000 in 2004.       The solution to the IED problem in 2003 had to be      ``immediate,'' says retired vice admiral Gordon Holder,      director for logistics for the Joint Chiefs until mid-2004.      ``We had to stop the bleeding.'' Holder says MRAPs seemed      impractical for the immediate need: ``We shouldn't take four      years to field something the kids needed yesterday.''       Would it actually have taken four years? That depends upon      how much urgency the Pentagon and Congress attached to      speeding production. Force Protection Inc., the small South      Carolina company that landed the first significant MRAP      contracts, was criticized this month by the Pentagon's      inspector general for failing to deliver its vehicles on      time. But bigger defense contractors were available then--and      have secured MRAP contracts in recent weeks that call for      deliveries in as little as four months.       A bigger obstacle might have been philosophical: The MRAP      didn't fit the Pentagon's long-term vision of how the      military should be equipped.       Then-Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld regarded the Iraq      war ``as a means to change'' the military, ``make it lighter,      make it more responsive, make it more agile,'' Holder says.      The MRAP, heavier and slower than the Humvee, wouldn't have      measured up, he says.              The commander: ``IEDs are my No. 1 threat''       By June 2004, the military had lost almost 200 U.S. troops      to the homemade bombs. Gen. John Abizaid, then head of U.S.      Central Command, told the Joint Chiefs that ``IEDs are my No.      1 threat.'' He called for a ``mini-Manhattan Project''      against IEDs, akin to the task force that developed the      atomic bomb during World War II.       The Pentagon organized a small task force that, two years      later, morphed into a full-fledged agency: the Joint IED      Defeat Organization, or JIEDDO. Its leader, Montgomery Meigs,      is a retired four-star general. Its annual budget totals $4.3      billion. Its mission: to stop IEDs from killing U.S. troops.       In one of its PowerPoint presentations, JIEDDO made its      priorities clear. First, prevent IEDs from being planted by      attacking the insurgency. Then, if a device is planted,      prevent it from exploding. ``When all Else Fails,'' reads      another slide, ``Survive the blast.'' That put solutions such      as the MRAP into the category of last resorts.       JIEDDO did spend its own money for 122 MRAPs, but it      primarily focused on electronic jammers to prevent bombs from      being remotely detonated, unmanned surveillance aircraft to      catch insurgents putting bombs along roads and better      intelligence on who was building and planting bombs.       The agency has claimed some successes. Insurgents in 2007      had to plant six times as many bombs as they did in 2004 to      inflict the same number of U.S. casualties, Meigs said in an      interview.       But the insurgents--Sunnis loyal to the deposed leader      Saddam Hussein, Shiites who hated the U.S. occupiers and      foreigners aligned with al-Qaeda--often managed to stay one      step ahead of JIEDDO. They changed the kind of explosives      they planted and varied the locations of the devices and the      way they detonated them.       When the Pentagon added armor to the sides of Humvees to      guard against bombs planted along roadsides, the insurgents      responded by burying bombs in the roads. The bombs could      blast through the vulnerable underbelly of the Humvees. The      insurgents also moved to larger, more sophisticated bombs,      some packed with as much as 100 pounds of explosives.       Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, the No. 2      official at the Pentagon, testified on Capitol Hill in June      that ``as the threat has evolved, we have evolved. We work      very, very hard to be responsible to our troops.''       Taylor, the Democratic congressman from Mississippi,      pressed England about why the Pentagon waited until May to      request substantial numbers of MRAPs. ``Are you telling me no      one could see that (need) coming, no one could recognize that      the bottom of the Humvee'' didn't protect troops, and      ``that's why the kids inside are losing their legs and their      lives?'' Taylor asked.       ``That is too simplistic a description,'' England replied.      ``People have not died needlessly, and we have not left our      people without equipment.''       To Pentagon decision-makers, the Humvee seemed able to      handle the threat early in the war--roadside bombs, rather      than those buried in the roads. ``If anybody could have      guessed in 2003 that we would be looking at these kind of      (high-powered, buried) IEDs that we're seeing now in 2007,      then we would have been looking at something much longer''      term as a solution, Holder says. ``But who had the crystal      ball back then?''       Nadeau, now a major general in charge of the Army's Test      and Evaluation Command in Alexandria, Va., also defends the      Pentagon's choices. He says buried IEDs did not become a      serious threat to the armored Humvees until 2006. Critics      might say, ``Why didn't you guys buy 16,000 MRAPs a decade      ago?'' Nadeau says today. ``You know, I didn't need them.''       Six officers interviewed by USA TODAY say the threat to the      Humvees surfaced sooner. Lt. Col. Dallas Eubanks, chief of      operations for the Army's 4th Infantry Division in 2003-04,      says IEDs became more menacing before he left Iraq. ``We were      certainly seeing underground IEDs by early 2004,'' he says.       In mid-2005, two top Marines--Gen. William Nyland,      assistant Marine commandant, and Maj. Gen. William Catto,      head of Marine Corps Systems Command--testified before      Congress that they were seeing an ``evolving'' threat from      underbelly blasts. They said at the time that armored Humvees      remained their best defense.              The congressman: MRAP's ``simple'' advantage       Just after lunch on June 27, 2004, a group of enlisted men      parked a handful of armored vehicles near a cinderblock      building at Marine headquarters in Fallujah, Iraq.       The day had turned sweltering, like every summer afternoon      in central Iraq. But this day was special. A congressional      delegation had arrived, and among the dignitaries was Rep.      Duncan Hunter, then the chairman of the House Armed Services      Committee. Hunter wasn't just a powerful congressman. He was      a Vietnam War veteran, and his son, then a 27-year-old Marine      lieutenant also named Duncan, was stationed at the base.       More important to most of the Marines, the California      Republican had been instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to      get better armor for them. Humvees with cloth doors--canvas,      like the crusher hat that Hunter wore that day--had been      standard issue when the war began. The fabric worked well to      shield the sun; it offered no protection against explosives.       Then, as now, Hunter was impatient with the pace of      procurement in Iraq. That winter, he had dispatched his staff      to steel mills, where they persuaded managers and union      leaders to set aside commercial orders to expedite steel      needed to armor the Humvees. He also worked with the Army and      its contractors to expand production.       In Fallujah, Hunter recognized the Humvees. He couldn't      identify the two vehicles next to them. One was called a      Cougar, the other a Buffalo. Both were MRAPs, made by Force      Protection Inc., and both, he was told, were coveted. They      were used by explosives disposal teams, but combat units      ``looked at them and said, `We want those,' '' Hunter      recalls.       Throughout most of Iraq, they still haven't arrived.       Despite requests from the field, Pentagon officials decided      to ration the vehicle. In 2003 and 2004, they bought about      55, and only for explosives-disposal units. But they chose a      different approach for protecting the rest of the troops:      adding armor to Humvees. The choice was problematic. The      Humvee's flat bottom channels an explosion through the center      of the vehicle, toward the occupants.       Memos and e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show a stream of      concerns about the decision to armor the Humvee. Most went up      the chain of command and withered:       December 2003: At the direction of then-deputy Defense      secretary Paul Wolfowitz, who was troubled by the mounting      death toll from IEDs, the Joint Chiefs began to explore      options for giving troops better armor. Detailed information      on the Wer'Wolf, an MRAP made in the African country of      Namibia, was passed from analysts in the Pentagon to Lt. Col.      Steven Ware, an aide collecting information for the Joint      Chiefs.       March 30, 2004: Gen. Larry Ellis, in charge of U.S. Forces      Command in Atlanta, sent a memo to the Army's chief of staff,      Gen. Peter Schoomaker. He complained that ``some Army members      and agencies are still in a peacetime posture.'' U.S.      commanders in Iraq told him that the armored Humvee ``is not      providing the solution the Army hoped to achieve.'' He didn't      recommend MRAPs but rather suggested accelerating production      of a combat vehicle called the Stryker. In response, the      military said new Humvee armor kits would suffice.       April 28-29, 2004: Duncan Lang, a Pentagon analyst who      worked in acquisition and technology, suggested purchasing      the Wer'Wolf, the MRAP put before the Joint Chiefs in      December 2003. In an e-mail to colleagues and supervisors,      Lang said ``a number could be sent to Iraq ``as quickly as,      or even more quickly than, additional armored Humvees.'' He      called it ``frustrating to see the pictures of burning      Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there      that would provide more protection.''       April 30, 2004: Another Pentagon analyst, Air Force Lt.      Col. Bob Harris, forwarded details about MRAP options to a      member of the IED task force. The list included a variety of      MRAPs, among them the Wer'Wolf and Force Protection's Cougar.      ``There was no great clarity as to why they didn't pursue      these options,'' Harris says. ``I saw it as my job to      educate.'' Harris is now an acquisition officer at Hanscom      Air Force Base in Massachusetts.       Hunter says the advantages the MRAP had on the Humvee were      clear. ``It's a simple formula,'' Hunter says. ``A vehicle      that's 1 foot off the ground gets 16 times that (blast)      impact that you get in a vehicle that's 4 feet off the      ground,'' like the MRAP.       Although Hunter favored adding armor to Humvees, he now      calls the military's devotion to that approach a costly      mistake. ``It's true that they saved more lives by moving     first on up-armoring the Humvees,'' he says. ``The flaw is      that they did nothing on MRAPs. The up-armoring of Humvees      didn't have to be an exclusive operation.''       Holder dismisses the idea that the Pentagon could have      moved on a dual track: armoring Humvees while ordering      up MRAPs. He doubts Congress would have funded both at the      time. But that's exactly what Congress is doing now--     buying both vehicles.       ``We probably should've had the foresight'' to start buying      MRAPs earlier, says Ware, the Joint Chiefs aide (now retired)      who passed the information to superiors and counterparts in      the Army and Marines. But ``we just couldn't get them there      fast enough.'' Adding armor to the Humvee, Ware says, ``was      better than nothing.''          The lieutenant colonel: ``Hope no one gets wasted''       A PowerPoint presentation, dated Aug. 25, 2004, shows      wounded troops lying in hospital beds. Most are bandaged. One      is bloody. His left eye is barely open, his injured right is      covered by a patch. Each was maimed by an IED. Each, save      one, was in a Humvee.       On another slide: ``Numerous vehicles on the market provide      far superior ballistic protection'' than the Humvee, wrote      then-lieutenant colonel Jim Hampton, the man who prepared the      presentation for the operations staff of the U.S. Army Corps      of Engineers in Baghdad.       Safety is a passion for Hampton. He's so concerned with      security that he asks his wife, Kate, to take her pistol when      she goes for walks on their 80 acres in rural Mississippi.      When he got to Iraq in early 2004, he was tasked with looking      at armor options to protect the Corps of Engineers, the      agency sent to help with rebuilding efforts. For weeks, he      studied armor options. His conclusion: The corps should get      MRAPs to protect its people, specifically Wer'Wolves. Hampton      says he asked for 53 Wer'Wolves. The corps got four.       Hampton couldn't have been more opposed to up-armoring the      Humvees and warned his superiors. He even e-mailed his wife      from Iraq. ``Hey Babe,'' his e-mail read. ``Just a little      aggravated with the bureaucracy. It is simply beyond my      comprehension why we're having to go through such (an ordeal)      to order confounded hard vehicles. I sure hope no one gets      wasted before the powers-that-be get off their collective fat      asses.''       Finally, he wrote his congressman, Rep. Chip Pickering, R-     Miss., urging him to investigate deaths involving the Humvee.      ``We would never consider sending troops'' in Humvees ``up      against armor or artillery,'' Hampton wrote, ``but this is      tantamount to what we're doing because these vehicles are      being engaged with the very ordnance delivered by artillery      in the form of improvised explosive devices.''       By November 2004, Pentagon analyst Lang had grown      discouraged, an e-mail shows. ``I have found that you can      never put the word out too many times,'' he wrote on Nov. 17.      ``I send it on to (the Secretary of Defense's office), Army      and (Marine Corps) contacts I have. Some of it is getting to      the rapid fielding folks and force protection folks that are      looking at Iraq issues. I do not see much action.''       Lang closed the message with a variation on his earlier      plea: ``For the life of me, I cannot figure out why we have      not taken better advantage of the sources of such vehicles,''      he wrote. ``We should be buying 200, not 2, at a time. These      things work, they save lives and they don't cost much, if      any, more than what we are using now.'' At the time, a basic      Wer'Wolf cost about the same as a factory-made armored      Humvee: around $200,000.       In December 2004, at a town hall meeting with troops in      Kuwait, a soldier asked Rumsfeld about the lack of armor on      military vehicles. Rumsfeld explained the situation this way:      ``You go to war with the Army you have. They're not the Army      you might want or wish to have at a later time.''       The concerns troops voiced at the meeting might have had an      impact. Within a week, the Marine Corps Systems Command in      Quantico posted its first notice seeking information on MRAPs      from potential contractors.       Back in Fallujah, the desire for the Cougar had grown. By      February 2005, the Marines were formally asking for more.      Field commanders sent their first large-scale request for      MRAPs, seeking 1,169 vehicles with specifications that      closely mirrored those of the Cougar. They no longer      envisioned the vehicle as limited to explosives-disposal      teams; they wanted MRAPs for combat troops, too.       Roy McGriff III, then a major, drafted the request signed      by Brig. Gen. Hejlik. ``MRAP vehicles will protect Marines,      reduce casualties, increase mobility and enhance mission      success,'' the request read. ``Without MRAP, personnel loss      rates are likely to continue at their current rate.'' In      spring 2005, he would have a chance to argue his case before      top generals.              The Marine major: ``Unnecessary'' casualties       They convened March 29-30, 2005, at the Marine Corps Air      Station in Miramar, Calif. The occasion: a safety board      meeting, a regular gathering to address safety issues across      the Corps. In attendance: five three-star generals, four two-     stars, seven one-stars and McGriff.       McGriff knew the MRAP's history and the Pentagon's      reluctance to invest in the vehicle. He had learned about the      vehicle from a fellow Marine, Wayne Sinclair. Sinclair, then      a captain, wrote in the July 1996 issue of the Marine Corps      Gazette that ``an affordable answer to the land mine was      developed over 20 years ago. It's time that Marines at the      sharp end shared in . . . this discovery.''       Addressing the generals, McGriff recommended analyzing      every incident involving Marine vehicles the same way      investigators probe aircraft crashes. Look at the vehicle for      flaws, McGriff recalls telling the officers, and examine the      tactics used to defeat it.       Lt. Gen. Wallace Gregson, commander of Marine Corps Forces      in the Pacific, and Lt. Gen. James Mattis, leader of the      Marine Combat Development Command, listened and then      conferred for a moment.       The room grew quiet. ``Then they said, `OK, what do you      want to do?' '' McGriff remembers.       He recited the very plan that the Pentagon, under a new      Defense secretary, would embrace in 2007: ``A phased      transition. Continue to armor Humvees. At the same time, as      quickly and as expeditiously as possible, purchase as many      MRAPs as possible. Phase out Humvees.''       According to McGriff, the room again grew silent. Then,      Mattis finally spoke: ``That's exactly what we're going to      do.'' Mattis' words failed to translate into action. The      urgent-need request McGriff drafted went unfulfilled at      Marine headquarters in Quantico. A June 10, 2005, status      report on the request indicated the Marine Corps was holding      out for a ``future vehicle,'' presumably the Joint Light      Tactical Vehicle--more mobile than the MRAP, more protective      than the Humvee, and due in 2012. In practical terms, that      meant no MRAPs immediately.       McGriff foresaw some of the turmoil over vehicles in a      prophetic 2003 paper for the School for Advanced Warfighting      in Quantico.       ``Currently, our underprotected vehicles result in      casualties that are politically untenable and militarily      unnecessary,'' his paper read. ``Failure to build a MRAP      vehicle fleet produces a deteriorating cascade of effects      that will substantially increase'' risks for the military      while ``rendering it tactically immobile.'' Mines and IEDs      will force U.S. troops off the roads, he wrote, and keep them      from aggressively attacking insurgents.       The words were strong and the conclusions were damning.      Rhodesia, a nation with nothing near the resources of the      U.S. military, had built MRAPs more than a quarter-century      earlier that remained ``more survivable than any comparable      vehicle produced by the U.S. today,'' McGriff wrote.       Despite his views then, McGriff, now a lieutenant colonel,      says he understands the delays. MRAPs needed to be tested to      ensure they could perform in combat. ``Nothing happens fast      enough when people are fighting and dying,'' he says today.      ``But amidst the chaos, you still have to make the right      choices. In the end, I think the Marines got the MRAP      capability as quickly and safely as possible.''       Others disagree.       Marine major Franz Gayl, now retired, was science adviser      to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq. He saw how      Marines were still being killed or maimed in Anbar in the      fall of 2006. If the Marine Corps had decided MRAPs were a      top priority, he says, it could and should have pursued them      with the same urgency the Pentagon is now showing.       ``The ramp-up of industry capacity was delayed by over 1\1/     2\ years,'' Gayl says, ``until it became the dire emergency      that it is today.''       Bureaucrats didn't want the MRAP sooner ``because it would      compete against'' armored Humvees and ``many other favored      programs'' for funding, Gayl says. Gayl, who works as a      civilian for the Marines at the Pentagon, has filed for      federal whistleblower protection because he fears retaliation      for speaking out about the failure to get MRAPs sooner.            Defense Secretary Gates: ``Lives are at stake''       After McGriff addressed the generals in March 2005, another      15 months passed. Then the Marines in Iraq reiterated the      request for MRAPs. This time they sent the request directly      to the Joint Chiefs. This time they were successful.       In December 2006, after insurgent bombs had killed almost      1,200 U.S. troops in Iraq, the Joint Chiefs validated      requests from Iraq for 4,060 MRAPs, and the formal MRAP      program was launched.       By March 2007, Marine Corps Commandant James Conway called      the vehicle his ``No. 1 unfilled warfighting requirement.''       In part, that's because he saw it save lives in Anbar      province. Brig. Gen. John Allen, deputy commander of      coalition forces there, says the Marines tracked attacks on      MRAPs since January 2006. The finding: Marines in armored      Humvees are twice as likely to be badly wounded in an IED      attack as those in MRAPs.       Perhaps more convincing: No Marines have been killed in      more than 300 attacks on MRAPs there.       The news, revealed in USA TODAY on April 19, drew the      attention of Defense Secretary Gates, four months into his      job at the Pentagon. He was traveling in Iraq and read about      the MRAP's success in the Pentagon's daily news roundup.      Weeks later, at a news conference, Gates said the Pentagon      would rush MRAPs to Iraq ``as best we can.''       Late last month, top Pentagon officials approved an Army      strategy for buying as many as 17,700 MRAPs, allowing a one-     for-one swap     for its armored Humvees. About 5,200 MRAPs had been approved      for the other services. Now, Pentagon officials decline to      say exactly how many MRAPs they need.       One official says they'll build MRAPs as fast as possible,      then recalibrate the military's needs as they assess      operations in Iraq, a tacit acknowledgment that they may need      fewer MRAPs as U.S. troops are withdrawn.       During another news conference late last month, Gates      worried that the companies building the MRAP--not only Force      Protection but BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Oshkosh Truck,      Armor Holdings, International Military and Government and      Protected Vehicles--won't be able to get the vehicles to Iraq      fast enough.       ``I didn't think that was acceptable,'' Gates said. ``Lives      are at stake.''             the young lieutenant: ``safest vehicle ever''       As the sun egan to bake the Iraqi countryside last month,      Marine 2nd Lt. George Saenz headed back to his base on the      outskirts in Fallujah. He felt oddly joyful.       Saenz had just spent hours leading his platoon through one      of the most excruciating battlefield jobs--inching a convoy      along the crumbling streets of Fallujah, searching for      homemade bombs planted in the asphalt or dirt.       The night before had proved dangerous. Two bombs had blown      up underneath Saenz's convoy, including one beneath his      vehicle.       As Saenz turned through the gray blast walls protecting the      base, he says he couldn't help but think: If I had been      riding a Humvee, I wouldn't be here right now.       Saenz knew why he was alive. His platoon in the 6th Marine      Regiment Combat Team had replaced its Humvees with MRAPs. The      two blasts produced just one injury, a Marine whose      concussion put him on light duty for a week.       ``We're probably in the safest vehicle ever designed for      military use,'' Saenz says, recalling his platoon's record:      Three months. Eleven bomb attacks. No one dead.       MRAPs have become legendary in Anbar since Marines began      using them on dangerous missions clearing roadside bombs.      Tank commanders, radio operators and others drop by Saenz's      platoon every day to do what Rep. Hunter had done three years      earlier--inspect the small fleet of MRAPs, knock on the      armor, sometimes crawl inside.       Scores of MRAPs are scheduled to arrive in Anbar this      summer. That means they'll be available for the first time to      the Marines for tasks other than clearing IEDs, says Marine      Col. Mike Rudolph, logistics officer for U.S. forces in      western Iraq. No one has decided how MRAPs will be used, but      ``everybody wants one,'' Rudolph says.       To be sure, the vehicle isn't perfect. Saenz's team warns      that MRAPs drive like trucks, plodding and heavy. Some models      are so bulky they have blind spots for troops peering over      the boxy hood and so noisy a driver has to shout at someone 2      feet away.       ``They're just so heavy,'' Sgt. Randall Miller says.      ``These are virtually designed off a semi-truck platform.''       After substantial testing, the military also has concluded      that MRAPs are vulnerable to explosively formed projectiles,      the newest and most devastating variation of the IED. More      armor has been developed for the MRAPs the Pentagon ordered      this spring.       Miller isn't complaining. On his first tour in Iraq in      2004-05, Miller searched for land mines in a Humvee. His      detection technique was simple: ``Go real slow, cross your      fingers.'' He still drives slowly but feels safer knowing the      MRAP's V-shaped hull will deflect a bomb blast. ``I've seen      our guys get hit and walk away,'' Miller says. ``They're      awesome, awesome vehicles.''              the widow: ``they should've done it'' sooner       Whom or what is to blame for the delay in getting safer      vehicles for the 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq?       Jim Hampton, now a retired colonel, questions why the      Pentagon and Congress didn't do more to keep the troops safe.      ``I have colleagues who say people need to go to jail over      this, and in my mind they do,'' Hampton says.       Hunter, now running for president, blames the Pentagon      bureaucracy, which he says ``doesn't move fast enough to meet      the needs of the war fighter. We have a system in which the      warfighting requirements are requested from the field and the      acquisition people say, `We'll get it on our schedule.' ''       Other members of Congress blame Rumsfeld and his vision of      transforming the military into a leaner, faster fighting      force.       Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., wonders if Rumsfeld's forceful      personality silenced some of the generals. ``Rumsfeld so      intimidated the military that I've lost confidence in them      telling us what they really need'' in Iraq, Murtha says.       ``They all knew the Rumsfeld rule: Your career is over if      you say anything contrary'' to his policies, Murtha says.      ``It's much better now that Rumsfeld is gone. The military is      being much more honest.''       If the Pentagon ``had just listened to the guys in the      field'' who wanted MRAPs, Murtha says, ``we'd have them in      Iraq right now.''       USA TODAY could not determine what role, if any, Rumsfeld      played in MRAP deliberations. A spokesman for Rumsfeld, now      running a foundation in Washington, said last week that the      former Defense secretary would not comment.       Aaron Kincaid's widow, Rachel, doesn't know who should be      held accountable. She is haunted by whether getting MRAPs to      Iraq earlier might have saved her husband's life. The bomb      that blew apart his Humvee lay along the path he and his unit      took, and no one noticed.       Today, she wonders: Was his death really about the path      that he took, or about the path the Pentagon spent years      avoiding, the path that, in May, finally led them to the      vehicle that might have saved her husband's life?       You think there is always something that could've been done      to prevent it,'' Rachel Kincaid says of her husband's death.       ``If that's been around for that many years,'' she says of      the MRAP, ``why hasn't it been used? They should've done it      at the beginning of the war. They should've done it three      years ago, four years ago.''                          ____________________
