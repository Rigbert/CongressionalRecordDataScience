Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Chairman Maurice Lyons. Maurice passed away on Wednesday, October 16, 2013. A long time resident of Riverside County, he was a pillar of the community and he will be deeply missed.  Maurice was born January 21, 1950, in Riverside County as one of nine children and raised a Morongo Tribal Member. He grew up on the Morongo Indian Reservation where he would later attend Banning High School. Maurice quickly became involved in the betterment of the Morongo Indian Reservation following his completion of school when he gained a job as a machine operator with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where he would remain a dedicated employee for over seventeen years.  Maurice's investment back into his community did not stop with his work, as he also became actively involved in public service beginning in 1994. Maurice served as Tribal Housing Commissioner, Chairman of the Morongo Head Start Parent Policy Committee, and Chairman of the Board of the National Indian Child Welfare Association. He was elected Tribal Chairman in July 2001 and faith in his leadership remained for years to come as he was reelected as Chairman in 2003, and again in 2005.  He worked closely with state and federal legislators on Native American and Morongo tribe related issues affecting government and economic development. Through his leadership, he made it a priority to improve the quality of life on the reservation through a betterment of youth programs created to preserve local Indian culture and customs. With a deep commitment to his history and heritage, Maurice kept the Morongo culture alive by encouraging education of youth in language and tradition.  Maurice quickly became a voice for Riverside County. He served on the Riverside National Cemetery's governing board and was instrumental in establishing the MIA-POW monument which has become a fixture in the community. He represented the Morongo tribe with the National Indian Gaming Association, which hosts 70 member states, and with the Tribal Alliance of Sovereign Indian Nations, a regional federation of 13 tribal governments. He was honored by the Council of Energy Resource Tribes for his national leadership in preserving tribal sovereignty.  Maurice was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife, Sandra Lyons; children, Tammie Lynn Lyons, Ernest Lewis Lyons, Melissa Renee Lyons, Maurice William Lyons, Joseph Rafael Lyons, Onoalyse Onjaleeen Lyons, Joshua Nicholas Bau Lyons, Isabella Ryanne Lyons, Kyle Munson, Andre Petkov, Angel Raelyna Gonzales, Erika Gonzales; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. On Saturday, October 19, 2013, a Memorial Service honoring Maurice's extraordinary life was held at the Morongo Reservation Community Center.  Maurice will always be remembered for his devotion to family, caring nature and selfless giving. He demonstrated an incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family, and I can personally attest to Maurice's professionalism and positive attitude. These achievements and qualities are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Maurice's family and friends. Although Maurice may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
