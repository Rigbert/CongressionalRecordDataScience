 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a respectable Kentucky veteran, Mr. Ledford ``Led'' Stephens. Ledford, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, still remembers vividly the time he spent serving overseas in Europe during World War II.  Led grew up across the creek from Lower Cal Hill Cemetery in Pine Knot, KY. When he was 18 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After passing two physicals, Led was allowed to spend 2 weeks at home before he boarded a train at Stearns station to Fort Thomas. There he received his clothes and was then shipped to Fort Wheeler, GA, for basic training. After completing basic training, Led spent a short time at Camp New Jersey where he received his ``impregnated clothes,'' which were outfits that protected soldiers from gas--this was a clear indicator that he would eventually be shipped overseas.  A short time later, Led remembers boarding a ship in New York that sailed for 14 days and nights before finally reaching Casablanca, North Africa. After arriving, Led and his group were placed with the 3rd Division and sent to assist in the Invasion of Sicily. Led was assigned to the position of 30-caliber machine gunner on his team.  ``From there, I went on to the Invasion of Italy. We went in there on a beach and fought our way up,'' Led recalls. ``I met a fellow from Frazer, Kentucky, and we both promised that wewould find each other's people back home if anything happened to either of us. It ended up that he was killed . . . I tried to find his people when I came back home, but I never could find them.''  The toil of war eventually took a toll on Led as well. During a battle, ``a shell went off close to me, and it did something to my ears,'' Led says. ``My face was numb . . . they loaded me into an ambulance and took me to the 106 Hospital in Naples, Italy.'' After that, Led spent time recovering in a rest camp and was taken out of combat and was assigned to a port battalion where he loaded and unloaded supplies.  After the war, Led received many medals and ribbons, including the Bronze Star for his service. Once he returned home to Kentucky, Led began a career as a coal-truck driver--he is also an ordained minister in his spare time. Around his 70th birthday, Led fell in love with Lois Neal, a girl he had known from his childhood. The two have been married now for over 18 years and reside happily together in their home in Pine Knot, KY.  I would like to ask that my Senate colleagues join me in thanking Mr. Ledford ``Led'' Stephens for his patriotism and selflessness. I commend Ledford for his service and accomplishments throughout his life--he is a true inspiration to Kentuckians everywhere. The McCreary County Voice in Whitley City, KY, recently published an article highlighting Ledford's honorable life and service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the McCreary County Voice, Aug. 11, 2011]                         Memories of a Soldier                           (By Eugenia Jones)       As a youngster, growing up across the creek from Lower Cal      Hill Cemetery, Ledford ``Led'' Stephens never dreamed that he      would someday travel to distant lands to serve his country.      The American war veteran, who just recently celebrated his      90th birthday, has vivid memories of his time spent in World      War II.       He recalls, ``When I was 18, I registered for the Army.      Next thing I knew, I got a call to go in and get two      physicals. I passed the first physical they gave me at      Stearns, and then I had to go all the way to Cincinnati for      the second one. When I was there in Cincinnati, they told us      to say, `Home' if we wanted to go back home for fourteen      days. Me and a buddy wanted to go back home for two weeks.      After we got those days at home, I caught a train at the      station at Stearns to go back to the Army. There were many      people at the station, and they were crying as we headed off      for the war. I ended up at Fort Thomas where they issued my      clothes. I went on to Fort Wheeler, Georgia, for basic      training and then to Camp New Jersey. A buddy of mine from      home was there with me. He had his guitar, and one night, he      started picking a song about going back home. All at once, he      told me that he wanted to go home, but I told him that they      would kill us if we took off. They issued us our impregnated      clothes there. Those types of clothes protect the soldiers      from gas. We just knew that being issued those clothes meant      that we were going overseas for sure.''       The hunch about going overseas was correct, and Stephens      can still remember leaving the U.S. ``From New Jersey, I went      to New York where we loaded a ship and sailed for fourteen      days and nights. We ended up in Casablanca, North Africa. We      spent a couple of weeks there and were put in the 3rd      Division. Right about that same time, there was a surrender,      and I thought we might get to go home. Instead, we ended up      in the Invasion of Sicily. I was the first scout in the town      of Messina, Sicily, and, from there, I went on to the      Invasion of Italy. We went in there on a beach and fought our      way up. I met a fellow from Frazer, Kentucky, and we both      promised that we would find each other's people back home if      anything happened to either of us. It ended up that he was      killed. I was a 30-caliber machine gunner, and he was an      assistant with another gunner. That is how he was killed. I      tried to find his people when I came back home, but I never      could find them.''       The war eventually took a physical toll on Stephens. He      explains, ``The Germans came in shelling us. A shell went off      close to me, and it did something to my ears. My face was      numb. They wanted me to wait to go to the hospital until the      36th Division could relieve us. When I did go to the medics,      they were in a long hospital tent. A fellow looked at me and      loaded me into an ambulance. They took me to the 106 Hospital      in Naples, Italy. After that, I went to a rest camp and some      other hospitals. I ended up being taken out of combat and was      assigned to a port battalion where I loaded and unloaded      supplies.''       Stephens did have some fun times while he was overseas. His      face lights up with a grin as he tells about the two girls he      met while in Europe. ``While I was there in Italy, I was sent      to a rest camp. I could go to town whenever I wanted. Me and      a buddy met two girls in town one day. We went for a ride      with them, and I started seeing the girl named Connie quite      regularly. I went for a time without seeing her and decided I      would go to her house and find her. I went up the stairs and      knocked on the door, and an old woman came to the door. She      spoke English and said, ``Stephens, come in!'' The old woman      was Connie's mom. She and Connie were glad to see me. When we      shipped out, Connie wanted to go. I went back later to see      her, and, this time, there she was! She was locked in the      arms of a sailor! Of course, that was the end of our      friendship!''       ``I met Esther when I was in France. When I first saw her,      she was crocheting, and she spoke English. Her sister's name      was Julie, and I told my buddy about Julie. The Germans had      taken their parents. One day, me and my buddy went and      visited. Julie's boyfriend came while we were there. Julie      was dating a boy named Scott from Tennessee. She was seeing      Scott and my buddy both at the same time. When I left France,      I told Esther that someday I would be back for her. When I      got back to the States, I planned to go back overseas, but      Mrs. Harmon of the draft board thought I should wait awhile.      I had already been overseas for thirty months and ten days. I      ended up never going back overseas, and I never saw Esther      again.''       After returning to the States, Stephens, the recipient of      many medals and ribbons, including the Bronze Star, spent his      life working as a coal-truck driver and, for a few years, he      worked in Indiana. At the age of 62, he began working for the      Forest Service where he remained for more than three years.      Stephens also was an ordained minister.       In his golden years, when he was about 70, Stephens fell in      love with Lois Neal. Lois, who, for many years, owned and      operated a grocery store at the top of Davis Hill in Pine      Knot, recalls, ``When Led started coming to the store, he      came regularly!'' ``Led'' adds with a chuckle, ``I enjoyed      helping her in the store. It sure wasn't the store that I was      after. It was Lois! I had my eye on her, and, then, she sent      me some roses! We had known each other when we were growing      up. Before I went overseas, I remember taking her for a ride      in a Model A. I was singing, I'm Sitting on Top of the World'      when we went for that ride.'' The two have now been married      for 18 years.       When ``Led'' finishes telling the stories about his days in      WW II, it is easy to see that this man who traveled the world      serving his country as a young man is now happy to be      ``sitting on top of the world'' with his lovely wife Lois at      their home in Pine Knot, Kentucky.                          ____________________
