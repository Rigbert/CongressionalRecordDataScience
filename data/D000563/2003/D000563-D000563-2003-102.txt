I think the Senator from Searchlight is going to fill me in about the history of his hometown, but I would like to ask the Senator, for those who may have just joined in this debate, if he could bring me up to speed as to where we are in terms of the business of the Senate with pending appropriation bills.  I ask, through the Chair, are there still appropriations bills that need to be worked on and resolved before this Senate will have finished its work? If so, could the Senator tell me if the schedule announced by the Republican majority leader this week is conducive to finishing that schedule?
