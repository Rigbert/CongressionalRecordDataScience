We are now seeing addiction creep into neighborhoods and communities of all sizes, both rural and urban. My home State of Vermont has not been spared, and it in fact has attracted much attention for its struggles with addiction. However in many ways, Vermont is ahead of much of the Nation when it comes to responding to the opioid epidemic. We long ago recognized the problem, and communities in Vermont have spent the better part of a decade coming together to address opioid addiction.  In March I had the privilege of chairing a field hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in Rutland, VT. It was the fourth time in the past 6 years that I brought the committee to Vermont to explore issues related to drug abuse. I heard powerful testimony discussing how communities are responding to addiction, rethinking decades-old approaches to prevention, treatment, and law enforcement efforts. Dr. Harry Chen, the Vermont Department of Health commissioner and a career emergency room physician, described what it means to recognizeaddiction as a public health issue, expanding evidence-based prevention and treatment services to all corners of the State.  Vermont hospitals are also rethinking best practices in light of this epidemic. Recently, the Office of National Drug Control Policy published an article entitled ``How a Vermont Hospital Fights the American Opioid Epidemic.'' The article was authored by Dr. Stephen Leffler, the chief medical officer at Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington, VT. In the article, Dr. Leffler describes how Fletcher Allen is on the leading edge of modernizing health care practices to minimize abuse and addiction, while still providing necessary pain management. The hospital provides clear, standardized protocols for treating pain, defines a maximum daily dosage as guided by the latest research, and measures patients' risk for addiction. This approach ensures consistency in treatment and may help to stem the flow of prescription opioid users from sliding into addiction.  The approach described in Dr. Leffler's article could potentially serve as a model for the rest of country, and I would encourage other States grappling with addiction to look at what Fletcher Allen is doing in Burlington. If we are to find legislative solutions that may finally break the cycle of opioid addiction, then surely we must carefully consider promising, novel approaches such as this. I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Leffler's article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     [From The Office of National Drug Control Policy, May 9, 2014]       How a Vermont Hospital Fights the American Opioid Epidemic                      (By Dr. Stephen M. Leffler)       Over the course of my more than 20 years as an emergency      physician, I have seen thousands of patients with painful      conditions. During that same time, I have witnessed the      remarkable evolution of modern pain medication--its potential      and its pitfalls. We can now help patients manage both short-     term and long-term pain. Yet, while medications--particularly      opioids--have helped us heal patients, we have also seen      their detrimental effects, chief among them addiction.       Opioids can be very helpful for patients with conditions      such as broken bones and kidney stones, and they are also      useful after many types of surgery. They may also be used to      treat those with chronic pain--people who experience pain      carrying out normal, daily functions of life that others take      for granted. Used for short periods of time at the proper      dosage, opioids are safe medications and excellent choices      for a wide variety of acute painful conditions.       While opioids work well for pain control, they have a      number of potentially serious side effects: They can hinder      or stop breathing, cause constipation, result in drowsiness,      and act as central nervous system depressants. That's why      your doctor tells you it is not safe to drive after taking      opioids.       Another devastating side effect is addiction. The body      develops a tolerance to opioids and, after only a couple of      weeks, may require higher doses to control pain. Over time,      increasing doses of opioids may be needed to manage the same      level of pain. Patients may develop dependence--their bodies      will crave it. They will exhibit a strong desire or      compulsion to take the drug for reasons beyond simple pain      control. At this stage, if they stop taking opioids, they      will experience withdrawal. This is how opioid use can lead      to addiction and all its inherent problems for the individual      and society.       As providers, our responsibility is to carefully manage the      side effects of opioid therapy. Dependence, tolerance, and      addiction must be discussed with patients, and a careful      well-planned strategy is crucial for their extended use of      opioids.       That is exactly what we are doing at Fletcher Allen Health      Care in Burlington, Vermont. Recently, providers and pain      management experts from multiple specialties (Anesthesia,      Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and      Surgery) converged to standardize how we care for patients      with painful conditions and to develop best practices for our      patients.       What did we do? Here is an overview:       Systems Approach. We built standardized protocols so that      patients will get similar treatment in various settings. We      believe this standardization will help our patients and      providers. There will be clear, defined expectations and      goals for treating our patients' pain.       New Rules & Tools. We use processes and tools such as pain      agreements with patients and surveys to assess how patients      are functioning with their pain and to measure their risk for      addiction.       Defining Maximum Daily Dosage. We are one of the first      hospitals in the country to define the maximum daily dose of      opioids. Research shows that beyond certain doses, patients      experience no additional benefit. We know that very high      doses of opioids increase the risk of dangerous side effects      but offer no additional pain control.       This approach helps ensure that we are more reliable and      consistent in our approach to pain in our patients and that      our patients will know what to expect from their providers.       Gil Kerlikowske, then-Director of ONDCP, recently visited      Fletcher Allen Health Care to discuss our new approach and      tools. He lauded our systems-level strategy and our      standardized protocols. I believe that the current dialogue      in Vermont and elsewhere on how to better manage opioid abuse      will be productive and lead to changes across the country in      how these drugs are prescribed and how acute and chronic pain      is managed. Fletcher Allen Health Care is on the leading edge      of this transition and could be a model for other health      systems managing this complex issue. I hope that sharing our      practices here is the first step toward being that model.                          ____________________
