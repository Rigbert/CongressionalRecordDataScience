President, I say, in response to the Senator from Nevada, he obviously does not understand the world as the folks across the aisle from us see it. They believe that families across America get up every morning and want to know whether the latest constitutional amendment has passed. They think that is what families do--rush to the television set, turn it on, and say quickly: Honey, did they pass a constitutional amendment?  That is not what I find. What I find at home is that families get together and say: I hope we can keep our job. I hope, for goodness' sake, that next year health insurance doesn't cost as much as it did last year and cover less.  That is the reality. That is the reality of life for families across America. So you wonder if those of us elected to the Senate really represent America and are listening to American families and businesses and labor unions, who tell us time and time again: The cost of health insurance is killing us. Why don't you do something?  Instead, the leadership in the Senate, in this do-nothing Congress, comes forward and says: We are going to blow off 3 days on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating a constitutional amendment about same-sex marriage.  Well, my wife and I have been married for 37 years. We believe in traditional marriage. But, for goodness' sake, why do you need to amend theConstitution--in a Presidential election year, I might add--instead of talking about the cost of health insurance and making it more affordable and more accessible for people across America? That is a real issue, and it is an issue that has been really avoided by the leadership in this Senate.
