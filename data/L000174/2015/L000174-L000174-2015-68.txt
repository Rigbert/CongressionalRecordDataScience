President, this month, the Senate passed a resolution recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and celebrating Hispanic Americans as dedicated public servants in the highest levels of government. These great Americans include a Supreme Court Justice, 3 U.S. Senators, 34 members of the House of Representatives, and 3 members of the President's Cabinet. I commend the U.S. Senate for passing this resolution celebrating Hispanic heritage, but we should be doing much more than approving a resolution. We should be working on a bipartisan basis to pass comprehensive immigration reform, as the Senate did last Congress under a Democratic majority. At the same time, the Senate should immediately confirm the several judicial nominees supported by the nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar Association.  There are three outstanding Hispanic judicial nominees that are currently pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar: Luis Felipe Restrepo, nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the Third Circuit; Armando Bonilla, nominated to a judicial vacancy in the Court of Federal Claims; and John Michael Vazquez, nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the district of New Jersey. A fourth, Dax Lopez, has been nominated to a judicial vacancy in the Northern District of Georgia, and is still awaiting a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.  These dedicated public servants are eager to serve, but they have been blocked by the Republican leadership's virtual shutdown of the judicial confirmation process since they took over the majority in January. More than 8 months into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed just six votes for judges. At this rate, the Senate this year will confirm the fewest number of judges in more than a half century. Luis Felipe Restrepo, Armando Bonilla, John Michael Vazquez, and Dax Lopez all deserve an up or down vote by this Senate.  Judge Restrepo was nominated last year to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. If confirmed, Judge Restrepo would be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this appellate court and only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit. He was unanimously confirmed 2 years ago by the Senate to serve as a district court judge. During his tenure as both a Federal district court judge and as a Federal magistrate judge, he has presided over 56 trials that have gone to verdict or judgment. He is superbly qualified, and I have heard no objection to his nomination. Despite his outstanding credentials and experience, it took the Republican majority 7 months just to schedule a hearing in the Judiciary Committee for this qualified nominee.  Judge Restrepo has bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators and was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote. He has the strong endorsement of the nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar Association. At his confirmation hearing in June, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no question Judge Restrepo is a very well-qualified candidate to serve on the Third Circuit.'' Senator Toomey described Judge Restrepo's life story as ``an American dream'' and recounted how Judge Restrepo came to the United States from Colombia and rose to the top of his profession by ``virtue of his hard work, his intellect, his integrity.'' I could not agree more.  Given his remarkable credentials, wealth of experience, and strong bipartisan support, the Senate should have confirmed Judge Restrepo months ago. Instead, for 10 months since his nomination back in November 2014, he has been denied a vote on his confirmation. No Senate Democrat opposes a vote on his nomination. He is being denied a confirmation vote by Senate Republican leadership. No one doubts that hewill be confirmed once Majority Leader McConnell schedules his vote. I have heard Senator Toomey indicate his strong support and that he would like to see Judge Restrepo receive a vote, but I have yet to see him ask for a firm commitment on a vote. The people of Pennsylvania are no doubt wondering when this longstanding and emergency vacancy on their appeals court will be filled.  Another outstanding public servant is Armando Bonilla, who was first nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims back in May 2014. If confirmed, Mr. Bonilla would be the first Hispanic judge to hold a seat on that court. He is strongly endorsed by the Hispanic National Bar Association. He has spent his entire career, now spanning over two decades, as an attorney for the Department of Justice. He was hired out of law school into the Department's prestigious Honors Program and has risen to become an associate deputy attorney general in the Department.  Armando Bonilla's background is also one that reminds us of the American dream. The son of a Cuban immigrant and Cuban American father, Mr. Bonilla has told the story of his mother's flight from Havana with his aunt and his grandmother. He has told the story of his uncle, ``Tio Mario,'' who eventually disappeared trying to help other exiles. And he has told the story of his father, who dropped out of high school, but served our country by joining the Marines and took on several jobs to support Armando and his sister. As Mr. Bonilla has beautifully described, his father ``exemplified the most outstanding qualities of the Hispanic culture and Hispanic people: the selfless sacrifice, the steely resolve, and unbridled optimism and the genuine pride in an honest day's work--all toward the cause of improving the lives of the next generation.'' Mr. Bonilla should be confirmed without further delay.  The U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been operating with several vacancies since February 2013. Only 11 of the 16 seats on the court are occupied by active judges. We could have a court working at full strength if we confirmed Mr. Bonilla and the other four nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. All five of them were nominated more than a year ago and have twice been voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. There is no good reason to delay an up-or-down vote for these uncontroversial nominees.  John Michael Vazquez was nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the district of New Jersey in March. He has been a public servant for both the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey and as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in the District of New Jersey. During his tenure in the U.S. attorney's office, Mr. Vazquez handled a wide array of Federal investigations and prosecutions while serving in the general crimes unit, the major narcotics unit, the terrorism unit, and the securities and health care fraud unit.  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Vazquez ``Well Qualified'' to serve as a district judge, its highest rating. He also has the support of his two home State Senators, Senators Menendez and Booker. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. There is no reason why Mr. Vazquez, along with Judge Restrepo and Mr. Bonilla, should not be confirmed today. Each of the outstanding Hispanic judicial nominees pending on the floor will be confirmed overwhelmingly if Majority Leader McConnell will simply schedule a confirmation vote.  Over the past 7 years, the Senate has acted to confirm some outstanding Hispanic American judicial nominees. President Obama nominated the first Latina to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as the first Latino circuit judges in three circuits: Alberto Diaz on the fourth circuit, Adalberto Jordan on the 11th circuit, and Jimmie Reyna on the Federal Circuit; and has already appointed 35 Hispanic Americans to serve on the Federal bench, more than any other president in history. But this record does not mean that the Senate should shut down any further confirmations as some in the majority may desire. The Senate has an obligation to vote on judicial nominees in regular order and to consider them fairly based on their individual merit.  A recent report from The Brookings Institution dated September 18, 2015, confirms that the Republican obstruction on judicial nominees is unprecedented in recent history. It states: ``Senate Republicans' aggressive slowdown in judicial confirmations so far in 2015 . . . are contrary to the confirmation records in the final two years of the other two-term presidencies since 1961--Ronald Reagan, William Clinton, and George W. Bush.'' And a recent report by the Alliance for Justice, dated September 17, 2015, notes that ``the burgeoning vacancies are the result of playing politics with judicial selection. And the victims are the people and businesses who cannot access courts to seek justice and the judges who must shoulder the burden of increased caseloads and fewer resources.''  I urge all Senators to read these reports as well as a recent story in the Associated Press that highlights the real consequences of Senate Republicans' judicial blockade. The story highlights a case brought by Latino migrant farmworkers for wage theft in Federal district court in eastern California. I ask unanimous consent that the Associated Press article be printed in the Record. The workers have waited more than 3 years to learn whether they can proceed with their claim. As years go by, the workers' attorney worries that her clients will have moved and be impossible to reach if and when she is able to recover their stolen wages. This is another heartbreaking example that justice delayed is effectively justice denied. The Senate, however, can act right now to alleviate the considerable backlog of cases in the Eastern District of California by confirming the noncontroversial pending nominee for this court, Federal Magistrate Judge Dale Drozd. Judge Drozd was voice voted out of the Judiciary Committee in June, and there is no reason why we cannot vote today on his confirmation.  The Republican leadership's virtual shutdown of judicial confirmations has only served to undermine the judicial branch and harm the American people. I urge Senate Republicans to change course and lead responsibly. The Senate should immediately turn to the confirmation vote of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo and then schedule confirmation votes for the other 15 judicial nominees, including Mr. Bonilla and Mr. Vazquez, without further delay.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Associated Press, Sept. 27, 2015]          Wheels of Justice Slow at Overloaded Federal Courts                         (By Sudhin Thanawala)       SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--Attorney Martha Gomez has been waiting      more than three years to hear from a federal court whether a      group of farm workers in California's Central Valley can      proceed with their lawsuit alleging wage theft.       The case in California's Eastern District could result in      payouts for thousands of migrant workers, but each passing      day raises the possibility that they will have moved on and      be impossible to track down, Gomez said.       ``Everybody is in limbo, and it's hard to explain that,''      she said.       Across the country, federal district courts have seen a      rise in recent years in the time it takes to get civil cases      to trial and resolve felony criminal cases as judges'      workloads have increased, according to statistics from the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.       The problem is particularly acute in some federal courts      such as California's and Texas's Eastern Districts. Judges      there have workloads about twice the national average and say      they are struggling to keep up.       The result, the judges and attorneys say, is longer wait      times in prison for defendants awaiting trial, higher costs      for civil lawsuits and delays that can render those suits      moot.       ``I think it's fair to say that things are quite bad,''      said Matt Menendez, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for      Justice at New York University School of Law who has studied      judicial caseloads.       Legal scholars say Congress needs to fill judicial      vacancies more quickly but also increase the number of judges      in some districts--both issues that get bogged down in      partisan political fights over judicial nominees.       California's Eastern District, which covers a large swath      of the state that includes Sacramento and Fresno, has had an      unfilled judicial vacancy for nearly three years, and it has      the same number of judicial positions--six--it had in 1978,      according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.       The Judicial Conference of the United States, the national      policy-making body for     the federal courts, has recommended Congress double the      number of judicial positions in the district.       In the late 1990s, the median time for civil cases to go to      trial in the district averaged 2 years and four months. From      2009 to 2014, that number jumped by more than a year. The      median time to resolve criminal cases nearly doubled to an      average of 13 months.       ``You're never out from under it,'' said Morrison England,      the court's chief judge. ``You're constantly trying to do      what you can to get these cases resolved, and we just can't      do it.''       The weighted caseload per judge has climbed from an average      of nearly 600 in the late 1990s to over a 1,000.       The Eastern District of Texas has seen similar increases.       ``The way one older judge put it to me: 'If you have too      many cases, you start to lose the time to think about      them,''' said Ron Clark, the court's chief judge.       The vacancy in California's Eastern District is in Fresno,      which is down to just one full-time district court judge.       Attorneys say they are reluctant to file cases in the      Fresno court because of delays and have faced additional      expenses from having to drive to Sacramento when their case      gets assigned to a judge there who has been called in to      help.       Gomez's April 2012 lawsuit was filed in Fresno and alleges      that Castlerock Farming and Transport forced the workers--     grape harvesters--to work off the clock and did not provide      them with proper rest breaks.       Jim Hanlon, an attorney for Castlerock, said he does not      comment on pending cases. The company says in court documents      it did not directly employ the workers and has already      defended their claims in a separate lawsuit.       Anthony Raimondo, an attorney for another defendant in the      case, said at least some of the time it's taken to resolve      the lawsuit can be attributed to its complexity.       The case lists multiple defendants and alleged labor code      violations and seeks class action status on behalf of as many      as several thousand employees. Early on, the judge overseeing      the case, Senior U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii, put it on      hold pending a class certification ruling in a related case.       But Raimando and Gomez say there have been delays that      appear to have no explanation other than a backlogged court.      Castlerock, for example, filed a motion to dismiss the      lawsuit last September that the judge has yet to rule on.       A woman who answered the phone in Ishii's chambers said he      would be away until the end of September and unavailable for      comment.       Lawrence O'Neill, the one full-time district court judge in      Fresno, said he could not comment on any pending case. But he      said the court's caseload has made it difficult to get trial      dates for civil cases.       He pointed to two cases on his docket--one alleging      excessive force by police and the other race and sex      discrimination by an employer--that were filed in 2013, but      won't go to trial until 2017.       ``We can slow things down because we simply can't work any      harder or faster,'' he said. ``But the real important effect      of that is people who need our help to move their lives      forward are delayed.''                          ____________________
