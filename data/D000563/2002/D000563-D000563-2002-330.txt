I have been supportive of the ethanol program throughout my congressional career. At times I have been chairman of the alcohol fuels caucus in both the House and the Senate. I believe ethanol has been proven over and over again to be a safe fuel. It is simply alcohol. It does not have the carcinogenic and dangerous qualities of MTBE and other chemicals. We have used it successfully in the State of Illinois for years. About a third of our gasoline supply is blended with ethanol and is used safely.  So I say to the Senator from California, speaking only for myself, I accept her challenge. I believe we can establish across the Nation that ethanol is a safe fuel, not only safe for those who would handle it and those who would use it in their cars but safe for our environment.  I see no reason for us to put language in this bill creating any kind of exemption from liability for ethanol or renewables fuels.  The Senator from California has suggested our fuels be held to the same standards as every other fuel in America in terms of public health and safety. I completely endorse that approach. I would like to be shown as a cosponsor to the Senator's amendment.
