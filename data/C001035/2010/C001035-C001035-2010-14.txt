President, today I wish to honor the spirit, determination, and life of Ivy Johnson. Ivy lost her long battle with cancer on Friday, November 19. Our thoughts and prayers remain with her parents, her brothers, and the rest of her family and friends.  While Ivy's many academic achievements and personal adventures will be chronicled by others, I want to focus on the Ivy we knew--the public servant--and I offer these thoughts on her life and her service to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  From the start, I appreciated and respected Ivy's strong work ethic, and my trust in her judgment grew each passing day.  Ivy had a wonderful capacity to combine her knowledge of the law and understanding of policy with the practical political realities that form the foundation of the legislative process. Ivy believed in the law and that it worked to advance notable and worthy goals.  She worked with Representative Issa's staff on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to identify financial support provided by the Federal Government to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, after allegations emerged of inappropriate activity by that organization.  She provided insightful analysis on everything from judicial nominations to homegrown terrorism.  She played a critical role in the investigative work of my staff regarding the November 2009 terrorist attack at Fort Hood. She skillfully conducted investigative reviews of the government's policies relating to the reading of Miranda rights to terrorists captured in the United States.  Ivy understood that the security of our Nation and the privacy and civil liberties of Americans are not mutually exclusive. Her guidance on law enforcement and intelligence tools and techniques reflected a mature appreciation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, an understanding of the threat terrorists pose to our Nation, and a deep respect for the rights of Americans.  Her accomplishments were noteworthy in and of themselves, but they are remarkable considering the personal struggle that Ivy was waging throughout her tenure on the committee.  Shortly before joining my staff, her doctors found a tumor in her jaw. She endured multiple surgeries, numerous rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, and other difficult treatments that sapped her strength and energy.  But neither the cancer nor the treatments could destroy Ivy's determination or spirit. Ivy insisted on carrying a full workload. She was always concerned that her treatments might place additional burdens on her colleagues, and she never complained about the hand she had been dealt.  On more than one occasion, we tried to tell Ivy to stop e-mailing from her BlackBerry while she was waiting for treatments. When a particularly grueling round of treatments or an extensive surgery was on the horizon, and with everything she was undergoing at the time, Ivy thought of others and let us know she would be watching her BlackBerry if we needed her for anything.  And we often did. The trust Ivy had earned from me and my senior staff was such that we regularly sought her guidance on matters across the board. Ivy was ``a lawyer's lawyer''--even the most skilled lawyers on my staff regularly sought her thoughts on issues because her knowledge of the law and her reasoned approach to problem solving was indispensable when complex problems required careful analysis.  In her professional life, and her pain, Ivy was intensely private. Few knew how ill Ivy actually was because while she suffered, her work never did.  There are times in our lives, whether professional or personal, when we know the right person has come into our lives, and that was the case for us with Ivy. It brought a heartfelt smile to my face when Ivy's mother told me that Ivy had called her time with us her ``dream job.''  Ivy's courage and determination will continue to serve as an inspiration for all of us.                          ____________________
