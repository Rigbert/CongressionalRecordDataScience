President, of course I would yield to a question. I would say, I am not going to withdraw the second-degree amendment. I willnot ask for any further debate. We can have up-or-down votes in the interest of time. But I think because of the comity that has been displayed to this point, perhaps if both amendments retreated and were saved for another day, it would be in the best interest of the Senate.
