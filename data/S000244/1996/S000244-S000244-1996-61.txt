Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished chairman from Pennsylvania, the Honorable Bob Walker. For the past 20 years, Bob has been an outstanding representative for the people of Pennsylvania's 16th District.  Since 1978, I've had the pleasure and fun of serving and dealing with Bob. Let me say it here first, there has never been nor will there ever again be a Member quite like Bob.  I've gotten to know Bob pretty well from our work on the Science Committee. Bob has been and continues to be a devoted supporter and ally of science. He has done a marvelous job as chairman of the Science Committee, focusing the limited budget resources on sound science and basic research. I sincerely hope my friend will continue to provide his enthusiasm and counsel in helping develop science policy for many years to come.  Bob's impact has not been limited to science policy. He successfully got his drug-free workplace provision passed in the 100th Congress. In addition, he has had legislative success reforming product liability, antitrust, and intellectual property laws.  Bob has been a master of parliamentary procedure since he entered the House. His mastery forced the Democratic leadership for many years to plug parliamentary loopholes as quickly as Bob could use them. Many battles and victories were won because of Bob's parliamentary skills.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank the Honorable Bob Walker for his outstanding service to the House of Representatives and the United States.                          ____________________
