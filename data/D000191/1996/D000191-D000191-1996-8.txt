Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank the members and staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for including language in the Water Resources Development Act which will help advance an important project in my district known as the Lower Amazon Creek restoration and protection project.  The project, which received approval previously from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Water Resources Development Act section 1135 program, is currently moving into the design and cost estimate phases. Yet a small portion of the project, which was originally constructed jointly by the Corps of Engineers and the Soil Conservation Services, now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS], had previously been left out of the project because of an apparent lack of statutory authority by the Corps of Engineers. This portion of the project is critical to the restoration of the Lower Amazon Creek and I am encouraged that this language will foster the necessary cooperation between the Corps and the NRCS to complete this important project.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support of this critical legislation and urge my counterparts in the Senate to support this provision of the bill.
