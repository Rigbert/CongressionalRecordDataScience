Chairman, I thank the gentleman and the chairman, too, because I think they both recognize a critical need. I know there are difficult choices to be made, and I am very hopeful that we will come back from conference with the Senate with the additional teams funded, and I think that that would be a tremendous asset to the protection of the American people.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
