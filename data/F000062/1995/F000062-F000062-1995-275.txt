 President, California has been hit disproportionately hard by base closures once again. While California is willing to do its fair share of base closures and defense downsizing, this base closure round is simply not fair to the State.   It is my contention that if this round of base closures goes through as proposed by the Commission, the cumulative economic impact of base closures on California will have a devastating impact on California and affect the State's recovery from the recession.  Just after three base closure rounds, it is apparent in California that when base closures are combined with on-going large-scale defense downsizing, there is a substantial impact on jobs for working people. Therefore, a worker who loses a job in the defense industry or on a base, loses retirement benefits, health insurance and a good salary. Similar replacement jobs are simply not available.  I strongly urge the President to reject the 1995 base closure list because of the devastating economic impact--including the cumulative economic impact--of base closures on California.  In addition, several of the Base Closure Commission's recommendations are opposed by the Secretary of Defense, as well as our military and civilian leadership at the Pentagon, because of their adverse impact on U.S. national security. Surely our military leaders know what is best for the Nation's defense.                             Exhibit No. 1                                   Secretary of the Air Force,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1995.     Hon. Alan J. Dixon,     Chairman, Defense Base Closure, and Realignment Commission,          Arlington, VA       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Air Force approach to the depots is      prudent because it saves money for the taxpayers and protects      military readiness. it is also the product of exhaustive      analysis by military professionals and senior leadership who      have been working the proposal for over a year.       Our depot proposal is simple. Building on the personnel      reduction that have already been taken from the Air Logistic      Centers and depots during the last five years (over 26,000      people), the pending Air Force proposal would reduce and      realign the depots by an additional 1,987 jobs (with a net      present value of $975 million). While there would be some      disruption, the business of the Air Force--flying combat and      transport aircraft, and maintaining our command and control      and space network--would continue unimpeded. This total Air      Force depot reduction of 28,000 jobs is almost two and a half      times the total depot reduction achieved by all other DoD      components in all four BRAC rounds combined.       On the other band, the staff generated BRAC proposal      described to us will cost the Air Force hundreds of million      of additional dollars (in excess of $1 billion in      environmental and military construction costs) during the      next five years; disrupt military readiness because of the      total restructuring of the Air Force logistics and depot      system; preclude the Air Force from carrying through on vital      readiness and modernization programs; and have a devastating      impact on as many as 25,000 DoD employees in Texas and      California who would lose their jobs or have to relocate to      other Air Force installations at great personal and public      expense.       Most importantly, the essential business of the Air Force--     operations, logistics and budget dollars that are critical to      future modernization--would be greatly disrupted. Since the      end of the cold war, the Air Force has reduced its budget by      more than $20 billion and reduced personnel by over 200,000      people. Some further reductions and savings are necessary;      however, they must be taken in a way that permits the Air      Force to continue to carry out its essential mission. The      Department of Defense proposal does that; the Commission      staff alternative does not.           Sincerely,     Ronald R. Fogleman,       General USAF, Chief of Staff.     Sheila E. Widnall,       Secretary of the Air Force.                             Exhibit No. 2                                      Department of the Air Force,                                               U.S. Air Force,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC 20510       Dear Senator Feinstein: This responds to your request for      my views on McClellan Air Force Base, California, pertaining      to that base's consideration by the Defense Base Closure and      Realignment Commission. Given our limited fiscal resources,      the Air Force views the budgetary impact of a closure of any      of the depot installations as inconsistent with other budget      priorities. The estimated one-time cost of a closure of      McClellan AFB, not including environmental restoration costs,      is more than $500 million. Incurring these costs would be      harmful to our efforts in modernization, readiness, and      quality of life initiatives. The Air Force strongly opposes      the closure of any of our depot installations, including      McClellan AFB.       I understand the Commissioners were impressed during their      recent visit to McClellan AFB with the quality and scope of      the work performed there. As you know, McClellan AFB      possesses several Air Force maintenance centers of excellence      and was recommended as a Technical Repair Center receiver      location for a number of commodities in the Air Force      proposal to downsize Air Force depots. These commodity      workloads include such vital areas as composites and      plastics, hydraulics, injection molding, and electrical/     mechanical support equipment. The approval of our      recommendation in the BRAC process will clearly establish the      Sacramento Air Logistics Center as Air Force Materiel      Command's number one provider of these commodities for the      future.       The skilled workers and leadership at McClellan AFB are      essential to the Air Force proposal. The Commission's      recognition of their deserved reputation for quality,      efficiency, and pride in their work will commend the approval      of the downsizing initiative. I trust this information will      prove helpful and please let me know if you would like to      discuss.                                           Thomas S. Moorman, Jr.,                               General, USAF, Vice Chief of Staff.                             Exhibit No. 3                                                        U.S. Army,                                           The Chief of Staff,                                                   May 24, 1995.       Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As we discussed by phone yesterday,      the Army's position regarding the recent decision by the      Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to consider      the closure of Oakland Army Base remains unchanged. The Army      studied the feasibility of closing the port at Oakland and      concluded its loss represents an unacceptable risk. Oakland      is essential for the deployment of our CONUS-based forces to      respond to any national security threats which could emerge      in the Pacific.       Although our initial analysis indicated some financial      benefit, the resulting operational risk is unacceptable. The      Army needs this critical facility to support the rapid      deployment of equipment during peace and war. Its closure      would leave the Army without a port facility on the west      coast.       While it has been difficult for the Army to identify the      excess infrastructure necessary for divestiture, we clearly      understand the impact of BRAC on our fellow Americans. Our      choices for realignment and closure are the right ones and      balance requisite infrastructure with the warfighting      capability needed to forge the Army into the 21st century.       We will make certain the Commission clearly understands the      Army's position on Oakland Army Base. I appreciate your      personal interest in and support of the Army.           Sincerely,                                               Gordon R. Sullivan,                                               General, U.S. Army.                             Exhibit No. 4                                      Department of the Air Force,                                  Headquarters U.S. Air Force,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1993.       1. During his visit to Onizuka AFB in 1992, Gen McPeak      asked about the cost and operations impacts of closing      Onizuka. This alternative is being considered by the Space &      C31 Resource Allocation Team [RAT] as a possible cut during      upcoming budget exercises. Request a joint study be initiated      to assess the impacts of such a closure, document the      development and support impacts of such a closure, and      determine if the mission of the AFSCN could continue while      meeting operational and User requirements.       2. I recently received an AFSCN status. It described the      current Network, the acquisition methodology, and provided      detail on the planned Improvement and Modernization programs      essential to maintaining the AFSCN infrastructure, and      providing User support. These efforts must continue and may      provide the architecture that will allow a closure of Onizuka      that minimizes operational impacts and improves operational      efficiency in the future.       3. All these considerations should be taken into account in      this study. The primary output of this study should be a      briefing and report fully defining the AFSCN mission in light      of the current world environment, updating the operational      and acquisition impacts of a closure, and fully describing      what must be done to accomplish the AFSCN mission in the      future. As you are aware, the AF will have to respond to      budget actions resulting from the new administration as well      as prepare for the FY 96 POM (the effect on the space      community will exceed $1.5B in FY 96). We need to be certain      all current and planned missions of the AFSCN are well      understood, and the operational impacts of a closure of      Onizuka include all AFSCN Users. Initial output of this study      should be a plan, to include a schedule, with interim      milestones, and a final briefing and report. We would like      the AFSCN PEMs in SAF/AQSL and AF/XORS to participate in this      study and would like to have access to the interim data to      support any on-going exercises. Please provide your plan and      schedule by 5 Mar 93.                                               Sanford D. Mangold,                                                    Colonel, USAF.                             Exhibit No. 5                           Office of the Secretary of Defense,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1995.  Memorandum for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security                     (Economic Reinvestment and BRAC)     Subject: Functional Assessment of Proposed Military      Department Base Realignment and Closure Actions.        Proposed BRAC actions by the MILDEPs as available on 9      February 1995, have been reviewed, and except as identified      in the attachments, determined to be acceptable from the      perspective of the DoD test and evaluation mission. Of those      in the attachments, two are considered to be major      showstoppers (regarding Dugway Proving Grounds and Fort      Hunter-Liggett), and another a minor showstopper (Tunnel 9      inclusion in the White Oak closure). The remainder are      considered incomplete requiring additional alternatives to be      analyzed before we can agree to them.     Philip E. Coyle,       Director, Operational Test and Evaluation.     John A. Burt,       Director, Test, Systems Engineering, and Evaluation.                                 issue       The Army's proposal to move its Test Battalion from Fort      Hunter-Liggett (FHL) to Ft. Bliss would de facto ``close''      FHL and remove its capabilities from operational test use.                               rationale       1. The TEXCOM Experimentation Center (TEC), located at Fort      Hunter-Liggett, California, has the unique capability to      provide a total test/experimentation package. TEC's isolated      location provides unequaled access to extremely versatile      training areas with a wide variety of weather and terrain      conditions, controlled airspace to 24,000 feet, a 360 degree      high energy laser play area, isolation from ambient light,      and minimal radio frequency (RF) interference.       2. The terrain at FHL resembles Korea and is unlike that in      any of the desert test ranges. Its diverse terrain features--     mountains, hills, rivers, creeks and lakes--were the reason      FHL was selected as a field laboratory site in 1957 and FHL      remains a unique asset today. For example, operational      testing prior to the final IOT&E of the SGT YORK was at Ft.      Bliss where only flat terrain was encountered. In the IOT&E      at FHL the valley walls caused ground clutter breakthrough      which rendered the radar useless. Also, FHL has a unique      capability--a natural 360 degree ``bowl''--and the necessary      state permits--to test high power military lasers. Recent      Longbow Apache tests at FHL required this capability,      revealing important limitations in modeling and simulation.       3. By moving to Ft. Bliss a further test restriction would      be created. Radio frequency jamming essential to creating a      realistic test environment in a location that is close to      large metropolitan areas, international airports, and an      international border will be difficult to recreate and will      increase risks of not having an adequate test environment.       4. Operating temporarily at FHL with mobil assets will be      more expensive. Just four years ago in March 1991, all of      TEC's command staff and operational functions were      consolidated at FHL because operating in temporary duty      status was too expensive. The projected savings reflected in      the Army's submission, the reduction of 17 military and 5      federal civilians, would be trivial when considering giving      up this valuable and important operational test capability.                             recommendation       Army withdraw proposal to move its test Battalion from Fort      Hunter-Liggett to Ft. Bliss.                               ____________________
