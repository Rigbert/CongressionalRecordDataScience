I say to my friend from Alaska, what we are trying to do in this effort is to perhaps bring new perspective to this issue. The Senator's State of Alaska really prides itself on its individualism and its own special character. What we are trying to do is say we think it is not unreasonable, in fact it is valuable, to have consumers represented in this discussion. I know what I am going to get if I write a letter to the major Federal agencies in town. I know what I will get if I write to most of the investigative branches of the Government. Would it not be refreshing to have a new perspective with a Commission that really at least includes some honest-to-goodness consumers who take a look at this from the small business perspective, from the farmers' perspective, from the family's perspective? I do not think we have anything to lose. We may have a lot to gain, and I hope in doing that maybe we will convince some of the larger industries and utilities and even Government agencies that they ought to every once in awhile take a fresh look at things.  I do not think this piles on to bureaucracy. It might open up a window and bring in some fresh air.
