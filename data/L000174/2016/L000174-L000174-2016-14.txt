President, New England is in itself a small community. We Senators who represent these States band together to fight for our urban and rural communities, to protect our borders, and to preserve the rich heritage on which our country was founded. For the last 6 years, one of those partners has been New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte. She has diligently sought to represent the Granite State.  Senator Ayotte and I share a background in law enforcement; as New Hampshire's attorney general, she prosecuted many important cases. After her election to the U.S. Senate in 2011, Senator Ayotte was recognized as one of the most influential women in her party. She has taken a practical, New England-style approach in the Senate. Like many of us from New England, she has been persistent in her efforts to call national attention to the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities and particularly hitting hard rural communities in Vermont and New Hampshire. She was a partner as we sought to advance and ultimately pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which should provide much needed support for those facing this crippling addiction. Her attention to this public health crisis will surely be a cornerstone of her Senate legacy.  I wish Senator Ayotte, her husband, Joseph, and their children well in their future endeavors.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
