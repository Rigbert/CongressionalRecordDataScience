 President, and Members of the Senate, the situation is this: Senator Kerry is now on the floor prepared to offer an amendment. It will be our intention to debate the Kerry amendment between now and the first vote at 6:30 and then stack the vote on the Kerry amendment. All Senators should be aware that in all likelihood there will now be three votes beginning at 6:30.  I see Senator Kerry is here. I am certain that he will shortly send his amendment to the desk.
