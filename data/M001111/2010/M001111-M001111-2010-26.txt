 President, today I wish to congratulate a hard-workingWashingtonian, Mr. Shannon McDaniel, on his well-deserved retirement on October 29, 2010, after 30 years of dedicated service to Washington State agriculture.  As the manager of the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District, Mr. McDaniel has overseen the provision of water to 4,000 landowners and farm operators on 230,000 acres of farm and ranch lands in eastern Washington. Through his leadership and extensive knowledge of irrigated agriculture, Mr. McDaniel has brought certainty to many farmers in the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District by closely and responsibly managing important water delivery infrastructure.  Mr. McDaniel has assisted me and my colleagues in Congress with the drafting and passage of legislation important to Washington State farmers. He worked closely with both the State and Federal Government to foster strong working relationships with organizations such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bonneville Power Administration, as well as with numerous water resource and industry associations to ensure the highest quality of service to farmers and ranchers. Shannon also served as an invaluable resource to the Grand Coulee Project Hydroelectric Authority, the Columbia Basin Development League and the Columbia Basin Project.  The abundance of awards and honors that Mr. McDaniel has received demonstrate his hard work and commitment to Washington State. He has received many prestigious awards including, the National Water Resources Association President's Award, the Washington State Water Resources Association Water Resources Leadership Award and the Bonneville Power Administration's Administrator's Excellence Award for Exceptional Public Service.  On behalf of all Washingtonians, I commend Shannon for his many years of dedicated service to our State. His knowledge, experience, and commitment to dependable irrigation will be sorely missed. I congratulate Shannon and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
