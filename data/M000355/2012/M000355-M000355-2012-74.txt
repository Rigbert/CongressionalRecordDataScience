 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man that will leave a legacy of firm economic performance, solid physician recruitment, and a commitment to nurture community partnerships in the hospitals of his area. Mr. Dennis Meyers of Clay County, KY, was named to the Clay County Days Wall of Fame in August 2012 for the amazing work he has accomplished in his community and the community's hospital, Manchester Memorial Hospital.  Dennis Meyers's spectacular working experience began as a pastor in 1969 in Nebraska and Illinois. In 1986, he decided on a change of career. He accepted a job as a registered nurse at Hanford Hospital. After 4 successful years, Dennis transferred to San Joaquin Community Hospital to fill the position of vice president. Dennis never stopped dreaming and believing. He continued his career to become chief operating officer and vice president of Manchester Memorial Hospital.  Dennis initiated numerous community-outreach programs, each serving as evidence to show the worth of this man and the dedication he displayed towards his community. Dennis introduced Mission in Motion, public health screenings, Live It Up!, and mission-outreach programs to enrich the Clay County community.  Dennis married Susan Meyers, who also works for the hospital. They have three children, who, like their father, hold nursing degrees. Dennis urges that success come to everyone in life. He strategizes on helping the community that is served by the hospital through Community Outreach and church programs.  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in honoring Mr. Dennis Meyers as he has been named to the Clay County Days Wall of Fame. His ambition and hard work ethic has improved and will continue to improve the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  A news story highlighting the accomplishments of Dennis Meyer was recently published in the Manchester Enterprise. I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Manchester Enterprise, August 30, 2012]            Dennis Meyers Led Manchester Memorial to Growth       Clay County Days Hall of Fame inductee Dennis Meyers      retired from the lead role at Manchester Memorial Hospital      recently after 12 years in the position.       Meyers began as a pastor in 1969 in Nebraska and Illinois.      In 1980, his career took a dramatic shift when he began      working as a recreational therapist at the Battle Creek      Sanitarium. In 1986, he transitioned to Hanford Hospital,      where he worked as a registered nurse.       Four years later, Meyers accepted a position as vice      president of nursing at San Joaquin Community Hospital.       From there, he became chief operating officer and vice      president of nursing at Manchester Memorial, and then      president and chief executive officer.       Several community outreach initiatives began under Meyers's      direction, including Mission in Motion, public health      screenings, Live It Up!, and mission-outreach programs that      enrich the community.       Meyers holds a bachelor of arts in religion, a bachelor of      science in nursing, and a master's of divinity from Andrews      University.       He is married to Susan Meyers, who works for the hospital,      and all three of his children hold nursing degrees.       Meyers plans to continue helping the community outreach and      church programs.                          ____________________
