  I can assure my distinguished colleague from Virginia that Senator Lugar, I, and others in the Foreign Relations Committee will have thorough hearings on this, as we did before.  This bill merely reaffirms the open-door policy for NATO enlargement which was first enunciated by the Clinton administration and now has been continued by the Bush administration. It does not authorize new funds that would throw the budget out of whack. It merely authorizes monies that have already been appropriated by the Arms Export Control Act.  Voting for this legislation does not indicate any Member's intention to vote for or against any potential aspirant to NATO. Exactly which countries will be invited by the alliance is a decision that will be made more than 6 months from now at a NATO summit in Prague, and thorough Senate debate on ratification of NATO enlargement will occur sometime at the end of this year and the beginning of the next. Everyone is going to have an opportunity to decide whether they are for or against this.  I remind my colleagues that 4 years ago, the Senate spent 7 lengthy days in floor debate on the ratification of admission to NATO of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I managed that resolution, and I am certain the Senate will scrutinize the aspirants invited to Prague, just as we did in 1998. What the bill does mean is that the Senate authorizes the foreign military financing assistance to help those candidate countries meet the alliance's stringent membership requirements.  This bill will help NATO extend the zone of stability eastward and southward on the continent so that sometime within the next decade we will be able to say for the first time, I think, in all of modern history that we have a Europe whole and free.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Freedom Consolidation Act. I yield the floor to my friend from Virginia.
