Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I will be brief, given the generosity of the chairman.  This amendment would prohibit the Selective Service from conducting a full-blown nationwide exercise of a mock draft. This House just voted less than 2 years ago, 404-2, against reinstitution of the draft. There is no scenario under which the Pentagon, the White House, or this Congress believes we are going to return to a draft. These funds would be wasted with this exercise.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
