 Madam Speaker, S. 1936 was introduced by Senator Ron Wyden. It would allow the Forest Service to sell the Bend Pine Nursery in the State of Oregon and use the proceeds to purchase other lands in that State. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) has introduced the House companion bill for this measure, H.R. 4774, and he should be commended for his work on behalf of the State of Oregon.  S. 1936 passed the full committee on September 20 of this year by a voice vote; and I would urge support for the passage of S. 1936, as amended, under suspension of the rules.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
