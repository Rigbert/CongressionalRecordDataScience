Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Wes Keusder, who has been a dedicated, strong and effective voice for the principles and ideals of California's building community during his years as a member and leader of the Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIA/SC). Riverside County and all of southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Wes is one of these individuals. On November 5, 2004, Wes will be honored by BIA at their 38th Annual Awards and Installation Dinner.  Wes Keusder is a third generation home builder in California and has worked for over twenty years to make homeownership a reality for thousands of California's families. Wes followed in the footsteps of his father, Walter Keusder Jr., and grandfather, Walter Keusder, by serving as President of BIA/SC as well as participating in the California Building Industry Association and the National Association of Home Builders. Wes has demonstrated exemplary leadership and service to the building industry by serving as the President of the BIA Riverside County Chapter in 2001 and 2002. Additionally, Wes served as a Director of the Building Industry Legal Defense Fund, whose mission is to defend the rights of home and property owners.  Homeownership is an American dream, and housing is a community asset which strengthens the fabric of neighborhoods. Wes has worked tirelessly to ensure that thousands of Californians can make that dream a reality. His passion and service for homeownership has improved Riverside and all of Southern California. Wes Keusder has earned my many thanks and I wish him great success in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
