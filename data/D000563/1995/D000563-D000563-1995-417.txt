 Ms. DeLAURO. I just want to say I mean through all the discourse and commentary on this issue quite frankly, as a woman in West Haven, CT, said to me at office hours one morning, one Saturday morning, she said, ``I wish for one minute that the people in Washington would put their feet in our shoes and understand what our lives are all about,'' and that is what this is about. It is what people want to know, is their standard of living going to be raised? Are they going to be able to get their kids to school? Are they going to be able to live in some kind of sense of security? Are they going to be able to pass on that American dream to their kids the way my colleagues' fathers, and my mother and father, did for me?  The whole point of this and part of that is that we do get our fiscal house in order. There is no question about that. But let us come clean with the American public and in fact tell them whether this balanced budget amendment is going to deny their kid, one out of four, a Pell grant to get them to school. Is it going to put their mother or elderly mother and father in jeopardy with regard to Social Security and with Medicare? Is it going to jeopardize their ability to get education and training so that they can get that first job? That second job? That fifth job? And earn a living wage? And is it going to do something to allow them to work and go to work in this country? Is it going to raise that standard of living?  Let us have that open debate in this body. The American people deserve no less around this issue of the balanced budget.
