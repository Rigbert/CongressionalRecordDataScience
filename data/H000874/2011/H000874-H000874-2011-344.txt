Speaker, I submit these inaugural remarks by an outstanding educational leader in Maryland's Fifth District, Joe Urgo, the new President of St. Mary's College.  Inaugural Address as President of St. Mary's College--March 26, 2011                             (By Joe Urgo)       Thank you, Madame Chair, for your charge to me, which I      accept with pleasure and with full knowledge of the weight of      responsibility it entails.       Madame Chair and board of trustees, Congressman Hoyer,      elected officials and their representatives, academic      delegates, alumni, faculty, staff, students, friends,      neighbors and family: I want to welcome each and every one of      you and thank you for the honor of your company on this day.       It is traditional at this point in the ceremony for the new      president to deliver an inaugural address. We're going to do      that, but in a different fashion, which I will explain      shortly. I'd like my inaugural address to drive home three      linked points, and I'll need some help doing so. First, that      our past informs our present--we cannot be effective     agents of progress or change without an awareness of how we      came to be, and of what came before us. On the institutional      level, we know that the original St. Mary's school was      founded as a monument to freedom and inclusiveness. We may be      free, but we are not alone. This brings me to my second link,      that none of us exists as an island, even if we are      surrounded by water. On a personal level, we open our      awareness to full recognition of who worked to clear a path      for us to arrive here, on this spot, at this time. And third,      to reflect on our work over the past twenty-four hours, at      yesterday's symposium, work done by people who love this      place and this College, and by whose passion and dedication      we shall deliver on the promise of the liberal arts as a      public trust.       These are the three links: (1) an acceptance of the ongoing      challenge of our profound origins; (2) a shared belief that      education is a collaboration; and       (3) the conviction that it is passion that will move us      forward. Such is the essence of the inaugural, which is,      above all else, a readiness--to be prepared, together, in the      fullness of the present, inspired by an old verity: that our      love for St. Mary's College will move us to accomplish      something fine. Today marks a new beginning, and a      reaffirmation.       But first, let's talk about me. Why me? Product of what      past, and by whose assistance, have I come to this podium      this afternoon? To help answer those questions, and to      illustrate that none among us stands alone, I have asked the      assistance of George Monteiro, professor emeritus at Brown      University, and Cecelia Tichi, William R. Kenan, Jr.      Professor of English at Vanderbilt University. These scholars      have built magnificent careers, about which you may read in      the program.       In 1980, two years after my college graduation and two      years into post-baccalaureate wandering, Professor Monteiro      agreed to be my graduate school advisor and gave me the idea      that I might have an academic career. Some of it was spoken      but most of it was in temperament, sensibility, and an      assumption of inclusion. I would never have conceived of and      completed the PhD without George Monteiro's support--he'll      deny it, but that's the kind of support I am talking about.       In 1988, I was three years past receiving my PhD, and in      the second of two contingent faculty appointments. That year      the English department at Vanderbilt University hired      Professor Tichi into a senior level, endowed professorship--a      signal accomplishment for her career. I was on a three-year      non-tenure track fellowship in the department and would be      gone in a year or so--a lowly accomplishment in mine.      Professor Tichi became a mentor and guide, and for reasons I      am not certain I know, took an interest in me, saw me through      difficult early career times, and continued as confidante      through the next decade of career decisions.       I have asked George and Cecelia to help me once more, by      each taking a portion of the time allotted for this      inaugural. They are but two individuals who have made it      possible for me to be here today, as St. Mary's president;      many others are in the audience. My undergraduate thesis      advisor is one--Haverford professor of political science,      emeritus, Harvey Glickman; my collaborator from Bryant      University, Roger Anderson, professor of management; my      Fulbright host from Leon, Spain, Professor Manuel Broncano--     que tal estas, Manolo?; my former colleagues and good friends      from Hamilton College, Art Massolo, Susan Skerritt (of      Kirkland College) Karen Leach, Dick Tantillo, Pat Reynolds,      Dave Smallen, Ellie Wertimer, William Billiter, and Mary      Lyons and Ed Bradley. These kind spirits inform my own--I      have them with me all the time; it is an honor to share this      installation with them today. I also note the love and      support of my parents, Joe & Rose Urgo--although not with us      physically, they accompany me today.       I also share this day with my lover, my partner, and my      best friend, Lesley Dretar Urgo, as we have shared 28 years      of marriage, six job changes for me, at least that many for      her, nine household moves--and throughout the day-to-dayness      of our marriage, truly a partnership of mind, body, and      spirit.       That 28-year partnership produced our son, George Urgo. As      every parent knows, we are also the products of our children,      who supplant our childhood and replace it with renewed life      as a parent. George has been a good friend since 1986, when      he was born in Syracuse one day before our health insurance      was to expire. His timing has always been dramatic and he has      been able to masterfully infuse that quality into his life's      passion. It is with a father's pride that I ask his      assistance this afternoon. And I could not ask for a more      suitable blues rendition on my behalf, as both a      representative of my love and of my confidence in the future.       Professor Monteiro will speak first; followed without      further introduction by Professor Tichi. Once George has us      ready, I'll come back to the podium with my inaugural remarks      to follow.       [Remarks were made by George Monteiro, Cecelia Tichi,      followed by a musical performance by George Urgo]       [Joe returned to the podium]       To borrow from the cadences of our students, ``I do, I do      believe, I do believe I am ready to be the president of St.      Mary's College''--and yes, I hope you are ready for me!       In the past nine months there has gestated in me a love for      this college and a passion for its mission. And now I am      ready to talk to you about it.       In the middle of William Faulkner's great novel, Absalom,      Absalom!, after repeated failures on the part of college      students Quentin and Shreve to understand the human      motivations behind events they seek to comprehend, Shreve      says, ``And now we're going to talk about love.'' At that      point, the roommates begin to realize that understanding,      unlike regurgitation, demands emotional investment, and more,      requires interpersonal, collaborative creativity. Yes, we      need data; yes, we need technical skills; yes, we need      assessment measures. But none of these processes and      admonitions will move us forward without emotionally invested      human beings. You have heard from individuals whom I have      loved, depended upon, learned from, and in turn, influenced.      As the president of St. Mary's College, I pledge to take this      model of personal interaction, of investment in collaboration      and influence, and make of it the the core value of what we      do here--in learning, in teaching, in research and      creativity, in daily work and in the responsibilities we      share.       ``And now we're going to talk about love.'' I speak to all      lovers of learning, lovers of creativity, and to those who      simply love this place. Above all, the liberal arts is about      love: human passion, the engine of human emotion behind all      of human history. St. Mary's College of Maryland exists in      the public trust, offering the love of liberal learning--an      impassioned, dedicated, humanistic endeavor--to all segments      of society, supported by enlightened individuals in the great      state of Maryland. Where many of our nation's finest liberal      arts colleges were established as exclusive, private      institutions, this one was founded on the principles of      freedom and inclusiveness. As St. Mary's College trustee      emeritus J. Frank Raley has reminded me, our mission is to      provide an elite education that is not elitist. Our classes      are for all classes. Please join me in a salute to Mr. J.      Frank Raley.       I am cognizant of the work of St. Mary's presidents and      principals who have preceded me, visionaries who have guided      us from 19th & 20th century seminary to 1960s junior college      to 1970s public four-year college--and to today's glimpse      into the future, of what will become an ``elite'' liberal      arts education, where ``elite'' refers to brainpower, not      family wealth. I follow men and women of remarkable      dedication and courage, and am humbled by their      accomplishments. With us today is the man whose vision of a      public liberal arts college animates us now as it has for      forty years--please help me acknowledge former St. Mary's      College President Renwick Jackson.       My goal is to make the academic rigor of an elite      residential liberal arts education available to all members      of the coming generation who possess the will and the      capacity to meet its challenge. At St. Mary's College we do      not make class-distinctions for education deemed as      ``appropriate'' to the wealthy as apart from that      ``appropriate'' to the general population. Our mission is to      combine the two greatest educational accomplishments of      American civilization: public education, and the residential      liberal arts college. We seek to be an engine of class      mobility, helping to end the cycle of educational deprivation      that afflicts too many American families.       Can we do this? Can we sustain this ambition in the face of      forces that will urge us to mediocrity, urge us to do      something cheaper, easier, something that in the name of      efficiency devalues the collaborative, humanistic educational      model of the residential liberal arts college? Former      trustee, U.S. ambassador, and friend of St. Mary's, Paul      Nitze, reflecting on his career, remarked, ``I have been      around at a time when important things needed to be done.''      Embedded in that simple, humble statement is an attitude of      mind toward one's circumstances. ``I have been around at a      time when important things needed to be done.'' Students,      faculty, staff members, alumni and friends of the College,      there is important work to be done, right here, right now.       With passion and a belief in the rightness of our charge,      we find there are important things to be done, and we are      around to do them--I feel within me a sense that this College      and this community are READY, ready for greatness. At St.      Mary's College we are the beneficiaries of one of the world's      most beautiful campus locations. Our natural surroundings      inspire our quest for sustainable living, ordered by a      responsiveness to the future of the land we occupy and the      waters that surround us. In months since arriving here,      Lesley and the College community have answered this beauty      with human hands, working to create an arboretum on campus,      further marking this site as a destination.       The historical project of St. Mary's City reminds us of the      significant work done here in the past, and at the same time,      warns us with mortality. As well as live and thrive, things      die: they perish, they are conquered, they come to an end.      Our mission above all else is to embed our ambitions into      sustainable systems, so that the future is indebted to us,      and not in debt because of us.       At a liberal arts college, ``education'' is the name we      give to intellectual endeavor, to creative expression, and to      the perpetuation of these impulses across generations. And      now we're going to talk about love. In Faulkner's novel there      is a concern that we are too quick to assign to human      motivation overtly rational, design-driven origins. One      character observes:       Have you noticed how so often when we try to reconstruct      the causes which lead up to the actions of men and women, how      with a sort of astonishment we find ourselves now and then      reduced to the belief, the only possible belief, that they      stemmed from some of the old virtues? (Ch 4)       Faulkner called these the old virtues--love, passion,      sacrifice--the human qualities that produce what matters to      humanity, from the forging of a peace agreement between      contending nations, to the assistance offered a stranger in      need, to the mentoring of a student, a new colleague, or to      the simple preparation for class by professor and student      alike.       At St. Mary's College, embedded in our mission and purpose,      is the premise that great things will come of following the      heart's desire. Learning to love what you do is a signal      achievement of a lifetime. Finding the important thing that      needs to be done, and investing yourself in that      significance, sacrificing for it, and loving where it leads--     this is the essence of a liberal arts education. Once      immersed in poetry, in history, in science and mathematics,      you'll find that passion transferable to careers and      communities that will depend upon like-minded, invested human      hearts and minds for their perpetuation. And in that process,      forty years ahead, the community of 2051 will look back on us      and say, ``our way was made by the commitments of 2011, and      we inherit a college that was loved, nurtured, and cared for      by men and women of passion.''       It is in this spirit that I ask all of us who work to      maintain and advance this college community on the banks of      the St. Mary's River to renew our commitment--to providing an      academically elite, liberal arts education that is inclusive,      public, and accessible; to fostering an egalitarian spirit on      campus characterized by collaboration and cooperation,      seeking methods of compromise over conquest; to installing      procedures and systems, as well as bricks and mortar, that      are sustainable beyond our lifetime; to considering future      generations to be our partners, not our creditors; to      maintaining the liberal arts in the public trust, dedicated      to the young people who seek the rigors of a liberal arts      education, in whose creative spirit and intellectual audacity      we entrust the future of this state, this nation, and the      world.       I ask you, gathered here today: Are you ready? Because I am      ready--ready for the future of St. Mary's College of      Maryland.                          ____________________
