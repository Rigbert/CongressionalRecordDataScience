 President, today following the 90-minute period for morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Morocco free-trade agreement. The agreement reached last night provides for a vote on final passage to occur at 11:30 this morning.  As a reminder, last night the majority leader filed a cloture motion on the nomination of Henry Saad to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. That vote will occur tomorrow. We expect debate today on the Saad nomination, as well as other pending judicial nominations.                          ____________________
