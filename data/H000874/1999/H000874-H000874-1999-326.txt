Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the parishioners of the St. George's Episcopal Church as they celebrate the 200th Anniversary of their church building on Sunday, November 21st. Located in Valley Lee in the Southern Maryland County of St. Mary's, St. George's has been serving the faithful since the reign of William and Mary some 360 years ago--hence it is also known as the William and Mary Parish.  Following the establishment of the Maryland Colony by Leonard Calvert in 1634, the settlement at St. Mary's began to grow with the establishment of St. George's Hundred, a piece of land across the St. Mary's River and west of the Capital settlement of St. Mary's City. Maryland is known as the birthplace of religious toleration in Colonial America and along with Catholic settlers and settlers of other faiths came followers of the Anglican church. Some of these colonists would establish the Poplar Hill Church--thought to have been built between 1638 and 1642 just 50 feet from the site of the present building.  Over the years, the William and Mary Parish would worship in several buildings. A second church is believed to have been built on the existing site in 1692 and a third structure around 1760. In 1799, the existing structure was built and today we recognize this incredible 200 year journey.  Just as members of the Parish no doubt celebrated the dedication of their new building in 1799 on the verge of a new century, today we celebrate two hundred years of progress at Poplar Hill as we count down the remaining days to the new millennium.  The parishioners of St. George's have been witness to extraordinary events and their history bridges a time line of critical events in our Nation's history--from the fledgling colony of the 1600s, the rise of revolution in the 1700's, the Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the 1800's, and the transformation of St. Mary's County from its rural way of life to being the home of the world's premier and most advanced aviation testing facility with the establishment of Patuxent River Naval Air Station.  And through it all, St. George's Episcopal Parish has been a beacon of faith serving to enrich its parishioners with God's word and providing a firm foundation to do His work.  I commend St. George's Episcopal Church on the 200th Anniversary of their building and wish its parishioners all the best in the future.                          ____________________
