President, today I introduce, with Senators Kerry and Menendez, an environmental justice bill that will help protect the well-being of minority and low-income communities throughout the United States.  In 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive Order instructing Government agencies to develop strategies to identify and address environmental inequities that might be created through agency programs. The Executive Order recognized that low-income and minority communities often end up with more than their fair share of pollution, associated health risks and environmental degradation.  More advantaged communities--with strong advocates, more resources, and better access to information--are less likely to have landfills, petrochemical plants, or waste incinerators built in their neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has not honored the 1994 Executive Order and the goal of environmental justice has not been met. In a March 2004 report, the EPA Inspector General concluded that the agency ``has not fully implemented Executive Order 12898 nor consistently integrated environmental justice into its day-to-day operations. EPA has not identified minority and low-income [populations] . . . and has neither defined nor developed criteria for determining [who is] disproportionately impacted. Moreover, in 2001, the Agency restated its commitment to environmental justice in a manner that does not emphasize minority and low-income populations, the intent of the Executive Order.''  Today, with the introduction of the Environmental Justice Act of 2007, we ask Congress to codify the Executive Order. The legislation also directs the EPA to implement recommendations in this area from both the EPA Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. The recommendations include creating offices to review programs and policies for environmental justice implications, training staff to address environmental justice concerns in the rule making process and specifically assessing the impacts of future regulation and enforcement on the communities most at risk to human and environmental health problems. Finally, the bill establishes reporting requirements for the implementation of the recommendations.  I am pleased that our legislation currently has the support of 18 organizations, including: Earthjustice; Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights UnderLaw; Center for Health, Environment and Justice; Natural Resources Defense Council; Advocates for Environmental Human Rights and Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.  The bill we are introducing today is an important step toward shifting the balance of environmental hazards, so the burden is not shouldered unfairly by low-income and minority communities.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 642       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Justice Act of      2007''.     SEC. 2. CODIFICATION OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898.       (a) In General.--The President of the United States is      authorized and directed to execute, administer and enforce as      a matter of Federal law the provisions of Executive Order      12898, dated February 11, 1994, (``Federal Actions To Address      Environmental Justice In Minority Populations and Low-Income      Populations'') with such modifications as are provided in      this section.       (b) Definition of Environmental Justice.--For purposes of      carrying out the provisions of Executive Order 12898, the      following definitions shall apply:       (1) The term ``environmental justice'' means the fair      treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless      of race, color, national origin, educational level, or income      with respect to the development, implementation, and      enforcement of environmental laws and regulations in order to      ensure that--       (A) minority and low-income communities have access to      public information relating to human health and environmental      planning, regulations and enforcement; and       (B) no minority or low-income population is forced to      shoulder a disproportionate burden of the negative human      health and environmental impacts of pollution or other      environmental hazard.       (2) The term ``fair treatment'' means policies and      practices that ensure that no group of people, including      racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups bear      disproportionately high and adverse human health or      environmental effects resulting from Federal agency programs,      policies, and activities.       (c) Judicial Review and Rights of Action.--The provisions      of section 6-609 of Executive Order 12898 shall not apply for      purposes of this Act.     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY ENVIRONMENTAL                    PROTECTION AGENCY.       (a) Inspector General Recommendations.--The Administrator      of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, as promptly as      practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations      of the Inspector General of the agency as set forth in report      # 2006-P-00034 entitled ``EPA needs to conduct environmental      justice reviews of its programs, policies and activities'':       (1) The recommendation that the agency's program and      regional offices identify which programs, policies, and      activities need environmental justice reviews and require      these offices to establish a plan to complete the necessary      reviews.       (2) The recommendation that the Administrator of the agency      ensure that these reviews determine whether the programs,      policies, and activities may have a disproportionately high      and adverse health or environmental impact on minority and      low-income populations.       (3) The recommendation that each program and regional      office develop specific environmental justice review guidance      for conducting environmental justice reviews.       (4) The recommendation that the Administrator designate a      responsible office to compile results of environmental      justice reviews and recommend appropriate actions.       (b) GAO Recommendations.--In developing rules under laws      administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the      Administrator of the Agency shall, as promptly as      practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations      of the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth      in GAO Report numbered GAO-05-289 entitled ``EPA Should      Devote More Attention to Environmental Justice when      Developing Clean Air Rules'':       (1) The recommendation that the Administrator ensure that      workgroups involved in developing a rule devote attention to      environmental justice while drafting and finalizing the rule.       (2) The recommendation that the Administrator enhance the      ability of such workgroups to identify potential      environmental justice issues through such steps as providing      workgroup members with guidance and training to helping them      identify potential environmental justice problems and      involving environmental justice coordinators in the      workgroups when appropriate.       (3) The recommendation that the Administrator improve      assessments of potential environmental justice impacts in      economic reviews by identifying the data and developing the      modeling techniques needed to assess such impacts.       (4) The recommendation that the Administrator direct      appropriate agency officers and employees to respond fully      when feasible to public comments on environmental justice,      including improving the agency's explanation of the basis for      its conclusions, together with supporting data.       (c) 2004 Inspector General Report.--The Administrator of      the Environmental Protection Agency shall, as promptly as      practicable, carry out each of the following recommendations      of the Inspector General of the agency as set forth in the      report entitled ``EPA Needs to Consistently Implement the      Intent of the Executive Order on Environmental Justice''      (Report No. 2004-P-00007):       (1) The recommendation that the agency clearly define the      mission of the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) and      provide agency staff with an understanding of the roles and      responsibilities of the office.
