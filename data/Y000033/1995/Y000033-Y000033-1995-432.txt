Mr. Speaker, I am introducing legislation today to correct a significant inequity in Federal law with respect to land uses of property conveyed to the Kenai Natives Association, Inc. [KNA]. The legislation, which will mark the final outcome of a process begun nearly 14 years ago and which was the subject of a congressional hearing last Congress and the enactment of one interim law, would correct the land entitlement inequities of KNA by authorizing and directing the completion of a land exchange and acquisition package. The legislation will allow KNA for the first time to make economic use of the majority of lands conveyed to the corporation under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.  We began the final stage in this process by directing, through enactment of Public Law 102-458, an expedited negotiation of a land acquisition package between the Fish and Wildlife Service and KNA. Over the past year, negotiations were completed, resulting in a package which is identical to the elements of the legislation I am introducing today.  KNA has waited since 1982 to resolve its land selection problem with property which is within the boundaries of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. KNA has reached a tentative agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with an exchange agreement on lands within the refuge. I believe that they have waited long enough for ratification of the agreement and believe they deserve to have this behind them. This legislation will authorize and direct the Secretary to make an offer to KNA to complete an exchange and acquisition of lands owned by KNA.  This legislation represents an agreement reached during the 103d Congress. It is my intention to move this legislation quickly and get it behind us. I urge my colleagues support so that KNA can move forward with their agenda.  I am pleased with the efforts by KNA, its former president, the late Katherine Boling, and board of directors as well as the Fish and Wildlife Service to finalize this acquisition. KNA and the Fish and Wildlife Service have set aside past differences and have resolved the land use disagreement which has prevented KNA from using most of its lands conveyed under ANCSA. At the same time, another purpose of Public Law 102-458 and, a Federal goal, was acquiring for public ownership land along the Kenai River. These missions would be accomplished by the legislation I am introducing today.  The Service has completed all the necessary negotiations on land acquisitions and exchange components and completed the necessary public review and legal reviews required for exchanges in Alaska. I commend the Service for their efforts to acquire a key parcel of land along the Kenai River, inside the boundaries of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, for public use. This acquisition is the crucial component of this legislation. Just as crucial is the need to allow KNA to make economic use of lands conveyed to the corporation to settle native land claims. It is wrong under any sense of fairness or the law to convey lands to native corporations in settlement of recognized land claims yet at the same time prohibit the use of those lands.  Mr. Speaker, we need innovative measures to resolve land use conflicts in Alaska. Secretary Babbitt has noted the need for innovative exchanges throughout the Nation to properly manage Federal lands. This legislation represents a fine example of an exchange which resolves a longstanding land dispute on a voluntary basis.  I believe we can and should resolve this dispute on a voluntary basis. If we fail to do so, the result will only be ill-will, an extreme inequity to the Alaska Natives of KNA, litigation and the loss of an important opportunity to acquire public, riverfront lands, along the Kenai River. Further, there will remain a significant doubt that any land use conflict involving Federal lands in Alaska can be resolved in a cooperative fashion.  Mr. Speaker, I have worked closely with the former chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Miller, on this matter for many years. I believe we have an opportunity to correct an inequity, acquire valuable habitat, and show that innovative answers to land use problems will work in Alaska. I am anxious to move forward on this legislation which resolves this matter on a voluntary, willing seller [[Page E13]] basis early this year based on agreements reached during the last session between all interested parties.                          ____________________
