Speaker, I submit the following script written by Mr. Bradley Areheart, State winner of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary Voice of Democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest. Mr. Areheart is a junior at Emporia High School in Emporia, KS and plans a career in medicine or politics. He was sponsored by the VFW Post 180 in Emporia. The contest theme this year was ``Answering America's Call.'' Bradley has done a wonderful job of capturing the sense of duty that each of us has toward our fellow Americans and toward our future generations. I encourage each one of my colleagues to read Bradley's message and take his suggestions to heart.                        Answering America's Call       It's 2:00 in the morning and a lady clutches her heart as      if struck! A heart attack! She staggers to the phone and      frantically dials the numbers 9-1-1. The police dispatcher's      voice comes across clearly but in a lethargic sounding tone.      The lady, gasping, screams, ``Help me! Help me! I've had a      heart attack! Get someone out here!'' ``Wait right there; I'm      going to put you on hold,'' is the dispatcher's reply as she      picks up another line. A frantic call, put on hold by an      apathetic operator. Important? Yes, and that call is not      unlike the call being made today. A call of far greater      importance to everyone in the United States. That call is      America's plea for the future; we have several options as we      hear that call. We can answer immediately, ignore it, or just      like the apathetic operator, put it on hold. However, in my      mind, we have only one clear option. If we are to be      responsible, caring citizens, we must answer America's call.       Former Secretary of State Cordell Hull said, ``I am certain      that however great the hardships and the trials which loom      ahead, our America will endure and the cause of human freedom      will triumph.'' How truly this reflects the time since the      foundation of our nation. In the 1700's America sounded a      call for freedom from oppression so 50 brave Americans      answered this call and signed the Declaration of      Independence. The early part of this century saw America      facing the perils of the depression and Franklin Roosevelt      rose to meet the call by instilling hope and providing      employment. In 1941, when the Japanese bombed our ships in      Pearl Harbor, courageous Americans answered the call to arms      and continued to fight until the Japanese surrendered.      Indeed, history is filled with stories of how Americans have      always     met their country's call. But what if these calls had been      left unanswered or put on hold? What would become of them?      And more importantly, what would become of our country? We      cannot be half-hearted and we haven't been. We confront      situations like a raging bull who has his eyes fixed only on      the matador. And that's how things get done--full force?      America answers the call because of patriotic citizens and      leaders who see a light at the end of the tunnel. America      will continue to answer the call because of compassion,      pride, and love of country.       I am a youth of today, but a leader of tomorrow. I face      certain responsibilities: the responsibility of speaking up      for what's right, setting an example, and a willingness to      fight for my country.       But currently, America's call is for the future. A call      that is widespread and impossible to ignore. It's a call to      return to basic values and truths that have always made      America so great. The call is for safer streets, moral      integrity, and family values. Former president Dwight      Eisenhower said that ``the problems of America are the family      problems multiplied a million fold.'' And isn't that evident      in today's society? As tomorrow's leaders, my generation must      answer the call to become responsible, moral, intelligent,      and patriotic citizens. The ideals of life, liberty, and the      pursuit of happiness are not just empty words and must be      stressed for all citizens. We cannot accept the attitude ``It      doesn't matter how I act; I'm just one person.'' Instead, we      must share the feelings of so many Americans who say'' ``I      love my country; I sincerely care about its future.'' That      attitude must now direct all of us. There's an African      proverb that says ``it takes an entire village to raise a      child.'' The time has come for all of us in the village to      accept responsibilities. You see, we can determine needs and      become catalysts for change. America's future demands the      commitment of everyone to not only hear, but also answer      America's call. Whether it be a call to arms or a call to      peace.       Today's call is not an emergency 911 situation because      America maintains her greatness at home and abroad. Our      commitment must be to maintain that greatness and preserve      our freedoms and liberties for future generations. I want to      make sure that America is never like the woman making the 911      call, who despite her efforts to get help, is ignored. When      my generation answers the call to become responsible      citizens, we will be there to be counted. I promise my      contributions by pursuing higher education, voting, and      maintaining my morals and integrity. When everyone in my      generation follows this lead, we will truly be answering      America's call.                          ____________________
