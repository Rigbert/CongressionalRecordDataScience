President, on behalf of Senator Torricelli and myself, I am pleased to introduce today the Area Code Conservation Act. This legislation is designed to spare American businesses and households the expense and inconvenience of unnecessary changes in their area codes.  Mr. President, our current system for allocating numbers to local telephone companies is woefully inefficient. It leads to the exhaustion of an area code long before all the telephone numbers covered by that code are actually in use. My legislation will take steps to stop this wasteful practice and to bring some measure of sanity to our system of allocating telephone numbers.  When area codes were first introduced in 1947, 86 area codes covered all of North America. During the three-year period beginning on January 1, 1998, it is estimated that we will add 90 new area codes in the United States alone. In short, Mr. President, in only three years, we will add more codes than were originally required to cover the entire continent. And there does not seem to be an end in sight.  To the extent that additional area codes are needed to bring new telecommunications services to existing users or existing services to new users, they are a price we must pay. To the extent they are the result of inefficient practices, however, they are a price we must avoid. Unfortunately, the latter is far too frequently the case, as I shall explain.  The problem addressed by my legislation stems from a very simple fact. When a new carrier wishes to provide competitive telephone service in a community, it must obtain at least one central office code. Because it contains its own unique three-digit prefix within an area code, each central office code--and herein lies the crux of the problem--includes 10,000 telephone numbers. Thus, even if a telephone carrier expects to serve only five hundred customers in the community, it will exhaust 10,000 phone numbers in the process. And the ultimate effect of this occurring on a repeated basis is to exhaust all of the numbers in the area code, thereby requiring that a new area code be created.  Let me illustrate this further. Let's assume that a town of 12,000 households, each with one telephone line, is served by a single telephone carrier. The carrier will be able to meet the demand with only two central office codes and still have about 8,000 numbers for new customers. Assume further that three new competitors enter the market, which would be a welcome development and one that the 1996 Telecommunications Act was enacted to promote. Since central office codes are not shared by carriers, each new competitor would need its own code consisting of 10,000 telephone numbers. As you can see when you do the math, we would go from exhausting 20,000 numbers to exhausting 50,000 numbers to serve our town of just 12,000 households.  My own home state of Maine dramatically reflects the problem inherent in the current system. With a population of about 1.2 million people, we have 5.7 million unused telephone numbers out of the roughly 8 million usablenumbers in our area code 207. However, more than 3 million of the unused numbers are within central office codes that have already been assigned, making them unavailable for other carriers. Thus, despite the fact that more than 70% of the telephone numbers in the 207 area code are not in use, Maine has been notified by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator that it will be forced to create a new area code by the Spring of the year 2000.  As one Maine commentator noted, even if every moose in Maine had a telephone number, we would still have plenty of numbers left over. Yet, we are told we will soon need another area code, something that probably make as much sense to our moose as to our people.  Mr. President, this paradigm of inefficiency in the midst of America's telecommunications revolution might almost be amusing were it not for the fact that it causes real hardships for many small businesses. With its great beauty, the Maine coast relies heavily on tourism for its economic health. We have heard from businesspeople throughout our coastal communities--a gallery owner in Rockport, an innkeeper in Bar Harbor, and a schooner captain in Rockland--who are among those who are rightly concerned about the cost of updating brochures, business cards, and other promotional literature, all of which will be necessitated by having a new area code. And as the innkeeper also told my office, it takes as long as 2 years to revise some guide books, the biggest source of information for many of his guests. Changing the area code could therefore lead to a significant loss of business and unneeded expenses for these small businesses.  Along with the economic cost, new area codes create tremendous disruption and confusion for consumers. With geographically split area codes, States, counties, and cities are split apart, creating new territorial boundaries that only serve to divide citizens. With overlay area codes, even more confusion can result. Just imagine having to dial up a different area code in order to order a pizza from a delivery service just down the street.  The legislation I am introducing today will resolve these problems and bring common sense to the process of allocating telephone numbers. The Area Code Conservation Act will set a date certain by which the Federal Communications Commission must develop a plan for the efficient allocation of telephone numbers. Consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the plan must include measures to ensure that telephone numbers will be portable when customers change carriers and that unassigned numbers in a central office code will not be the exclusive property of a single carrier.  The Area Code Conservation Act would also give decision-making authority to the States, where officials know the best policies to promote competition while minimizing costs and confusion to businesses and consumers. Specifically, the Act would authorize State public utility commissions to implement area code conservation measures while the FCC is developing its plan and, I would hope, before a new area code is needlessly forced on the State. These conservation measures could include minimum fill rates for central office codes, mandatory 1,000-block pooling, individual number pooling, and interim unassigned number porting.  The legislation would also allow State commissions to require the return of unused or underused central office codes to the numbering administrator.  In developing this legislation, I received valuable assistance and technical advice from the Maine Public Utilities Commission. I have every confidence in the ability of the Maine PUC and, indeed, State commissions throughout this country to develop the best policy in this area.  The people of Maine welcome technological change and accept that it may come with a price. They are prepared to pay for innovation and progress, but they object--indeed, they should object--when they are asked to pay for inefficiency. When one looks behind its technical subject matter, this bill is about nothing more complicated than stopping a form of government waste. Such waste should not be tolerated by Members of this body, whether they come from States like Maine with a single area code or from States with cities already divided into different area codes.  I urge my colleagues to support my efforts to bring an end to this inefficiency and the unnecessary cost and inconvenience it will impose on our citizens, particularly our small businesses.                                 ______                                       By
