 President, I look forward to responding to the distinguished Democratic leader, with whom I profoundly disagree. The distinguished Democratic leader made the point--well, California is already using ethanol in its gasoline. My goodness, it is already using it up to 65 percent. California is forced to use it. It is forced to use it. Yet it doesn't need to use it. That is my point. The egregious 2-percent Federal oxygenate requirement forces California to move in this direction if it is going to phase out MTBE, which is another oxygenate which has been shown to have very detrimental environmental and health effects. The Governor has said he is going to phase it out by the end of this year. Consequently, to meet the 2-percent oxygenate requirement--which I think is flawed public policy--again, California is forced to begin to use this ethanol.  The Democratic leader also says that I have supported a renewable portfolio standard. In fact I have. California has a renewable portfolio standard. It is for wind, it is for solar, it is for alternative energies, and California has set it at 10 percent. Yes, I support that. That is totally different than an ethanol requirement, which is not a renewable energy source like solar or wind.  To add insult to injury, the Democratic leader says this doesn't require States to use it. Then I ask the question: Why does his legislation exempt Alaska and Hawaii? If it doesn't force States to use it, why is there an exemption that exempts Alaska and Hawaii? Let me read it to you, on page 4 of the bill:       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this      paragraph the administrator shall promulgate regulations to      ensure that gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in the      United States, except in Alaska and Hawaii, on an annual      average basis, contains the applicable volume of renewable      fuel determined in accordance with subparagraph (b).
