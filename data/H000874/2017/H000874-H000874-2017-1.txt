Speaker, the Appropriations Committee used to be an extraordinarily bipartisan committee where we worked together, not on a partisan basis, but on a basis of trying to determine which priorities were important for our country, what funds were needed so that agencies could operate in an effective way. That, unfortunately, is not happening the way it did.  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, who control this House, and all the levers of government, to work with Democrats on making sure that all those who need emergency disaster relief, as well as those who need funds to operate their government agencies in a way that serves America best--I urge us to work together toward that end. I urge us because nobody believes these CRs are good policy, but they, unfortunately, are becoming regular, if not regular order.
