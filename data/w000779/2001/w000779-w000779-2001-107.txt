I will be very brief.  I say to the Senator, I thank him for all the years he has toiled in the vineyards on this issue. He and Senator McCain have been out week after week for years. I was sworn in as Oregon's first new Senator in more than 30 years on February 6, 1996, around noon. The first official action I took, as Oregon's first new Senator in more than 30 years, was to be a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold legislation.  I just want the record to note that this Senator knows we do not get to this kind of opportunity by osmosis. It does not happen by accident. It happens because we get two Senators suchas the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona who, week after week, year after year, do so much to make this action possible.  I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate all his leadership.
