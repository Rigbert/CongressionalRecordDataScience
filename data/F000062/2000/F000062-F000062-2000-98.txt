 President, earlier today, Senator Craig spoke on the floor about licensing and registration. I just wanted to correct one statement he made.  Senator Craig said that ``The reality of licensing gun owners and registering firearms is something that almost all Americans have viewed as an anathema for a long while. Why? Because they really do believe that a gun once acquired is private property and it is no business of the government that they should know about it.''  Of course guns are private property, but the facts do not support the contention that the American people view licensing and registration as an ``anathema.''  According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last year, 90 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans support mandatory registration of any type of gun or firearm.  A May report by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago shows similar findings, with 70 percent favoring gun-owner licensing and training in use of their guns.  A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll taken at the end of April shows seventy-six percent of those surveyed favored registrations of all handguns. And 69 percent favored the federal government requiring all handgun owners to obtain a special license.  In fact, a recent Princeton Survey Research Association Poll indicated that even 66 percent of gun owners support the registration of all handguns.
