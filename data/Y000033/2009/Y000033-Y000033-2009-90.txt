Mr. Speaker, it is essential that our Nation's ports have a reliable funding stream for vital projects that are ``ready to go'' in ports around the nation. The Maritime Administration has identified more than $1.5 billion in immediate opportunities to fund ready-to-go port landside projects. Ports are a key component of our national intermodal transportation system. MARAD has conservatively estimated that funding $1.5 billion in ready to go projects will add 80,000 direct and indirect jobs to the economy. These port projects are essential to our ports fulfilling their roles in our national defense, transportation, commerce, and homeland security systems. All other transportation modes, including highways, transit, rail, aviation, and ferries have dedicated funding in the Transportation Infrastructure sections of H.R. 1. Ports do not have such a dedicated source of funding. However, I want to state for the record that ports are eligible for funds in the $1.5 billion discretionary competitive grant funding made available by this bill to the Secretary of Transportation. In addition ports are eligible for funds under the Surface Transportation formula funds made available to States under this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the Secretary of Transportation, working with MARAD, should ensure that ports, like rail, transit, highways and aviation also have a secure stream of funding for much needed ``ready to go'' intermodal infrastructure investments. Ports all over the country, including in my own State, are ready to put thousands of people to work immediately on vital port infrastructure projects.  Mr. Speaker, I know that the entire House, indeed the entire Congress agrees that it won't do much good to have improved highways, rail, and air transportation if our ports are crumbling, overcrowded, and outdated.                          ____________________
