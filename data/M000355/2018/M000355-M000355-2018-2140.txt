 President, last week Americans from all across the country--including many from Kentucky--came here to Washington to speak up for unborn children whom our legal system has denied the right to life. Now Congress has an opportunity to take a step forward.  The United States is currently one of just seven countries--just seven--including China and North Korea, that permits elective abortions after 20 weeks. It is time we began to remedy this obvious and tragic moral wrong. The long-overdue legislation that we will be voting on soon would do just that.  I am pleased to have filed cloture on this bill to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain. I am proud to cosponsor it, along with many of my colleagues, and I look forward to voting for it early next week.                          ____________________
