 President, I send a group of amendments to the desk, en bloc, and ask for their immediate consideration.  The amendments are as follows: One is for myself to extend the pilot program authority provided by the GMRA until December 31, 1999; one for Senator Stevens to clarify section 645 of the bill; one for Senator Mikulski regarding closure of an alley in the District of Columbia for construction of a Federal building; one for Senators Mack and Graham to transfer a property for animal research; one for Senator D'Amato to provide criminal sanctions for fictitious financial instruments; one for Senator Gregg regarding distribution of Federal employees' names; one for Senator Kohl, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, regarding IRS telephone service; one for Senator Kerrey regarding the IRS reorganization.
