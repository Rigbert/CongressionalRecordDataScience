Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to reauthorize a landmark conservation law known as the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act.  This historic legislation, which was enacted into law four years ago, was modeled after the highly successful African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988. The fundamental purpose of this law was to establish a Conservation Fund to finance worthwhile projects to assist highly imperiled species of rhinos and tigers. Sadly, the populations of these two flagship species continue to decline and, unless additional assistance is provided, they will continue to slide toward extinction.  In the case of the rhinoceros, it has been estimated that their population has been decimated from 65,000 animals in 1970 to less than 11,000 today. In fact, in the case of two of the five species of rhinoceros, the Javan and Sumatran, there are less than 600 left in the world. While all five species of rhinoceros were listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1977 and a worldwide trade ban has been imposed, poachers continue to slaughter rhinos for their horns. These horns have been used for generations in Asian medicine to treat fever in children and as decorative handles for ceremonial daggers.  Despite plummeting populations of rhinoceros, there is still an insatiable demand for rhino horn, which has made this commodity extremely valuable. In fact, African rhino horn can be worth as much as $10,000 per kilogram and rare Asian rhino horn is worth up to $60,000 per kilogram. The largest consumers of rhino horn live in China, Taiwan, and South Korea.  Regrettably the situation facing tigers is even worse. Of the eight subspecies of tigers once found in the world, three have become extinct and the remaining five populations have been reduced from 100,000 tigers in 1990 to less than 5,000 animals today. Furthermore, the three subspecies of South China, Siberian and Sumatran all have populations that are estimated at less than 500 animals.  Although commercial activities and human population growth have transformed large amounts of the tiger's habitat, illegal hunting has had the most dramatic impact. Despite the fact that all tigers are protected under CITES, tigers are killed for their fur and most of their body parts. Tiger bone is used in many forms of traditional Oriental medicines including powders, tablets, and wines that are consumed to fight pain, kidney and liver problems, convulsions, and heart conditions. Like rhino horn, the major consumers of these products live in China, Taiwan, and South Korea. According to CITES, during the past six years, South Korea imported about 10,500 pounds and China 78 tons of tiger bone.  Sadly, the financial rewards of illegally killing a tiger are substantial. According to the World Wildlife Fund, a pound of tiger bone sells forover $1,400 and a tiger pelt may be worth up to $15,000. It is essential this market be destroyed and that people who live in the tigers' habitat begin to understand the consequences of exterminating an animal that has such a dramatic impact on so many other species.  These were fundamental goals of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994. While it is still too early to tell whether this law will stop the population decline, it is clear that unless the United States takes a proactive leadership role in saving these species, they will soon only exist in remote wild locations or in zoos.  Since its enactment, the Congress has appropriated $1 million over the last three fiscal years. While this is considerably less than the $30 million that was authorized, this money has funded 24 conservation projects to assist rhinos and tigers at a Federal cost of about $530,000. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is now evaluating an additional 70 proposals from organizations that are interested in helping to conserve these irreplaceable species.  According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it has funded 12 rhino projects, 6 tiger projects, and 6 projects that will benefit both species. These projects have included: an adopt-a-warden program in Indonesia; aerial monitoring of the Northern white rhinoceros in Zaire; establishment of a community rhino scout program for the survival of the black rhino populations in Kenya; investigation of poaching and illegal trade in wild tigers in India; a tiger community education program in Indonesia; and training of staff and surveys of four black rhino populations in the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania. The sponsors of these projects, who are likely to match the grants with private funds, include the International Rhino Foundation, the Minnesota Zoo Foundation, and the World Wildlife Fund.  Based on the success of the African Elephant Conservation Fund, I am hopeful that these grants will make a positive difference in the fight to conserve rhinos and tigers.  Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Reauthorization Act, a bill to extend this landmark law for four years in the hope that it will help ensure that these vital species do not disappear from this planet.                          ____________________
