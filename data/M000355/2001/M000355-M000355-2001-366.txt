 Your amendment will certainly be on the list. What we don't know, given the limited amount of time remaining between now and Thursday night, is whether that guarantees its consideration.  The Senator from Arizona is correct; if Senators work it out, there will be no problem. If they don't work it out, I don't want the Senator from Texas to think it is a certainty that we are going to be able to handle all these amendments before we get to final passage.  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I wish to make it clear, if we are not done by Thursday night, it will be done on Friday; if it is not done on Friday, we will be on it Saturday; if we are not done on Saturday, Sunday; if not Sunday, Monday. We will make time for the amendment of the Senator from Texas. We will not leave this legislation as long as I have the ability to keep us on it. If I don't, then all amendments will go, and so it won't matter whether the amendment came up or not.                      Amendment No. 111, Withdrawn
