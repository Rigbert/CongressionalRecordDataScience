 President, it is my pleasure to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleague from South Carolina, the distinguished President pro tempore, in this effort to increase funding for research into the use of polymer additives for asphalt and concrete pavement.  The Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee directed that $2 million be committed for further research into polymer additives. Limited resources prohibited us from committing additional resources to this effort.  The provision the Committee added to the Report was designed to respond to a shortfall in this area by directing federal research efforts into further study of the effects of polymer additives on pavement quality and performance.  I greatly appreciate the Senator from South Carolina's interest in this matter, and I look forward to working with him and the FHWA to ensure this research is completed and reported to the states and other interested parties in a timely fashion.
