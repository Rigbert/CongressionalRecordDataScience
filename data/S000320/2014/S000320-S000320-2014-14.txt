 I think he is right on point when he said this is the first time we have been able to bring the appropriations process--I hope--back to regular order, which is what we need. No one wants to shut the government down. My goodness, neither side wants to do that. It is no good, and the American people don't want it. This is a good bipartisan effort. Senator Mikulski and other members of the Appropriations Committee have worked together.  I have been at odds sometimes--and a lot of times together--with Senator Harkin. I first met him 35 years ago when I first went to the House. He had been there a couple of years--a veteran. We have worked together on a lot of issues.  Senator Harkin is absolutely right when he says we can't say enough about the leadership of the chairperson of this committee, Senator Mikulski. She has reached out to both sides. She wants the process to work, as do most of us, and this is an example of that.  I hope later this afternoon that we are going to get a good vote, just as the House did, on this bill. This a big step in how we should be running the government.  I yield the floor.                         USE OF FUNDS FOR GUAM
