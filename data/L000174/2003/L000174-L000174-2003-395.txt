President, we are again being asked to consider the very controversial nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Senate has voted on this before.  One might ask what has changed since the last Senate vote? The only thing that has changed is that the administration, the Republicans, have ratcheted up their unprecedented partisanship in the use of judicial nominees for partisan political purposes.  Recently, they reached a new low through political ads and statements that should offend all Americans. The White House and the backers should understand with these ads they have gone far too far. They should withdraw and disavow.  Last week I urged our Republican Senate colleagues to disavow those despicable efforts. Unfortunately, they are choosing to continue the unfounded smear campaign of insult and division.  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent the articles in the New York Times of this past Sunday, both editorials from the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, Huntsville Times, Palm Beach Post, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 27, 2003]                  Accusation of Bias Angers Democrats                            (By Robin Toner)       Washington, July 26.--The battle over judicial nominations      has grown ever more bitter on Capitol Hill, but Democrats on      the Senate Judiciary Committee say they are     particularly outraged over the latest turn: the accusation      that their resistance to some conservative nominees amounts      to anti-Catholic bias.       In a recent newspaper advertising campaign, run by groups      supporting the Bush administration's judicial nominees, a      closed courtroom door bears the sign ``Catholics Need Not      Apply.'' The advertisement argues that William Pryor Jr., the      Alabama attorney general and a conservative, anti-abortion      nominee to the federal appeals court, was under attack in the      Senate because of his ``deeply held'' Catholic beliefs.       Democrats say they oppose Mr. Pryor because of his record,      including what they assert is a history of extreme statements      on issues like abortion and the separation of church and      state. All nine Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee      voted against Mr. Pryor's confirmation this week, while the      10 Republicans voted for it, sending the issue to the full      Senate--and the likelihood of further Democratic opposition.       Republicans and their conservative allies argue that the      Democrats have created a de facto religious test by their      emphasis on a nominee's stand on issues like abortion. ``It's      not just Catholics,'' said Sean Rushton, executive director      of the Committee for Justice, one of the groups that paid for      these advertisements, which are running in Maine and Rhode      Island. ``I think there's an element of the far left of the      Democratic Party that sees as its project scrubbing the      public square of religion, and in some cases not only      religion but of religious people.''       Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of      the Judiciary Committee, sounded a similar theme this week,      asserting that ``the left is trying to enforce an      antireligious litmus test'' whereby ``nominees who openly      adhere to Catholic and Baptist doctrines, as a matter of      personal faith, are unqualified for the federal bench in the      eyes of the liberal Washington interest groups.''       The accusation of anti-Catholic bias seemed especially      galling to some of the Democratic senators who happen to be      Catholic. Four of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee      are Catholic. In fact, 57 percent of the Catholics in the      House and the Senate are Democrats, according to the      forthcoming Vital Statistics on Congress, 2003-4 edition.       Like many Americans of Irish descent, Senator Patrick J.      Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on Judiciary, said he      grew up hearing his father talk about the bad old says when      Irish Catholics were greeted with signs saying they ``need      not apply.'' He added, ``It was a horrible part of our      history, and it's almost like you have people willing to      rekindle that for a short-term political gain, for a couple      of judges.''       Senator Richard J. Durbin, who is Catholic, said he reached      his limit at a committee meeting on Wednesday when Senator      Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama (and a Methodist), began      explaining Mr. Pryor's positions as ``what a good Catholic      believes.''       Mr. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who personally opposes      abortion but backs abortion rights, added, ``I understand the      painful process I have to go through with the elders of the      church on many of these issues, explaining my position. But      it is galling, to say the least, when my colleagues in the      Senate, of another religion, start speaking ex cathedra.''       Many Catholic elected officials are, perhaps, particularly      sensitive to the line between religious faith and public      responsibilities. It was a line drawn most vividly by      President John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic president, who      had to deal with widespared fears that a Roman Catholic      president would serve both Rome and the American people.       Kennedy responded by declaring, ``I believe in an America      where the separation of church and state is absolute, where      no Catholic prelate would tell the president, should he be a      Catholic, how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell      his parishioners for whom to vote.'' In recent years, Gov.      Mario M. Cuomo reasserted that line, particularly regarding      abortion.       Behind the anger of many Democrats is the suspicion that      this advertising campaign is part of the Republican Party's      courtship of Catholics, an important swing vote. In general,      Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the      People and the Press, said Mr. Bush was ``doing pretty well      with white Catholics'' lately.       It is all part of a politics that has changed radically      since 1960. Among the nine Democrats on the Judiciary      Committee accused of working against the interests of      Catholic judicial nominees is, of course, John Kennedy's      brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.                                  ____                 [From the Boston Globe, July 28, 2003]                       Pryor's Bad-Faith Backers       Congressional supporters of Alabama Attorney General      William Pryor have descended to low blows in promoting his      nomination to the federal bench. recently an independent      committee launched an advertising blitz in Rhode Island and      Maine, two states with swing Republican senators, claiming      that Pryor's opponents are motivated by anti-Catholic      bigotry. In the Senate committee hearing last week that      advanced Pryor's nomination to the floor, Republicans      repeated the allegation that Pryor's opponents believe ``No      Catholics need apply.'' This canard is designed to muddy the      only real issue--Pryor's fitness to be a federal judge. When      the full Senate considers Pryor's nomination, it must not      allow itself to be swayed by such intimidation tactics.       Pryor, a Catholic, opposes abortion even for victims of      rape or incest not just as a religious view but as a legal      principle. He has called Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court      decision legalizing some abortions ``an abomination.'' He      also supported the Texas law banning sodomy that was recently      overturned by the Supreme Court. Pryor's backers now claim      that anyone questioning these views--views that, after all,      conflict with existing federal law--is really targeting his      religion. ``Some in the U.S. Senate are attacking Bill Pryor      for having deeply held Catholic beliefs,'' the ad reads.       In trying to cloak Pryor's views in protective religious      garb, the Republicans have covered themselves in hypocrisy.      First of all, Pryor holds one view at odds with Catholic      teaching: He ardently supports the death penalty, which Pope      John Paul declared in 1995 was permissible only in cases of      ``absolute necessity'' to maintain civil order, occasions the      pope said were so rare as to be ``practically nonexistent.''      Pryor supports capital punishment so fiercely he even fought      state legislation to replace Alabama's electric chair with      lethal injection.       The ironies don't stop there. Conservative Republicans are      forever railing against ``identity politics,'' when      minorities seek special assistance from the government. But      when it comes to stacking the federal bench with right-wing      judges, these same folks reach for the race or religion card      with impunity. Opponents of nominee Miguel Estrada were      accused of being anti-Hispanic, for example, and Clarence      Thomas called opposition to his Supreme Court appointment ``a      high-tech lynching.''       It was Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican supporters, who      first inserted Pryor's religion into the committee      proceedings, not opponents. Pryor and his pious backers      should take heed of John Kennedy's remarks in 1960, just      before he became the nation's first Catholic president: ``I      believe in an America where the separation of church and      state is absolute.'' That should apply to political tactics      as well as matters of law. It was Senator Orrin Hatch, a      Republican supporter, who first inserted Pryor's religion      into the committee proceedings, not opponents. Pryor and his      pious backer should take heed of the John Kennedy's remarks      in 1970, just before he became the nation's first Catholic      president: I believe in an America where the separation of      church and state is absolute.'' That should apply to      political tactics as well as matters of law.                                  ____               [From the Washington, Post, July 29, 2003]                         Bad Faith Advertising                           (By Richard Cohen)       When Lance Armstrong took a spill during the Tour de      France, the cyclists chasing him slowed until he could right      himself and resume the race. Lucky for him his competitors      were not conservative Republicans. They would have run right      up his back.       For an example of how these conservatives play the game, it      is probably best to live in Maine or Rhode Island. In those      states, an organization called the Committee for Justice has      been running newspaper ads accusing Senate Democrats of using      a religion test for judicial nominations. The nominee in      question is William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama. The ad says that      if Pryor were not a strict Catholic, the Democrats would have      no problem with him.       The newspaper ads show a picture of a door labeled      ``Judicial Chambers.'' A sign says ``Catholics Need Not      Apply.'' The ad goes on to say that Pryor is being opposed      because of his ``deeply held'' Catholic beliefs, omitting the      awkward fact that some of the Democrats who oppose him are      also Catholic. The ad--not to put too fine a point on it--is      a lie.       What's more, it's an insult to Catholics. It employs a      historically redolent phrase, once so familiar to New      England's Irish Americans, to sidestep the real problem with      Pryor's nomination to a Federal appeals court--not his      ``deeply held'' religious convictions but his deeply held      determination to impose them on others. The ad's sponsors      deeply hope that Catholics react viscerally. I pray that they      don't.       Pryor's record is unequivocal. As Alabama's attorney      general, he not only made statements deploring Supreme Court      decisions upholding the separation of church and state--``it      seems our government has lost God''--but repeatedly expressed      his conviction that the God he had in mind was the Christian      one. ``The challenge of the next millennium will be to      preserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian      perspective,'' he said in 1997.       On another occasion--his investiture as Alabama's attorney      gengeral--he concluded his remarks by saying, ``With trust in      God, and his Son, Jesus Christ, we will continue the American      experiment of liberty and law.''       Although a state official, Pryor chose to intervene in      federal court cases on the side of Roy Moore, now the state's      chief justice. As a trial judge, Moore opened court with a      prayer delivered by a Christian clergyman. He displayed the      Ten Commandments in his courtroom and later, when elected the      state's chief judge, had a monster statue of the Ten      Commandments placed before the courthouse. Higher courts told      him to remove it.       Whatever Pryor's religious convictions, they are no      business of the Senate. But they     are its business when he seeks to impose those beliefs on      others--as he has repeatedly tried to do. This is what the      Democrats on the Judiciary Committee object to. Yet the ads,      sponsored by a committee led by C. Boyden Gray, the first      President Bush's White House counsel, simply label Pryor's      opponents as religious bigots. Gray lent his name to this      cause, and so did former president George H.W. Bush, who lent      his house for a fundraiser. This is a GOP operation, pure and      simple.       Gray ought to be ashamed. Instead of battling religious      prejudice, he is using the fear of it to stack the courts      with conservative Republicans. At the same time, he has      allied himself with those who traffic in their own kind of      religious bigotry--a smug disdain for the beliefs of others,      including dissenting Christians, non-Christians and people      who have no religion at all. Pryor clearly feels his religion      is the better religion--the one the state should support, the      one with which to open a court session or to proclaim in      stone on the courthouse steps.       This is dangerous stuff. We are a pluralistic society. I      happen to think some religions are just plain weird. I also      happen to think that Pryor cannot for a second explain      through reason--reason, not faith--why his convictions are      better, truer or closer to God's than mine. Such matters      cannot be debated. Historically, they have been settled at      sword's point. If you believe that a cow is sacred, I cannot      argue with you. The same holds for the virign birth, or, for      that matter, the burning bush. You believe what you believe.      It is that simple.       Gray and by extension former president Bush ought to      repudiate the ad. At its core, it is a demagogic lie. As for      Pryor, by statements and actions, he has disqualified himself      for the federal bench. I don't care if he's a good Catholic.      I do care that he'd make a bad judge.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2003]                            Beyond the Pale       ``Some in the U.S. Senate are attacking Bill Pryor for      having `deeply held' Catholic beliefs to prevent him from      becoming a federal judge. Don't they know the Constitution      expressly prohibits religious tests for public office?''       So reads a wildly inappropriate ad run in newspapers in      Maine and Rhode Island by a group called the Committee for      Justice. Mr. Pryor is the elected attorney general of Alabama      and President Bush's choice to sit on the U.S. Court of      Appeals for the 11th Circuit. We oppose the nomination--which      the Senate Judiciary Committee this week reported on a party-     line vote--and hope it will be defeated on the Senate floor.      Yet some of Mr. Pryor's supporters seem unwilling even to      debate this troubling nomination on its merits. So they have      hit on an alternative: branding his opponents as motivated by      anti-Catholic bigotry.       The tactic is not entirely new. Republican senators--     including committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and      Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.)--have been complaining      for some time of what Mr. Frist has called ``a religious test      on the confirmation of our judges.'' And Democrats during the      last administration complained of bias in the Senate's      treatment of women and minority nominees--as, indeed,      Republicans now complain of bias in the treatment of appeals      court nominee Miguel Estrada. But the new ad campaign      ratchets up this gross kind of politics a notch, and the      unwillingness of key Republican senators to distance      themselves from it is striking.       The Committee for Justice was formed by former White House      counsel C. Boyden Gray to support Mr. Bush's nominees. Its ad      ran in states with large numbers of Catholics and moderate      Republican senators. It shows a picture of a courthouse door      with a sign hung on it saying, ``Catholics Need Not Apply.''      And it asks ``Why are some in the U.S. Senate playing      politics with religion?'' It goes on to describe the nominee      as ``a loving father'' and ``a devout Catholic'' and insists      that ``it's time for his political opponents to put his      religion aside and give him an up or down vote.''       But who exactly is ``playing politics with religion'' here?      We are aware of no instance in which any Senate opponent of      Mr. Pryor has raised his religion--nor did the Committee for      Justice produce an example in response to our inquiries. The      only people raising Mr. Pryor's Catholicism, rather, seem to      be his supporters. Mr. Pryor's nomination is controversial      for the simple reason that he has never shied away from      taking strident positions on matters of national moment: His      record is replete with the sort of unblinking partisanship      and ideological fervor that properly should raise questions      about potential service on the bench. We have criticized      liberal groups for smearing President Bush's nominees.      Smearing senators is no better.                                  ____               [From the Huntsville Times, July 25, 2003]                    Sham Issue Invoked To Help Pryor                           (By David Person)       Bogus. That's the only word that accurately describes this      week's dust-up on the Senate Judicial Committee over the      nomination of Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor to the      Federal Appeals Court. Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and      Orrin Hatch of Utah, both members of the committee, suggested      that other committee members were opposed to Pryor because he      is a Catholic       This criticism seems part of a larger strategy. According      to National Public Radio, some ads have been running in Maine      and Rhode Island that suggest the same thing. And according      to NPR, it was Hatch who introduced Pryor's faith into the      proceedings by asking Prior about his religious affiliation      during the nominee's June hearing before the committee.       Methinks the GOP doth protest suspiciously and a bit too      much. Four of the nine Democrats on the committee--ranking      member Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dick Durbin of Illinois,      Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Joe Biden of Delaware--     are Catholics.       That probably disqualifies them from being against Pryor      due to his faith, you think?       My guess: The GOP knew that Pryor's right-wing views on Roe      vs. Wade, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's Ten Commandments      monument and homosexuality would be lightning rods. So      instead of going the stealth route--which would have been      difficult since Pryor, to his credit, has been upfront about      his views--why not spin out the ruse that opposition to      Pryor's politics is actually opposition to his faith?       As a political strategy, it's clever. But discerning      observers will know that the baloney-salami quotient is high.       Being anti-religion and opposing the insertion of religion      into the public life are as different as being a meat-eater      and vegan. The two aren't even remotely the same.       Pryor, a smart, competent, compassionate and honest elected      official, has made it no secret that he follows one of      Alabama's most practiced political traditions: fusing faith      and politics. Again, to his credit, he's aboveboard. He      doesn't pretend to be anything other than what he is. That's      why many Democrats and liberals have supported him here and      even in his quest to be appointed to the federal bench.       But history shows that when religious dogma collides with      public policy and practice, someone will be hurt. (Please      turn in your history books to the chapters on the Crusades,      the Reformation, and Salem witch trials, and the conflicts      between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland, Muslims and      Christians on the African continent, and fundamentalist      Islamic regimes and their opposition.)       In fact, isn't the United States currently resisting      attempts by fundamentalist Muslims to assume control in a      reconstituted Iraq?       Pryor's fellow Catholics on the Senate Judiciary Committee      oppose how he applies his religion, not the religion itself.       This shouldn't be hard to grasp. Religions, like political      parties, often have competing ideological wings.       Some of my Catholic friends in town also oppose Pryor. They      mince no words as they spit out their criticism of him.       Not one had anything to do with his faith.       The committee, by the way, has voted along party lines to      send Pryor's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. By the      end of the summer, we may know if Pryor will get the      appointment or if it will be derailed by a Democratic      filibuster.       If the latter, I guess Leahy, Durbin and any others who      will have opposed him will be called bigots by GOP      extremists. But this will be a false charge. The only thing      they will be guilty of is disagreeing in matters of faith.       Last time I checked, the Constitution gives them that      freedom.                                  ____               [From the Palm Beach Post, July 27, 2003]                   No Defense for Pryor's Convictions                           (By Randy Schultz)       As part of their ongoing effort to stack the federal      courts, Republicans first accused Democrats of being anti-     Hispanic. Now, they're accusing Democrats of being anti-     Catholic. Here's the funnier part: Many of the Democrats in      question are Catholics.       When it comes to judicial nominations, the Supreme Court      obviously gets most of the attention. The highest court is      the last word on issues that prompt fund-raising letters. In      June, for example, the justices reaffirmed that race can be a      consideration in college admissions and rules that sexual      orientation can't be a consideration when states make laws      about sex between consenting adults.       In fact, the highest court hears only about 100 cases each      year. The 13 federal appeals courts, however, rule on nearly      30,000 cases in 2001. In practical terms, appeals court      judges set most of the law. Also, they are the Supreme      Court's farm teams. Seven of the nine justices--William      Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor are the exceptions--were      promoted from the federal appeals courts.       So President Bush wants to put the youngest, most      conservative people he can on those courts. The lastest is      41-year-old William Pryor, and you can tell how unqualified      he is by the lengths to which Republicans are going.                    to florida from Alabama? no way       Mr. Pryor is Alabama's attorney general. He believes that      the 1973 Supreme Court did greater harm by legalizing      abortion than the 1857 court did by legalizing slavery.      President Bush wants to put him on the 11th U.S. Circuit      Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Florida, Georgia and      Alabama. To maintain geographical balance, this vacancy on      the 12-member court goes to Alabama.       But to William Pryor? No way. There's evidence that he      solicited political donations     from companies that do business with his office. There's      evidence that he wasn't straight about that when he testified      before the judiciary committee last month.       So Democrats have objected, as they have when Mr. Bush has      tried to put similarly ultra-orthodox conservatives such as      Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen onto other appeals courts.      When Democrats blocked Mr. Estrada's nomination, Republicans      whooped that Democrats don't like Hispanics. Except that      Republicans blocked Hispanics whom President Clinton had      picked for the appellate bench.       Last week, the GOP kicked up the hysteria another notch. A      group run by the first President Bush's chief counsel ran ads      saying that Democrats want to keep Catholics such as Mr.      Pryor off the court. The ads show a courthouse with a sign      reading, ``Catholics need not apply.'' Boston merchants used      the same language in the 19th century, saying ``Irish''      instead of ``Catholics.'' Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.,      parroted the ad Wednesday. ``Are we saying that good      Catholics can't apply?''                   non-catholics lecturing catholics       How hilarious that must have sounded to the four out of      nine Democratic committee members who are Catholic. As      National Public Radio reported, one of them, Sen. Dick      Durbin, D-Ill., first said, ``This is disgusting.'' Then he      remarked, ``I want to express my gratitude to my colleagues      who are members of the Church of Christ and the Methodist      Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints      for explaining Catholic doctrine today.''       Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Mormon in question, yelped that      Democrats were opposed to any Catholic with ``deeply held''      beliefs or any nominee who opposed abortion. Sen. Durbin      noted that the Catholic Church opposes the death penalty      while Mr. Pryor supports it. Also, a Bush nominee who called      abortion ``evil'' got a seat on another appeals court with      Democratic support.       For all the Republican fussing, President Bush got more of      his nominees through a Democratic Senate than President      Clinton got through a Republican Senate. Nearly half of Mr.      Clinton's appeals court nominees got no vote in the      congressional term when they were nominated.       Now that Democrats are going all-out to block Mr. Bush's      worst nominees, Republicans can't take it. They rant, and      they pout. They can't argue the facts, and they can't argue      the law. So they are trying to argue ethnicity and religion.      The problem isn't their Democratic opponents. It's their      president's nominees.                                  ____         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 25, 2003]           Bring on the Filibuster Against Ultraconservative       Southerners who care about the separation of church and      state should hope Alabama Attorney General William Pryor      never sits on the 11th Circuit appellate bench, which rules      on appeals in cases from Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The      ultraconservative Pryor, who preaches that Christianity      should be more a part of American public life, was approved      by the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday in a 10-9 vote      along partisan lines.       If ever there were a nomination that merits a filibuster,      it is this one. Not just because Pryor holds views far out of      the mainstream, but also because of the unprecedented      twisting of the Constitution's advise and consent process by      President Bush's corporate pals. Misleading ads, funded by      the deceitfully names ``Committee for Justice,'' have already      run in Maine and Rhode Island to pressure moderate Republican      senators into voting for Pryor's confirmation on the Senate      floor. The despicable ads show a courthouse door with a sign      across it saying ``No Catholics allowed.''       Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who is Catholic and opposes      the Pryor nomination, is infuriated that he and others were      being accused of discriminating against Pryor for his      religion, a false charge. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking      Democrat on Senate Judiciary, said religion is irrelevant to      consideration of a judicial candidate. ``Just as we're      supposed to be colorblind, we must be religion-blind,'' he      said.       The committee funding the ads is headed by the White House      counsel to former President Bush, C. Boyden Gray, and      includes lawyers and lobbyists who represent huge tobacco,      insurance and investment banking corporations with cases      pending before the federal courts. Because it would be      unseemly to campaign for judges who favor corporations, they      have cleverly aligned with the Ava Maria List, a Catholic      pro-life political action committee.       Pryor's record is sufficient to disqualify him from any      judgeship. In addition to his extreme views on abortion (he      opposes it for rape victims), he favors prayer in public      school classrooms and the Ten Commandments in the Alabama      courthouse. He was also the only attorney general in the      nation to argue that the Violence Against Women Act is      unconstitutional.       Georgians ought to let U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Zell      Miller know their opposition to Pryor. He is simply unfit for      the decision-making essential to a fair, independent and      nonpartisan judiciary.                                  ____           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 25, 2003]   Pryor Restraint: Specter Should Have Balked at an Extreme Nominee       With Pennsylvania's Sen. Arlen Specter trying to have it      both ways, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday sent      to the floor an unacceptably extreme nominee to a federal      appeals courts--but not before some silly sniping over      whether the nominee, Alabama Attorney General William Pryor      Jr., has been the victim of anti-Catholicism.       The anti-Catholic canard, raised by a conservative pressure      group and echoed by some Republican senators, would be      laughable if anti-Catholicism weren't an ugly part of      American history. Fortunately, excluding people from public      life because they are ``papists'' is largely a thing of the      past. Mr. Pryor himself is proof of that: Alabama, where he      serves as the chief law enforcement officer, was historically      home to Bible Belt anti-Catholicism.       But if some of Mr. Pryor's supporters are to be believed,      opponents of his nomination to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of      Appeals are anti-Catholic bigots. A pro-Pryor group aired      television ads showing a locked courthouse with a sign      reading ``No Catholics Need Apply.'' On the committee,      Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions referred to his fellow Alabaman      as ``this solid Catholic individual'' and offered a      convoluted argument for the bigotry charge.       According to Sen. Sessions, Mr. Pryor's veiws on abortion--     he called the Roe vs. Wade ruling an ``abomination''--are      rooted in his church's teaching. Therefore senators who      oppose Mr. Pryor because of his denunciation of Roe vs. Wade      are really subjecting him to an unconstitutional ``religious      test'' for office.       Well, not really. The concern isn't that any Catholic judge      will repudiate Roe vs. Wade--Justice Anthony Kennedy, a      Catholic, voted to reaffirm Roe in a 1992 ruling--but that      Mr. Pryor's vehement denunciations of Roe as bad law indicate      that he is a man on a mission, despite his protestations that      he would apply the law judiciously. The problem with Mr.      Pryor isn't his religion; it's the fact that he is what we      have called a ``walking stereotype'' of right-wing legal      extremism.       (We wonder, by the way, if Sen. Sessions would rush to the      defense of a liberal Catholic nominee who, citing      pronouncements by the pope and America's Catholic bishops,      denounced Supreme Court decisions upholding the      constitutionality of capital punishment.)       Some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who are      themselves Roman Catholics objected to the Republicans'      decision to play the Catholic card. Sen. Richard Durbin      facetiously thanked Sen. Sessions, a Methodist, and Judiciary      Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Mormon, for elucidating his      own church's doctrine for him.       The ``anti-Catholic'' discussion was an unseemly sideshow      to the committee's decision, on partisan lines, to approve      the Pryor nomination and send it to the floor. To his      discredit, Sen. Specter, who faces a conservative challenger      in next year's Republican primary, joined in that vote--while      suggesting that he might vote against the nomination on the      floor. That straddle is the opposite of a profile in courage.      If Sen. Specter thinks Mr. Pryor unsuitable for the court, he      should have voted no.
