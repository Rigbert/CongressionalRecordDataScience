President, that is from the Women's Lawyer Association of Los Angeles.  Last week, at a Judiciary Committee executive business session, I asked her name be added to the agenda and that the committee report her nomination to the Senate for confirmation. All questions have been answered. The Republican Senator who propounded the questions on initiatives said he would not filibuster her nomination and agreed not to hold her up any longer. I thank him publicly and appreciate his forthrightness.  But even though we looked around that room and said, ``Does anybody have any objection to her,'' and I had gotten absolute confirmation from every single Democratic Senator that they were ready to vote positively for her and would vote for her on the floor immediately, her nomination was not called up. My requests that she be called up for a vote before the committee was rejected, and she remains in limbo almost 2 months after her second confirmation hearing and one full year after she was first nominated.  There is now what amounts to a secret hold on this nomination in the Judiciary Committee. Some Senator is holding her up. Some Senator doesn't have the courage to come on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say why this woman is objectionable to him. Some Senator will hold her up secretly because he doesn't want to vote on her publicly, even though I guarantee you, if we had a rollcall vote on her, it would be overwhelmingly positive. We should proceed with the nomination of Margaret Morrow without further delay.
