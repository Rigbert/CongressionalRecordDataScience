 Leach) and the ranking member, the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) for their very hard work on this important legislation.  As a member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services and an original cosponsor of this bill, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1151, legislation which will nullify a recent Supreme Court decision by ensuring that Federal credit unions can serve multiple groups and that no current credit union members will be forced out of their accounts.  Large corporate banks have been trying for years to shut out their credit union competition. In recent years they have filed 19 separate lawsuits in 12 States, and now five Supreme Court Justices say the law is on their side. Very simply, we must change the law and ensure that Americans have choices in banking, and today we will do just that.  At a time of increasing bank fees, ATM surcharges, high credit card fees, increasing minimum balance requirements and the loss of many locally-owned banks to large, multi-billion dollar corporate institutions, credit unions today are more important than they have ever been. I have been a long-time supporter of credit unions because they are managed by their members and not by a high-priced board of directors. Credit unions, therefore, are more concerned about the financial needs of their own membership and not the profits of the owners of the institution. Credit union profits do not go to pay high executive salaries; they are directed back to customers in the form of lower fees and higher rates of return.  In Vermont, where 170,000 people are members of credit unions and where the membership has played a very, very active role in determining that this legislation will be passed, credit unions provide important benefits such as lower loan rates, lower minimum balances, free ATM use and free credit cards.  Madam Speaker, it is incumbent upon Congress to pass this important legislation, and I urge all of our Members to support it.
