Chair, let me clarify what insisting on this point of order means.  First, it means that the amendment the Appropriations Committee added to the bill, requiring the Postal Service to maintain highest quality delivery standards, is nullified.  This amendment was passed for fiscal year 2017 without objection in our committee, and it was included in last year's bill and was passed back then as well. So it is not something new. It stands as a strong measure of support for the U.S. Postal Service in both rural and urban America. Those that neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays them from the swift completion of their appointed rounds deserve our respect.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman needs to confine her remarks to the point of order.
