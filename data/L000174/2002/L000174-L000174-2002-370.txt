President, on November 13, 2001, President Bush signed a military order authorizing the use of military commissions to try suspected terrorists. This order stimulated an important national debate and led to a series of Judiciary Committee hearings with the Attorney General and others to discuss the many legal, constitutional, and policy questions raised by the use of such tribunals. Our hearings, and the continued public discourse, helped to clarify the scope of the President's order and better define the terms of the debate.  For example, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on November 28, 2001, at which several legal experts challenged the validity of the military order. Philip Heymann of Harvard Law School, a former Deputy Attorney General, testified that the order was so broad that it amounted to a dangerous claim of executive power. In his view, the order improperly bypassed congressional review, undermined confidence in our civil justice system, and jeopardized relationships with our allies abroad. Retired Air Force Colonel Scott Silliman who is now at Duke Law School, questioned the President's authority to use military commissions with respect to the September 11 attacks absent authorizing legislation by Congress. Professor Silliman also echoed the comments of Professor Heymann, arguing that tribunals convened under the order could adversely impact our international credibility as a Nation under the rule of law.  On December 4, 2001, Senator Schumer chaired another important hearing on the issue of military commissions. Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe testified at that hearing that ``Congress alone can avoid the constitutional infirmities that plague the Military Tribunal Order of November 13.'' Professor Tribe argued for the establishment of procedural guidelines to ensure the protection of defendants' due process rights, and called for Congress to set limits in consultation with the President. He cautioned that if the Administration acted on its own--under authority that Professor Tribe believed was constitutionally infirm, any convictions could later be overturned by the courts, with the result that dangerous individuals could be set free. By contrast, convictions obtained by military tribunals constituted under the authority of the Congress and the President acting together would more likely be shielded from constitutional challenge on appeal.  At the same December 4 hearing, Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School testified that ``from the standpoint of both constitutional law and democratic legitimacy, it is far better if the President and Congress act in concert,'' adding that ``the executive branch stands on the firmest ground if it acts pursuant to clear congressional authorization.'' Professor Sunstein suggested that Congress limit the scope of military tribunals by allowing the use of military tribunals ``only on certain essential occasions.''  Finally, on December 6, the Judiciary Committee heard from Attorney General Ashcroft on military commissions and a number of other unilateral actions taken by the Administration last fall. I believe that we had a constructive conversation that day, despite our disagreements on substantive points. The Attorney General took issue with anyone who dared question the thinking of the executive branch on such topics, charging them with ``fearmongering'' and aiding the terrorists. I would note, however, that several members of the Committee, including some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, suggested to the Attorney General that if military tribunals were used, they should provide a number of basic due process guarantees. Suggestions like these, coming from both Republicans and Democrats, are not intended to bait the Administration. Rather, constructive criticism can be, should be and has been useful in developing sound policy that can better protect Americans and American soldiers, particularly when they are serving abroad.  The Attorney General testified at our hearing on December 6 that the President does not need the sanction of Congress to convene military commission, but I disagree. Military tribunals may be appropriate under certain circumstances, but only if they are backed by specific congressional authorization. At a minimum, as the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania stated on this floor on November 15, ``the executive will be immeasurably strengthened if the Congress backs the President,'' Clearly, our government is at its strongest when the executive and legislative branches of government act in concert.  We demonstrated this unified strength in negotiating the USA Patriot Act last fall. The Congress, the White House and the Department of Justice worked intensively for seven weeks to craft a bill that provided law enforcement agencies with the tools they said were needed to fight terrorism while preserving American values and democratic principles.  In that same spirit, and with my friend, the senior Senator from Illinois, I am today introducing the Military Tribunal Authorization Act. This legislation would provide the executive branch with the specific authorization it now lacks to use extraordinary tribunals to try members of the al Qaeda terrorist network and those who cooperated with them.  Specifically, this legislation authorizes the use of ``extraordinary tribunals'' for al Qaeda members, and for persons aiding and abetting al Qaeda in terrorist activities against the United States, who are apprehended in, or fleeing from, Afghanistan. It also authorizes the use of tribunals for those al Qaeda members and abettors who are captured in any other place wherethere is armed conflict involving the U.S. Armed Forces.  Like the November 13 order, the Military Tribunal Authorization Act exempts U.S. citizens from the jurisdiction of the tribunals, as well as those individuals determined to be prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. The bill also exempts individuals arrested while present in the United States, since our civilian court system is well-equipped to handle such cases. These exemptions are consistent with the Administration's treatment of Zacharias Moussaoui, the suspected 20th hijacker in the September 11 attacks, who is awaiting trial in Federal district court. A second terrorist suspect, Richard Reid, the so-called ``shoe bomber,'' is also being tried in Federal district court. In fact, one of the nine charges against Reid, ``attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle,'' is a new anti-terrorism offense that was created by the USA Patriot Act. Finally, the Administration has decided to bring Federal criminal charges against John Walker Lindh, who allegedly took up arms against Americans to fight with al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.  A significant question raised about the November 13 order is that it vests the President with plenary and unreviewable discretion to determine who is subject to trial by military tribunal. The President's order also implied that those who were arrested under its terms could be held indefinitely. Detainees were to receive a ``full and fair trial,'' but no explanation of the terms ``full'' and ``fair'' is offered. While the Administration has deferred providing any explanation to the development of regulations by the Secretary of Defense, requests for an opportunity to review and be consulted about the draft regulations have been denied. This leaves introduction of legislation showing how military tribunals may be constituted to comport with constitutional mandates and values as one of the few avenues to inform the process in development of regulations.  The Military Tribunal Authorization act defines the jurisdiction and procedure of tribunals in a way that ensures a ``full and fair'' trial for anyone detained. Under the bill, the Secretary of Defense is charged with elaborating on the procedures that the tribunals must follow and publishing any draft regulations in the Federal Register.  First, the bill makes clear that tribunals may adjudicate violations of the law of war, including international laws of armed conflict and crimes against humanity, targeted against U.S. persons. Wars have rules, as defined by the Geneva Conventions and other international agreements. These rules protect civilians from harm and define how captured soldiers must be treated Under the bill, individuals who violated those rules by targeting innocent American civilians can face trial in a military tribunal. In addition, individuals who committed crimes against humanity, such as murder, torture, or other inhumane acts, may face charges in a tribunal.  Second, on the length of detention, the bill authorizes detention of individuals subject to military tribunals for as long as the President certifies that the United States is in armed conflict with al Qaeda or Taliban forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere, or that an investigation, prosecution or post-trial proceeding against the detainee is ongoing. The certification must be made every six months.  Third, on the conditions of confinement, the bill requires that detainees be ``treated humanely,'' which is consistent with the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1988. this includes adequate food, water, shelter, clothing and medical treatment, hygienic conditions, the necessary means of personal hygiene, and the free exercise of religion. Detention determinations and the conditions of detention are subject to review by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Fourth, the bill incorporates basic due process guarantees, including the right to independent counsel. In imposing this requirement, I am not suggesting that suspected terrorists deserve special treatment. Rather, the bill follows well-established standards for indigent defense. In the first of its ``Ten Commandments'' of public defense programs, the Department of Justice calls for full independence of defense counsel and judicial functions. The department's ``Ten Commandments'' also require that counsel's ability, training, and experience must be matched to the complexity of the case. Providing independent counsel and judicial review is critical to ensuring that any convictions are free from political influence. An independent process with experienced counsel will also safeguard against otherwise valid convictions being overturned for violations of due process or incompetent counsel.  Under the terms of this bill, tribunals would be required to apply reasonable rules of evidence to ensure that material admitted at trial was of probative value. Defendants would be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and proof of guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendants may not be compelled to testify against themselves. Finally, defendants could appeal their convictions and sentences to a higher tribunal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.  These procedures do not, as some have claimed, provide greater protections to suspected terrorists than we offer our own soldiers. These are, rather, the very basic guarantees provided under various sources of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, among others. Several of the procedural protections are also drawn from the U.S. Rules of Courts-Martial and the Military Rules of Evidence. In addition, the trial procedure statute of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is cited in the President's military order, recommends that the President apply to military commissions the principles of law and rules of evidence that are generally recognized by the federal district courts.  I submit for the record a list the international conventions that serve as sources for the eighteen procedural protections included in my bill. As the ABA resolution urges, in establishing military tribunals, we should ``give full consideration to the impact . . . as precedents in . . . the use of international legal norms in shaping other nations' responses to future acts of terrorism.'' Respecting those international legal norms, will redound to the benefit of Americans.  It is important to note that last week the President reevaluated his position on a related issue. He decided to apply the Geneva Conventions to Taliban captives. This decision sends a signal to the world that the United States respects the Geneva Conventions and expects them to be applied to American soldiers captured overseas. I commend Secretary Powell, who supported this application of the Geneva Conventions. I also commend Secretary Rumsfeld, whose draft rules on military commissions contained a number of important procedural protections. Both Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld have worked to bring the original military order and subsequent decisions over detention within the framework of international law. I urge the Administration to follow this example of flexibility and inclusiveness by working with Congress to establish tribunals that are authorized by statute and consistent with international law.  Finally, the bill comes down squarely on the side of transparency in government by providing that tribunal proceedings should be open and public, and include public availability of the transcripts of the trial and the pronouncement of judgment. The only exceptions are for demonstrable reasons of national security or the necessity to secure the safety of observers, witnesses, tribunal judges, counsel or other persons.  In sum, the Military Tribunal Authorization Act establishes a legal framework for proceedings that are truly ``full and fair.'' The provisions of this bill track very closely with recommendations arrived at independently by the American Bar Association and issued on February 4, 2002. The ABA calls on the executive branch to provide due process guarantees similar to those used in courts-martial, including a number of rights included in thisbill. It also urged the Administration to work with Congress in defining the rules for military commissions.  Passage of authorizing legislation would ensure the constitutionality of military tribunals and protect any convictions they might yield, while at the same time showing the world that we will fight terrorists without sacrificing our principles. We can also show by example how we expect our soldiers and nationals to be treated if they are swept into foreign courts or tribunals.  Our government is at its strongest when its executive and legislative branches act in concert. I provided earlier drafts of this legislation to the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, but received no response. With the introduction of this bill, I again invite the Administration's cooperation and comment.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the sectional analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1941       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Tribunal      Authorization Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders      have committed unlawful attacks against the United States,      including the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States      embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the      October 12, 2000 attack on the USS Cole and the September 11,      2001 attacks on the United States.       (2) The al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leaders      have threatened renewed attacks on the United States and have      threatened the use of weapons of mass destruction.       (3) In violation of the resolutions of the United Nations,      the Taliban of Afghanistan provided a safe haven to the al      Quaeda terrorist organization and its leaders and allowed the      territory of that country to be used as a base from which to      sponsor international terrorist operations.       (4) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution      1267, declared in 1999 that the actions of the Taliban      constitute a threat to international peace and security.       (5) The United Nations Security Council, in Resolutions      1368 and 1373, declared in September 2001 that the September      11 attacks against the United States constitute a threat to      international peace and security.       (6) The United States is justified in exercising its right      of self-defense pursuant to international law and the United      Nations Charter.       (7) Congress authorized the President on September 18,      2001, to use all necessary and appropriate force against      those nations, organizations, or persons that he determines      to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the      September 11 terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations      or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of      international terrorism against the United States, within the      meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.       (8) The United States and its allies are engaged in armed      conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban.       (9) Military trials of the terrorists may be appropriate to      protect the safety of the public and those involved in the      investigation and prosecution, to facilitate the use of      classified information as evidence without compromising      intelligence or military efforts, and otherwise to protect      national security interests.       (10) Military trials that provide basic procedural      guarantees of fairness, consistent with the international law      of armed conflict and the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights (opened for signature December 16, 1966),      would garner the support of the community of nations.       (11) Article I, section 8, of the Constitution provides      that the Congress, not the President, has the power to      ``constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; . . .      define and punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations;      . . . make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water; . . .      make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for      carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other      Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the      United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.''.       (12) Congressional authorization is necessary for the      establishment of extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate and      punish offenses arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks      against the United States and to provide a clear and      unambiguous legal foundation for such trials.     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY TRIBUNALS.       (a) Authority.--The President is hereby authorized to      establish tribunals for the trial of individuals who--       (1) are not United States persons;       (2) are members of al Qaeda or members of other terrorist      organizations knowingly cooperating with members of al Qaeda      in planning, authorizing, committing, or aiding in the      September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States, or,      although not members of any such organization, knowingly      aided and abetted members of al Qaeda in such terrorist      activities against the United States;       (3) are apprehended in Afghanistan, fleeing from      Afghanistan, or in or fleeing from any other place outside      the United States where there is armed conflict involving the      Armed Forces of the United States; and       (4) are not prisoners of war within the meaning of the      Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of      War, done on August 12, 1949, or any protocol relating      thereto.       (b) Jurisdiction.--Tribunals established under subsection      (a) may adjudicate violations of the law of war,      international laws of armed conflict, and crimes against      humanity targeted against United States persons.

(8) That the accused have the opportunity to confront and      cross-examine adverse witnesses and to offer witnesses.       (9) That the proceeding and disposition be expeditious.       (10) That the tribunal apply reasonable rules of evidence      designed to ensure admission only of reliable information or      material with probative value.       (11) That the accused be afforded all necessary means of      defense before and after the trial.       (12) That conviction of an alleged offense be based only      upon proof of individual responsibility for the offense.

(b) Imposition of the Death Penalty.--The requirements of      the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the imposition of      the death penalty shall apply in any case in which a tribunal      established under section 3 is requested to adjudge the death      penalty.       (c) Public Proceedings.--Any proceedings conducted by a      tribunal established under section 3, and the proceedings on      any appeal of an action of the tribunal, shall be accessible      to the public consistent with any demonstrable necessity to      secure the safety of observers, witnesses, tribunal judges,      counsel, or other persons.       (d) Confidentiality of Evidence.--Evidence available from      an agency of the Federal Government that is offered in a      trial by a tribunal established under section 3 may be kept      secret from the public only when the head of the agency      personally certifies in writing that disclosure will cause--       (1) identifiable harm to the prosecution of military      objectives or interfere with the capture of members of al      Qaeda anywhere;       (2) significant, identifiable harm to intelligence sources      or methods; or       (3) substantial risk that such evidence could be used for      planning future terrorist attacks.

(2) United states court of appeals for the armed forces.--     The procedures established under paragraph (1) shall, at a      minimum, allow for review of the proceedings of the tribunals      by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces      established under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.       (3) Supreme court.--The decisions of the United States      Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces regarding proceedings      of tribunals established under section 3 shall be subject to      review by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.

SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the President should seek      the cooperation of United States allies and other nations in      conducting the investigations and prosecutions, including      extraditions, of the persons who are responsible for the      September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and use to      the fullest extent possible multilateral institutions and      mechanisms for carrying out such investigations and      prosecutions.     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) September 11, 2001 attacks on the united states.--The      term ``September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States''      means the attacks on the Pentagon in the metropolitan area of      Washington, District of Columbia, and the World Trade Center,      New York, New York, on September 11, 2001, and includes the      hijackings of American Airlines flights 77 and 11 and United      Airlines flights 175 and 93 on that date.       (2) United states person.--The term ``United States      person'' has the meaning given that term in section 101(i) of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C.      1801(i)).     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.       The authority under this Act shall terminate at the end of      December 31, 2005.                                  ____    Military Tribunal Authorization Act of 2002--Section-by-Section                                 Analysis       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Military Tribunal Authorization      Act of 2002.       Sec. 2. Findings. This section outlines twelve findings,      including that the al Qaeda terrorist organization and its      leaders committed unlawful acts against the United States on      September 11, 2001 and on prior occasions; the U.S. is      justified in exercising its right to self-defense under      international law and the U.N. Charter; the Congress      authorized the President to use all necessary force against      those who committed, aided or abetted the September 11      attacks in order to prevent future attacks, within the      meaning of the War Powers Resolution; military trials may be      appropriate to protect public safety, to protect classified      information used as evidence, and to protect national      security interests; Article I, section 8 of the Constitution      provides that the Congress, not the President, has the power      to constitute tribunals and to define and punish offenses      against the law of nations; and congressional authority is      necessary to establish extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate      offenses arising from the September 11 attacks.       Sec 3. Establishment of Extraordinary Tribunals. The      President is authorized to establish tribunals to try non-     U.S. persons who are al Qaeda member (and persons aiding and      abetting al Qaeda in terrorist activities against the United      States); are apprehended in Afghanistan, apprehended fleeing      from Afghanistan, or apprehended in or fleeing from any other      place where there is armed conflict involving the U.S. Armed      Forces; and are not prisoners of war, as defined by the      Geneva Conventions. Tribunals may adjudicate violations of      the laws of war targeted against U.S. persons. The Secretary      of Defense is charged with promulgating rules of evidence and      procedure for the tribunals.       Sec. 4. Procedural Requirements. Rules for tribunals shall      require (1) an independent and impartial proceeding; (2) that      the accused be informed of the charges against him; (3) that      proceedings be conducted with simultaneous translation for      non-English speakers; (4) that the accused be shown the      evidence against him; (5) that the accused be present at      trial if he so chooses; (6) that the accused have the right      to be represented by counsel; (7) that the accused have the      right to respond to the evidence, and to obtain exculpatory      evidence from the prosecution; (8) that the accused have the      right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to      offer witnesses; (9) an expeditious trial and disposition;      (10) that the rules of evidence admit only reliable      information of probative value; (11) that the accused be      afforded all necessary means of defense; (12) that      convictions be based only upon proof of individual      responsibility; (13) that a conviction may not be based on an      act, offense, or omission that was not an offense under law      when committed; (14) that the penalty for conviction not be      greater than it was when the offense was committed; (15) that      the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and      that proof of guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt;      (16) that the accused may not be compelled to confess guilt      or testify against himself; (17) that trials to be open and      public and include public access to transcripts and      pronouncement of judgment, with the exceptions described      below; and (18) that convicted persons be informed of      available remedies and appeals. The bill follows the      Uniform Code of Military Justice in requiring a unanimous      vote for imposition of the death penalty.       Trial proceedings will generally be accessible to the      public with limited exceptions for demonstrable public safety      concerns. The bill allows for evidence to be kept secret from      the public where disclosure may compromise national security      or intelligence sources.       Convictions may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Armed Forces. Any decisions of that court regarding      proceedings of tribunals are subject to review by the U.S.      Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.       Sec. 5. Detention. This section authorizes detention of      individuals who are subject to a tribunal under section 3. In      order to detain an individual under the authority of this      section, the President must certify that the U.S. is in armed      conflict with al Qaeda or Taliban forces in Afghanistan or      elsewhere, or that an investigation, prosecution or post-     trial proceeding against the detainee is ongoing. This      certification must be made every 6 months.       Evidence that may establish that an accused is not subject      to detention under this section shall be disclosed to the      accused, except that a summary of such evidence will be      provided if the Attorney General certifies that disclosure      would cause certain identifiable harms. Detentions under this      section may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      D.C. Circuit.       This section also defines the conditions of detention,      requiring that detainees be treated humanely. Humane      treatment includes adequate food, water, shelter, clothing      and medical treatment, hygienic conditions, the necessary      means of personal hygiene, and the free exercise of religion.      Detention determinations and the conditions of detention are      subject to review by the Court of Appeals for the D.C.      Circuit.       Sec. 6. Sense of the Congress. This section calls for the      President to seek the cooperation of U.S. allies and other      nations in the investigations and prosecutions of those      responsible for the September 11 attacks. It also calls for      the President to use multilateral institutions to the fullest      extent possible in carrying out such investigations and      prosecutions.       Sec. 7. Definitions. This section defines the terms,      ``September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S.,'' and ``U.S.      person.'' The latter takes its meaning from the definition of      the term ``U.S. person'' in the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act of 1978, and includes a citizen of the      United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent      residence.       Sec. 8. Termination of Authority. Authority under the act      terminates on December 31, 2005.                                 ______                                       By
