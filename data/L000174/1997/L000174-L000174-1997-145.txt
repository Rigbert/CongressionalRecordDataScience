President, yesterday, the administration transmitted its legislative proposal for implementing the two new treaties adopted in December 1996 by the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO]. Over the past few months, I have spoken and written to Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce urging him to transmit this proposal without delay. The legislative package we received yesterday is an excellent start for moving forward. I commend the administration, Secretary Daley and, in particular, Assistant Secretary Bruce Lehman of the Patent and Trademark Office for their hard work on this proposal.  I understand that the administration's proposal will be introduced in the House of Representatives today. Along with Senator Hatch, I am reviewing the proposal. I hope we will be able to introduce the legislation this week so that we can take this matter up for hearings and further deliberation and action promptly when we return in September.                          ____________________
