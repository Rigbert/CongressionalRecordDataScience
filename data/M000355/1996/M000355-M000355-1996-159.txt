  Mr. McCAIN. On page 27 of the report accompanying the bill that I am looking at----  Mr. McCONNELL. I really think Senator Johnston, who is the author, ought to respond.  Mr. McCAIN. The way I read it, it says the committee ``strongly recommends that AID consider implementing the initiative through those organizations.'' I ask the Senator from Louisiana, is that the correct interpretation of the language in the bill?
