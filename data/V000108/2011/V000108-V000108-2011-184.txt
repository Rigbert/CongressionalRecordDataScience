Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Paul M. Maday on his retirement from his position as Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer for the Boilermakers Local 374, as well as his position as Recording Secretary-Treasurer for the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council. Paul, a member of the Boilermakers Local 374 for many years, has dedicated his life to the interests of his fellow tradespeople and the entire community in Northwest Indiana. For his lifetime of service to the Boilermakers, Paul was honored at a retirement dinner that took place at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana, on Friday, June 10, 2011.  Paul Maday has been a member of the Boilermakers Local 374 for 34 years. During his tenure, he has held numerous positions. After four years as an apprentice, Paul became a journeyman, a general foreman, and a union steward. Paul's career continued to advance, and he was named Assistant Business Manager in 1995, a position he held for ten years. Because of his hard work and tremendous leadership skills, Paul went on to become Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer in 2005 and was reelected to this position in 2008. Paul also has served as Recording Secretary-Treasurer for the Northwestern Indiana Building Trades Council since 2005. For his noteworthy level of skill and commitment, Paul was appointed to the Indiana State Pressure Vessel Board in 2002, 2005, and 2008. Additionally, he has served as chairman of the Boilermakers National Pension Trust and the National Annuity Trust and also served as chairman of the Tripartite Committee for U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor and Burns Harbor, representing the Northwestern Indiana Building Trades Council. Paul's passion, devotion, and continuous support to the Building Trades is truly remarkable, and for this he is worthy of the highest praise.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in the craftsmanship and loyalty of tradespeople. For many years, Paul Maday has displayed unwavering dedication to the members of the Building Trades, and his various positions have allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of countless individuals. Not only has Paul selflessly served his local members, but through his work with the Building Trades, he has been a remarkable example of just how much good a dedicated individual can do for a community. When it comes to serving those in need, Paul Maday has been a leader of his members and the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council to ensure that innumerable good works are done. Paul also selflessly gives of his time to many charitable organizations. He has been involved in the Alzheimer's Association walk-a-thon fundraiser and has served on the executive board for the American Heart Association of Northwest Indiana, as well as the Northwest Indiana Workforce Investment board. Although Paul has served the Building Trades and his community with complete dedication, it is his commitment to his family that is most impressive. Paul and his wonderful wife, Terry, have two beloved children and one grandchild.  Mr. Speaker, Paul Maday has given his time and efforts selflessly to the union members he has worked so tirelessly with and represented so well. He has given to the people of Northwest Indiana personally and through his work with the Building Trades Council. He has been a true role model to his peers and a true friend to Northwest Indiana. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Paul for his outstanding contributions and in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
