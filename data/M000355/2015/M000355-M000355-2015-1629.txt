 President, for the information of all Senators, the first vote of the week will occur at 5:30 p.m. this afternoon on confirmation of the nomination for Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator. There are three other votes in the series tonight, and those nominations will be confirmed by voice vote.  Tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of legislation to combat human trafficking. Members on both sides of the aisle have amendments to the bill, and those Senators should be working with Chairman Grassley and Senator Leahy to get in the queue for consideration. It is my expectation that votes in relation to the trafficking bill will kick in after the policy lunches tomorrow.                          ____________________
