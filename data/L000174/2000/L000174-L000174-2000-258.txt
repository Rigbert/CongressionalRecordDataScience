President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act,'' which would encourage the donation of original works by artists, writers and composers to museums and other public institutions, thus ensuring the preservation of these works for future generations. This bill would achieve this by restoring tax equity for artists. Artists who donate their self-created works, like art collectors who donate identical pieces, would be allowed to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work.  Under current law, art collectors who donate works to qualified charitable institutions may take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. This serves as a powerful and effective incentive for collectors to donate works to public museums, galleries, libraries, colleges and other institutions rather than keep them hidden from the public eye. Unfortunately, artists who create those same works may not take such a deduction. Instead, artists may only deduct the material cost of the work which is, in most cases, a nominal amount. This is simply unfair to artists in Vermont, and artists across the nation, who want to donate their works for posterity.  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress changed the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Since then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums and cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the Library of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the Library of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from authors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the deduction, the library received only one gift. Instead, many of these works have been sold to private collectors, and are no longer available to the general public.  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of Congress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a private foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive loss to our cultural heritage. This loss was an unintended consequence of the tax bill that should now be corrected.  Over thirty years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in response to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that time, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse of fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists who donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/collectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes providing relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel.  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, which often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to display. The institution must also certify that it intends to put the work to a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For example, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be used by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be sold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be donated to a hospital or other charitable institution, that did not intend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting the donee's exemption under section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or related activities.  In addition to restoring tax equity for artists and collectors, this bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment of self-created works--the difference between how the same work is treated before and afteran artist's death. While artists may only deduct the material costs of donations made during their lifetime, donations of those same works after death are deductible from estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, when an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed on the fair market value.  The time has come for us to correct an unintended consequence of the 1969 bill and encourage rather than discourage the donations of art works by their creators. The public benefit to the nation, when artists are encouraged to contribute their works during their lifetimes, cannot be overemphasized. It allows historians, scholars, and the public to learn directly from the artist about his or her work. From artists themselves, we can learn how a work was intended to be displayed or interpreted and what influences affected the artist.  In Vermont, we were lucky enough to have Sabra Field, a well known artist who has been creating wood block prints for the past 40 years, donate over 500 of her own original prints to Middlebury College, at their behest. With those prints, Middlebury will establish the Sabra Field Collection so that students of the college as well as Vermonters and visitors to our state will be able to view her original works on display. We Vermonters owe her our thanks for her incredible generosity. Under current law, Ms. Field, whose prints have sold for up to $4,000 on the market, was unable to deduct the fair market value of the donated works from her taxes, as a collector of those same works would have been able to. In that instance, the public's gain was Ms. Field's loss. This legislation would create a win-win situation for all.  The Senate recently recognized the importance of the arts in our children's education when it passed a resolution designating March 2000 as ``Arts Education Month.'' The Artist-Museum Partnership Act could make a critical difference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather than sell it to a private party, where it may become lost to the public forever. I cannot think of a better way to enhance arts education than to encourage the donation of art works by living artists, a few of whom we are lucky enough to have in Vermont, to public institutions across the nation.  I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Bennett and Mr. Lieberman for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I would also like to submit to the record a letter from the Association of Art Museum Directors, in support of this bill.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                Association of Art                                             Museum Directors,                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2000.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Robert Bennett,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett. On behalf of the      Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), I thank you for      introducing legislation that would allow artists, composers      and writers to take a deduction of the fair-market value of a      contribution of their own work to a charitable institution.       As a result of changes to the tax code in 1969, visual      artists, writers and composers can no longer take a deduction      based on the fair-market value of a contribution of their own      work to a charitable organization. The artists' deduction is      limited to the cost of materials in preparing a work--in the      case of a visual artist, canvas and paint. However, a      collector, making an identical donation, may take the fair      market value of the work. Also, once the artist dies, his or      her spouse may contribute the work and use the fair-market      value as the basis of the donation.       As a result, contributions to museums and libraries by      living artists and writers have all but disappeared in the      last 30 years, depriving the public of access to its cultural      heritage, since many of the pieces are sold abroad or into      private collections and never seen again. If instead the      works were contributed to a charitable institution, the      artists could, while still alive, provide interpretations and      insights that would be of enormous benefit to the public in      understanding 20th century art.       Artists like Chuck Close and Sam Gilliam who have achieved      a considerable degree of success, would be more willing to      share their work with the public through donations to major      institutions. However, the benefits of the proposed      legislation would not be limited to major artists and      institutions.       Many smaller museums would benefit from contributions by      local artists in the community who could be important in      documenting geographic, ethnic, religious or regional      examples of art.       The AAMD, which was founded in 1916 and represents 170 art      museums nationwide, fully supports the enactment of this      legislation.           Sincerely,                                          Millicent Hall Gaudieri,                                               Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
