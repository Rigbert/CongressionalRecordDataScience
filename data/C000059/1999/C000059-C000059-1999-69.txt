Speaker, today I am dropping the fourth in a series of single-issue bills to make common sense corrections to the Endangered Species Act. My bill, the Direct Review of Protected Species Act, would amend the ESA to provide for the review and recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences of species that should be removed from the list of endangered and threatened species.  During ESA's 26 years, over 1,154 animals and plants have been listed as endangered or threatened, yet only 27 species have been removed from the list. 27! That is a recovery rate of 2 percent, which leads me to believe that either the Fish and Wildlife Service is not keeping up with their mandate to review the list every five years and remove recovered species, or their best efforts to conserve habitat at the expense of billions of dollars to taxpayers are failing. Either conclusion is unacceptable. The DROP Species Act would take the de-listing process out of the hands of politicians and place it in the hands of a well-respected, independent panel of scientists.  I'm unhappy with the Fish and Wildlife Service, Mr. Speaker. So unhappy that I will introduce one ESA reform bill every week until the Resources Committee field hearing in California on July 9. The agency has a responsibility to balance the rights of species with the rights of taxpaying citizens. This is a call to common sense.                          ____________________
