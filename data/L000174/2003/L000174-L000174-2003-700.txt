President, I have listened to the comments of the distinguished Senator from California. I strongly compliment her for what she has been saying. Is it not a fact, Mr. President, I ask my friend from California, that simply because a Senator wishes more time to debate a particular nominee that does not mean that Senator is going to vote against the nominee; is that not correct?
