President, I would like to see the amendment. I hate to agree to a time, and I am sorry to upset the clerk by saying that, but it is a little bit difficult to get the exact time when we might vote. I am not sure exactly what the amendment is. I hate to cut off other people.  Why don't we agree on an hour evenly divided? The amendment I now have in my hand ends ``this transmits certification such paragraph in.''  Mr. McCAIN. I have a better copy for the Senator.
