Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a debate about whether to fund family planning or title X. The only question is whether we believe that parents should raise our children or whether we think that government officials should raise our sons and daughters.  Parents must consent before their children attend field trips, if their children are absent from school, for their children to receive treatment for a twisted ankle, and parents must consent for their children to participate in sports after school. Should this same parent not also have to consent before their children receives contraceptives or treatment for a sexually transmitted illness? That is the only issue raised by the Istook amendment.  Without this amendment, when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and planning families, parents need not apply. The Istook amendment puts parents first again. It says that what is common sense for movies, fields trips and football should also apply to serious medical treatment.
