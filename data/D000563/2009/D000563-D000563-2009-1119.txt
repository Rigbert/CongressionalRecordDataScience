 I would like to make a unanimous consent request that has been cleared by the other side: that of the 4 hours that have been set aside for this debate, the last 30 minutes be preserved and equally divided between the two sides, with 15 minutes to a side; under the custom of the Senate, if we go into quorum calls, time is taken equally from both sides. We have actively spoken on this amendment on our side, and no one has appeared yet, though I think they will soon, on the other side.  So I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the usual tradition of quorum calls taking the remaining time, dividing it by half, that the last 30 minutes be insulated and protected from that, and it be allocated 15 minutes to a side.
