 President, the Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from Vermont are going to discuss the amendment that is currently at the desk. What we would like to do at this point is to have an opening statement from Senator Coverdell on the amendment that he is going to be offering, which will be laid aside and will be taken up subsequent to the vote on the McCain amendment.  So, Mr. President, the order will be, we will hopefully vote on the McCain amendment sometime as early as possible in the morning and then go to the Coverdell amendment which Senator Coverdell is now prepared to discuss. I yield the floor.
