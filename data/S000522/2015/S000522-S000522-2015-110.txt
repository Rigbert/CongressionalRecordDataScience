Mr. Speaker, 59 years ago today, the Hungarian people rose up against the Soviet-installed communist dictatorship--a revolution that remains a model of patriotism, heroism, and resistance against tyranny today. I submit the following remarks delivered last evening at an event commemorating this momentous anniversary by Louis S. Segesvary, Ph.D., of the American Hungarian Federation.                  [From American Hungarian Federation]                        Hungary and the Hard Way                     (By Louis S. Segesvary, Ph.D.)       It was in the month of October, on the twenty-third day in      1956, that the small Eastern European nation of Hungary rose      up in a revolution against the Soviet Union that represented      the first major challenge to its military dominion since      World War II.       Nearly six decades have passed since then, yet it would be      a mistake to discount the significance of this revolution      merely because of the passage of time. This was David facing      down Goliath in the modern era, and as such it remains and      will remain an inspiration to freedom loving people      everywhere.       Historians have explained to us the cause of the Hungarian      uprising against the mighty Soviet empire as one of chafing      under the weight of totalitarian occupation. But this      explanation is hardly enough. Many peoples have suffered      similar fates without risking the human costs associated with      revolution. Those that have been willing to pay the price      have been far fewer, and the more formidable the force of the      occupier, the even fewer number. Bravery has always been the      difference.       In this respect, Hungary and the United States share a      similar past. Both risked revolutions against the greatest      powers of their times. Only the American patriots were      successful while Hungarians were seemingly not.       But it is just at this point that we must be the most      careful in assessing the significance of Hungary's revolt      against the Soviet Union, which pitted a nation of only ten      million against the armed forces of a world superpower. For      the sheer courage displayed in this uprising against the most      hopeless of odds not only stunned the world but inspired it.      As the French writer and Nobel Laureate Albert Camus put it      at the time,       ``Hungary conquered and in chains has done more for freedom      and justice than any people for twenty years. . . Those      Hungarian workers and intellectuals, beside whom we stand      today with such impotent sorrow, understood this and have      made us the better to understand it. That is why their hope      is also ours. In spite of their misery, their chains, their      exile, they have left us a glorious heritage which we must      preserve: freedom, which they not only chose, but which in a      single day they gave back to us.''       Practical consequences as well were to follow the Hungarian      revolution even as it was crushed by columns of Soviet tanks,      for the sacrifices of the freedom fighters helped lead      eventually to a crescendo of falling dominos and the      dissolution of the entire Soviet Union itself. The seven days      of freedom Hungarians had achieved in 1956 meant that Goliath      had been mortally wounded, his aura of invincibility      shattered. It was just a matter of time before he collapsed      into the dust once again just as in biblical times.       Today Hungary is a fledgling democracy experiencing the      kind of attacks that don't come from the muzzles of AK-47s or      the cannons of Soviet era tanks. Caught in the whirlwind of      the migrant crisis enveloping Europe, with nearly 400,000      political and economic migrants transiting the country so far      this year on their way to Austria and Germany, it has been      subject to harsh public criticism for not being accommodating      enough to this flood of humanity.       Regrettably, the fact that Hungary has faithfully adhered      to the very protocol established by the European Union to      deal with asylum seekers in requiring their registration on      entry is generally ignored. But even more fundamentally, the      civilizational issues associated with nation states are just      as often disregarded. Whatever one thinks of Hungary's      insistence on protecting its borders, one also has to      consider the broader implications of what chaos will do to      Europe's cultural distinctiveness.       Albert Camus' stirring words on the Hungarian revolution      are well known. Not as well-known are his prophetic words,      just as profound, about the dangers associated with the      breakdown of civilizational rules. While the pitfalls of      anarchy meant the unpleasant task of having to make order, he      wrote, there had to be order, because without order, he would      die, ``scattered to the winds.''       He could have been speaking here once again about Hungary      as well. Only this time it was about a people seeking to      preserve the national identity they had secured for      themselves with their own blood six decades earlier. It is a      stand that not everyone will agree with, it is a stand that      can be debated, but it is a stand that is once again      resonating throughout the world.       The stakes in this debate are not to be taken lightly      because we should never forget that how this migrant crisis      is resolved will affect not only this generation of Europeans      but generation after generation to come. In a very real      sense, these future generations are fated to live with the      consequences of the choices made today with no other recourse      to them. That means the decisions by all of us affected by      this crisis need to be as wise as we can make them and our      consciences as clear as we can keep them.       The choices Hungary has taken so far in upholding the      asylum precepts of the European Union and safeguarding its      borders represent the hard way, a path of thorns on which      Hungary has so often found itself in its brilliant but tragic      history. It has risked its reputation on these choices, and      only time can tell us how sagacious they have been. In the      meanwhile, let us hold our rush to judgement. Especially on a      day in which we honor Hungary for its great sacrifices for      freedom.                          ____________________
