The reason for that is that the need that the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Norwood] talks about in terms of 40 percent, the gentleman from Georgia is absolutely correct. We would have to put a whole lot more money in there. We adopted a budget agreement. We would like to have a whole lot more money for almost every object in this bill. Why? Because as Mr. Natcher from Kentucky used to say, this is the people's bill. It deals with their health and with their education, their workplace safety, the very guts of their lives. That is why this bill is so popular. But when you increase an object by $338 million and then come back and say, well, we need $11 million additional, all of us know that that will not make a very big impact at all although it will make a big impact to reduce the compliance in OSHA.
