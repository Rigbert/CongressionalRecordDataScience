Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, clearly what the gentleman is trying to do in a debating framework is trying to say we didn't mention every specific instance,whether very serious, moderately serious, or extraordinarily serious.  The gentleman is correct. I have responded to the gentleman that the Ethics Committee clearly, we believe, can make those judgments; and we believe and are confident that the committee will make such judgments and will not treat de minimus assertions as seriously calling for investigative subcommittees or further action by the committee.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the bribery and corruption charges against Congressman Jefferson are serious. They go to the very heart of our ability as a representative government to do its job. It is fundamental that the people trust their elected representatives to act in the people's interest, not in their own. The very appearance that these allegations create is damaging to the image of this institution.  In the coming days, Congressman Jefferson will answer in a court of law to the 16 charges on which he was indicted. Congressman Jefferson is entitled to the presumption of innocence in the allegations against him, including bribery, racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice.  However, the Congress should be held to the highest standards. Earlier today, I called for the Ethics Committee to initiate its own investigation into the charges against Congressman Jefferson.  I support this resolution which calls for the automatic initiation of an Ethics Committee investigation when a Member of this body is indicted or formally charged with criminal conduct. This principle applies not just to Congressman Jefferson but to any Member of this House.  In the opening days of this Congress, I rose on the floor in support of a tough new ethics package.                              {time}  1915  I said then that Members of Congress should be held to the highest regard by the people they represent. Illegal, unethical or inappropriate conduct by Members of the House cannot be tolerated.  I was elected to this Congress to help change the way we do business in Washington, and I will continue to do so without regard to person or party.
