 President, let me echo the words of our chairman and thank him, our staff and everyone who has worked on this and everyone who has supported this in a bipartisan way to send it now to the President to be signed into law.  It is a great step forward. As the chairman, Senator Alexander, just said, the work must now begin in our schools, in our communities, and in ourStates to find ways to make sure all of our students achieve. We have put them on that, we expect them to live up to that, and that is the promise of this bill.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.
