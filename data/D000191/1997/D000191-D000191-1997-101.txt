  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, as we debate today, millions of Americans across the country are still laboring over their taxes. No one can argue that the current system is simple or fair. But today, under the guise of offering relief to average taxpaying hardworking wage-earning Americans, this Congress is going to consider a constitutional amendment that would make it impossible to close the loopholes and make other needed changes in the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Code.  It would be more properly titled ``The Corporate and Special Interest Loophole Protection Amendment.'' It would not allow us, except with a two-thirds vote, to close the loophole that allows 71 percent of the profitable foreign corporations in America to pay not a penny of tax in this country, and 31 percent of the largest, most profitable U.S. multinationals to pay not a penny of tax in this country.  Foreign firms filed claims on our precious minerals last year. A foreign company got $13 billion of gold for $13,000. We would not be able to charge them anymore without a two-thirds vote under this ridiculous amendment.                          ____________________
