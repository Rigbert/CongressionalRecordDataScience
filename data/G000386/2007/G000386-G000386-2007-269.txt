 President, look up Senator Stevens' name in media reports and you will find a long list of adjectives: tenacious, temperamental, scrappy, gruff, hot-tempered, tireless. And you will come across a long list of nicknames: one of the Senate's ``old bulls'' for his institutional knowledge, ``Uncle Ted'' to the people of Alaska who are grateful for his aggressive advocacy for their interests, pioneer for flying Army Air Corps missions during World War II and migrating to our rugged 49th State after law school, a mentor to up-and-coming elected officials, reportedly by his wife, a nutrition enthusiast for his devoted consumption of greens and whole grains, in the case of his longtime friend, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, ``my brother.''  I would like to add a few adjectives of my own.  First, Ted Stevens is an Alaskan. It is impossible to think of Alaska without thinking of its senior Senator. Alaska and Ted Stevens are inseparable. Anyone who knows Senator Stevens knows he wakes up every morning fighting for the people of Alaska and doesn't stop until he sleeps, which apparently isn't much. Their commercial industry, health care, electricity, water, transportation--even the cost of rural mail delivery--all earn his scrutiny. He has delivered again and again on policy to improve Alaskans' quality of life.  Second, and just as important, Ted Stevens is loyal. He is loyal to the institution of the United States Senate. Bipartisanship is natural for him. He understands that the art of compromise is critical to getting things done. For example, he is known to have helped reach a bipartisan deal on how to conduct the impeachment trial of President Clinton to minimize the partisan bickering that would have sullied the Senate and made a tense time even more tense.  He is more than willing to look across the aisle and find kinship with people of like interests. His friendship with Senator Inouye, a Democrat, is steadfast and legendary. They have found plenty of common ground in delivering good policy to the people of their uniquely situated States. Despite what seems like a gruff exterior sometimes, Senator Stevens has a reputation for extending generous kindness to his colleagues, such as flying across country to attend the funeral of a former Senator whose vote had once been helpful.  Senator Stevens' approach to policymaking is guided by Rotary International's ``Four-Way Test,'' a copy of which is framed on his desk in the Senate Chamber. The test reads: ``Is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?''  That four-way test was written in 1932, but like Senator Stevens--and here are more adjectives--it is common sense, inspirational, and timeless.                          ____________________
