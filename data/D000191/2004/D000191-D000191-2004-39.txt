Speaker, the point the gentleman made is little understood, and I have a whole bunch ofthose guaranteed student loans to get through, and what you said just really merits revisiting.                              {time}  2145  The Federal Government is going to guarantee banks 9.5 percent rate of return for extending loans to students to go to college to get a higher education.  Now, it is a great thing that we can help kids get a higher education. That is good. But the point is those loans are guaranteed by the Federal Government. The bank has no risk. Zero risk. I always thought interest had something to do with risk. So if the bank has no risk, how is it that they are going to get guaranteed?
