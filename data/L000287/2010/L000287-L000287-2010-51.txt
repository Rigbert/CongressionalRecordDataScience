Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, my friend, for yielding.  Madam Speaker, not long ago, the American economy was headed toward disaster. In the past year, businesses have closed their doors, and more and more of our sisters and brothers have joined the unemployment line. In my district, unemployment is still over 10 percent. That is unacceptable. And with this bill, with this piece of legislation, we can do better.  While this Congress and this administration have brought our economy back from the brink of depression, there is still so much left to do. Today with this bill, we can take another step down that long road to recovery. This bill will create jobs, it will save jobs, and it will save our small businesses. Is it possible? Is it too much to ask for? Is there someway and somehow that we all could come together and create jobs to put our people back to work?  This bill will help the family-owned restaurant that has served our community for years. It will help businesses that are facing cutbacks, and it will help people follow their dreams to open their own businesses.  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, for all of our small businesses, and to pass it now.
