Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for two bills we are considering today, both of which were introduced by my good friend and colleague Representative Hutchinson.  H.R. 1384 makes an important contribution to veterans health care by helping ensure that the VA health care system can retain the best health personnel. Unfortunately, existing VA regulations actually create a disincentive for many health care professionals to work in the VA health care system.  By restricting nurses, physician assistants, and dental auxiliaries from obtaining additional work outside the VA, we are forcing these personnel to make a choice between remaining in the VA, or leaving the system altogether. Many of these employees feel that they must obtain income from secondary sources in order to support their families and make ends meet. They should be allowed to do so, while still serving the VA. We should not risk losing talented people in the VA health care system simply because of an outdated regulation that no longer serves a useful purpose.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1536, which will extend the VA's authority to use local salary data to determine the salary levels of nurse anesthetists. This provision is necessary to ensure that nurse anesthetists are fairly compensated for their services, in the same manner that compensation for regular nurses is determined through the Veterans Affairs Nurse Pay Act of 1990.  As a member of the Veterans' Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care, I was pleased to support both of these bills at both the subcommittee and the full committee level. I want to thank Chairman Hutchinson for his diligent work on these legislative initiatives, and urge all my colleagues to give their full support to these two measures.
