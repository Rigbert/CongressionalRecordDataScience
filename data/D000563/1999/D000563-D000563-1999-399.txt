 percent of the catch, proportion of payments, zero; Venezuela, 16.2 percent of the catch, proportion of payments, zero; Ecuador, 26.3 percent of the catch, proportion of payments, zero.  Why aren't these countries paying their fair share, their fishery industry fishing for tuna, signatories to this agreement? They should be paying their share instead of being subsidized by the United States.  I think we should take the money saved by the Senator from California and dedicate it to a lot of other international fishery efforts that are listed within this legislation. I am happy to support her amendment. I think it is eminently fair. I hope those listening to the debate will join us in making certain that every country lives up to its obligation.
