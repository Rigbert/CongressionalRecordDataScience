Mr. Speaker, today I think the question in this debate boils down to one thing: Who do we trust?  I arrived here in 1994, at the end of the 40-year period of Democrat rule of this House of Representatives. They were running 200-plus billion dollar deficits and created a $5 trillion debt. Government was growing at an exponential rate. They were ready and willing to place upon this country a government program that would have taken us over the line, a government program called socialized medicine. There was not enough money for them to spend. They just kept taking it out of Social Security and Medicare, wherever they could get the money to create larger government all the time.  To hear them talk about debt reduction is amusing. Talk about revisionist history. We listened to it last night.  When I came here, I signed a contract, the Contract with America, that would balance the budget, that would cut taxes, that would reform welfare, that would reduce the size of government and allow people to keep more of their money. They fought it every inch of the way.  Yes, there was a government shutdown. Know why? Because the President would not sign the Balanced Budget Act that he is so wonderfully willing to take credit for today.  The question is, who do we trust?  They did not get the title ``tax-and-spend'' liberals for nothing. I think it is a very appropriate title and it still sticks with them today.  The question is who do we trust? It is like if we believe them, it would be like asking Jessie James to guard the bank vault for a little while. I do not think we want to do that. I do not think we want to go back to 40 years of tax-and-spend liberals.
