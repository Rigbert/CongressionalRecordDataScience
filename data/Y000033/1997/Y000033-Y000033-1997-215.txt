If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Chairman, as I stated earlier, the committee only approved this rescission after it was determined there would be no impact on planned fiscal year 1997 testing efforts. The committee did not and would not approve any action which would delay program development.  In the early stages of the THAAD program success was all over the place, but recent tests have been not quite as successful, so the review is necessary. But this rescission should have no impact on the ability to deploy a user operational evaluation system by 1999. We are committed to getting this system and other critical theater missile defense systems into the field to protect our troops at the earliest possible date.
