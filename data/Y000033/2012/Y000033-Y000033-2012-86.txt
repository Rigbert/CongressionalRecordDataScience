Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of a grateful Alaska Congressional Delegation, state, and country, to welcome four heroes to our nation's capital. On September 27, 2012, four World War II veterans are coming on an Honor Flight from Alaska to visit the World War II Memorial here in Washington, D.C.   The Honor Flight program was started in 2005 to provide national transportation to D.C. for veterans who might otherwise never see the memorials built in their honor. Initially run entirely by individual volunteers, the program has grown into a non-profit network of volunteers, organizations, and airlines that work together to extend this amazing opportunity to those who most deserve it.   The four veterans on this Honor Flight are World War II veterans: William Joseph Nuggent, Army Air Force; Louis Elmer Fessler, U.S. Army; Marc Stella, U.S. Marine Corps; Robert J. Ingram, U.S. Navy.   Mr. Speaker, these four veterans from Alaska join over 81,000 veterans, from across the country, who have traveled to our nation's capital since 2005 to visit and reflect on memorials built in their honor. This Honor Flight was made possible through generous public donations and contributions from those who wish to honor these heroes.   We truly can never repay the debt we owe the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who put themselves in harm's way to protect our freedom. The sacrifices made by these heroes--and the families they left behind--are truly incredible. These servicemen returned home with heavy burdens and scars from war, and still helped our nation rebuild and achieve unprecedented prosperity. Their honor, courage, commitment, and sacrifice brought freedom to much of the world, and allowed us to enjoy the freedoms we cherish today.   Please join me in thanking these Alaska veterans for their selfless dedication, commitment, and service to our great nation. God bless America and these brave men.                          ____________________
