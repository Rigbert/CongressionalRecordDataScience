Speaker, I rise in strong support of the American Homeownership Act, and I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. McIntosh).  Mr. McINTOSH. Mr. Speaker, let me first say thanks to the chairman for this. This bill is excellent. The chairman deserves a lot of commendation for bringing it to the floor, especially with regard to manufactured housing.  Let me ask two questions: Does the preemption language in this bill change or alter in any way any existing duty or responsibility of the manufacturer with respect to the installation of the home?
