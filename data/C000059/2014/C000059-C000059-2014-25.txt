Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Lake Elsinore has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities better places to live and work. Dave Oster is one of these individuals. On January 25, 2014, Dave will be honored as the 2013 ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce Instalation and Awards Gala.  Dave was born and raised in the small town of Mantua, OH, where the friendly and respectful nature of the community created a family-like atmosphere. Dave grew up watching his father establish a successful career in human resources, and soon, his work ethic and values were formed. Growing up, Dave developed his passion for America's favorite pastime, baseball, and found himself consistently holding a leadership position as captain for many of his teams. Dave went on to graduate high school and attend Bowling Green State University and later Ohio Northern University, where he earned his degree in sports management. He was honored with his first leadership award, the Clyde A. Lamb Award, during his senior year at Ohio Northern.  Dave's thriving career in sports began when he interned for the Cleveland Force, a renowned soccer team based in Ohio. His first job out of college followed suit, as he became the General Manager for the minor league baseball team, the Geneva Cubs. Dave became involved in every facet of the organization, from concessions to clean up, and he established an environment of success and fun. Dave quickly learned how to grow a business and manage a staff, eventually leading him to win the John H. Johnson Award for team recognition and running of an organization.  After 4 years with the Geneva Cubs, Dave took his talent and drive to Delaware, where he began his job as Assistant General Manager for the Wilmington Blue Rocks minor league team. During a time when the organization was just beginning, Dave used his skills and expertise to help build the franchise from the ground up. He made sure the community saw every game as a ``must-attend'' event, and grew attendance from 800 to 6,000 fans, virtually selling out every home game. Dave soon made another move, ending up in Salem, VA, where he was promoted to General Manager of the Salem Avalanche. For all of his hard work, he was honored with the Executive of the Year award for the Carolina League.  Following his success on the East Coast, Dave took a huge leap of faith, and moved out West, where he found his new home with the Lake Elsinore Storm as the Owner and President. His contributions as a leader in the area resulted in huge economic growth and community involvement. For this, he was once again honored with the Executive of the Year Award in the California League. Aside from the tremendous work he has done to create success with The Storm, above all, he is most proud of the family he has found in the staff, and the passion he has for the community, the players and the franchise. 2013 marked Dave's 25th year in professional sports, and his 14th season with the Lake Elsinore Storm.  Dave is most known as an effective leader with a natural ability to organize the efforts and goodwill of others. He is an enthusiastic team builder who enjoys encouraging creativity in the staff that he leads. Considering all that Dave has done for Lake Elsinore, the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce named him their 2013 Citizen of the Year. Dave's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. He has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
