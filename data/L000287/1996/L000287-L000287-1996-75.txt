Mr. Speaker, Mother's Day is almost here, and I have some bad news for my mother and many others. The Republicans have a new budget, and they still cut Medicare. They still want Medicare to wither on the vine.  There they go again, Mr. Speaker. In the Republican Medicare budget, they divide the elderly. They give Federal dollars over to insurance companies for the healthy and the wealthy. Then they want the Federal Government to pay for the sick and the poor.  They offer medical savings accounts to healthy seniors. So, they can use money from the Federal Government--to buy a car or take a vacation. That does not made sense. That will not help the budget or our seniors.  I call on my Republican colleagues to give us a better budget. We should not cut Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. We should not destroy Medicare in the name of saving it.  Don't cut Medicare.                          ____________________
