Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce the Family Service Improvement Act of 1996 this afternoon. I have been working on the concepts behind this legislation for a number of years. The Family Service Improvement Act will eliminate Federal redtape and unnecessary regulation. It will give local programs the flexibility they need to address local problems. It should create incentives for program coordination which serves kids and families better while making more efficient use of our resources. And it will demand accountability based on program results, not on process and paperwork.  I believe that a concerted Federal effort to rationalize and coordinate programs for children and families is long overdue. Over the years, Congress has created hundreds of categorical programs to help communities and families deal with the myriad of issues confronting them. Each of the programs was created with its own rules and regulations to deal with a particular problem. Over time, the list of rules and regulations has grown to stifle, rather than support, the very objectives we are trying to achieve.  In some areas, where local needs don't fit the problems covered by our categorical programs, our services for children and families are vastly inadequate. In other areas, services overlap and duplicate each other. For example, multiple programs may provide caseworkers to a single family, but each caseworker deals only with one aspect of that family's needs.  In many programs, caseworkers spend far too much time dealing with redtape and paperwork, juggling multiple programs with multiple eligibility criteria, application processes, and service requirements. The Federal Government has created hundreds of different taps through which assistance flows--and communities, programs, and families must run from tap to tap with a bucket to get the help they need.  As an appropriator, I am particularly concerned that our tax dollars be spent efficiently and effectively. In 1994, I asked the Department of Education to convene a working group on coordinated services to make recommendations for such a Federal effort. The working group was headed by Jeanne Jehl from the San Diego public schools, whom I would like to thank for her outstanding work. The working group, which met through 1995, included Federal employees and people from State and local governments and organizations across the country. I was particularly pleased that Maryland's outstanding Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Nancy S. Grasmick, was able to participate in this effort. The Family Service Improvement Act is based on the recommendations of that group.                   Federal Fixes for Federal Problems  While I applaud the efforts of several of my colleagues in developing waiver bills which are now under consideration by this Congress, I believe that the Federal Government--not local programs--should have the responsibility of fixing the problems the Federal Government created. Under the Family Service Improvement Act, a Federal Coordination Council is designated to oversee the effort to eliminate regulations, simplify requirements, and make waiver requests unnecessary. The Council's responsibilities include eliminating unnecessary and burdensome regulations; developing a single eligibility and application form for a range of services to children and families; developing a single information release form which can be used to authorize exchange of information among a number of service providers; and developing RFP's which can be used to apply for funding from multiple Federal programs.                     Interdisciplinary Coordination  No effort to make services to families more effective and efficient will succeed unless programs which meet different aspects of family needs are better coordinated with each other. Cross-program coordination is the key to improving service quality and efficiency. The Family Service Improvement Act allows the creation of consortia of program providers in a community. Consortia members could include State, local, or tribal governments, and not-for-profit organizations. Each consortium must include providers in at least three of the program areas of education. Head Start, child care, job training, housing, nutrition, maternal and child health, family support and preservation, juvenile justice, and drug abuse prevention and treatment. In addition, it creates several incentives to encourage coordination, reduce program duplication, and improve services.                      Incentives for Coordination  As any State or local official who has been involved in the process will tell you, requesting a waiver from the Federal Government is time consuming and complicated. Where multiple programs are duplicating the same steps, common sense dictates that they ought to be able to join forces without going through the hoops of requesting a waiver.  For example, authorizing legislation requires many programs to assess community needs each year and to provide case managers to assist families. We certainly want programs to plan based on community needs, and to perform case management, but it simply doesn't make sense for each program to repeat work done by several others. Under the Family Service Improvement Act, a consortium of three programs which are required to do a community needs assessment and to provide a case worker to the same family would be automatically exempted from meeting such duplicative requirements as long as the requirement was met by the consortium or one of its members. Consortia will then be permitted to spend these funds to expand or improve their services.  In addition, the Family Service Improvement Act would allow consortia to set aside up to 10 percent of their Federal funds in a flexible fund. This flexible fund must be used to expand or improve services consistent with the programs run by the consortium. This provision will give service providers much needed flexibility to meet local needs which might not be anticipated by our Federal rules and regulations.                             Accountability  What counts in human service programs is performance: Are our programs working? Instead of measuring input and process, weshould be measuring outputs. Is the infant mortality rate going down? Are kids staying in school? Are kids learning more in school? Are parents getting--and keeping--jobs?  In an atmosphere of waivers, flexibility, and interdisciplinary coordination, the challenge of program evaluation becomes even more difficult. The Family Service Improvement Act creates what I believe is a workable system for both tracking and evaluating the impact of our Federal investment in these programs.  Many States are moving toward this focus on results, and have already identified State goals such as improved employment, reduced crime, increased high school completion and decreased infant mortality. Under the Family Services Improvement Act, a number of consortia will develop plans which identify goals taken from their State's list. The consortia will be responsible for collecting data over time to measure progress toward these goals. Data will be collected on a community-wide basis as well as disaggregated by appropriate subgroups as identified by the consortium, and published.  I believe the results of this demonstration will show that four purposes are met by collecting and publishing data in this way. First, collection of data will show how well the programs accomplish their goals for all people in the community, and allow the consortium to improve and adapt services as necessary. This information will become a valuable diagnostic tool for improving services. Second, publication of data will create bottom-up pressure within the community to serve all segments of the community. Third, disaggregation of data will help to prevent programs from cherry-picking the best clients just to improve their outcome statistics, and will create incentives to address the needs of the hardest to serve as well as the easiest. And fourth, collection of this type of data will allow the Federal Government to evaluate the effectiveness of its financial investment in these programs.  The Federal Government must demonstrate its leadership in promoting flexibility, demanding accountability, and eliminating redtape. We must get rid of the ``taps and buckets'' approach, and instead create a seamless flow of assistance that truly meets the needs of children and families. The Family Services Improvement Act is an important step in that direction.                          ____________________
