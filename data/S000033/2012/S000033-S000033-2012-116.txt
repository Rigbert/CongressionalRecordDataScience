 President, I ask to have printed in the Record these essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the second annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' essay contest conducted by my office. The following essays were selected as ``Runners Up.''  The Statements follow.             Monica Allard, Milton High School (Runner Up)                           [January 23, 2012]       The American Dream is adaptable. The ideals that we have      long valued are admirable, but often contradicting or      impossible to achieve with a large population. In today's      economy, that translates to the right to a free market      economy, conflicting with the practical need for government      interference; the right to succeed for oneself, battling with      the need to work together for today's and future generations.      As long as our country is able to prosper without certain      regulations, I encourage it to run free, but when the winter      comes and there is no more grazing, the horse must accept the      fence that accompanies the grain. It is imperative that      Americans collectively work to solve problems with social      security, our economy, and our political system in these      troubled times.       ``Maybe if we ignore it, it will go away'' has been the      standard approach to growing concerns about social security      in the last few years. Because of increasing life expectancy,      more people are retiring than the system can support. When      the newest generation retires, there won't be enough funds      for everyone, unless something changes soon. A fixed rate      retirement check is the logical solution, if we deduct money      from the fixed rate check based on income. Working citizens      would pay fewer taxes because only the people who need social      security will be receiving it, and everyone else would have      more money to put aside for their own retirement plans.       The predominant issue of the 21st century has been the      international recession. Unemployment rates are high, but      what many young Americans don't realize is the shortage in      technical workers. There is a national trend towards      traditional four-year universities, but technical careers are      the road to take if you are searching for job stability,      demand, potential for advancement, and self-employment or a      local employer in today's economy. Through ad campaigns and      offering incentives to students enrolling in technical      universities. This is a simple way to lower the unemployment      rate, while promoting local businesses.       Another important step in rejuvenating our economy is      passing legislation that gives the national government more      control over the stock market. Occupy movements have swept      the country and it is time for Congress to respond, instead      of hiring and appointing the same executives who were largely      responsible for our economy's collapse.       In order to move forward, we need to present a united      front. Republicans and Democrats are rending our country in      two because of partisan pressure. We need radical change in      the political system: remove all party authority. Primaries      and power distribution in Congress put too much emphasis     on parties, cause corruption, and detract from the primary      duty of Senators and Representatives to their states and      country.       As our soldiers rejoin their families at home we are forced      to turn our focus inward. Reform is necessary. It is not a      question of when nor is it a question of how. Rather, the      question is whether or not we are willing to do what is      necessary to save our great county. God bless America.                                  ____     Kayleigh Ehler-Vock, South Burlington High School (Runner Up)                           [January 23, 2012]       During a time of severe recession, a government facing      incredible debt, and a collapsing financial system, our      future looks dark. As a student that has been in the system      for 13 years, and will continue to higher education, I have      seen the benefits and complications of the current situation      with education. Next year, I will be attending college and      the cost of tuition is daunting. The high cost deters kids      from attending college. However, in our world today, a high      school diploma no longer ensures a hopeful career.      Republicans and democrats alike acknowledge the need to      invest in the skill and future of the youth.       Those who choose to continue their education to better      themselves and America should not be punished by entering the      real world chained down by debt; no one should be at the      bottom because they choose to go to college. According to      Helen Krispien of The Hopkinton Crier, the cost of private      college is approximately 57% of yearly income, and therefore      having two children in college is 114% of yearly income. The      cost of tuition is expected to increase by 5% per year,      leaving those in 15 years with tuition of $103,946. Reform is      needed. Colleges and universities must be required to cut      their own costs. They know their budget better than anyone,      and like our nation, they need to find a way to balance      competition with lowering skyrocketing costs. This will allow      for less borrowed education, and less government      intervention. Furthermore, revamp colleges in hometowns      allowing affordable options for the working class. As a      nation, we need to eliminate the interest that banks charge      on student loans. Instead, temporary tax breaks should be      given to those who have children that have attended college      for four years. This will allow for quicker repayment of      loans, and will insure a successful future for both the youth      and our nation. The government shouldn't be funding the      system the way they do now; funding should be used on reform.       Aspiring students see college as an investment into the      future; friendships, suitable partners, and a confidence in      them. In four years, I don't want to enter into a world of      hurt. I want to be a proud American, able to look back and      see what this great nation can do to recover from the      struggle we are facing. I want my parents to be able to      retire; they have worked hard to raise me and my siblings,      they deserve what they were promised. I am proud our      government is willing to listen, and if we work together as      one nation, America can be triumphant and re-establish the      high caliber and positive regard we have for much of history.                                  ____      Kate Raszka, Champlain Valley Union High School (Runner Up)                           [January 23, 2012]       My fellow Americans: The current state of our nation is one      of anticipation; anticipation for the future and what changes      will occur in the government regarding both foreign and      domestic affairs.       Our country faces many difficulties: a struggling economy,      the draining of resources from involvement in foreign      conflicts, too few new jobs, environmental degradation,      uncertainty about how to pay for health care, and a damaged      international reputation because of our handling of suspected      terrorists. While we face many difficulties, we can find      strength as one union and pursue solutions as a nation.       The United States must continue to lead by example. We      should teach the world how to prevent the degradation of our      environment. We as a country can promote renewable energy      resources. This would create a larger, newer market which in      turn would provide many new jobs. We have the power to      directly change the future. We must lead the fight to      preserve our planet.       It is unfortunate that while our country faces many      domestic issues we have been deeply involved in conflicts      overseas. However, our involvement in Iraq has led to a more      stabilized and democratic country. As we pull out, we leave      with a success.       Currently our judicial branch is deciding whether or not      the recently passed health care bill violates individual and      states' rights. All Americans deserve affordable health care.      To be successful our citizens must be able to live without      the fear of being unable to provide themselves or their      children healthcare. It may be wrong to require all people to      buy insurance, but a solution must be found by our esteemed      members of Congress in which all seeking citizens will find      affordable health care.       The indefinite incarceration of our citizens suspected of      terrorist involvement is a wrong that must be corrected. The      National Defense Authorization Act is a direct violation of      habeas corpus and must be dealt with. I urge the Supreme      Court to do so immediately.       The greatest solution to our problems is to make our      education system the greatest in the world and prepare our      youth for the competitive future. Educating our children will      prepare our younger generations to solve new problems that      will undoubtedly arise in the future. Currently, our      children's test scores fall below other rising nations'      scores. With our resources these results are unacceptable. It      is time to ensure that all our citizens, particularly those      below the poverty line, can attend college. Many of the      students with low test scores live in poor environments with      few opportunities. The success of our country must be made by      building upon our society from the bottom up. It is time to      raise our education standards and inspire change among those      of us most down trodden.       Thank you and God bless the United States of America.                                  ____        Karolina Sowulewska, Burr and Burton Academy (Runner Up)                           [January 23, 2012]       My fellow Americans: Our world is rapidly evolving, and we      must adapt to it, or be left behind. As a sovereign power, we      must lead through example. While progress has been made in      three domestic key fronts, America must advance      environmentally, economically and educationally.       We must take the first step in saving the environment, or      it will not sustain us and our ever expanding nation. America      must take initiative; by reducing our dependency on foreign      oil, to improve relations abroad, and purses for Americans at      home. This is also an opportunity to create jobs for      Americans, through national programs that would emphasize a      greener economy, such as lowering the cost of public      transportation, cutting gasoline and foreign fuel spending,      and creating energy efficient plans for buildings and      residential areas. By funding regional and national projects,      we create jobs and take large steps forward towards a low      carbon future.       The necessary changes in the environment intertwines with      our second key front: education. We need to fund and broaden      opportunities ranging from the elementary to university      level. More programs with emphasis on environmental service,      protection and restoration would prepare the men and women of      America to attack real world problems. If the budget for      education were to increase, there would be more monetary      provisions for grants, payment for teachers and new programs.      Projects and research, such as investigating alternative fuel      resources, and technological innovations, would not only      benefit our environmental front, but would prepare our      nation's future for the larger arena they must compete in.      Let us not wait for another Sputnik crisis to advance in      education and the sciences. We need simply to offer      accessible opportunities for higher learning for the variety      of people that seek it.       The environmental and educational fronts cannot begin to      expand or flourish, without a sturdy and secure economic      front. We must also adapt our freestanding market: the debt      continues to rise, and the need to invest the American people      in their nation increases as well. We must restore the      people's faith in the government. Our middle class will      strengthen. Unfortunately, this has to be achieved through      austerity: budgets must be redistributed to focus on our      priorities, such as our three fronts. While the free market      begs for stimulus, we must not wane and give in, but offer a      firm guiding hand to decrease the national debt. This must      begin by focusing our resources on environmental changes,      which would be brought forth through advances in educational      programs. By becoming less dependent on foreign resources, we      not only further invest in our nation and economy, but      provide jobs for hardworking Americans.       If the United States is to remain a strong domestic and      international power, we must adapt to our current situation      and prepare for the upcoming year. We must make significant      changes in order to progress. These changes on our three      fronts--environment, economy and education--will be      difficult, but they are changes that will only benefit us;      these are changes we can believe in.                          ____________________
