President, let me say--this is probably the first and only time I have ever said this--I have been listening carefully to my friend from New Jersey, and I agree with everything he said.  I have had a chance to talk a little bit about some of these people who are retiring, and at some length about Senator Nickles, and I certainly appreciate the Senator's remarks about him.                          ____________________
