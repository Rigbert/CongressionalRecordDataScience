Mr. Chairman, may I remind my good friend from Michigan--and she is a dear friend and her husband is a dear friend of mine, he voted for my bill, ANILCA--it is the law. It was an agreement that the State would manage.  By the way, it is against the law to shoot species of animals from a boat. This doesn't change that. It changes the management concept. It is overreach by the Federal Government. It is overreach by Fish and Wildlife. They would not be fish and wildlife managers anymore. They are becoming the preservationist group without the management ability in the State that lives there.  I am not changing anything other than just the fact that the State still has authority under ANILCA. He voted for it. I am suggesting, respectfully, if you want the Federal Government to manage everything, 100 million acres that we agreed that we could manage in the ANILCA law, the State, if you want the government to take that all over, let's just give the government all the land. Let's stop having free land.  You talk about being public land, the public that lives there, they want the State to manage the land. So far they have done a great job.  As far as shooting bears, that is against the law in the State of Alaska.  Now, why are we saying that?  Because it is emotionally acceptable. So let's stick to the facts. This is a fact.  Do you want the administration, the government to manage all lands or doyou want to follow the law that we passed in this Congress?  The law.  We have a tendency here to forget what happened, this Congress. Look at the history of ANILCA. It was a compromise. A lot of it I objected to, but we passed it in this House and it was accepted by the State with the understanding that the State would manage fish and game and not the Federal Government.  By the way, the Park Service in the State of Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife in the State of Alaska, in the beginning the BLM are not partners anymore. It is all run from Washington, D.C.
