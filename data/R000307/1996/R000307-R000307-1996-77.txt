Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, not only for his motion to instruct, but for his leadership in regard to the continuation of an outstanding program, the conservation reserve program. The gentleman has essentially described the House position, and the gentleman has very eloquently stated the positive aspects of this program. I want all Members to understand that every member of the Committee on Agriculture is supportive of his motion to instruct.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
