Speaker, I rise to ask that immediately following rollcall vote No. 48 a statement be included therein indicating that because the President of the United States was in my district this morning, and I was with him, I was unable to vote on rollcall No. 48, which extended the debt limit. Had I been here I would have voted ``aye.''                          ____________________
