President, I say to my friend from New York, it is reasonable to move forward on it. These are issues the American people care about. They do care about the gun show loopholes on gun sales, certainly after the tragedy of Columbine. They do care about a number of the issues that are in the juvenile justice bill. The Senate reflected that by passing it 73-25. This is a 3-to-1 vote in the Senate.  I say to my friend from New York, when he served in the other body, he and I were on a number of conference committees together. We knew we would have major criminal justice bills come in one distinct form from the Senate and one distinct form from the House, but we moved quickly in the conferences, sometimes going all night long. In fact, I can remember a couple that went all night long, 2 or 3 nights in a row, to complete our work because we knew we were dealing with criminal justice matters, matters about which the American people have great concern. But we did it.  So I say to my friend from New York, in answer to his question, that this is wrong. This is wrong that we are not moving forward to immediately conference the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.
