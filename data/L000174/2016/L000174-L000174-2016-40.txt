President, while we are on the subject of the President-elect, he has indicated some of the appointments he will make. Some, of course, will require advice and consent by this body, and I hope we will do that, even though this body has refused to advise and consent on the Supreme Court nomination now pending before it.  There are others he can appoint without being confirmed by the Senate. It is amazing that the President-elect, having said that he wants to bring the country together, that he wants to be a President for all of us, would then appoint to his inner circle, someone with the ear of the President, Stephen Bannon.  Let me just read part of an editorial in the Chicago Tribune.  ``The problem is that Bannon, who will sit at the right hand of a president, also works as a conduit to hate and intolerance. Bannon has said Breitbart is `the platform for the alt-right.' Yet the `alt-right' is a repellent, nationalist political movement that breeds racism, anti-Semitism and misogyny. The alt-right miasma `opposes feminism, diversity, gay rights, globalism, gun control and civil rights,' according to Baruch College professor Thomas Main, who is writing a book on the movement. At the fringes of alt-right is where you will find American neo-Nazis and the Klan, two groups evidently thrilled by Trump's victory.''  Those aren't my words. Those are the words from the Chicago Tribune.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the Record the full editorial.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 17, 2016]       Editorial: Stephen Bannon: The Next President's Whisperer       With just a week or so under his belt as president-elect,      Donald Trump has spoken in public briefly, given a few      interviews and bashed out some colorful tweets. Americans      still processing his stunning victory will have to wait a bit      longer to get a full sense of the next president's      priorities.       But already there's this: Trump has named Stephen Bannon,      62, his White House chief strategist.       Bannon, the political equivalent of a shock jock, was      little known until he became Trump's campaign chief executive      in August. He is a conservative media impresario whose resume      includes Georgetown, Harvard, the Pentagon and Goldman Sachs.      He's now the executive chairman of Breitbart News, whose      popular website dabbles in the swamplands of the far right. A      lot of bigoted ugliness swims out there in the so-called alt-     right, and Bannon has let it fester on Breitbart.com.       Trump won as a populist insurgent who used bullying and      intemperate language to fan his message. The strategy worked      but also helped divide the country. Appointing Bannon as      consigliere is not a good step toward unity. It agitates the      not-my-president slice of the American populace. And it      confuses Americans who are trying to give the president-elect      a fresh start--but who also need to see evidence that Trump      will abide his promise to be ``president for all Americans.''       When Trump takes office, Bannon--if he's still around--     won't be the Treasury secretary or the attorney general or      the secretary of state: leaders working largely in public.      Bannon instead will play the role David Axelrod played for      the nation's last novice president. His will be the whisper      in President Trump's ear. His work product won't be what the      White House proposes or what Congress passes. His work      product will be what the president does. What the president      says. What message the president projects to the country and      the world.       We get what Trump is trying to do by appointing Bannon. The      president-elect made two major picks early this week: He also      chose Reince Priebus to be chief of staff, the Oval Office      gatekeeper. Priebus, head of the Republican Party, was a      shrewd selection. Someone in the White House needs political      experience to guide Trump's agenda through Washington's      thicket. Priebus is perfectly positioned to be the hour-by-     hour liaison to his friend and fellow Wisconsinite, House      Speaker Paul Ryan.       Priebus is nobody's bomb thrower. He's a member of the      Normal Club. But that also pegs him as an establishment guy,      making Trump vulnerable to accusations of being a sell-out.      So to assuage the anti-establishment crowd, here comes      Bannon, whose website was one of Trump's most vocal      cheerleaders.       The problem is that Bannon, who will sit at the right hand      of a president, also works as a conduit to hate and      intolerance. Bannon has said Breitbart is ``the platform for      the alt-right.'' Yet the ``alt-right'' is a repellent,      nationalist political movement that breeds racism, anti-     Semitism and misogyny. The alt-right miasma ``opposes      feminism, diversity, gay rights, globalism, gun control and      civil rights,'' according to Baruch College professor Thomas      Main, who is writing a book on the movement. At the fringes      of the alt-right is where you find American neo-Nazis and the      Klan, two groups evidently thrilled by Trump's victory.       On the issue of Trump's presidency, we want to remain      patient as well as vigilant. We've said in prior editorials      that presidents get fresh starts and wide latitude to set      their agendas. Bannon helped Trump get elected, which makes      him more clever than the Democratic operatives who backed      Hillary Clinton, the losing presidential candidate. Maybe his      primary White House role is to be a sop to supporters and      that's all.       But Trump voters aren't the only Americans anxiously      waiting for positive signals from the new administration.      While Trump will never placate Democrats, there's another      crucial group we'll call America's middle third who need to      be assuaged. Many of them didn't vote for Trump but they may      make the biggest difference in the success of his presidency:      They'll either be won over or will bolt to the opposition.      Like every president, Trump will calibrate many of his      actions according to how far he can go without losing them.       That's always a tough balance. In today's America it's      especially tough. By adding someone as notorious as Bannon to      his team, the new president has more than sent the wrong      signal. He also has risked alienating the vast swath of      Americans who will determine whether his presidency succeeds      or fails. And he's done it well before even taking the oath      of office.
