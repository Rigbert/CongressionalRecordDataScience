 President, I rise today to oppose the budget reconciliation conference report. The conference report cuts total $39.7 billion versus the Senate proposed $34.6 billion. It reduces mandatory outlays for entitlement programs by relying heavily on added financial burdens on poor, working Americans.  This ``deficit-reduction'' effort of cuts in vital programs is offset by provisions soon to come which will provide $95 billion in additional tax cuts--including cuts to capital gains and dividends rates. The conference report will raise $39.7 billion while capital gains and dividends tax cuts passed by the House will reduce revenues by $20 billion over 5 years and $50 billion over 10 years. This strategy is clearly not reducing the deficit, and it does not justify cutting programs for the poor to benefit the wealthy.  This bill is just another step to further the Republican agenda of severely cutting benefits to working-class families while handing out tax cuts to the wealthy. The fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense appropriations conference report is another illustration of this--this bill contains a 1 percent across-the-board cut to discretionary programs totaling $8.6 billion in fiscal year 2006.  While Republican leaders had the opportunity to create significant savings in the conference report by reducing prescription drug costs and eliminating unnecessary payments to HMOs, they chose not to. This bill provides relief for special interests in exchange for greater burdens on poor, working families, welfare recipients, and children.  Here is an overview of who wins and who loses in this conference report.  The conference report fails to include provisions in the Senate bill that would have limited what Medicaid pays for prescription drugs. The Senate bill increased the minimum rebates that drug manufacturers are required to pay the Medicaid Program for drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. The Senate bill also applied the rebates to drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans. In total, the prescription drug provisions in the Senate bill would have saved $3.9 billion over 5 years and $10.5 billion over 10 years. The conference report eliminates all but a few hundred million of these cuts.  Although not in this bill, the drug industry scored another major victory in the fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense conference report by being handed broad liability protection even in instances of reckless disregard or gross negligence. This egregious provision protects drug companies even when there are criminal violations of FDA standards.  I think we can safely say this holiday season will be a merry one for the drug industry. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for poor and working Americans on Medicaid under this bill.  The conference report maintains the $10 billion Preferred Provider Organization, PPO, stabilization fund even though 52 Senators voted to eliminate it and the extremely strong showing of private health insurance participation in the Medicare prescription drug benefit obviates the need for it.  Even the independent, non-partisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, recommended, nearly unanimously, that the $10 billion stabilization fund be eliminated because it is unnecessary and unwarranted and provides an unfair competitive advantage to PPOs.  In total, the conference report contains $1.9 billion in increased copays and premiums for poor families and children in Medicaid. That is over 5 years. If you look at the 10-year figure, that amount jumps to $10.1 billion.  The Senate bill contained no such increases in premiums and copays.  In total, the conference report cuts $3 billion that will directly impact Medicaid beneficiaries.  What is going to happen to these families once they are required to pay possibly as much as 20 percent of the cost of each medication they take or 20 percent for each doctor visit with no annual limit on how much they have to pay out-of-pocket? They simply won't go to the doctor, they won't take their medications, or they will simply not enroll in Medicaid at all.  For those Medicaid beneficiaries who can no longer afford to stay enrolled in Medicaid or choose not to enroll, who wind up in an emergency room for their medical care, under this bill there is no limit on what they may be charged, other than a 10-percent limit of the cost of service for those who are between 100 percent and 150 percent of poverty, which is equivalent to between $9,570 and $14,355 of individual annual income.  As under the House-passed spending reconciliation bill, the conference report allows providers to deny a service if the patient has no ability to pay the charges at the time of services and States can terminate Medicaid coverage if the family cannot pay premiums.  The conference report allows States to provide any child, without regard to income, a lower benefits package than they have today. That means low-income children, no matter how poor they are, are no longer guaranteed vision screenings, eyeglass coverage, therapy services, and medical equipment that would allow them to attend school.  I am disappointed that the conference report eliminates a provision that Senator Hutchison and I worked hard to get included in the Senate bill which protects Medicaid adult day health care services in eight States: California, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington. In California alone, the elimination of this provision means that 47,000 seniors and disabled people are at risk of losing community-based health care services.  And why are they at risk? They are at risk because of aggressive actions by this administration to force California's adult day health care program into a 1915(c) Medicaid waiver which the State of California estimates will make 40 percent of currently eligible program participants ineligible for the services they receive today. These services include skilled nursing care, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, and nutrition services for low-income, frail elders and disabled adults.  The administration is pursuing this despite vocal, bipartisan opposition from California's Congressional Delegation. I ask unanimous consent toenter into the record two letters from the California delegation to the administration opposing a waiver.  Cuts to Federal student loan programs in the conference report will push college out of reach for many middle- and low-income families. The $12.7 billion reduction over 5 years, nearly one-third of the conference report's total cuts, will be the largest cut to student aid ever enacted.  This conference report makes it more expensive for students and their parents to borrow for college by increasing the interest rates and fees they pay on loans. At the same time, this bill protects private lenders at a higher cost to the Government.  This is being done as students and families are struggling to pay skyrocketing college costs. The average cost of attending a public university for 1 year in our country has increased 66 percent within the last decade.  Students will be forced to take out more loans to meet the cost of increasing tuition. This will only drive them greater into debt, making it even more expensive for students to pursue a college degree.  The conference report reauthorizes the TANF Program for 5 years despite overwhelming opposition in the Senate to including TANF reauthorization in budget reconciliation. The conference report contains drastically inadequate child care funding and will cost California approximately $350 million more annually as a result of changes to work participation requirements.  Lastly, I am deeply concerned about the impact this conference report will have on child welfare in California. This bill, like the House-passed bill, reduces Federal foster care supports that help grandparents and other relatives care for abused and neglected children. It also contains a provision overturning a 2003 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Rosales v. Thompson that may harm more than 4,400 foster kids in California alone.  Mr. President, the bill before us today represents a victory for special interests over the interests of our nation's poorest and most vulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Leavitt: As Senators representing      California, we are very concerned about the future of adult      day health care (ADHC) in California due to the recent      requirement imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid      Services (CMS) to convert the ADHC program to a 1915(c)      waiver. If implemented, this proposal would radically      diminish what services are provided. how the services are      delivered, and to which populations the services are      provided.       As you know, ADHC services manage disease and chronic      conditions; prevent and reduce hospitalizations, physician      and emergency department visits; and maintain or improve      health status while permitting the individual to retain      important community and familial contacts. The provision of      these services is qualitatively equivalent to those provided      in institutional long term care environments but less costly      than when the same services are provided in such settings.       California and seven other states have long been innovators      in providing ADHC services as an alternative to institutional      long-term care for the frail elderly and disabled. ADHC      services have been offered in California and the other states      as an optional state plan benefit under Medicaid since the      1970's, prior to the introduction of the 1915(c) home and      community based services waiver.       ADHC services are currently provided to 47,000 participants      in California, including the frail elderly, persons with      disabilities, persons with Alzheimer's disease and related      dementia, persons with developmental disabilities, persons      with psychological disabilities and those infected with HIV.       In 2003, CMS ordered California to remove ADHC services      from the state plan as an optional benefit and offer the      services through a 1915(c) waiver. CMS's stated rationale for      taking this action is that, despite the provision of these      services under Medicaid for more than two decades, they are      not defined in the federal statute and therefore must be      stopped.       Unfortunately, transposing ADHC into a waiver would deny      access to these services to many of those within the      currently served populations. It is estimated that the      transition to a waiver would leave approximately 40 percent      without ADHC services in California due to the restrictive      rules governing 1915(c) waivers.       While seven other states also offer ADHC services as an      optional state plan benefit under Medicaid, it is our      understanding that to date none of those states have been      requested to transform their ADHC services into a waiver. Yet      the policies your agency is pursuing make those states      vulnerable to the same consequences that are anticipated      in California.       The action by CMS, attempting to reinvent a program that      has worked for more than 25 years and saves the Medicaid      program money, is totally contrary to your own stated      interest in reducing the institutional bias in Medicaid and      encouraging the use of community-based services. Further, it      occurs as CMS is launching a new demonstration program in      Medicare to allow beneficiaries access to ADHC under the home      health benefit.       At a time when both your Administration and the National      Governors' Association have identified Medicaid's      institutional bias as a serious policy problem and are      examining options for enhancing home and community-based      care, it is puzzling that CMS's Medicaid program is moving in      the opposite direction by proposing to dismantle existing      ADHC programs and force them into waivers, thereby      undermining their effectiveness. Maintaining ADHC services as      an optional Medicaid benefit would be consistent with the      Administration's New Freedom Initiative and the United States      Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, which give priority to the      provision of services at home and in the community,       We urge you to withdraw CMS's attempt to overturn existing      Medicaid policy and thus continue Medicaid beneficiaries'      uninterrupted access to ADHC services in California and other      affected states. We look forward to your response.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein.     Barbara Boxer.                                  ____                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.     Michael O. Leavitt,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington, DC.
