 President, today the Senate passed the United States-Chile and the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Acts. This is the first time in our history that the Senate has approved two free trade agreements in a single day. The fact that we were able to achieve this goal is a testament not only to the high quality of these agreements, but also to the power of Trade Promotion Authority.  It was almost a year ago today that the House and Senate gave final approval to the conference report for the Trade Act of 2002. This historic piece of legislation empowered the President, for the first time in almost a decade, to negotiate free trade agreements utilizing Trade Promotion Authority procedures. Today, with the passage of these two agreements, we are using TPA to take some of our first steps toward re-engaging the world through international trade. It is a welcome development.  International trade has long been one of the most important foreign policy and economic tools in our Nation's arsenal. It was a key component of our post-World War II international economic strategy. For over 50 years international trade contributed to stability and economic growth throughout the world. It helped to lift the nations of Europe and Asia out of the ashes of World War II. And it helped America experience unprecedented prosperity here at home.  International trade can play a similar role at the beginning of the twenty-first century. That is part of what Trade Promotion Authority is all about. Trade Promotion Authority represents a partnership between the executive and legislative branches of government. It provides the President with Congressional support so he can negotiate the best trade agreements for America's workers. It provides certainty to our trading partners that any agreement reached will get timely consideration and will not be ripped apart by the U.S. Congress. In exchange for the authority to negotiate, Congress requires intense consultation and notification procedures. It provides a legislative check on the President's ability to negotiate. And it provides greater certainty to Congress that its intent is being followed. The success of these procedures can be seen by the strong support these two agreements enjoy today.  With our votes today we are locking in two strong trade agreements with our two strongest international trade allies, Chile and Singapore. With the passage of these agreements, we send a strong message to the world that the United States is back in the game.  These bills would not have been possible without the able assistance of many people. First, I want to acknowledge the leadership of President George W. Bush and our United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Zoellick. Their stalwart commitment to expanding export opportunities for America's farmers and workers was a major factor in passing Trade Promotion Authority last year and in concluding these two agreements.  I would also like to take a moment to thank some of those individuals in the Senate who helped to make this historic day possible. First, I want to thank my colleagues on the Finance Committee, especially the Ranking Member, Mr. Baucus. Working together, we demonstrated that international trade is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, but rather an issue that works for all Americans.  Next, I would like to thank my Finance Committee staff who has worked hard over the summer to get the implementing bills drafted and the materials ready so that we could consider these agreements before the August recess. It was no easy task, and I appreciate their hard work and dedication.  First and foremost, I want to thank my Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Kolan Davis, whose ability to manage multiple legislative priorities is a key factor to the success of the Finance Committee's work. I also would like to thank my Chief International Trade Counsel, Everett Eissenstat, who successfully coordinated the efforts of the Finance Committee trade staff to enable us to move this legislation quickly. I also want to recognize the rest of my trade team, Carrie Clark, Zach Paulsen, David Johanson, Nova Daly, Stephen Schaefer and CathyMcKinnell. This group sacrificed many long hours to bring these agreements to fruition. Without their hard work and dedication, our success today would not have been possible.  Mr. Baucus had a good staff helping him as well and I would like to take a moment and thank them for their efforts. I thank Senator Baucus' Staff Director, Jeff Forbes, and General Counsel, William Dauster. I also appreciate the work of his trade staff led by the Chief International Trade Counsel, Tim Punke, along with Shara Aranoff, John Gilliland, Brian Pomper and Lara Birkes.  A sincere thank you also must be given to Polly Craighill from the office of the Senate Legislative Counsel, for her patience and expertise in drafting this legislation. She is truly a valued part of this institution, and her knowledge of the law and devotion to task is without equal.  We can all be proud of today's accomplishments. I look forward to President Bush signing these two bills into law.                          ____________________
