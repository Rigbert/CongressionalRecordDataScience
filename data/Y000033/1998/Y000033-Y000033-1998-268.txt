Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for consideration of the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 856.  The proposed open rule is consistent with the process which is followed by the Committee on Resources in the development of this bill to resolve the United States political status problem with Puerto Rico.  This was an effort to reach out and include as many sectors as possible in a fair manner in which the facts were openly aired and examined without respect to special interests or local political considerations.  I can confirm that as the chairman of the House committee of jurisdiction for territorial affairs, the committee followed and completed every legislative step in the development of this initiative during the past 4 years from 1995 to the present time.  Five extensive hearings with the broadest participation possible were held in Washington and Puerto Rico. Testimony was heard from individuals with many different views on the future relationship of Puerto Rico and the United States. Special attention was given to allow the three principal parties in Puerto Rico, each representing the status of commonwealth, independence, or statehood, to present their preferred definition with their respective status options.  Subsequent deliberations by Members of Congress were complete and exhaustive. All the issues have been raised and debated.  Once Members examined the complexity of the problems, they realized that this bill is the most viable way to address the problems facing the United States due to failure to permanently resolve Puerto Rico's status.  The bill's self-determination process in H.R. 856 is a carefully crafted three-stage process, a three-stage process leading to full self-government for Puerto Rico as a separate sovereign nation or a State of the Union if the majority of the people are ready to change the current form of local self-government as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.                              {time}  1100  Congress and the Americans of Puerto Rico will be required to vote in each of the three stages of the bill. I want to stress that. Congress and the Americans of Puerto Rico will be required to vote in each of the three stages of the bill, an initial referendum, a 10-year transition plan, and the final implementation act. If there is no majority for change, then the status quo continues and United States citizens of Puerto Rico are consulted again by referendum at least once every 10 years.  The Committee on Resources overwhelmingly approved and reported it twice, first in the 104th Congress and now in the 105th Congress. I firmly believe it is appropriate and necessary for the full House to now consider the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 856.  In carrying out congressional responsibilities under the Constitution for territories, Congress will be able to directly respond to the request of the Legislature of Puerto Rico to the 105th Congress to define the status choices and authorize a process to resolve Puerto Rico's political status dilemma. I support this rule, and I will discuss in debate the merits of all amendments that come before us.  I want my colleagues to understand this is nothing new. This is a project I worked on, my committee has worked on, the people of Puerto Rico have worked on for the last 4 years. It is time to act. It is time for this Congress, this House, to pass this legislation for America, for the people of Puerto Rico. This rule is a good rule, and I urge passage of the rule but, more than that, the defeat of some amendments and final passage of this legislation, long overdue for the people of Puerto Rico.
