Speaker, I rise today to proudly submit the Urban Agriculture Production Act.  Across America, too many of our urban neighborhoods are absent stores where community members can purchase fresh, healthy foods. There are more than 23 million individuals residing in these so called ``food desert'' neighborhoods, where there are no stores within one mile in which they can buy healthy food.  Without healthy options, people are forced to eat unhealthy, processed, junk food, because that is all that is available and affordable. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is a step to correct this unacceptable trend.  I am pleased to recognize and support the growing resurgence of locally grown and produced product. I see it in my own community at the Sustainable Local Foods and Frederick Douglass Center Association Community Garden, of Toledo, Ohio.  Individuals, non-profits, and co-ops are stepping up and taking action to address the challenge of access to healthy food, by developing local food sources and community gardens to provide fresh, affordable produce throughout underserved communities. Not only are they growing product to provide to communities though, they are engaging and encouraging community participation all throughout the process. They are teaching community members how to farm.  As the ancient proverb says, ``give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' And so goes my bill, the Urban Agriculture Production Act.  The measure will encourage economic development in underserved communities by furthering the mission of local farming. It provides programmatic funds to educate people on health and wellness, supports marketing and development networks, and will inspire communities to create self sufficient food production systems to stimulate community development and healthy eating options.  All throughout our urban communities there are an abundance of unused land and space that are conveniently located to neighborhoods that are ripe for agriculture development. We must support and encourage the means to development these plots so they become local sources of wholesome food options.  Communities that lack access to fresh produce are facing growing epidemics of obesity related diseases. We must get serious about the increased incidents of preventable disease in these communities. Prevention is paramount, and encouraging a balanced diet while also providing access to healthier foods is an obvious solution.  Farmer's Markets, greenhouses and other community agriculture initiatives can help diversify American food production so we rely less on imports and create American jobs that cannot be outsourced. My bill will spur the development and expansion of community agriculture in nontraditional agricultural production areas across this great nation.  Mr. Speaker, urban farming and food production is a viable solution to support healthier dietary options and improve overall health of urban communities. The Urban Agriculture Production Act is the appropriate means to further develop alternative, urban agricultural production and to help meet all communities' food production needs of the future.                          ____________________
