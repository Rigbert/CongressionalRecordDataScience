Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, this merely moves offshore what this bill bans in the United States. What it will do is create a huge financial incentive for those people and companies in foreign countries to take advantage of Americans. I do not think that we should be giving foreign companies that kind of financial advantage. If it is wrong to do here, we should prohibit the importation of these materials.
