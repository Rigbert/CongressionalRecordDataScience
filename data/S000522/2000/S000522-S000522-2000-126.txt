Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Relations for his very kind words; the feeling is mutual and the respect is mutual.  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply grateful that the House is meeting today to consider H.R. 3244, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 which I introduced last year along with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), and a number of other bipartisan cosponsors.  Before discussing the merits of the legislation, I would like to point out that the bill now has 36 cosponsors, 18 Democrats and 18 Republicans. Among the Republican cosponsors are the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the distinguished majority leader, who last year gave us a very firm commitment that this bill would be brought to the floor because of the egregious nature of the situation that we are facing; the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority whip; the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the chairman of the Committee on International Relations who just spoke; the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley), the chairman of the Committee on Commerce; and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Canady), the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution. The Democratic cosponsors include not only the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson), the distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations, but also the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), and the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney), my friend and the ranking member on my subcommittee.  Another index of the broad support for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is that it has both the support of Charles Colson and Gloria Steinem, of the Family Research Council and of Equality Now; of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, as well as the National Association of Evangelicals.  In crafting this legislation, we have also had the assistance of impartial experts, such as Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, Gary Haugen of the International Justice Mission, which goes out and rescues trafficked women and children one-by-one. I especially want to thank Grover Joseph Rees, the chief counsel and chief of staff of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, for his remarkable skill in helping to craft this measure and, in like manner, I would like to thank David Abramowitz, the chief counsel for the Minority staff, who has done tremendous work on it as well. I would also like to thank Dr. Laura Lederer of the Protection Project whose painstaking research has been indispensable in ensuring that we have the facts about this worldwide criminal enterprise and its victims.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, in testimony at a Helsinki Commission sexual trafficking hearing that I chaired on June 28, Dr. Lederer told the story of Lydia. Lydia's story, she told us, is an amalgamation of several true stories of women and girls who have been trafficked in Eastern Europe in recent years.                              {time}  1245  Lydia was 16 and hanging around with friends on streets, she told us. You can fill in the name of the country here, the Ukraine, Russia, Rumania, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, when they were approached by an older, beautifully dressed woman who befriended them and told them they were so nice looking she could get them a part-time job in modeling.  She took them to dinner, bought them some small gifts, and when the dinner was over she invited them back to her home for a drink. Taking the drink is the last thing that Lydia remembers. The woman drugged her and handed her and her friends over to an agent who drove them, unconscious, across the border. Here you can fill in another set of countries, be it Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, some Middle Eastern countries, even as far as Japan, Canada, and of course, the United States.  When Lydia awoke she was alone in a strange room in a foreign country. Her friends were gone. A while later a man came into the room and told her that she now belonged to him. I own you, he said. You are my property. You will work for me until I say stop. Don't try to leave. You have no papers. You have no passport. You don't speak the language in this country. He told her if she tried to escape his men would come in after her and beat her and bring her back. He told her that her family back home was in danger. He told her that she owed the agency $35,000, which she would work off in a brothel by sexually servicing men, sometimes 10 to 20 men a day.  Stunned, angry, rebellious, Lydia refused. The man then hit her. He beat her. He raped her. He sent friends in to gang rape her. She was left in the room alone without food or water for 3 days. Frightened and broken, she succumbed. For the next 6 months she was held in virtual confinement and forced to prostitute herself. She received no money. She had no hope of escape.  She was rescued when the brothel was raided by local police. They arrested the young women and charged them with working without a visa. They arrested the brothel manager and charged him with procuration, but he was later released. They did not attempt to arrest the brothel owners or to identify the traffickers.  The girls were interviewed, and those who were not citizens of the country were charged as illegal aliens and transferred to a woman's prison where they awaited deportation.  A medical examiner found that Lydia had several sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, she was addicted to a potent cough syrup, and she was physically weak. She was spiritually broken. There was no one to speak for Lydia. She feared the future because she knew her keepers. They had the networks, the power, the resources to track her down, kidnap her, and bring her back again.  The risk is low so the potential profits are high, and girls like Lydia are the real target. There seems to be no one who cares about Lydia's life. The authorities do not have an interest in tracking down the organizations or the individuals in this trafficking chain, from the woman who drugged Lydia to the agent who brought her across the border to the agent who broke her will to the brothel managers and to the brothel owners.  In addition, there are corrupt law enforcement officers involved, because the process of getting Lydia across the borders and keeping the brothels running involves payoffs to local visa officials and police in the country of origin, border patrols for both countries, and local police in the destination countries. Lydia is without protection. The traffickers have bought theirs.  Now, think of Lydia's story multiplied by hundreds of thousands and you get the picture of the scope of the problem. UNICEF is estimating that 1 million children are forced into prostitution in southeast Asia alone, another 1 million worldwide. These are just children. An estimated 250,000 women and children from Russia, the newly-independent States, and Eastern Europe are trafficked into Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Canada, and the U.S. each and every year.  An estimated 20,000 children from Central American countries, and this is a new figure from the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery,are being trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation up through Central America and into the United States.  Mr. Speaker, on an OSCE human rights trip to St. Petersburg last July, my wife Marie and I, joined by several other Members, met with Dr. Juliette Engel of MiraMed Institute, an NGO dedicated to helping women exploited by trafficking. We met with girls and young women who told us their heartbreaking stories of their captivity.  Dr. Engel's group has supported H.R. 3244 and points out that, unfortunately for Russian girls, sexual trafficking is the most profitable of all the criminal enterprises. Estimates are as high as $4 billion last year, because unlike one-time sales of weapons and narcotics, women can be sold over and over again. Dreams are shattered, she writes, families are broken apart, lives are destroyed.  Mr. Speaker, our legislation, H.R. 3244, has attracted such broad support not only because it is pro-women, pro-child, pro-human rights, pro-family values, and anticrime, but because it addresses a problem that absolutely cries out for a solution.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act focuses on the most severe forms of trafficking in human beings: on the buying and selling of children into the international sex industry, on sex trafficking of women and children alike by force, fraud, or coercion, and on trafficking into slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor.  Each year, as many as 2 million innocent victims, of whom the overwhelming majority of are women and children, are brought by force and/or fraud into the international commercial sex industry.  Efforts by the U.S. Government, international organizations, and others to stop this brutal practice have thus far proved, unfortunately, unsuccessful. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that instances of forcible and/or fraudulent sexual trafficking are far more numerous than just a few years ago.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say a couple of final points. Part of the problem is that current laws and enforcement strategies in the U.S. and other countries often punish the victims more severely than they punish the perpetrators. When a sex-for hire establishment is raided, the women and sometimes children in the brothel are typically deported if they are not citizens of the country in which the establishment is located, without reference to whether their participation was voluntary or involuntary, and without reference to whether they will face retribution or other serious harm upon return.  This not only inflicts further cruelty on the victims, it also leaves nobody to testify against the real criminals, and frightens other victims from coming forward.  My legislation, Mr. Speaker, seeks the elimination of slavery and particularly sex slavery by a comprehensive, balanced approach of prevention, prosecution and enforcement, and victim protection.  The central principle behind the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is that criminals who knowingly operate enterprises that profit from sex acts involving persons who had been brought across international boundaries for such purposes by force or fraud, or who force human beings into slavery, should receive punishments commensurate with the penalties for kidnapping and forcible rape. That means up to life imprisonment. Putting these gangsters away for life would not only be just punishment but also a powerful deterrent, and the logical corollary of this principle is that we need to treat victims of these terrible crimes as victims who desperately need protection.  Let me just say, this bill needs to be passed, Mr. Speaker and it needs to be passed today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
