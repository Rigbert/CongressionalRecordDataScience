 President, let me say in response to the colloquy we just heard that it used to be the assistant majority leader's view that, as he put it, if you don't want to fight fires, don't become a firefighter, and if you don't want to cast tough votes, don't come to the Senate. Obviously, those days have changed.  What really happened over the last week is the refusal to have an open amendment process, the refusal to treat both sides the same.
