Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Raymond Magnon, who passed away in California on Monday, April 24, 2017. Raymond, or Ray as he was known to friends and family, proudly served our nation as a plane mechanic in the Air Force during the Korean War and he will be deeply missed.  Ray was born to Frank and Caroline Magnon in Niles, Ohio. In 1944, when Ray was 14 years old, his family moved from Ohio to Riverside where he attended Poly High School, served in the Air Force as a plane mechanic during the Korean War, and later attended Chaffey College. After college, Ray worked at Lockheed and at a local fiberglass company. Shortly after Ray started his career working as an electrician, he would eventually start his own company, Service Electric. Over the years, Service Electric would provide the electrical construction for many notable buildings in the city of Riverside, including Tyler Mall. At one point in the 1970s the company was the largest electrical contractor in California, employing hundreds of electricians and staff.  Later in life, Ray ventured into commercial real estate development. In 1977, he founded The Magnon Companies which developed and built many of the buildings constructed in Riverside, including buildings in the Sycamore Canyon Business Park, Hunter Park, and other areas of the city. Ray also was responsible for the construction of several apartment buildings in Canyon Crest including Bunker Hill. Ray had many passions in life such as Formula 1 races, tennis, traveling to Europe, collecting sports cars, and a fondness for classic jazz and crooner songs. One of his strongest passions was being a business leader in the community and working to advance important causes for our region.  Ray is survived by his wife, Kelly Magnon, their son, Ryan Magnon and by his daughters from his previous marriage to Elaine Timmons Taber; Patti Oldham, Cheryl Cliff and Deanna Magnon. Ray was preceded in death by his son, Douglas Magnon. He is also survived by many loving grandchildren, nieces, nephews and step-children. I had the distinct privilege of knowing Ray for many years and I will deeply miss him. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Magnon family. Although Ray may be gone, his selfless dedication to our nation will long be remembered.                          ____________________
