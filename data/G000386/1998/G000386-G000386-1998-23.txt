 President, today, along with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, I am introducing the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1998. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, it is my responsibility to review federal court processes and procedures. Every two years or so, the Congress receives an official request from the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, that include changes in the law the Judicial Conference believes is necessary to improve the functioning of the courts.  After reviewing the latest official request from the Judicial Conference, Senator Durbin, who is the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I worked together in putting together a modification of this request to introduce as legislation. We are introducing this legislation today.  The bill contains four different titles including numerous changes in subjects such as judicial financial administration, judicial process improvements, judicial personnel administration, other personnel matters and federal public defenders. While many of these items may not be essential for the court system to operate, they will certainly help the system function better, and hopefully, more effectively.  Mr. President, it is my hope that we can consider this bill and pass it during these last few weeks of this Congress. I will work with Senator Durbin to try and make that happen. I urge my colleagues to support us in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2516       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
