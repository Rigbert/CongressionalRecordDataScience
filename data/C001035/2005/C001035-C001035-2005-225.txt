President, I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for his excellent statement. We have worked very hard on this issue for the past 3 years. It is my hope that our colleagues will recognize the work that has gone into this measure, whether it is coming up with a fair and balanced--I guess that phrase maybe has weight toward it--carefully crafted formula or whether it is the accountability measures that are in the bill that I also believe are so important. Another member of our committee who has been a stalwart supporter of the bill and has worked very hard in shaping many of its provisions from his perspective as a former mayor of a major city is our colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman. I am very pleased he is here to speak on behalf of the bill.
