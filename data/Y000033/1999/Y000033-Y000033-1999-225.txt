Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would address several matters of concern to Alaska Natives through an amendment to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).  As my colleagues know, ANCSA was enacted in 1971, stimulated by the need to address Native land claims as well as the desire to clear the way for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and thereby provide our country with access to the petroleum resources of Alaska's North Slope. As the years pass, issues arise which require amending that Act. The Resources Committee as a matter of course routinely considers such amendments and brings them before the House.  Consequently, I am introducing this bill containing several such amendments to ANCSA in order to facilitate having its provisions circulated during the upcoming Congressional recess through the Congress and the Administration as well as the State of Alaska for review and consideration.  This bill has nine provisions. One provision would allow common stock to be willed to adopted-out descendants and another would clarify the liability for contaminated lands. The clarification of contaminated land would declare that no person acquiring interest in land under this Act shall be liable for the costs of removal or remedial action, any damages, or any third party liability arising out or as a result of any contamination on that land at the time the land was acquired under this Act.                   Section 5. Alaska Native Veterans  Section 5 of the bill amends the Act further to allow equal access to Alaska Native Veterans who served in the military or other armed services during the Viet Nam war. Alaska Natives have faithfully answered the call of duty when asked to serve in the armed services. In fact, American Indians and Alaska Natives generally have the highest record of answering the call to duty.  Under the Native Allotment Act, Alaska natives were allowed to apply for lands which they traditionally used as fish camps, berry picking camps or hunting camps. However, many of our Alaska natives answered the call to duty and served in the services during the Viet Nam war and were unable to apply for their native allotment. This provision allows them to apply for their native allotments and would expand the dates to include the full years of the Viet Nam war. The original dates recommended by the Administration only allowed the dates January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971. Our Alaska Natives veterans should not be penalized for serving during the entire dates of the Viet Nam conflict. This provision corrects that inequity by expanding the dates to reflect all the years of the Viet Nam war--August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975.          Section 8. Elim Native Corporation Land Restoration  In 1917, the Norton Bay Reservation was established on 350,000 acres of land located on the north side of Norton Bay southeast of Nome, Alaska for the benefit of Alaska Natives who now reside in the village of Elim, Alaska. The purpose of the establishment of the reservation included providing a land, economic, subsistence, and resources base for the people of that area.  In 1929, through an Executive Order, 50,000 acres of land were deleted from the reservation with little consultation and certainly without the informed consent of the people who were to be most affected by such a deletion. After passage of ANCSA, only the remaining 300,000 acres of the original Reservation were conveyed to the Elim Native Corporation. This loss of land from the original Reservation has become over the years a festering wound to the people of Elim. It now needs to be healed through the restoration or replacement of the deleted fifty thousand acres of land to the Native Village Corporation authorized by ANCSA to hold such land.  As I am sure my colleagues will agree, the history of our nation reflects many examples of injustices to Native Americans. As hearings will confirm, this is one of those calls out to be sensibly remedied and can be with relative ease as outlined in this section of the bill.  Again, I am introducing this bill today to facilitate having its provisions circulated and reviewed during the August recess by the Department of the Interior, the State of Alaska and Alaska natives.                          ____________________
