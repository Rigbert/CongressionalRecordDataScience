President, the Senate Judiciary Committee moved expeditiously to consider Judge Henry Autrey despite the poor treatment of President Clinton's nominees in the same circumstances. I mention this because this vacancy is special. It is a vacancy to which Justice Ronnie White should have been confirmed. But in October of 1999, my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, marched from a closed-door meeting to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White, the first African American Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, after his nomination to the District Court had been kept waiting for 2 years--2 years here in the Senate; actually kept on the Executive Calendar pending for 9 months.  I mention this because, with all the unfair criticism of Majority Leader Daschle, who has been moving judges through at a much faster pace than was done prior to him becoming majority leader, I just want to contrast the difference between that action and the one on this nomination, where we are going to confirm Judge Autrey to the Federal bench in Missouri.  It shows, also, Senator Carnahan showed far more grace in helping us move this nominee forward.  I yield the floor.
