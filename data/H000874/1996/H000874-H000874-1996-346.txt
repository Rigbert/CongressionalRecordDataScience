Speaker, I rise today to honor the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, an organization which for years has been instrumental in the development of America's youth.  Through an array of programs, an expert staff, and a dedicated corps of volunteers, boys and girls clubs provide services to over 2 million children throughout this country. In doing so, boys and girls clubs instill in our Nation's children sound character and superior values. They provide a foundation from which the youth of today may become the leaders of tomorrow.  The future of America's children, however, remains precarious. In our society, children are confronted with the difficult task of overcoming many obstacles which threaten their development. Drugs and alcohol are ever present. Crime and violence are tragically abundant. Yet, Boys and Girls Clubs of America continued to steer children along the path of opportunity, hope, and success. For this I commend them. Their work is indeed a testament to what's right with America.  On September 20, 1995, Mr. Arnold Burns delivered remarks before a congressional breakfast which honored the Boys and Girls Clubs' Youth of the Year finalist. His comments were clearly indicative of the boys and girls clubs' commitment to serving our country's children. In recognition of this outstanding service, I respectfully submit that his remarks be entered into the Record.                      1995 Congressional Breakfast                         (By Senator Thurmond)       Representative Steny Hoyer, Mr. George Grune, the Chairman      of the Board, Mr. Robbie Callaway, the Senior Vice President,      Melvin Laird, Arnold Burns, one of the outstanding lawyers of      this nation, Judge Freeh, all of the distinguished guests,      and ladies and gentlemen, I'm very honored to be here on this      occasion. Now, as a Senator, there are a lot of events you      are asked to attend. I'm always pleased to attend this      breakfast. It's the twelfth year.       I'm a strong believer in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.      There's no more important resource than our children. Boys &      Girls Clubs of America work to help protect and promote that      resource. This is an organization that is making a difference      in the lives of tens of thousands of at risk teens. It      provides parks and recreational activities, a safe haven from      the mean streets, teaches kids the importance of work and      responsibility, works to get kids into schools, into jobs,      off welfare roles, out of public housing and away from the      temptations of a life of crime.       The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is an organization on the      move, serving more children each year. Thirteen years ago,      they served approximately one million kids. This year, they      are serving more than 2.2 million boys and girls. More than      1,700 clubs are in the United States. Last year, they      averaged an opening of one new club every three days. This is      a group that seeks continued growth. By the year 2001, the      Boys & Girls Clubs of America aims to have 1,000 new clubs, 1      million new members, over 3 million kids involved in      productive activities.       The Boys & Girls Clubs of America is one of the most      effective organizations in the nation for supporting our      children. It is an organization worthy of the support of      everyone in this room. As members of Congress, we are in the      position to help the Boys & Girls Clubs and our children. We      can support legislation that is beneficial to the Boys &      Girls Clubs. One example is the current crime bill. The Boys      & Girls Clubs of America is seeking 100 million dollars out      of the crime bill over the next five years. The Board of      Directors of the Boys & Girls Clubs will match that 100      million from the crime bill. That is 200 million dollars      pumped directly into the future of our nation's children.       By attending this breakfast, each of you is demonstrating      your support for a worthwhile cause. I urge you to continue      to help the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. You can do nothing      more worthy. We are proud of the Boys & Girls Clubs of      America and we're going to keep on working to make it bigger      and stronger every year. Good luck, God bless you and God      bless the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and God bless our      country.                        congressman steny hoyer       One problem with the Strom and Steny show is that I have to      follow Strom Thurmond. Thurmond and Hoyer, that sounds like a      good name for a firm at some point in time. Strom's show has      been running a lot longer than mine, as you know, but I'm      always amazed at the energy, his commitment and the verve      that he brings to life and the endeavors which he      undertakes. And Senator, I want you to know what an honor      and privilege it is to co-chair this breakfast on a      continuing basis with you. George Grune, your leadership      is critically important. General Burns, you've seen      General Burns up here, he looks a lot like Colin Powell. I      asked him if he was running for President. He's got those      four stars on his lapel, here. I'm sure it's got to have      something to do with that. He is outranked, of course, at      his table by Secretary Laird and the Secretary is keeping      him in line, luckily, so they'll be peaceful. Pete Silas,      thank you for all you've done and your leadership. We look      forward to working with you on a continuing basis. My      friend, Robbie Callaway. I think we ought to give Robbie      Callaway a big round of applause for the outstanding      leadership he brings to this effort on a regular basis.      Ken Gordon is here today, too.       Six or seven of the top law enforcement officials in our      nation are here. We have Louis Freeh and a group of his      distinguished colleagues. They're the ones who lock up and      help convict those who break the laws in our     country, to keep our communities and streets and schools      safe. That's their job. We ask them to do that. They're      people that sometimes themselves risk their life and limb to      do so. They're here this morning and I reflect on why and      what message that brings us. They're here because unless      parents and Boys & Girls Clubs leaders and other youth      leaders all over this country do their job, they know they      can't lock up enough people. God bless them and you ladies      and gentlemen of the Boys & Girls Club, God bless you.      Senator Thurmond is correct because you do God's work.       This is the first line of defense. This is the first line      in a battle we all must wage if we are to stop the crime and      the violence and the drugs from taking over our streets--our      children. And that, ladies and gentlemen is what it's all      about.       I am very, very proud to be here with two people who      symbolize what is the first line and the best line and      ultimately the line that will get us to where we need to be--     two parents who all America, and indeed all the world      applauded just a few days ago.       Lou Gehrig had the kind of character that all the world      would admire. Let us thank God that his record was equaled      and surpassed by another individual who had the character of      which we can all be proud and say, ``He was worthy of Lou      Gehrig''. But, why was it so? It was so because Vi and Cal      Ripken Sr. gave him the leadership and the character and the      understanding that gave him the will and the strength of      character to persevere in the face of pain, the face of      frustration, the face of being tired. We all get tired. Cal      Ripken, Jr. rose and he said, effectively, ``My Dad and Mom      said to go to work every day and do the best you can.'' Is      there a more powerful, potent message to be given to young      people than that message? God bless Vi and Cal Ripken, Sr.      We're proud of you and proud of what you've done. By the way,      they're from Maryland.       I know if you'll allow me four more minutes, I will close      with this. I hope all of you have read the books left for      you. There is a young woman sitting at my table who is      typical of all of the young people we come here today to      honor. She's a success story. Not just the kind of success      story we read about every day, but also a success story of      the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. She's from Dallas.      She's a young woman. She's an African American woman and a      true success story. Read her quote. She says, ``I am proud      to tell my story. One of struggle and hardship, but also      one of triumph and achievement.'' LaWanda Jones, that's      what it's all about because, there are a lot of young      people who don't have a Vi and Cal to lift them up, to      nurture them, to protect them, to give them the kind of      internal mechanism and compass that they need to succeed.       And so, as Todd Green said, one word came to mind when he      thinks of Boys & Girls Clubs, and that's ``family * * *      family''. All of us are extended family for an awful lot of      young people who need the kind of nurturing and caring and      courage given by Cal and Vi to Cal, Jr. Each of you in this      room is a part of that caring family of America that      ultimately will be the difference. Not the government, it      won't happen in government. Government can help. I am one who      believes that government needs to be a partner. I'm one who      believes that we need to marshall our resources in the form      of, yes, paying taxes and applying those to good efforts.      But, in the final analysis, we will not solve the problems of      making sure America's future is secure and the security of      our young people is assured if it's not through our families      and through us, individually, caring for our young people.      That's what Boys & Girls Clubs of America do. Brooke Kersey      said, ``In good times and bad times, the Boys & Girls Clubs      have been my life line.'' You do God's work. I am proud to be      a part of all of you. Thank you.                      ``captain'' arnold i. burns       Good morning. Thank you very much for your kind invitation.      I'm delighted to be here with the distinguished members of      law enforcement community mentioned by Congressman Hoyer.       I've come today to make some important arrests. I've come      to arrest crime and I've come to arrest violence, to arrest      the drug epidemic, to arrest teenage pregnancies, to arrest      alcoholism, to arrest youth gangs. One thing responsible      people in the law enforcement business have come to know, and      know very well, and Steny made this point, and that is that      law enforcement alone cannot solve our societal problems. We      have come to believe it and to espouse the old adage that an      ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We know that in      order to make our streets safer and more secure, we must work      with organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America.       We need more programs for the young people of this nation      of ours--programs like the tried and proven initiatives that      have earned Boys & Girls Clubs the reputation as the positive      place for kids. These programs help young people to resist      the peer and other pressures that lead to substance abuse, to      say ``no'' to drugs, ``no'' to alcohol, to say ``no'' to      teenage premature sex and to say ``no'' to gangs.       We need more Boys & Girls Clubs which keep kids coming back      day after day and year after year under professional, adult      supervision to learn how to get up in the morning, to show up      on time for an interview, to find employment, to develop good      work habits and to become a reliable and important part of      the work force. Boys & Girls Clubs of America programs      literally save hundreds of thousands of kids from harm and      destruction each year. It is these programs that keep kids      from harm and destruction each year. It is these programs      that keep kids out of our courtrooms and out of jail. It is      these programs that prepare kids to become productive and      participating citizens in the mainstream of our society. It      is these programs which makes our kids producers of tax      dollars and not consumers of tax dollars as wards of the      State or as welfare participants. Boys & Girls Clubs of      America save billions of dollars, multi-billions of dollars      of our tax dollars, because the cost of prevention pales      beside the cost of cure, particularly as the cure      rehabilitation so rarely works.       So, my department, today, is issuing an APB--an all points      bulletin--to the 1680 boys & girls clubs facilities across      our nation--reach out--reach out for more kids. Ten years      ago, boys & girls clubs served 1,000,000 kids. Today, over      2,220,000 kids. Tomorrow--within the next few years--     3,000,000 kids. No alibis.       We in law enforcement will continue to investigate,      apprehend, prosecute, convict and incarcerate those who slip      through the prevention net. We would like--no, we need, no,      we must have your help--your continued top flight work, to      cut potential miscreants off at the pass and bypass the      criminal justice process entirely by opting for good and      productive citizenship early. I close by congratulating our      ``Youth of the Year'' finalists: Jason Reese, Russell      Roberson, Fernando Pantoja, Michael Smith and Michael      Lampkins. Each of them personifies the success boys and girls      clubs can achieve in providing youngsters with a real      alternative to life on the streets.       We will continue our work, you continue yours--ours must be      a partnership, a collaboration. Together, we can make America      a better place for all.                          ____________________
