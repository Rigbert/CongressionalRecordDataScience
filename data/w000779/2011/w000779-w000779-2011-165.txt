President, I rise today with Senator Grassley to introduce the Medicare Data Access for Transparency and Accountability Act. I would like to begin by thanking my friend and esteemed colleague for his unwavering commitment to greater transparency and accountability in government. This Medicare DATA Act advances that goal.  Sunshine continues to be the greatest disinfectant. In that light, the Medicare DATA Act ensures all taxpayers have access to the Medicare Claims Database, both to aid them in making medical decisions, and in understanding what their money is paying for in this vital, yet enormous, health program. Making this information public will also help prevent wasteful spending and outright fraud in Medicare claims. The Medicare Claims Database is an important resource for public and private stakeholders as it captures healthcare provider payment and claims information for roughly 1/3 of the United States healthcare system. But why isn't this information already available?  In 1978, the Department of Health Education and Welfare attempted to release this information, upon request, under the premise that accessibility to the source data was in the public interest and therefore should be made available for public consumption. An injunction by a Florida court, however, successfully blocked that public disclosure of this information. As a result, this data has been--with limited exceptions made for government employees, contractors, and researchers willing to pay for partial access--off limits for the last three decades. Passage of the Medicare DATA Act puts an end to that practice.  I consider hiding information affecting the American taxpayer that clearly should be in the public domain, to be indefensible in a free society. With this principle in mind, I join with Senator Grassley in changing ``business as usual.''  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that Medicare data is finally fully transparent and available to Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this effort.                                 ______                                       By
