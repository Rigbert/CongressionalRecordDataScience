 President, I rise this evening in very strong support of my friend Ronald Gould's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This has been a long hard-fought battle and I commend him for his patience, perseverance, and persistence. We made it, Ron. Congratulations!  Let me share with my colleagues some of the special things about Ronald Gould that make him a person I was proud to recommend to the President for a seat on the Federal bench. He has personally supported me in my political career and helped others to believe in me. Ron is an excellent lawyer, a strong advocate for the legal profession, a community booster, a dedicated family man, a Distinguished Eagle Scout, and a man who has overcome much in his personal life to continue to be all of these things. I am honored to have been a part of his journey to the Federal bench.  I would like to highlight some of Mr. Gould's personal history. He married his wife Suzanne more than 30 years ago, and they have two children. their 23-year-old son Daniel, who is also an Eagle Scout, is a jazz saxophone performer and technology student who recently graduated from Stanford University and founded his own Internetstartup business. Their 20-year-old daughter Rebecca is a sophomore at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. Rebecca was selected for the Seattle ``High School Hall of Fame'' for her courage in conquering challenges following an auto accident in which she was seriously injured.  Mr. Gould also has been supported in this and all other endeavors of his life by his mother, Sylvia Gould. She is an active 81-year old walker and swimmer who justifiably takes some credit for her son's accomplishments since she encouraged him to do well in school and succeed as a Boy Scout.  Mr. Gould graduated the Wharton School of Business and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in economics. He received his J.D. degree in May 1973, graduating magna cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School where he won academic awards and served as editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review. During law school he received the Abram Sempliner Memorial Award for legal excellence, the Henry Bates Memorial Scholarship, and the Order of the Coif.  After law school, Mr. Gould served as a law clerk for Judge Wade McCree on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He next served as a law clerk for Justice Potter Stewart at the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1974 term.  Since December 1975, Mr. Gould has practiced law as an associate and then as a partner with Seattle's largest firm, Perkins Coie. He has had a varied civil litigation practice, including litigation in antitrust, banking, director and officer liability, and trade secrets. Mr. Gould is highly respected in his field and has worked for many of our region's most influential companies and constituencies.  Mr. Gould's fellow lawyers in the King County Bar Association honored him with the 1987 Award for Distinguished Service to the Legal Profession and Public. He was elected to the Board of Governors of the Washington State Bar Association for 1988-91 and served as President of the Washington State Bar Association for its 1994-95 term. Also, as President-Elect and as President of the Washington State Bar Association, Ron co-founded with Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire a project to implement mediation in Washington State high schools to prevent youth violence. This program teaches young people how to avoid the kind of tragedies our nation has seen too much of in recent years.  Mr. Gould shares my commitment to public education. He has served Bellevue Community College as a trustee from 1993 to the present and was elected chair of the Board of Trustees in 1996.  In addition, Mr. Gould has served as a member of several legal delegations under the People to People Citizen Ambassador Program, founded by President Eisenhower and supported by Presidents since as a means of enhancing international personal diplomacy and goodwill. He has participated in legal delegations to eastern Asia, Tokyo, and Eastern Europe.  Mr. Gould's long and consistent leadership service to the Boy Scouts has been well-recognized. He became an Eagle Scout in 1962. He serves on the executive board of the Chief Seattle Council of Boy Scouts of America, which serves over 40,000 youth and participating adult leaders. Mr. Gould has served as vice president for Programs, vice president for Exploring, vice president for Special Events and chair of the Jamboree Committee. In 1995, he received the Silver Beaver Award for Chief Seattle Council, the highest award given to volunteer leaders. In 1998, he received from Boy Scouts of America the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, reflecting decades of service to scouting and his profession.  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their decision to support Mr. Gould's confirmation unanimously. Again, I am proud of Ron and look forward to seeing him serve justice as a circuit court judge. I have no doubt he will carry his commitment to the profession and to the larger community to the federal bench and be one of our outstanding Ninth Circuit judges.                          ____________________
