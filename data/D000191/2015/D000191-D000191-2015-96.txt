Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern about the condition of our bridges, and I have spent, as I spoke earlier tonight, a lot of time on that issue and, in fact, opposed the so-called stimulus bill because of the lack of investment in infrastructure, particularly bridges.  But in this case, I think perhaps there are some drafting errors in the amendment because it would preclude using these funds for rest areas, which I think is problematic.  We have a crisis in terms of safe places for people to pull over, both commercial truck drivers and individuals. So I assume that the gentlewoman did not mean to preclude the use for rest areas.  Also, I don't know Missouri well, but I know in the West, actually, we have used these landscaping funds when we do new construction or significant construction to reduce maintenance costs because we have high wildfire danger in the West and, if you can plant, basically, natives that will dominate, that are not tall, are not fire-prone, then you don't have to go in and mow two or three times a year in case some idiot throws their cigarette or cigar out of the car and starts a catastrophic forest fire.  So, actually, leaving the discretion to the States to use these funds in that way, depending upon their conditions, I think is important.  There have been a couple of instances in past bills where they went overboard with this kind of stuff. I think the current restrictions on the program are such--and there is no mandate for the projects like resurfacing or anything else that is new construction. And doing it, as appropriate, to state ``and including rest areas.''  I think, because of all those things, I reluctantly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
