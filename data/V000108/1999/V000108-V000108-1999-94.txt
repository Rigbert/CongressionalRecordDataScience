Speaker, It is with great pleasure that I congratulate St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana, as it celebrates its 85th Anniversary as a parish this Sunday. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Reverend Jovan Todorovich on this glorious occasion.  On November 20th, St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Church will open its 85th Anniversary celebration at 9:30 a.m. at the church. Reverend Todorovich will begin with a liturgy, followed by a blessing of a new icon painting, and a Parastos, or ceremony for the dead. Beginning at noon in the church's small banquet hall in Hobart, Indiana, the celebration will continue with a Pomen ceremony, a wreath laying, taps, and a service by the American Legion in honor of all veterans from St. Sava's congregation. A banquet will be served at 1:00 p.m. in the main hall in Hobart. Entertainment will be provided by Drina Tamburitza, and Nikola P. Kostich will be the guest speaker at this gala occasion. Nikola Kostich is an attorney from Milwaukee and is the lead counsel for the Serbian Republic and for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  A church of humble beginnings, St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Church was founded in 1914 in Gary, Indiana by about 200 immigrant families. Today, it is home to 625 families. During the past 85 years, the congregation at St. Sava's has worshiped in five different locations and weathered a major disaster when one church building was destroyed by a fire. The history of the parish, from both a joyous and sorrowful perspective, will be remembered Sunday when the church celebrates its 85th Anniversary.  The church's roots go back to a group of Serbian immigrants who first formed a choir. In 1914, the choir members began meeting for church services at a hall located near 13th Avenue and Washington Street in Gary. By 1915, they had built and consecrated a church in Gary at 20th Avenue and Connecticut Street. In 1938, a new church was built at 13th Avenue and Connecticut Street. The congregation remained there until 1978, when the church burned down. The congregation held services at a hall located on their picnic grounds in Hobart, while they raised money to build a new church in Merrillville. In 1983, the church broke ground at 9191 Mississippi Street in Merrillville, and in 1991, the church was completed and consecrated.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the parish family of St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Church, under the guidance of Reverend Jovan Todorovich, as they prepare to celebrate their 85th anniversary. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of the love and devotion they have displayed for their church throughout the past 85 years.                          ____________________
