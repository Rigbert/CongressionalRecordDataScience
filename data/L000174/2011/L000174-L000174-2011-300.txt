President, on June 14, 2011, I introduced the Consular Notification Compliance Act. This legislation will help bring the United States into compliance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, VCCR, and is critical to ensuring the protection of Americans traveling overseas.  Each year, thousands of Americans are arrested and imprisoned when they are in foreign countries studying, working, serving in the military, or traveling. From the moment they are detained, their safety and well-being depends, often entirely, on the ability of U.S. consular officials to meet with them, monitor their treatment, help them obtain legal assistance, and connect them to family back home. That access is protected by the consular notification provisions of the VCCR, but it only functions effectively if every country meets its obligations under the treaty--including the United States.  As we now know, in some instances, the United States has not been meeting those obligations. There are currently more than 100 foreign nationals on death row in the United States, most of whom were never told of their right to contact their consulate, and their consulate was never notified of their arrest, trial, conviction, or sentence. This failure to comply with our treaty obligations undercuts our ability toprotect Americans abroad and deeply damages our image as a country that abides by its promises and the rule of law. It would also be completely unacceptable to us if our citizens were treated in this manner.  The Consular Notification Compliance Act seeks to bring the United States one step closer to compliance with the convention. It is a narrowly crafted solution. It focuses only on the most serious cases--those involving the death penalty--but it is a significant step in the right direction and we need to work together to pass it quickly. Texas is poised to execute the next foreign national affected by this failure to comply with the treaty on July 7, 2011. He was not notified of his right to consular assistance, and the Government of Mexico has expressed grave concerns about the case. We do not want this execution to be interpreted as a sign that the United States does not take its treaty obligations seriously, or to further damage relations with an important ally with which we share a border. That message puts American lives at risk.  Since introduction of the Consular Notification and Compliance Act, the Department of Justice and the Department of State have worked with me to explain the importance of the bill, its limited nature, and the urgent need to see it passed. On June 28, Attorney General Holder and Secretary Clinton wrote to me in support of the ``carefully crafted, measured, and essential legislative solution'' included in the Consular Notification and Compliance Act. I will ask consent to have a copy of the letter printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. We have already had productive discussions with Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate. I appreciate that others are willing to work together to address this critical issue.  I also want to note all of the favorable commentary the bill has generated, including multiple editorials in major newspapers and numerous letters of support from across the political spectrum. I also will ask that a selection of those be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Everyone agrees that this legislation is not about giving breaks to criminals. It is not about expanding habeas corpus relief. It is not about weakening the death penalty. This bill is about three things only. It is about protecting Americans when they work, travel, and serve in the military in foreign countries. It is about fulfilling our obligations and upholding the rule of law. And it is about removing a significant impediment to full and complete cooperation with our international allies on national security and law enforcement efforts that keep Americans safe.  The bottom line is this--our failure to comply with our legal obligations places Americans at risk. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am announcing that I intend to hold a hearing on this critical issue in July. We must work together, and we must act now.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letters and editorials to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 28, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We thank you for your extraordinary      efforts to enact legislation that would facilitate U.S.      compliance with its consular notification and access      obligations and to express the Administration's strong      support for S. 1194, the Consular Notification Compliance Act      of 2011 (CNCA).       The millions of U.S. citizens who live and travel overseas,      including many of the men and women of our Armed Forces, are      accorded critical protections by international treaties that      ensure that detained foreign nationals have access to their      country's consulate. Consular assistance is one of the most      important services that the United States provides its      citizens abroad. Through our consulates, the United States      searches for citizens overseas who are missing, visits      citizens in detention overseas to ensure they receive fair      and humane treatment, works to secure the release of those      unjustly detained, and provides countless other consular      services. Such assistance has proven vital time and again, as      recent experiences in Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere have      shown. For U.S. citizens arrested abroad, the assistance of      their consulate is often essential for them to gain knowledge      about the foreign country's legal system and how to access a      lawyer, to report concerns about treatment in detention, to      send messages to their family, or to obtain needed food or      medicine. Prompt access to U.S. consular officers prevents      U.S. citizen prisoners from being lost in a foreign legal      system.       The United States is best positioned to demand that foreign      governments respect consular rights with respect to U.S.      citizens abroad when we comply with these same obligations      for foreign nationals in the United States. By sending a      strong message about how seriously the United States takes      its own consular notification and access obligations, the      CNCA will prove enormously helpful to the U.S. Government in      ensuring that U.S. citizens detained overseas can receive      critical consular assistance.       The CNCA will help us ensure that the United States      complies fully with our obligations to provide foreign      nationals detained in the United States with the opportunity      to have their consulate notified and to receive consular      assistance. By setting forth the minimal, practical steps      that federal, state, and local authorities must take to      comply with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations      (VCCR) and similar bilateral international agreements, the      CNCA will ensure early consular notification and access for      foreign national defendants, avoiding future violations and      potential claims of prejudice for those who are prosecuted      and ultimately convicted. In this regard, the legislation is      an invaluable complement to the extensive training efforts      each of our Departments conducts in this area.       The CNCA appropriately balances the interests in preserving      the efficiency of criminal proceedings, protecting the      integrity of criminal convictions, and providing remedies for      violation of consular notification rights. By allowing      defendants facing capital charges to raise timely claims that      authorities have failed to provide consular notification and      access, and to ensure that notification and access is      afforded at that time, the CNCA further minimizes the risk      that a violation could later call into question the      conviction or sentence. The CNCA provides a limited post-     conviction remedy for defendants who were convicted and      sentenced to death before the law becomes effective. To      obtain relief, such defendants face a high bar: They must      establish not only a violation of their consular notification      rights but also that the violation resulted in actual      prejudice. Going forward, the CNCA permits defendants who      claim a violation of their VCCR rights an opportunity for      meaningful access to their consulate but does not otherwise      create any judicially enforceable rights.       After more than seven years and the efforts of two      administrations, the CNCA will also finally satisfy U.S.      obligations under the judgment of the International Court of      Justice (ICJ) in Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican      Nationals (Mex. v. US.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (Mar. 31). As we      expressed in April 2010 letters to the Senate Judiciary      Committee, this Administration believes that legislation is      an optimal way to give domestic legal effect to the Avena      judgment and to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision      in Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 (2008). The CNCA will      remove a long-standing obstacle in our relationship with      Mexico and other important allies, and send a strong message      to the international community about the U.S. commitment to      honoring our international legal obligations.       The CNCA unmistakably benefits U.S. foreign policy      interests. Many of our important allies and regional      institutions with which we work closely--including Mexico,      the United Kingdom, the European Union, Brazil and numerous      other Latin American countries, and the Council of Europe,      among others--have repeatedly and forcefully called upon the      United States to fulfill obligations arising from Avena and      prior ICJ cases finding notification and access violations.      We understand that the Governments of Mexico and the United      Kingdom have already written to Congress to express their      strong support for this legislation.       This legislation is particularly important to our bilateral      relationship with Mexico. Our law enforcement partnership      with Mexico has reached unprecedented levels of cooperation      in recent years. Continued noncompliance with Avena has      become a significant irritant that jeopardizes other      bilateral initiatives. Mexico considers the resolution of the      Avena problem a priority for our bilateral agenda. The CNCA      will help ensure that the excellent U.S.-Mexico cooperation      in extradition and other judicial proceedings, the fight      against drug trafficking and organized crime, and in a host      of other areas continues apace.       In sum, the CNCA is a carefully crafted, measured, and      essential legislative solution to these critical concerns. We      thank you again for your work towards finding an appropriate      legislative solution to this matter of fundamental importance      to our ability to protect Americans overseas and preserve      some of our most vital international relationships.           Sincerely,     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,       Attorney General.     Hillary Rodham Clinton,       Secretary of State.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 2011]    Why the U.S. Should Allow Arrested Foreigners To Contact Their                                Consulates       Humberto Leal Jr. is scheduled to be put to death by the      state of Texas next month     for the 1994 murder of a 16-year-old girl. Like so many cases      involving capital punishment, Mr. Leal's has generated      controversy, but not for the typical reasons.       Mr. Leal is a Mexican national. When he was arrested, Texas      officials failed to advise him of his right to communicate      with his country's embassy as required by the Vienna      Convention on Consular Relations. The United States, Mexico      and some 160 other countries are signatories to the      convention. Mr. Leal is one of roughly 40 Mexican nationals      who were not advised about consular access and who sit on      death row in this country.       Mexico filed a grievance on behalf of its nationals and      prevailed in 2004 before the International Court of Justice      (ICJ), the judicial arm of the United Nations. The ICJ      concluded that the United States was obligated to comply with      the treaty and that it should review these cases to determine      whether the defendants had been harmed by the lack of      notification.       Texas, where the majority of these inmates are held,      balked. Three years ago, the state executed Jose Ernesto      Medellin, another Mexican national who was not informed of      his right to consular access and who was denied additional      review. The state is likely to take the same approach in the      Leal case. ``Here, in Texas, if you commit terrible and      heinous crimes you're going to pay the ultimate price,'' says      Katherine Cesinger, press secretary to Gov. Rick Perry.       This misses the point entirely. This is not about coddling      criminals nor is it a referendum on the death penalty. It is      about a country's obligation to honor its treaty commitments.      The United States must comply with the Vienna Convention--and      demonstrate good faith in addressing past mistakes--if U.S.      citizens abroad are to be afforded the same rights and      protections.       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is expected to introduce      legislation as soon as this week to provide meaningful review      in federal court for those denied consular access. The      legislation should be narrowly tailored and mandate that the      legal proceedings focus solely on whether denial of access      seriously prejudiced an inmate's ability to defend against      charges. The bar for success should be high, and only those      who can provide compelling evidence of such harm should be      allowed a new trial or benefit from a reduced sentence.       To avoid this problem in the future, federal and state      governments should be diligent about abiding by the treaty's      mandates. The State Department should continue its outreach      to state and local governments to impress upon law      enforcement officials the importance of the consular      notification. Complying with the treaty is not only the right      thing to do; it is the smart and self-interested thing to do.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 17, 2011]                         The Treaty and the Law       Humberto Leal Garcia Jr., a Mexican citizen who faces      execution in Texas next month, has petitioned Gov. Rick Perry      for a six-month reprieve. He is asking for a stay under a      vital international law, the Vienna Convention on Consular      Relations, which requires that foreign nationals who are      arrested be told of their right to have their embassy      notified of that arrest and to ask for help.       In recent years, the treaty has provided important      protection for Americans who have been detained in Iran,      North Korea and elsewhere. Mr. Leal was not notified after      his arrest of his right to contact his embassy. But the      Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that Texas did not need to comply      with the treaty because there is no federal law requiring      that states do so.       Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont on Tuesday introduced a      bill that makes clear that federal law requires that states      tell foreign nationals who have been arrested that they can      contact their consulates for help.       For those who were convicted and sentenced without being      told, the bill would let them ask a federal court to review      their case and decide whether the outcome would have been      different if they had had diplomatic help. After the bill was      introduced, Mr. Leal petitioned Federal District Court for a      stay to keep Texas from ``rushing to execute'' him before      Congress has time to act.       Mr. Leal, convicted of murder during a sexual assault, had      grossly incompetent legal representation. If he had been      given access to a Mexican diplomat, he would have had a      chance at better counsel and likely the opportunity to strike      a plea deal, avoiding the death penalty.       For the sake of justice, the governor and court should      grant the stays. For the protection of foreigners arrested      here, and American citizens arrested abroad, Congress should      pass Senator Leahy's bill.                                  ____          [From the Austin American-Statesman, June 10, 2011]          Execution Case Important to International Relations       The Golden Rule of life also applies to the tricky business      of international relations. What we do to non-Americans in      our country we can reasonably expect to be done unto      Americans in other countries.       It is for that reason that Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas      Board of Pardons and Paroles--both in the uncommon position      of making a decision with international impact--should      commute or postpone the death sentence of Humberto Leal, a      Mexican raised in Texas, scheduled to die July 7 for the 1994      murder of Adria Sauceda, 16, in Bexar County.       The key issue in this case at this point is not whether      Leal committed the crime. Also not central now are the      circumstances involving Leal, including sexual abuse by a      priest, a challenging family history and other factors that,      though significant, fail to add up to justification for      murder. They could, however, count as mitigating factors that      argue for a life sentence.       It's what happened after Sauceda was killed that is at      issue. More specifically, it's what didn't happen. Despite      the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requirements,      Leal was not informed of his right to contact Mexican      officials to seek legal assistance. Records indicate that he      was not aware of that right until told about it by a fellow      death row inmate.       Instead of getting legal help from Mexican consular      officials, who have a track record of providing quality legal      representation for Mexicans facing the death penalty in the      U.S., Leal was represented by a court-     appointed team that included a lawyer who twice had his      license suspended.       Back in 2004, the International Court of Justice said Leal      was entitled to a hearing to determine the extent of harm he      suffered as a result of the lack of consular access. A U.S.      Supreme Court ruling has said the U.S. must comply with the      decision by the international court. Texas, citing state law,      said no such hearing could take place. Congress now is poised      to consider legislation, to be filed in coming weeks, that      would establish a procedure for a federal court hearing on      the extent of harm caused to Leal because he was not advised      of his right to contact Mexican officials.       In a clemency petition filed this week, an impressive list      of former U.S. diplomats, retired military leaders and others      concerned about international matters urged a stay of      execution to grant Congress time to deal with this case.       At stake, they said, are the consular rights of Americans      who become entangled in legal problems while out of the      country.       ``For Texas to proceed with (Leal's) execution prior to      full compliance with these treaty obligations would endanger      the interests of American citizens and the United States      around the world,'' John B. Bellinger III, a State Department      legal adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said in a      letter signed by others and delivered to Perry.       The former military leaders told Perry that ``improving      U.S. enforcement of its consular notification and legal      access obligations will help protect American citizens      detained abroad, including U.S. military personnel and the      families stationed overseas.''       Sandra L. Babcock, a Northwestern University law professor      representing Leal, said he would not have been convicted if      he had received proper consular assistance. We have no way of      knowing that. But there is no arguing with Babcock's      contention that ``with consular access, Mr. Leal would have      had competent lawyers and expert assistance that would have      transformed the quality of his defense.''       And, as she noted, Mexican officials have developed      expertise in helping Mexicans facing the death penalty in the      U.S.       ``It really is a very modest remedy we are talking about,''      Babcock said.       Modest, indeed, but with important international      ramifications.                                  ____              [From the Houston Chronicle, June 22, 2011]    Keeping Our Word: Scheduled Texas Execution Violates Treaty and                        Endangers Americans Abroad       Americans traveling abroad are protected, whether they are      aware of it or not, by a treaty called the Vienna Convention      on Consular Relations, ratified by about 170 countries, which      guarantees them access to U.S. consular assistance if they      are detained or arrested in a foreign country. In 2010, more      than 6,600 Americans were arrested abroad, and more than      3,000 were incarcerated. Many of them benefited from the      protections of this treaty.       But unfortunately, the U.S. has repeatedly failed to offer      those same protections to foreigners on U.S. soil. The most      egregious of these violations is the denial of consular      assistance to foreign nationals convicted and sentenced to      death. (Currently, about 100 foreign nationals are on U.S.      death rows.) And in a particularly urgent case, one of those      individuals whose rights were violated, a Mexican national      named Humberto Leal Garcia, is scheduled to be executed on      July 7 in Huntsville.       Because a bill has been introduced to bring the U.S. into      compliance with the treaty, Leal's attorneys have filed a      federal petition and a motion for a stay of execution so that      Leal will be alive and eligible for the remedies of this      legislation when it becomes law.       There are compelling reasons why these petitions should be      granted. Chief among them is the fact that this pending      legislation will allow for review of cases like Leal's, said      his attorney Sandra Babcock, ``where lack of consular      assistance may well have made the difference between life and      death. That's why the consular access really matters.''      Mexico provides top-flight legal assistance to its nationals      under such circumstances.       Leal's court-appointed attorneys were ineffective and      inexperienced, Babcock told the Chronicle, resulting in harm      to Leal in both the guilt-or-innocence and the penalty phases      of his trial. According to Babcock,     they failed to challenge the prosecution's ``junk science''      and flawed DNA evidence or to present expert testimony on      Leal's learning disabilities and brain damage. Leal,      sentenced to death for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16-year-     old girl, was then 21 and had no criminal record.       Also, there is no dispute that this treaty is the law: In      2003, Mexico filed suit against the U.S., claiming that 51      Mexican nationals sentenced to death in U.S. courts had been      denied consular access. (Leal was one of them.) In 2004, the      International Court of Justice ruled that the U.S. must      review those individuals' cases. The issue was finally      resolved, in 2008, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which      unanimously supported the ICJ decision but ruled that it was      up to Congress to implement it.       That is what Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick      Leahy addressed last week, when he introduced legislation to      allow federal courts to review such cases, and to increase      compliance and provide remedies.       And finally, as Leahy eloquently stated, the U.S. failure      to honor its treaty obligations ``undercuts our ability to      protect Americans abroad and deeply damages our image as a      country that abides by its promises and the rule of law. It      would also be completely unacceptable to us if our citizens      were treated in this manner.''       For all of these reasons, we urge Congress to act swiftly      to pass this legislation, and we urge Gov. Perry to give      Leal, and others in his situation, the time to benefit from      its remedies if they are shown to have been harmed.                          ____________________
