 President, there will be a period for morning business until 2 p.m. At that time, the Senate will begin consideration of S. Con. Res. 23, the budget resolution. By statute, there will be 50 hours of debate. So Senators should expect late nights and numerous votes throughout this week.  As previously announced, there will be no votes today. However, it is the leader's intention to complete action on this matter of the budget this week.  There will be a cloture vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination tomorrow. Senators will be notified as to the precise time of that vote as soon as the majority leader and minority leader have consulted.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Iowa.                          ____________________
