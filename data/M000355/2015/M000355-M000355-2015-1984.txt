 President, I wish to say a few words about what has been happening in Paris. We have seen remarkable displays of support for the French people. Out of terrible darkness, we have seen defiant recommitments to the ideals of free expression, and the French people should know that the Senate stands in solidarity with them as they work to recover from such awful terrorist attacks. They should also be assured that we are prepared to cooperate in whatever appropriate way we can.                          ____________________
