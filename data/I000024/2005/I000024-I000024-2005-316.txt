President, I rise today to pay tribute to acting and music legend Pat Boone.  While most of us remember him as one of the greatest singers of the 1950's, he is also known for his abiding Christian faith and strong moral standards which have sustained him throughout his life even during the height of his career in the entertainment industry.  Today, Mr. Boone is the spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, a nonpartisan senior citizens advocacy group.  He recently was interviewed by John Gizzi with Human Events. I ask to have printed in the Record an article titled ``Pat Boone on Politics, Porn, and the Death Tax''.  The article follows.               [From Human Events Online, Aug. 19, 2005]             Pat Boone on Politics, Porn and the Death Tax                            (By John Gizzi)       Pat Boone, 71, is one of America's most beloved      entertainers. In the 1950s, he was the nation's second most      popular singer after     Elvis Presley. His hits, ``April Love'' and ``Love Letters in      the Sand,'' were No. 1 for six and seven weeks respectively.      He starred in 15 movies, including Journey to the Center of      the Earth and State Fair. Long an active conservative      Republican, Boone is currently spokesman for the 60 Plus      Association. Last week, Boone spoke with Human Events      Political Editor John Gizzi.       You have always been known in Hollywood as a conservative      and a Christian. In 1961, in fact, you, Ronald Reagan, Roy      Rogers and John Wayne addressed Dr. Fred Schwartz's all-     Southern California anti-Communist rally. Has it become more      difficult for someone [in Hollywood] to be a conservative and      a Christian today?       Pat Boone: I was not involved politically at that time.      Then, I felt so strongly about anti-communism and I did read      Fred Schwartz's book and then came his crusade at the sports      arena. What Schwartz said in his book [You Can Trust the      Communists--To Be Communists] made perfect sense to me. The      phrase, ``Better Red Than Dead,'' was sweeping college      campuses at the time.       When my time came to say a few words, I quoted that      sentiment. I said I've got four little girls and if it ever      came to that, although I pray it never will, I would rather      see my four daughters blown to heaven in an atomic blast than      caught in the hell of a Communist United States.       It impressed Reagan and he quoted that a number of times,      beginning by saying, ``I once heard a young father say.''      That's what occurred that night.       My activism and my being very outspoken never abated after      that and it has cost me as an entertainer. There is a      visceral antipathy that producers, hirers and firers have. I      feel myself in the other direction. I have feelings I have to      control of anger and total disregard for certain actors and      outspoken people in our business that I think are ruining      American culture.       Do you care to name any names?       Boone: When Norman Lear started People For the American      Way, he asked to meet with me. He wanted me to be the voice      of People For the American Way--its spokesman. He knew I had      considerable influence and a high-profile among Christians      and Middle America.       I said to him: ``Look, I understand why you have these      feelings. You want to promote your point of view. But your      main concern is with the Christian right, isn't it?'' He      said, ``That's right.'' I said, ``I know you've been openly      critical of [Rev.] Jerry Falwell. I know Jerry, although I'm      not a member of the Moral Majority. He feels that what you're      doing and saying and promoting is at least as harmful for      America as you feel his point of view is. So why don't we get      you two guys together? I have a feeling that so many of your      concerns are similar. Since I know him, I think he'd be      willing to meet with you.''       Lear said, ``No, I wouldn't meet with him.'' When I asked      him why, he said, ``He'll just quote Scripture and I don't      know anything about that. I'm not going to meet with him.''      When he left, he knew I wasn't going to be his spokesman.       I'm on the unpopular side in the entertainment community. A      number of entertainers, Jonathan Winters for one, say to me,      ``Boone, I believe everything I ever hear you say. But I      don't dare say it.'' Now, here's a comedian who'll say      anything if it's funny, but when it comes to politics or      spiritual things, he knows that he's written off if he were      to express himself as emphatically as he would really like      to.       Why have you signed on with the 60 Plus Association, and      why do you believe its premier cause, abolishing the estate      tax, is so critical?       Boone: [60 Plus President] Jim Martin, a former Marine and      longtime friend of the President, contacted me and asked me      if I wanted to join him and his organization. I had been      asked to be a spokesman for a number of seniors' groups, but      I put it off because I wasn't ready or willing to be      considered a senior. Several years ago, in a 10K race here in      Los Angeles, I chose a very public moment in front of the      network affiliate cameras to come out of the closet and admit      I am a senior. Since then, I haven't been reluctant to let      people know that, yes, I am a senior and I do feel very      concerned about Social Security and the economy and medical      costs.       I have considered for many years that this estate tax is      absolute robbery. You already pay taxes, you save money,      you've been a good citizen and a responsible person, you save      up something, maybe it compounds, but you've already paid tax      on it. Now, when you have the poor judgment to die, the      government steps in and says, ``Thank you for doing that all      these years. We'll take half of that.'' And maybe your folks      have to sell the business and the house.       When Bing Crosby's [first] wife Dixie died [in 1952], going      back that far, he had to sell assets to pay the estate tax.      On top of losing his wife, he was losing assets on which he      already paid taxes. I read this was the case and asked him,      and he said, ``Oh yes. You can't get away from the long arm      of the IRS.''       Some say that hip-hop, acid rock and similar modern music      is destructive. Do you agree that a lot of it is harmful?       Boone: Oh, yes, I've been very vocal about that, too. The      culture is being dragged into the gutter, and the ones doing      it are not just the performers, but the record company      executives. It's calculated on their part because they      realize there's some fascination, as we used to be fascinated      with Jimmy Cagney in the gangster movies. But in the movies,      the criminals always got caught and punished.       The executives found some years ago that this ``gangsta      rap'' music was being bought and played by kids out in the      suburbs. These are the well-to-do kids, not the black kids in      the ghetto areas. They were not the ones subscribing to it      and making this music so successful. It was the kids driving      BMWs that their dads gave them that were playing it very loud      and rattling windows of the houses they were going by.      They've made a multi, multi-million dollar business out of      it.       What's the answer to this? Are you talking about      censorship?       Boone: I had a real head-to-head with Robert Blake one      night on the Merv Griffin Show about censorship. I said that      no society can survive without some form of censorship. He      said, ``You're crazy. We don't have censorship. That's bad.''      I replied, ``Wait a minute. The traffic light at the corner      is a form of censorship. It says you stop so that someone      else can go. And then you have your turn to go.'' We have      laws on the books that prevent you from standing up in a      theater and yelling, ``Fire,'' or from walking down the      street and opening your trench coat and exposing yourself.      There are laws that tell you that you can't do certain things      and that's what a society does to protect itself.       I believe we need censorship. I don't think the arts we      call the arts--literature, movies and certainly not the      airwaves--should be exempt from the rules society makes to      protect itself. It's the sensibilities of kids and the      females we used to call ladies we're talking about. Thanks to      ``Sex and the City'' and this other stuff, they can be just      as profane and filthy as men.       I've watched segments of ``The Sopranos,'' and I just get      so sick of the glamour. Talk about Cagney and Bogart. We're      making national heroes out of gang bosses.       I do advocate censorship for a healthy society with three      provisos: that it be majority-approved, self-imposed and      voluntary. The ``voluntary'' and ``self-imposed'' may sound      like the same thing. The society agrees that we need to      protect ourselves, and there are certain bounds beyond which      we don't want the public to be exposed to filth. But we will      make the rules in a voluntary, majority-approved way. And      they can be changed by majority opinion.       I have felt that a healthy society should draw some lines      in the dirt and say, ``You cannot cross over this line. You      cannot say certain words on public television and cable or      anything that's going to reach sensibilities. We are going to      do something to defend our kids and our ladies and our      families.'' But it's something you just can't even talk about      in the entertainment industry. But I say, how are we going to      protect ourselves if we don't demand responsibility?       One final point--friends in California say that you were      urged to run for Congress as a Republican in 1968. Why didn't      you do it?       Boone: That was back when I had all of my kids at home. I      just knew that it would be totally time-consuming and if I      were elected, I'd have to do the job. I thought I could get      elected. But I also knew if I was elected, I would do my best      to be a good congressman. However, it would be very      disruptive of my family life because I would spend a lot of      time away from family. And also, I could never go back to      being an entertainer.                          ____________________[Pages S10115-S10116]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          TRIBUTE TO PAT BOONE
