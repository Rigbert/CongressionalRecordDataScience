 Speaker, as cosponsor of the original Kaptur resolution and as somebody who offered I think a very important amendment as a part of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services markup for this bill, I strongly support this resolution.  There are three basic points that I would like to make:  No. 1, at a time when Members of Congress are proposing cutbacks in School Lunch Programs, in Breakfast Programs, in programs which hurt the most vulnerable people in our society, because the claim is we do not have enough money to provide those programs, it seems to me to be absolutely irresponsible to put one penny at risk in attempting to bail out the unstable Mexican economy and the unstable Mexican Government. We have more than enough problems here at home. Let us pay attention to those problems.  Second of all, not only is the concept of the bailout wrong, it is an absolute outrage that the President and the Republican leadership would suggest that they can make the bailout going through the Exchange Stabilization Fund and not come to the U.S. Congress for a debate and a vote. It is no secret why they did not come to Congress for a vote, and the reason is, they would have lost that vote.  The third point that I would want to make is, as important as this resolution of inquiry is, it is only, and must be understood to be only a first step. We have got a long way to go.  My sincere hope is that the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach] will allow my legislation, H.R. 867, to be considered by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services and come to a vote on the floor. What that bill would require is that this bailout package and other uses of the Exchange Stabilization Fund must be approved by the U.S. Congress and the people before one penny could be spent.
