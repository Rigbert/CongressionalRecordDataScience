 President, at dawn, with Congress returning to session, we lowered the flag at the U.S. Capitol to half-staff in honor of the servicemembers who were killed in Chattanooga. What we saw there was a tragedy for our country. It was a terrible blow to everyone who loved these brave Americans. We will never forget their sacrifice, and we will continue to keep their families and their memories in our thoughts today.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
