Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues here, and I guess what we can talk about is wreck-onciliation, and it is truly a wreck for our communities, and for communities across this country.  I happen to serve on the Committee on Appropriations, and I can testify that there have been many, many years when we have cleared our bills on time, all 13 of them, before October 1. There is no reason to furlough 800,000 Federal employees. I can tell you in Toledo, OH, my largest community, we had our office in the Federal building, and just today, because Social Security had to really close down, those people were furloughed, there were 70 people whose claims could not be directly processed, 500 visitors were turned away, because our office is pretty close to their office, and, on average, they receive about 245 phone calls a day. That means 245 seniors called in to the office, and the phone could not answer today, because the people were not there.  Here in Washington, tomorrow I think I am the only Washington monument that students in my district will see, because hundreds of them are here during the fall season, and they learned that all the monuments, all the museums, are all closed down. So here they have saved their money, they have done car washes during the summer, they have worked so hard to come with their classes to Washington, and today they cannot see any of them. This is their one time. It is so expensive to come here, so we are seeing the results of this unnecessary train wreck here in the month of November.  What is amazing to me, this so-called new leadership on both sides of the Congress, why do we have to wait until the end of the week? It is Tuesday. Now they told us we have to wait through Wednesday, wait through Thursday, and maybe we will have a vote on Friday. What are we waiting for?
