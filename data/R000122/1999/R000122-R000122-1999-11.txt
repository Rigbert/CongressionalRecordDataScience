President, I rise today to honor an outstanding individual who has dedicated her life to the education of our young people. Karen Leach of Johnston, Rhode Island, is retiring from the Providence School Department after nearly thirty years of dedicated service.  Since Karen graduated from Rhode Island College in 1969 with a Bachelor's Degree in Elementary and Special Education, she has received Masters of Education Degrees in both Elementary Education and in Administration for Elementary and Middle Schools. She has also furthered her professional development by achieving certification in many areas.  The capital of Rhode Island, Providence is at the heart of our state's urban center and during her career, Karen has been assigned to several schools in the District. Karen began her long and accomplished career as a teacher and dedicated her efforts toward Special Education. During her tenure, the field of education has seen tremendous change--from curriculum, to technology, to teaching methods and to administrative practices. Throughout nearly three decades of service, Karen has brought efficiency, expertise and professionalism to her many challenging assignments.  In 1988, Karen was named Supervisor of Elementary/Pre-School Education for the Providence School Department and in 1992, she became Principal of the Sackett Street Elementary School and the Reservoir Avenue Elementary School. Since the 1992-1993 school year, she has been Principal of the Sackett Street Elementary School and she is retiring from her present administration position as Interim Acting Superintendent of Teaching and Learning.  Karen Leach is a person of great integrity, compassion and initiative. She is accomplished and well respected for her many contributions to the Providence School System. She has made a positive impact on the quality of education, and in the lives of students, especially those with special needs. Most recently, Karen's leadership as a Principal and as an Administrator has left a lasting mark on the City of Providence.  So many young people have had their lives enriched by one person's efforts. Karen Leach's commitment and her tangible accomplishments clearly demonstrate that an investment in education is indeed an investment in the future.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Karen Leach for her commitment to educational excellence and for her efforts to improve the overall quality of our education system. Indeed, she has made a tremendous difference in the lives of her students. As Karen Leach leaves the Providence School Department, she plans to continue as a professional educational consultant. I wish her well and remain confident that we will hear more news of this outstanding educator's good works.                          ____________________
