President, I am delighted to commend Falmouth High School of Falmouth, ME, on being named a 2018 National Blue Ribbon Exemplary High Performing School. This outstanding high school is one of only 349 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award recognizes the hard work and determination of Falmouth High School's students, faculty, and staff. This is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and its strong commitment to professional development ensures that teachers, staff, and students are lifelong learners. This recognition adds to the town's record of achievement in education; its middle and elementary schools were awarded Blue Ribbons in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Falmouth High School is known for its extensive extracurricular activities, which help forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests. In addition to music, theater, and art presentations, the school provides the community with such offerings as robotics demonstrations, a film festival, a science Olympiad, poetry slams, and math team competitions. A new school garden and greenhouse and a student technology team provide hands-on learning experiences. Many high school students serve their community by mentoring students in the town's elementary and middle schools.  The school strives to address the varying needs of individual students. Falmouth's innovative student centered team brings together students, teachers, administrators, and counselors to provide a support network tohelp ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed academically and socially.  This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute not only to the students, but also to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Falmouth High School. Together, they are accomplishing their mission to help students succeed in the classroom and as engaged citizens. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential. I congratulate the entire community for this well-deserved recognition.                          ____________________
