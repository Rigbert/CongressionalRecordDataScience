 President, I appreciate that and I thank the Senator. It is just that I think I find a conflict in this because, after all, Social Security, although there is an outlay every year, is running well in surplus. By the year 2002 when this is operative, there will be $705 billion plus another $300 billion, it is my understanding, becoming available for retirements. But because they are not needed, this amendment would automatically use those revenues to balance the budget. That is my problem with this.  The fact that--let us say it is Federal or quasi-Federal--this is still an entity that is the product of the Federal Government whose full faith and credit at one point built it, et cetera, and whose full faith and credit would sustain it if it fell into tough years.  I look at Social Security as important as TVA, it is as important as Bonneville if you are a senior who is depending on it or a working person who is paying the FICA taxes with the expectation that the Government is going to make those revenues available. This amendment does not make those revenues available for retirements.  So all we are saying is, just as you have excepted Bonneville, TVA, and some other things yet unknown to some of us, we say exempt Social Security, and then we can all march forward together.
