 President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the bankruptcy legislation with 10 hours remaining for postcloture debate. Senator Wellstone will be recognized at 9:30 a.m. to offer any of his germane amendments. Following his time, Senator Kohl's amendment regarding the homestead issue will be debated for up to 90 minutes. Under the previous order, there will be two votes at 12 noon on Leahy amendment No. 19 and amendment No. 41. Further, amendments will be offered and debated during tomorrow's session, and therefore votes will occur throughout the day. It is hoped that we can complete action on the bill very early in the evening.                          ____________________
