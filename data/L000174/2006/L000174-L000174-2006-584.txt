President, I am pleased today to stand with my colleagues, Senator Alexander, Senator Hatch, and Senator Nelson of Florida, to express the sense of this Congress that institutions of higher education should act diligently to help eliminate the harms from the illicit copyright infringement that plagues many campus computer systems.  Online piracy, especially illegal file-sharing of copyrighted works such as music, movies and software, is a growing problem. While I always encourage technological innovation, I am also acutely aware of the need to respect the intellectual property rights and talent of those who create the works that are made available online. Some peer-to-peer software applications allow individuals, without authorization, to copy and distribute--for free--unlimited numbers of these valuable works. The speed and convenience of our universities' networks, which were built for academic pursuits, have unfortunately also proved to be a lure for students seeking to engage in this illegal and detrimental behavior.  When music and movie industry representatives speak with me about this problem, they describe a disturbing level of online piracy. In addition to exposing students to legal liability, illegal file-sharing on school networks may compromise the integrity of those systems by using up expensive bandwidth, introducing spyware, and hosting destructive viruses.  I am pleased that colleges and universities in my home state have been working for nearly two years to combat these problems. In July 2004, Middlebury College, located in Middlebury VT, announced a deal with Napster to provide legitimate file sharing services that offer online music to students. It is my hope that more institutions will follow in step, and work to provide students with the tools needed to lawfully access the wealth of information available on the web.  As technology continues to advance, the issues that surround legitimately accessing online content will become increasingly important. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the isle for working with me to convey this important message.                          ____________________[Pages S3394-S3395]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS                                 ______                                      SENATE RESOLUTION 438--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD ADOPT POLICIES AND EDUCATIONAL     PROGRAMS ON THEIR CAMPUSES TO HELP DETER AND ELIMINATE ILLICIT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OCCURRING ON, AND ENCOURAGE EDUCATIONAL USES OF,                   THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS
