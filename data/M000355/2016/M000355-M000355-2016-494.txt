 President, we all know that so-called sanctuary city policies are extreme. They undermine the safety of our communities. They can inflict incredible pain on innocent victims and their families. President Obama's own Secretary of Homeland Security has called such policies ``not acceptable'' and ``counterproductive to public safety.''  Yet Democrats voted to block two proposals that would have worked to prevent so-called sanctuary city policies from existing in the first place and would have enhanced penalties to keep more criminals off our streets when cities refuse to do away with such policies.  Senator Toomey offered one of them, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, which he described this way:       My legislation stands for the simple proposition that the      safety of the American people matters. The life of Kate      Steinle matters. Protecting our neighborhoods from violent      criminals and terrorists matters.  Senator Toomey's bill would have ensured more fairness for citizens and governments that do the right thing. It would have supported police officers, who risk everything for our safety, and it enjoyed critical support from several law enforcement organizations.  Democrats again chose partisan politics over making a difference for the American people.  I know Senator Toomey won't be deterred. I know he will continue his work to do something about this issue. He has been an outspoken leader against the dangerous and extreme policies of sanctuary cities for some time now. I thank him for his leadership on this issue and his tireless work to advance this measure.  I also recognize Senator Cruz for his legislation, Kate's Law, which would have helped protect the public even when jurisdictions continue to follow so-called sanctuary city policies by putting more dangerous criminals behind bars and off our streets.  These measures would have sought to prevent the kind of pain that Kate's family has been forced to endure, a pain that no family should have to experience.                          ____________________
