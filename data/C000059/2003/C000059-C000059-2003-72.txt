Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to his country and community was extraordinary. Orange County, California, was indeed fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated community leader who willingly and unselfishly gave his time and talents to make his community a better place in which to live and work. The individual of whom I speaking is Ahmad Rateb Olomi. He was unexpectedly and tragically taken in an airplane accident over the Arabian Sea on Monday, February 24, 2003, at the age of 45.  Mr. Olomi was born in Afghanistan, and earned his bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore, Pakistan. He moved to the United States in 1980. He was hired by Orange County in 1984 and shortly thereafter became a naturalized United States citizen. He worked his way up from Engineering Technician to the position of Senior Civil Engineer. Some of the more notable projects he worked on were Seven Oaks Dam, the Santa Ana River Mainstream Project, and the Laguna Canyon Road State Route 133 realignment. Over his 19 years of service to Orange County, Mr. Olomi developed himself into one of the County's most talented and valued professionals.  In addition to his love for the United States and his community, he never forgot his original homeland. On the day of the tragedy, Mr. Olomi was on a six-month leave of absence from the County of Orange traveling with the Afghan Minister of Mines and Industries to help with the rebuilding of Afghanistan, and the construction of a transnational pipeline project that would pump natural gas and oil from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan and into Pakistan.  Mr. Olomi was also a dedicated family man. He is survived by his wife Roya and children, Yusef and Sahar. He is remembered by his family and friends as a man admired for his integrity, honesty, intelligence and selfless commitment to others. My thoughts and prayers go out to them for their loss.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Mr. Olomi's life, we see a man dedicated to his family, community, adopted country and original homeland--an American and Afghani whose service led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with him. Honoring Mr. Olomi's memory is the least we can do today for all that he gave over his lifetime.                          ____________________
