Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bipartisan Kaptur-Roukema-Riggs-Roemer-Quinn amendment. It provides enough support to maintain the current participation level of pregnant women and low birthweight children around this country. The support is paid for then by an offset to the NASA accounts, the wind tunnel accounts, which are being canceled.  Keep in mind, for a few hundred dollars per participant we save, on average, $20,000 for children who would be admitted to hospital rooms across the country with anemia, with all kinds of conditions, that are a direct result of poor nutrition.  This is a wise investment for America, fully paid for, fully proven. Support the bipartisan Kaptur-Roukema amendment. I thank my dear colleague, the gentlewoman from New Jersey, Mrs. Marge Roukema, for working so hard on this. It is an honor to work with her.
