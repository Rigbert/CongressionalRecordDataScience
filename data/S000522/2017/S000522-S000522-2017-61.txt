Mr. Speaker, everyone remembers where they were and what they were doing on September 11, 2001--I was in Washington chairing a Veteran's Affairs hearing--when a group of cowards hijacked airliners in order to perpetrate the worst act of terrorism in American history.  No one remembers the shock, horror and numbing sorrow more, however, than the families and close friends of the victims.  Because it was a surprise attack, there was no chance to fight back that day although when New Jersey's Todd Beamer and other passengers learned what happened to the Twin Towers, Todd famously said ``let's roll'' and attacked the terrorists on board the flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field to preclude another jet from being used as a missile.  Who can forget the courageous first responders running up the stairs of burning buildings--with total disregard for their own safety--saving some at the expense of their own lives.  On the morning of 9/11, I got a mere glimpse--I say again a glimpse--into the sense of horror suffered by the victim's families when I couldn't reach my own brother Tom--an American Airlines 757 Captain who often piloted Flight 11 from Logan to LA, the flight that crashed into the North Tower.  Stuck in traffic within sight of the burning Pentagon, cell phones were all but gridlocked. At noon, I got through. He and his flight attendant wife Sandy were safe but were in anguish because they knew the pilots and crew on board Flight 11.  For the families of the victims--and I got to know and work with several including Kathy Wisniewski who lost her husband and today works on my staff, the Jersey Girls and Theresa Velardi, the news that day was absolutely devastating.  Both then--and now 16 years later--words are still inadequate to convey our empathy for those who died and for the victim's families.  For many, their faith in God has helped them survive and overcome.  Yet for 16 years, the families have had to endure their loss and a broken heart.  Which reminds me of that haunting song in Les Miserables after one of the main characters loses many of his friends in a battle at a barricade:     There's a grief that can't be spoken     There's a pain goes on and on;     Empty chairs and empty tables . . .     Where my friends will meet no more . . .  Yes, empty chairs and empty tables in New Jersey and elsewhere but those chairs and tables are not empty in heaven.  Yesterday, I attended a 9/11 memorial in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Theresa Velardi, who lost her dad, Paul James Furmato, on September 11, was eloquent in her moving statement, which I include in the Record:       I have not spoken at a memorial like this before, so I hope      you will all bear with me as I try to get through this.      First, I want to thank Lillian for giving me the opportunity      to speak today. I would like to thank everyone who takes care      of this memorial and the township of Colts Neck for providing      me with a place to come to remember and to be with my Dad.      And I also want to thank all of you for coming out today and      always keeping the families and first responders of 9/11 in      your hearts and your prayers.       My father, Paul James Furmato, was an institutional sales      trader and a Vice- President at Cantor Fitzgerald. He was      taken away from me 16 years ago and my entire family dynamic      was changed. I remember waking up morning after morning      watching my mother fight back her tears and try her best to      raise 3 children on her own. I remember waking up every day      after the twin towers crashed wondering, ``does this mean Dad      is really never coming home?'' I remember being a Girl Scout      in Colts Neck and having to skip Father-Daughter dances      because my father was murdered. I remember hoping and      praying, even years later, that my Dad would come walking      through the door one day and that this was all a really      horrible dream.       But it wasn't a dream. And my family would be changed      forever. The entire country would be changed forever. You      don't remember much from when you were 6, but you never      forget the feeling of losing a father. You never forget the      pain, the devastation, or the confusion. And it wasn't just      my family. Families from around the country lost loved ones.      There was true devastation felt all around after the twin      towers fell. The country went into a state of shock.       But shortly thereafter, something incredible happened. We      came together. We united with those around us and worked      towards repairing New York City, repairing broken families,      and repairing the damage in our hearts. In this country, we      support each other. In Monmouth County, we support each      other. And in my hometown Colts Neck, we support each other.      This community picked each other up off the ground. I      remember Cedar Drive Middle School teachers and Conover Road      Elementary School teachers showing up at my house days after      with food and condolences. All types of Colts Neck residents      showed up at my door to lend my mom the support and prayers      she truly needed.       As devastating as 9/11 was for my family and for our entire      community, it reminded all of us to help each other and look      out for one another. It reminded us that no matter how bad      things may get, there is always a better tomorrow. No matter      what age we are or what troubles we face, we can overcome. We      can fight through it and we can work together to rebuild.       My father's life was taken from him at 37 years old. My      mother lost her husband, her soul mate after spending 17      years with him. She was left with heartbreak and three      children at impressionable ages. Yet she continued to wake up      every morning to provide and to care for her children. She      refused to let the hatred of others consume her own heart and      mind. I grew up watching a woman never give up and I knew I      wanted to follow in her footsteps.       I am 22 years old. I'm a college graduate from Fordham      University with a double degree in Philosophy and Political      Science. I run an office as the Executive Director at the      Monmouth County Republican Committee. I am working towards my      J.D. at Seton Hall Law School on the weekends. I live on my      own and I try my very best to balance everything going on in      my life. I strive every single day to make my Father proud in      Heaven. When life becomes overwhelming or stressful or it all      just feels like too much, I come here and I sit right on that      bench with Paul James Furmato's name on it. I sit here with      my Father beside me. Just this past week, my world felt like      it was caving in. But I came here and I sat with my Dad. I      prayed I was making him proud in Heaven and I promised him      yet again that I will continue to work hard every single day      to be the best daughter I can be no matter what life throws      my way.       At times, life gets difficult. I have seen that and      experienced that first hand. We see heartbreak and disasters      like the storms passing through Texas and Florida just this      past week. The only thing we can do when life hits us hard is      overcome. We have to reflect on tragedies like 9/11 and allow      them to help us grow.                          ____________________
