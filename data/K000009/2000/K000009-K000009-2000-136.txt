Chairman, I would just like to say, as ranking member of this committee, our responsibility is to serve the country; and we have Members that come to us, for example, from New York City and from Chicago who are not on the Committee on Agriculture who are suffering under the Asian long-horn beetle infestation where all of those hardwoods are having to be cut down. We serve the country. We try to provide answers through this section of research in special grants and special research efforts all across this country. We do not just serve people on the agriculture committees. Our job is to serve the membership and, through them, serve the Nation.  So I would object a little bit to the way the gentleman characterized the performance of the committee. We are very proud of the work we do in serving the Nation.
