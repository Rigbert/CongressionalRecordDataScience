 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian, Ben ``Buster'' Taylor, a retired Special Forces sergeant major and former Letcher County Sheriff. Sergeant Major Taylor is not one to brag about his accomplishments, but he should be honored for his courageous and selfless acts during the two decades he spent serving this Nation in the U.S. military.  In 1950, inspired by the heroism of World War II veterans, Taylor joined the United States Army's 11th Airborne Division at Camp Campbell, KY, which is now known as Fort Campbell. As he worked his way through various divisions, the Army began organizing its Special Forces Branch, the Green Berets. Taylor enthusiastically joined the Green Berets and spent the better part of two decades serving with his comrades in Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Burma, China, Laos, and Vietnam.  Taylor's missions exemplified his bravery and altruism. During his tours of duty, he was awarded 24 medals and 18 ribbons, among these four bronze stars. With each honor, a story revealing his heroism is told. He has notebooks full of citations and commendations that tell of the many times he risked his own life to save others. But of all these honors, the one most memorable to Taylor is the role he played in the funeral of President John F. Kennedy. Taylor was selected to represent the Green Berets at President Kennedy's funeral. He walked alongside the casket of the fallen Commander in Chief.  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing a true American hero, Sergeant Major Ben Taylor.                          ____________________
