President, first of all, I know what a sense-of-the-Senate resolution is. Everybody here knows if you establish a position on a bill that is very meaningful, such as the billthat was defeated--the McCain-Lieberman bill--you can turn around and vote for a sense of the Senate and play both sides. Essentially, I think that is what happened here.  Very clearly, a sense of the Senate doesn't do anything except offer cover. I would like to suggest that it would be difficult for me to imagine that anyone who voted in opposition to McCain-Lieberman a few minutes ago would turn around and support this because this is making four assertions that are not true. We have demonstrated very clearly that they are not true and nonscientifically based.
