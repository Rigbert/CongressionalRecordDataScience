Labor, human rights, and trade have always been connected. This is not new. This little planet is not ours to waste, but to use what we need and leave this little planet a little greener and a little more peaceful for generations yet unborn.  This Congress must be a headlight and not a taillight, or history will not be kind to us.  I urge each and every Member of this Congress to do what is right. Stand up for the working people of our country.
