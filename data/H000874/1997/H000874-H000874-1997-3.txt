 I rise, obviously, in strong support of this legislation. I presume there will be unanimous support for this legislation. As one who has been involved in the Boys and Girls Clubs through manyyears and who was himself a participant in the Miami Boys and Girls Club when I was in my very early teens, I can attest to the effectiveness of these organizations.  In recent years, I have cochaired the breakfast held annually on Capitol Hill with Senator Strom Thurmond. As we all know, the Boys and Girls Clubs are authorized under a congressional act and chartered under a congressional act; and, so, they submit annually a report to the Congress of the United States. It is one of the best breakfasts that I attend during the year, because at that point in time, they cite from four regions of the country outstanding young people. Invariably, those young people have overcome incredible obstacles to become outstanding young people, both academically, athletically, civically. They contribute mightily as young people to their peers and mightily to the strength of this Nation.  This effort, therefore, is a very worthwhile effort, which, for a relatively modest investment, will pay off incredibly large dividends. Investing in our young people clearly is the best investment that we citizens can make. Investing tax dollars in our young citizens is one of the best application of tax dollars that we can make, and, in my opinion, an investment strongly supported by the American people.  So I am very pleased to join the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. Jackson-Lee] and the committee in putting forth this bill, which will have great positive impact on the future of our country.
