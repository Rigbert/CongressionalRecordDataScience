 The point that we are getting to is this is the beginning of an important national debate brought on by the tragedy in Orlando. It is a debate which would not have occurred this week had the Senator from Connecticut and his colleagues not taken the floor with this filibuster on the Senate floor. I thank the Senator for his leadership on this. I ask the Senator if we can reach a point where we have a statement by the Republican leadership of the Senate that they will give us the votes on these two key issues that we raised over and over again; is that the purpose and intent of your filibuster?
