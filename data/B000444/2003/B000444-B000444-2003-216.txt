 President, it is fitting on this day, which is the 58th anniversary of VE Day, the victory over Nazi tyranny in Europe, that the Senate is about to vote to admit seven countries that suffered under that tyranny and the tyranny of Communism--Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--all of which have their Ambassadors present today and are very welcome.  His Holiness Pope John Paul the II and President Reagan should be thanked for having hastened the fall of Communism in Europe. President George H.W. Bush should be thanked for the unification of Germany, and our President Bush for having widened the circle of the current round of NATO enlargement, and President Clinton, who skillfully led the way to the pathbreaking last round of enlargement which moved NATO into formerly Communist Central Europe.  Today is a culmination of the work of a number of great men and women. I am just happy to be able to play a little tiny part.  I urge everyone to vote, which I am confident they will, for accession.
