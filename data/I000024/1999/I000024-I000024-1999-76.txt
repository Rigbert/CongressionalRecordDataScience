President.                             Exhibit No. 1                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1999.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear. Mr. President: As Chairman of the Senate Armed      Services Committee, I write to express my grave concern over      the future of the United States Navy's training facility      located on the Puerto Rican Island of Vieques. Ever since I      was the Secretary of the Navy, I have worked to keep this      facility available to the Department of Defense.       The last two east coast carrier battlegroups which deployed      to the Adriatic and Arabian Gulf, completed final integrated      live fire training at Vieques. Both battle groups, led by the      carriers U.S.S. Enterprise and U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, saw      combat in Operations Desert Fox (Iraq) and Allied Force      (Kosovo) within days of arriving in theater. Their success,      with no loss of American life, was largely attributable to      the realistic and integrated live fire training completed at      Vieques. This island is unique in character, both in terms of      its geography, with deep open water and unrestricted      airspace, and its training support infrastructure. The      training range is absolutely vital to our readiness, and      there is no replacement facility available.       Without a doubt, America enjoys the best trained, best      equipped and most motivated military force in the world. But      combat skills, practiced at Vieques, are perishable. Aviators      must hone targeting and weapons delivery skills; ammunition      leaders and flight deck personnel must coordinate weapons      assembly and leading; naval surface fire support teams must      integrate calls for fire support with ground units; gunfire      spotters must refine targeting skills; and ground units must      practice the seamless transfer of command ashore. The Armed      Forces have learned these lessons well. Untrained forces are      exposed to higher casualty rates and experience less mission      success.       Mr. President, I urge you to take no action which limits or      degrades our Armed Force's     ability to properly and thoroughly prepare for the challenges      they face in today's world.       The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton,      who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last      week, confirmed the continuing requirement for live fire      training operations at Vieques.       Due to the moratorium on training on Vieques, the next      carrier battlegroup is deploying with reduced combat      readiness in its airwing and naval surface fire support      capability. I encourage you to now signal your support for      all the men and women of our Armed Forces by allowing the      critical live fire training at Vieques to continue.       With kind regards, I am,           Respectfully,                                                      John Warner,     Chairman.                                  ____                                                Comander in Chief,                                        U.S. Atlantic Command,                                                  August 27, 1999.     Hon. William S. Cohen,     Secretary of Defense, 1000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary, I can appreciate the difficulty of      adjudicating the competing desires of groups for the use of      Vieques Island. It is important to me to be clear . . .      Vieques training area is not just nice to have . . . it is      part of the complex training regime that allows us to send      our men and women into harms way with a clear conscience. As      I mentioned to you in my July Quarterly Issues and Activities      Report, the moratorium on this live fire training will have      an impact on the readiness of military forces assigned to      U.S. Atlantic Command and on the quality of the joint forces      that I provide worldwide to the other CINCs.       Continued access to the Vieques training area, because of      its geographic location and access to base support, provides      us with a unique ability to conduct year-round integrated      live fire training. The island is one of the few locations in      the world where carrier battle groups can conduct high volume      ordinance training, from ``magazine to target.'' It is the      only East Coast facility that offers a live fire land target      complex with unencumbered access to airspace and deep-water      sea space. Shifting portions of this training to other      locations would degrade the quality of training while      increasing the OPTEMPO for our East Coast forces.       I firmly believe that we have a critical need for this live      fire and combined arms training to fulfill my responsibility      of providing trained and ready joint forces worldwide. Part      of the equation in this complex case must be, I believe, a      requirement to identify a suitable alternative before we      restrict this realistic training in any way.       I support the effort to retain the Vieques training area      and to continue this mission essential training. Combined and      integrated live fire training on the island is a valid joint      warfighting requirement. I am willing to assist in any way      necessary to resolve this readiness issue.           Very respecfully,                                                 H.W. Gehman, Jr.,     Admiral, U.S. Navy.                                  ____                                                  Central Command,                             Office of the Commander in Chief,                                       Macdill Air Force Base, FL.     Gen. Henry H. Shelton, USA,     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 9999 Defense Pentagon,          Washington, DC.       Dear General Shelton: As the issue of the Vieques Island      Training Range continues to be debated, I wanted to offer the      CENTCOM perspective. Live fire training at the Vieques      Training Range is vital to the readiness of naval forces      assigned to U.S. Central Command. As you know, the Vieques      training range is the only Atlantic Fleet live-fire range      where land, sea, and air forces can practice combat      operations. Although the range closure potentially affects      several warfighting areas, the most serious and immediate      degradation would occur in our ability to conduct precision      air to ground strike.       If the Vieques Training Range does not re-open soon, we can      anticipate less effective air to ground weapons delivery      accuracy in the early stages of our newly deploying battle      groups. Vieques is the only U.S. range that can support the      kind of high altitude TACCAIR ordnance delivery that we      regularly employ in Operation Southern Watch. It is the only      Atlantic Fleet range with airspace and facilities that can      support full air to ground and Naval Surface Fire Support      (NSFS) training from planning, to execution, to debrief. This      training is an absolute necessity to prepare our ships,      aircraft, and aircrews for ongoing operations (Southern      Watch), short-notice contingencies or MTW operations.       Although we have not recently seen the use of naval gunfire      in surface engagements or in support of forces ashore, it is      a capability our ships do and should routinely exercise.      NAVCENT will experience the first effects of not having this      training when U.S.S. John Hancock in-chops on 18 October. The      degradation of this ship is not significant in terms of      present operations and can be partly mitigated by other      means, however this shortcoming will continue to grow and      will degrade our standard of readiness for combat operations.       It is imperative that Atlantic Fleet ships and Navy and      Marine Corps aircraft have access to realistic training      ranges in support of their NSFS and air to ground      qualifications. Forces deployed to the CENTCOM AOR have faced      the very real potential for combat operations everyday. These      forces must be prepared to fight and win upon arrival in      theater. The Commander, Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, and      Commander, Second Fleet have always provided me, and other      Unified Commanders, with battle ready forces essential to the      successful execution of our mission. Short of development of      a fully functional alternative range or training process, we      must reopen Vieques and allow our forces to receive this      critical training prior to facing real world operations and      contingencies in our theater.           Respecfully,                                                       A.C. Zinni,     General, U.S. Marine Corps.                                  ____     Gen. Henry H. Shelton,     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon, Washington,          DC.                                                  August 23, 1999.       Dear General Shelton, I have followed with interest and      concern recent events in Vieques and Puerto Rico and their      potential impacts on Southern Command and fleet readiness.      This controversy has come at a crucial time for SOUTHCOM as      our components depart Panama and activate their new      Headquarters on Puerto Rico. Fortunately, up to this point      unit relocations and Vieques ranges have been treated as      separate issues on the island and by the press here in Miami      which has considerable influence in San Juan.       By virtue of past assignments, I am familiar with the      importance of Vieques to Fleet and Fleet Marine Force      readiness. Working through contacts on Puerto Rico, I have      tried to assist the Navy by creating increased awareness of      the unique and vitally important nature of the training that      is conducted on Vieques. While doing so, I have emphasized      the creative steps the Navy has taken or is considering to      ensure the health and safety of Vieques residents and to      promote the economic development of the island.      Unfortunately, I have yet to receive an encouraging response      from even our most consistent and energetic supporters. I      have also followed closely efforts to identify alternative      training sites to Vieques Island. Thus far, no suitable      alternative has surfaced.       Though Southern Command has a minimal stake in the training      that is conducted on Vieques, I am compelled to voice my      support for the Navy/Marine Corps cause. I have followed      closely efforts to identify alternative training sites to      Vieques Island. Due to a variety of hydrographic, geographic      and other considerations these efforts have not yet borne      fruit.       Whether the solution is Vieques or some other site in the      SOUTHCOM AOR, I am prepared to assist in any way that I can      as we strive to ensure that our forward-deployed forces      maintain their combat edge.           Very respectfully,                                                 C.E. Wilhelm,                            General, U.S.M.C., Commander in Chief,     U.S. Southern Command.                                  ____                                               Commander in Chief,                                        U.S. European Command,                                                  August 16, 1999.     Gen. Henry H. Shelton.     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon, Washington,          DC.       Dear General Shelton: Wanted to take this opportunity to      address an issue of importance to the readiness on naval      forces assigned to the European command--live fire training      at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico.       Concerned that with the current moratorium on training at      Vieques, the naval forces that will be assigned to EUCOM in      the future may not be fully combat ready to perform their      assigned missions. As you know, during the recent conflict in      the Balkans the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt battlegroup arrived      on station, and within hours of arrival was conducting      sustained combat operations. The level of precision and low      collateral damage achieved by naval forces during the Kosovo      conflict was possible primarily due to the realistic live      fire strike warfare training the carrier battlegroup      completed at Vieques just before their deployment.       Similarly, the 26th MEU assigned to the U.S.S. Kearsarge      Amphibiouis Ready Group also performed flawlessly during the      Kosovo conflict. Although Marines were not committed ashore      in an opposed battlefield environment, our Marines were fully      prepared to conduct force entry operations if the situation      would have required an amphibious capability under combat      conditions. Clearly, the coordinated and integrated      operational training that they received in a live fire      environment at Vieques was instrumental in preparing our      Marines for Kosovo and the combat conditions they encountered      as they entered Yugoslavia. Remain deeply appreciative of the      efforts of Commander, Second Fleet and Commander, Marine      Forces Atlantic to provide me, and the other Unified      Commanders with the most battle ready force possible, one      that is combat ready and can win on the sea, in the air, and      on the ground.       Firmly believe that there is an enduring need for live fire      training. We fight like we train, and a great measure of the      success our forces achieved in Kosovo can be directly      attributed to the realistic training environments in which      they prepared for combat. The live fire training that our      forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques      helped ensure the forces assigned to this theater were      ``ready on arrival'' and prepared to fight, win, and survive.      To provide our Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen with      less than this optimum training in the future would be      unconscionable, cause undue     casualties, and place our nation's vital interests at risk.       Realistic training under live fire conditions is a      necessity to ensure our men and women are afforded every      possible advantage over their potential adversaries.           Sincerely,                                                  Wesley K. Clark,                                                     General, USA.
