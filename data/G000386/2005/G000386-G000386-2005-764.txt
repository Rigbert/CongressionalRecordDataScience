 President, it is amazing to me that this is the second time tonight that we have had people who are standing around wanting to change the Medicare Modernization Act, and it does not even go into effect until the 2006. We do not even know that all this money my colleague wants to save will ever be spent in the first place, and if it is spent, it is to bring the plans to rural Wisconsin so that his folks in rural Wisconsin can have the same benefits as people in Florida or Los Angeles. It was a major compromise of this bill. We ought to preserve that compromise because it is for rural America.
