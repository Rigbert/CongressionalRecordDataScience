Robbie Floyd of Gary, Indiana. Ms. Floyd's many contributions to the Northwest Indiana community, as a businesswoman, as a civil servant, and as a leader within her church, are worthy of our deepest admiration. Robbie passed away on Sunday, September 28, 2008, but the impact and influence she has had on her community will surely live on for generations to come.  Robbie Lorraine Floyd was born in Gunnison, Mississippi to Joseph and Julia Floyd. At the age of 8, Robbie relocated to Gary, Indiana. She attended Froebel High School, one of only two schools in the City of Gary with integrated classes, where African-American students could attend with other children and receive the same education. The type of person who always sought to deepen her understanding of different areas, Robbie later enrolled in real estate school and became a licensed realtor.  Known for her focus and determination, Robbie Floyd took on the many challenges life brought her, and in spite of the shortage of advantages for African-Americans, sought to improve the quality of her life and the lives of her other family members. In the 1940s, she and her father became owner-operators of a grocery store, as well as apartment rental units in Gary.  Ms. Floyd, a true activist in the Northwest Indiana area, also recognized that having a voice at City Hall was essential to social progress. Recognizing the respect Robbie had in her community, and seeing just how dedicated an individual she was, then Mayor Peter Mandich encouraged her to enter politics. Thus she became a Precinct Committeewoman twice, first in District 4 and later in District 3. These positions enabled Robbie to serve her constituents by giving them a voice and allowing them to acquire the services they needed. Later, continuing her service in the public sector, Robbie worked as the Administrative Assistant/Secretary to two city controllers, George Chacharis and my father, John Visclosky, both of whom later became mayors of the City of Gary. It is in the City Controller's office that I first met Ms. Floyd as a child. Robbie kept an eye on me there, and until the day of her passing, to make sure I stayed on the straight and narrow.  A true renaissance woman, Robbie Floyd was also the first African-American woman to serve as a police officer for the Lake County Sheriff. As her peers would recall, in breaking this glass ceiling, she did so with distinction, dignity, honor, and dedication. For her efforts, she was honored with the highest accolade bestowed upon an individual by the governor of the State of Indiana, the Sagamore of the Wabash.  While she was fully committed to the people of Gary and Northwest Indiana, Robbie's commitment to her faith was equally impressive. After confessing Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior with First Baptist Church in Gary, she later became a charter member of Christ Baptist Church. Prior to her passing, Ms. Floyd was a key member of her church. For 16 years, Robbie served as its Financial Secretary. As her congregation would attest, she loved serving others and never failed to aid ``the stranger,'' ``the friend,'' or ``the child'' in any way that she could. Robbie was known for her ability to help those who needed it most, leading to her participation in various church ministries, including: the Willing Workers, Church School, the Church School Fellowship Committee, for which she served as its chair, Male Chorus Boosters, and the Pearce Prayer and Study Group.  While Robbie Floyd was always active in her community and her church, she cherished her time with her family the most. She leaves to cherish her memory two daughters, Dr. Doris Keys Ward and Debra Floyd; grandnieces, LaTanya Obgiofor, Desnee Flakes, and Donna Floyd; grandnephews, Cordell (Millicent) Olive and Joseph Floyd, and numerous great-grandnieces and nephews. She will also be greatly missed by her many friends, her Pastor, Reverend Dr. Maurice White, Jr., and all of the members of Christ Baptist Church.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Robbie Lorraine Floyd for her outstanding devotion to her community in Northwest Indiana. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation. Robbie's selflessness was an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to have represented her in Congress.                          ____________________
