Mr. Chairman, I am not opposed, and I know of no opposition to this, but I would ask to claim the 5 minutes.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) will control the time in opposition.  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).
