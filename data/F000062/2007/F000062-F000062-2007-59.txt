 President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senators Harkin and Specter concerning my amendment to the underlying bill, amendment 3403, which would provide compensation to qualifying individuals injured in the course of employment at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in California. This amendment mirrors legislation I introduced in July to correct longstanding injustices to these nuclear workers and their families. Because of the revenue impact of this amendment, I have chosen not to call it up at this time. However, the plight of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees deserves mention as we debate this important bill.  In 1999, Congress approved the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program to provide a $150,000 payment and medical benefits to workers who developed serious illnesses as a result of their work for the Department of Energy. The program has been plagued by slow processing times and roundly criticized by the families struggling to receive compensation for the deaths of loved ones.  I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to expand the Special Exposure Cohort to include qualifying Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees. This would allow eligible claims to be compensated without the completion of a radiation dose reconstruction or determination of the probability of causation. I would like to ask Senator Harkin the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, and Senator Specter, the ranking member of this subcommittee, whether they agree with me that Congress should expand the Special Exposure Cohort so that the claims of qualifying individuals can processed more efficiently?
