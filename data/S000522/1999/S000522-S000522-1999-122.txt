Mr. Chairman, for purposes of working this out, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Kingston) having assumed the chair, Mr. Barrett of Nebraska, Chairman pro tempore of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2415) to enhance security of United States missions and personnel overseas, to authorize appropriations for the Department of State for fiscal year 2000, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
