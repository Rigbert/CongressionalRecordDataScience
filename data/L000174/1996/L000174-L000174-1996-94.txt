President, I believe that there is strong support for the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I know that I am one supporting it. Again, I compliment him for the effort that he has made on this.  I also understand that as a result of efforts to get some Senators back in here, that we will probably not have this vote until 10 o'clock. I know that meets the satisfaction of leadership. So I might just make a couple of general comments on the bill along the lines of what I did yesterday.  This legislation reflects the best compromise that we are able to make in the Senate in the committee and a compromise between the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself in this legislation. We had an effort within a very small limit and a very small allocation. The allocation itself reflected the best efforts of the distinguished chairman of the overall Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield.  But I think that, Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves at some point just how long we can go down this road. No matter what the administration is, Republican or Democrat, we are going to have to face up to the responsibility of world leadership when we are the most powerful and wealthiest democracy known to history. We have seen steady cuts in the area of foreign aid. Maybe it is politically popular to go back home and talk about those cuts, but let us look at what we have with the conservative, tight-fisted, anti-foreign-aid rhetoric of the Reagan administration.  President Reagan's budgets were almost 40 percent higher in foreign aid than President Clinton's. President Bush's were. Frankly, those budgets reflected reality. The rhetoric did not reflect reality. The budget reflected more reality. But we have been so caught up with the rhetoric. The rhetoric of the Reagan administration rarely reflected their spending priorities. But we have gotten so caught up with the rhetoric that we have now made the spending priorities a reality. As a result, we are not reflecting our responsibilities. Some are just pure economic sense.  If we help in the development of these other countries, that is usually the biggest and fastest growing market for our export products. We create jobs in the United States. The more exports we can create, the more jobs we create, and our fastest growing and biggest potential market is in the Third World. That is why Japan and so many other countries spend more money than the United States does as part of their budget in these other parts of the world, because they know that with the United States stepping out of that they can step in. They are creating jobs. We lose American jobs. They create Japanese jobs, European jobs, and otherwise. They probably sit there and laugh and cannot understand why we believe our own rhetoric and give up these potential jobs. But they will take them over.  Then we have another area, and it is a moral area. We have less than 5 percent of the world's population; we use more than 50 percent of the world's resources. Don't we as a country have a certain moral responsibility to parts of the world?  In some parts of the world, the annual--think about this for a moment, Mr. President--in some parts of the world, the annual per capita income of a person is less than one page of the cost of printing the Congressional Record for this debate. We have already spent in the debate this morning by 10 minutes of 10 more than the per capita income of parts of the world where we help out with sometimes 20 cents per capita, sometimes even 25 cents per capita. Are we carrying out our moral responsibility as the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth?  We can look at pure economic sense. It makes little economic sense to us. We lose jobs as we cut back. We lose export markets as we cut back. But we also have some moral responsibility. Most Americans waste more food in a day than a lot of these hungry countries, the sub-Saharan countries and others, will ever see on their tables. We spend more money on diet preparations in this country than most of these nations will ever see to feed their newborn children or their families.  So I ask, Mr. President, at some point when you feel good about the rhetoric of going home, Members feel good about the rhetoric of going home and talking about how they are opposed to foreign aid, they ought also to look in their soul and conscience and ask what they are doing. And, if they are not touched in their soul and their conscience, then also talk to the business people in their State and say: ``We are doing this even though we are cutting off your export jobs, even though we are cutting out American jobs by doing this.''  There is an interesting op-ed piece in the Burlington Free Press of July 24 by George Burrill, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 24, 1996]                U.S. Foreign Aid Helps Americans at Home                          (By George Burrill)       Of all the budget cuts enacted last year, none was more      damaging than the reductions in foreign assistance.      Fortunately, the hemorrhaging appears to have stopped. The      Senate is now acting on the foreign operations spending bill,      which will increase the funding slightly over this year's      level. In James Jeffords and Patrick Leahy, Vermont is      fortunate to have two senators who understand the role of      foreign assistance in improving the economic security of      Americans. Both serve on the appropriations subcommittee with      jurisdiction over foreign operations, and both have supported      the programs that helped create future markets for U.S.      exports.       One poll last year showed that nearly six out of 10      Americans incorrectly believed that the U.S. spends more on      foreign aid than on Medicare. In fact, the government      collects only about $11 per person each year from income      taxes to pay for foreign assistance.       Most people know that foreign aid can be humanitarian. But      few Americans realize that 80 percent of the total foreign      assistance budget is spent right here in the United States,      on American goods and services--more than $10 billion in      1994. This translates to about 200,000 U.S. jobs. For      example, Cormier Textile Products in Maine provided tarps for      disaster relief and temporary housing in Africa.       Closer to home, I am working on a project to enhance the      computer capabilities of the Egyptian parliament. What kind      of computers? IBM--which has over 6,000 employees in Essex      Junction.       Today, exports account for 10 percent of the entire U.S.      economy--double the level of a decade ago. In 1983, the jobs      of five million workers depended on U.S. exports. Today, that      number has reached 12 million.       The fastest growing markets for U.S. goods and services are      in the developing world. Between 1990 and 1995, exports to      developing countries increased by nearly $100 billion,      creating roughly 1.9 million jobs in the United States.       This increase in U.S. exports to the developing world is no      accident. Most of the foreign assistance that we spend on      developing countries today goes toward making them good      customers tomorrow. The American economy is growing today      mainly because other countries want and can afford to buy our      products and services.       U.S. foreign assistance now focuses on encouraging six      reforms in developing countries.       First, we encourage reform of developing countries' overall      economic policy. For example, in the Czech Republic, we      assisted in the transition from a command economy to a free-     market system. The United States helped the Czech government      create a healthy economic environment for investors, which      included a balanced government budget, low inflation and low      unemployment. With over 10 million mostly urban and well-     educated consumers, reforming the Czech economy has meant an      11 percent increase in U.S. exports there between 1993 and      1994.       Second, we encourage developing countries to dismantle laws      and institutions that prevent free trade. Guatemala now      exports specialty fruits, vegetables, and flowers--and the      increased buying power of Guatemalans has meant a 19 percent      increase in U.S. exports there every year since 1989.       Third, we are helping to privatize state-dominated      economies. This dismantling of state-run industries is an      important means of attracting foreign investment. A $3      million U.S. government to investment to support      privatization in the Indonesian energy sector has led to a $2      billion award to an American firm for Indonesia's first      private power contract. In fact, the U.S. foreign assistance      budget has enabled U.S. companies to dominate the global      market for private energy.       Fourth, U.S. foreign assistance encourages developing      countries to establish business codes, regulated stock      markets, fair tax codes and the rule of law. Foreign      assistance helps create the stable business environments that      U.S. companies need in order to cooperate effectively.       Fifth, we are helping to educate a new class of consumers      in developing regions. When the United States helps educate a      population, we help develop the skills needed in modern      economy and a solid middle class with a vested interest in      seeing economic reforms succeed.       Sixth, we help build small businesses. Community-run      lending programs administered by the U.S. government are      expanding small businesses and increasing per capita income      in many developing countries.       The United States spent relatively more on foreign economic      aid in the 1960s and '70s than it does today. The economy      activity we are seeing in the developing world is tightly      linked to the work the U.S. government carried out 20 and 30      years ago. Although the private sector is ultimately      responsible for economic growth, the government's work is      critical. At the very least, our goal should be to match the      mean level of total U.S. economic assistance of the 1960s--     about $18 billion a year.       America is at a crossroads. We can choose to make a smart      investment now or pay a steep price later. The relatively      small amount of money we spend on foreign economic assistance      serves as an engine for our future economic growth.
