President, I would like to take a moment to tell you about a friend of mine.  Chuck Scholz has three great loves in this world: his family, his faith and his community, Quincy, Illinois. On May 2,after 12 years as Quincy's mayor, Chuck Scholz is stepping down.  It was clear from his earliest days as mayor that Chuck Scholz was a leader. Days after he was sworn in, the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1993 deluged Quincy and many other towns up and down the Mississippi. Even when the flood waters made the bridges connecting Quincy to West Quincy, MO, impassable--leaving the region isolated--Chuck Scholz never panicked. He led a relief effort that brought together Federal, State, and local resources. After the flood waters receded, he worked with communities in three States to lay the foundation for cooperative economic development efforts that continue to this day. He turned destruction and despair into focused determination. His influence on Quincy is so positive and so pervasive that today, many of us cannot think of Quincy or western Illinois without thinking of Chuck Scholz.  Chuck is a compassionate public servant and a talented lawyer. He is also an avid Quincy historian. In 1994, he was able to relive an important chapter in Quincy's history when he welcomed President Abraham Lincoln to the city. Actually, it was a very convincing actor who was playing Lincoln in a re-creation of the famous 1860 Lincoln-Douglas Presidential debates in Quincy. The debate was covered live on C-SPAN.  Mayor Scholz also welcomed a living President to Quincy. Hours after President Bill Clinton delivered his final State of the Union Address in 2000, Air Force One touched down at Quincy's Baldwin Field, and President Clinton delivered a speech in Washington Park. That visit and so many other remarkable events--would not have happened without Mayor Scholz's leadership.  The Scholz administration leaves an impressive list of accomplishments, from lowering property taxes to improving city services and enhancing public safety. Working hard and in a bipartisan manner, Chuck Scholz has made the ``Gem City'' shine even brighter. Quincy is a more prosperous, more vibrant, more beautiful, and more hopeful place than when he first became mayor.  Chuck Scholz is proud of the sister city bonds he helped forge between Quincy and the cities of Hereford, Germany, and Jiaxing, China. He has hosted Presidents, bishops, Supreme Court Justices, and dignitaries from many nations. But his favorite conversations have always been with Quincyans. He loves chatting with local grade school students and rewarding them for good grades with one of his famous red, white, and blue bookmarks.  Retiring as mayor will allow Chuck to spend more time with his wife Becky and his sons Charles and Jake. He will rediscover the law and maybe even spend a bit more time on the golf course or conducting the Quincy Park Band. But I know his service to his hometown will never stop.  As Chuck Scholz prepares to begin this next chapter in his life, I wish him well and I join many others in thanking him for 12 years of remarkable service to his community.                          ____________________
