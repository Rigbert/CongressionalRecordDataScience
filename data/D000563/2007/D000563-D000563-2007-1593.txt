But going back to Medicare Prescription Part D, we are not suggesting that Medicare offering its own program as an option is going to be mandatory on seniors. It is still their decision whether they want to use the Medicare approach--which we are supporting on this side of the aisle, which allows for these discounted drugs--or if they feel a private plan is better for them, better for their needs, better for their pocketbook. It is just a consumer choice. But that choice is not available today.  Medicare cannot offer to the seniors, under Medicare Prescription Part D, an option. What is wrong with Medicare offering that option and competing with these private insurance companies?
