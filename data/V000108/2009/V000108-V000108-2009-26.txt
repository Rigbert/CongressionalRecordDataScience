Since its inception as National Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968, which later became National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, Americans have taken this time to not only honor the rich culture and traditions of Hispanic Americans, but also to reflect on the countless contributions they have made that have led to improvements in their communities, and in turn, a better America.   As we reflect on the importance of the contributions that have been made by Hispanic Americans, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to one individual in particular from the First Congressional District who has represented the epitome of leadership and civil service within Northwest Indiana, the Honorable Lorenzo Arredondo, Lake County Circuit Court Judge. For over three decades, Judge Arredondo has presided over his courtroom, making him the longest serving elected State trial judge in the United States.   Raised in East Chicago, Indiana, Judge Arredondo has brought a very unique perspective to the courtroom. As a child in East Chicago, he grew up in a very diverse community, influenced by many ethnic groups, all living and working together. In East Chicago, a city centered around its steel mills, Judge Arredondo also learned the value of hard work, and of teamwork. This, no doubt, served him well in his later pursuits and has been a cornerstone of his remarkable career.   While serving on the bench for more than three decades is a truly amazing feat, it is Judge Arredondo's passion for and service to improving the justice system that makes histenure so impressive. His distinguished career includes service on the faculty of the National Judicial College and the Indiana Trial Advocacy College, on the board and executive committee of the American Judicature Society, as president of the Hispanic National Bar Association, and on the boards of the Indiana Judges Association and Judicial Conference. Not one to rest on his laurels, Judge Arredondo is currently vice-chair of the Indiana Supreme Court's Commission on Race and Gender Fairness, and he serves on the board of the Legacy Foundation. At home in Lake County, understanding the important role families play, Judge Arredondo has made great strides in improving opportunities for families, including the creation of the Family Division of the Lake County Court and the Domestic Relations Counseling Bureau, as well as the ``Children's Room,'' which aims to reduce stress on children whose parents are attending court.   While his knowledge and experience have crossed all cultural and racial divides, Judge Arredondo's contributions to issues vital to the Hispanic population are unmatched. It is for this reason that he has been summoned on numerous occasions to the White House to share his experience and his knowledge. For his contributions, Judge Arredondo is one of only five individuals in the thirty-nine year history of the National Hispanic Bar Association to receive the prestigious Lincoln-Juarez Award. Additionally, Judge Arredondo has been awarded the Indiana Judges Association Award for excellence in public information, the Indiana State Bar Association's prestigious Rabb Emison Award, and the Sherman Minton Award for Judicial Excellence.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, let us pay tribute to leaders such as Judge Lorenzo Arredondo, who have contributed so much to the improvement of our communities and our nation. I respectfully ask that you and my other colleagues join me in commending Judge Arredondo for his lifetime of service to the First Congressional District. I am proud to serve as his representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
