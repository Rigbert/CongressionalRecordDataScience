 President, each fall, Senators and Congressmen turn to the enjoyable task of submitting nominations to the U.S. Service Academies. This year, like every other, my office was flooded with applications from qualified young men and women--students with excellent academic records, students whose extracurricular activities would drive the most patient parent crazy, students who donate endless hours to community service projects. However, rarely do I see a young person possessing all of this and more.  This year I proudly nominated Erica Michelle Pitts, of Louisville, KY, to the U.S. Military Academy, as did Senator Wendell Ford and then-Congressman Mike Ward. There are many adjectives that can be used to describe Erica--poised, accomplished, brave, athletic, energetic, but even combined they do not adequately portray her. A senior at Saint Francis High School, Erica's headmaster Thomas Pike describes her as ``a delightfully different young person.'' Counselor Kit Llewellyn sees her as a ``risk-taker'' and admires her integrity.  Erica's military career dreams began at the age of 6 when her stepfather took her for a tank ride. At the tender young age of 8 she began working for her mother's boss formatting computer disks for $5 an hour. Entering as a seventh-grader at the respected Saint Francis, she was immediately placed in the freshman class, where, lacking a girls basketball team, Erica played on the boy's team. She has participated in a Russian exchange program, the Duke University Talent Identification Program, and served on the Courier-Journal High School Round Table. And, amidst her participation on the academic team and the yearbook staff, Erica works part-time at the Louisville Science Center yearround.  As you can see, Erica's childhood has been far from average. Notwithstanding, she has grown into a graceful young woman whose lofty dreams have been realized. Hoping to enter the Judge Advocate General's Corps after her years at West Point, Erica aspires to serve on the Supreme Court or be elected President. Both goals are well within her grasp.  Mr. President, please join me in honoring this outstanding young Kentuckian who has a bright future in the U.S. military. I ask that an article which recently appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal be printed in the Record. The author does a wonderful job of capturing Erica's charm and enthusiasm.  The article follows:                          Getting to the Point                            (By C. Ray Hall)       At first blush, the most interesting thing about Erica      Pitts is this: Barely 17, she is headed for the United States      Military Academy to join West Point's legendary long gray      line.       It will probably be the grayest thing that has ever      happened to her. So far, her life has been like a      colorsplashed, abstract work of art in progress.       Erica Pitts has been interesting for a long time. She was      interesting even in the womb.       ``I was named after a soap-opera character,'' she said.      ``Because I was trouble. My mom went into labor and so she      went to the hospital.''       False alarm.       ``They sent her back home. Then I was about ready to pop      out so they called the ambulance. I was almost born in the      ambulance. I was almost born outside on the way into the      hospital. I was almost born in the lobby. I was almost born      in the elevator, but finally they got her to a delivery room      and I was born. I made life a little difficult for her.''       Hence the name, Erica: ``Yeah, Erica Kane. Because I was      trouble.''       Not even a minute old, and her life was already a      cliffhanger.       Next scene in Erica's life: the beginning of an unlikely      romance. At Fort Knox, of all places. In a tank, of all      things.       ``It started when I was about 6. My mom had married my      stepdad. He was in the Army and he took me for a tank ride      one day and I just thought that was the coolest thing. I      admired the discipline in the Army.''       Next scene: Erica gets her first paying job, earning $5 an      hour to format computer disks for her mom's boss at the      Internal Revenue Service. She is 8.       Next scene: Erica is stepfatherless, owing to divorce. She      and her mom, Pamela Scott, are living in Louisville. Erica      masters public school effortlessly. ``I was so used to just      showing up for class, reading the newspaper during first      period and not doing any work all day and still getting an A      in every single class I took.'' So her mom takes Erica to St.      Francis, a downtown school of high academic reputation and      equally stratospheric cost (tuition up to $8,140).       Headmaster Thomas Pike recalled, ``I remember her and her      mom coming in and her talking about not being academically      challenged, talking about being an environmental lawyer or      biochemist. This is a seventh-grader. Just a really bright,      lively 13-year-old, and she has been lively and bright ever      since . . . a delightfully different young person.''       St. Francis took her and let her skip from the seventh to      the ninth grade. (``A double bonus,'' Erica said.)       ``Her life has always been action-packed,'' said school      counselor Kit Llewellyn. ``She's a skateboarder, a volleyball      player, a basketball player. She volunteers regularly. . . .      She has worked on literary magazines, so her literary      analysis is strong and indepth. . . .       ``She's kind of a risk-taker. She likes to start things.      She participated in crew (rowing) when it was founded. She's      the first female from this school to entertain the idea of      applying to a military academy.''       And yet, somewhere in that swirl of action, there's a      cerebral center.       ``I guess what stands out with me for Erica is her      integrity,'' Llewellyn said. ``I was her sponsor at Calvary      Episcopal Church when she went through the confirmation. For      her age (then 15), her questions and her depth of      understanding, what she was pursuing in her belief and in her      spiritual self, was very strong. Well-thought-out and very,      very calm in her approach.''       Oh. And did we mention she wants to be president?       Of the United States. Like the current occupant of the Oval      Office, she likes lawyering. And, like Bill Clinton, she went      to Russia at a tender age, as part of an exchange program.       Erica was nominated to West Point last year by then-     Congressman Mike Ward. For the physical test, she returned to      Fort Knox, the scene of her first infatuation with the Army.      She passed the exam, which includes running, throwing a      basketball while on your knees and hanging on a chin-up bar.      Some girls immediately drop off the bar. She held on for 31      seconds.       The audience included Lt. Col. Don Miller, an Army      reservist who serves as a West Point liaison (and, in another      life, helps run a Louisville brokerage). After interviewing      her, he wrote to the academy, ``Erica is a very goal-oriented      young lady with aspirations of becoming president someday. .      . . Erica has excellent people skills and appears to possess      good leadership traits. Her mother raised Erica alone and      this has resulted in sacrifice, and yet has developed her      sense of commitment.''       So this is a 17-year-old of greater complexity than most.      During her trip to Russia, she bought a fur hat. She felt bad      about it when she realized rabbits had died to decorate her      head. She thinks the country spends too much on defense. She      clashed openly with a 10th-grade teacher, but she has a kind      word even for Adolf Hitler. (``He was psycho, but he was a      brilliant, brilliant ruler.'')       This is not your father's West Point cadet.       ``She's a free spirit,'' said Bryan Walde, the man who      teaches her calculus, chemistry and basketball at St.      Francis. In her graduating class of 38, the animal-loving,      defense-cutting, coffeehouse-and-concert habitue might have      been voted least likely to go to West Point.       ``I heard that a lot,'' she said.       `` `You were the last person I thought would ever go      there.' A lot of the people I know are not really anti-     government, but they don't like people telling them what to      do. I don't really like it myself, but I do need the      discipline. I would love to have the discipline. And it's one      of the best schools in the country. Who would turn that      down?''       West Point told her the price of the education awaiting      her. ``They valued it as $200,000, which I wouldn't doubt,      because I think West Pointers can easily top people who go to      Harvard.''       That's obviously the kind of talk they like to hear on the      cliffs overlooking the Hudson River. Not that they actually      like to hear much talk at all from first-year cadets, or      ``plebes.'' For a while at West Point, she will speak only      when bidden. Too bad, for she has lots to say. To wit:       On her willowy yet well-fed frame of 5 feet 10 inches, 120      pounds:       ``I eat a lot. This morning for breakfast, I had a      cheeseburger, two pancakes and a cinnamon roll. . . .       On love, sex and all that:       ``I manage to stay friends with all of my ex-boyfriends.      It's really strange. I think partially because there's never      any reason for either of us to be really bitter. I don't      sleep with anybody. I just decided no sex before marriage. So      I never had to worry about sleeping with somebody and then      the next morning they just totally ditch me. There's never      any big thing to get really mad about. It's just a bunch of      little things that lead up to you saying, `You know, maybe we      shouldn't be together.' So you can just go back to being      friends.''       On her idea of cool wheels:       ``I want a big Dodge Ram truck as soon as I can get a      car.'' (She calculates that that will be three years hence,      with the down payment saved from her West Point stipend of      $6,600 a year.)       On her mixed parentage, the result of a college romance      that never led to marriage. A delicate matter?       ``It never has been. People have asked me about that for a      long time. They've asked me if I was mixed and it's never      bothered me. I've never really worried about it. Yeah, my      dad's white, my mom's black. . . . It's never been a big deal      to me.''       On her twin ambitions, of being a lawyer and a      psychologist:       ``I love to argue. That's what appeals to me about being a      lawyer. And I love using words . . . to get a point across. I      want to be a psychologist because I'm so used to doing that:      There are so many people with problems. My friends always      come to me for advice.''       What's the best advice anyone gave her?       ``You've got to learn to choose your battles and not fight      every single one. That's some good advice I got from my      mother. . . . For a while, every time somebody did something      I didn't like, I was ready to argue with them. I didn't get      into fistfights or anything, but I kind of verbally berated      my teacher sophomore year, sometimes in front of his class.      He didn't like that very much. That's when I learned to start      controlling my temper. I felt kind of bad, although I think      he kind of deserved some of that, although in front of his      class was really mean.''       On the prospects of harassment or hazing from macho      military males:       ``The sexual harassment thing, I think I would have the      guts to just stand up and say, `Hey, I don't like it. Stop.'      Being hazed and stuff like that, once it got to a dangerous      point where people were setting me on fire, I would just have      to like fight back, period. I would not allow somebody to set      me on fire     as part of a hazing ritual. I think I'm strong enough to      handle anything that might be thrown at me as a hazing      ritual.''       Hazing? Been there, done that, in a non-incendiary way. On      a basketball court, of all places.       ``My favorite moment came freshman year,'' she said. ``We      didn't have a girls' team yet, so I had to play on the boys'      team. We were playing against a team that was very, very,      very chauvinist. . . . I got in with about a minute 40 left,      and they were not treating me very well. At first my      teammates wouldn't even pass me the ball, and finally one of      'em did. I just stood back behind the three-point line, shot      and it went right in. Swish. It was perfect. We still lost      the game, but I felt better.''       Next scene in Erica's life: November 1996. The IRS      transfers Erica's mom to Nashville. ``She and her mother have      been a team through the years--her mom with pretty high      expectations and Erica living up to them,'' said Llewellyn,      the St. Francis counselor.       Erica stays behind to graduate from her school. She lives      with her grandma, Ellen Pitts. ``She's been pretty great. I      have my own loft, and it's really nice. It's not very big,      but it's nice. I've got a computer and a desk and my futon up      there, and that's all I really need.''       For now, at least, she dreams in a loft. But soon enough,      the dreams will be aloft. And Erica Pitts' life will get even      more interesting.                          ____________________
