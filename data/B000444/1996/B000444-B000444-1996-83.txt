 President, I know this is asking a lot, but let's just examine the logic of what is being said here. My friend from Utah stands up and says, ``Restore what we need to restore. Make the President do what he should do.''  What are we doing? The Senator from Georgia is restoring the request of the President. What are these guys talking about? The President is the one who asked for the money the Senator from Georgia says he should get. Now my friend from Utah says, ``Now what we must do is restore this war on drugs.''
