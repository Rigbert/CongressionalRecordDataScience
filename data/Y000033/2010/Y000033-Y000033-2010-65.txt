Madam Speaker, today I would like to recognize the centennial anniversary of the Sitka National Historic Park, which is the oldest federally designated park in Alaska. The park was established in 1890 to commemorate the 1804 Battle of Sitka. All that remains of this last major conflict between Europeans and Alaska Natives is the site of the Tlingit Fort and battlefield, located within this scenic 113-acre park.  In 1808, following this series of battles between the Tlingit natives and Governor Alexandr Baranov, Sitka was established as the capitol of what was then called Russian-America. Following the sale of this land to the United States after the decline of the otter fur trade, Sitka continued to be the seat of government for territorial Alaska until 1906, when the capital was moved to Juneau.  Unofficially called ``lover's lane'' or ``totem park'' by Sitka locals, the Sitka National Historic Park attracts nearly 300,000 visitors a year to its scenic coastal trails, beautiful temperate rainforest, and world-class collection of Northwest coast totem poles. These histories carved in cedar were donated by Native leaders from villages in Southeast Alaska, and were then brought to Sitka by Alaska's then District Governor John G. Brady in 1905. Many poles exhibited along the park's two miles of wooded pathways are replicas of the original totem poles.  The park also boasts a visitor center which contains ethnographic exhibits and houses the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center, where visitors can watch Native artists at work. Here, the park cares for more than 154,000 museum collection items. These include Tlingit ethnographic pieces, Russian American archeological and historical items, historical photos, archives and herbarium specimens. Highlights of the collection include totem poles, Chilkat weaving, Tlingit oral history recordings, 19th Century Russian furniture, Russian Orthodox icons and vestments, and two hundred original glass plate negatives by Sitkan photographer E.W. Merrill. Through these exhibits, visitors of the park get a rare peak into the unique cultures and lifestyles of Tlingit natives and Russian-American creoles.  The experience continues at the Russian Bishop's House, one of the last surviving examples of Russian colonial architecture in North America. This original 1842 log structure conveys the legacy of Russian America through exhibits, refurbished living quarters and the Chapel of the Annunciation. This house was once the center of the Russian Orthodox Church authority in a diocese that stretched from California to Siberian Kamchatka, at a time when Russia was still the dominant power in the Pacific Northwest. Today, it is an artifact of the heritage of Russian Orthodoxy in Alaska, which maintains a strong presence to this day.  Given this unique combination of natural beauty, cultural history, and rare artifacts, it is no wonder that the Park played a significant role in Sitka's recent designation as one of the Dozen Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Tucked away behind the dormant volcano Mt. Edgcumbe, the Sitka National Historic Park remains one of Alaska's jewels. As the City of Sitka commemorates Sitka National Historic Park month, I would like to join Alaskans in recognizing the Park on its centennial celebration.                          ____________________
