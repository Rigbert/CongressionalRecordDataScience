 President, I rise today in support of legislation introduced last week by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth, and Moynihan. I commend my colleagues for their dedication to improving the way federal programs serve persons with disabilities. Continuing my support for this effort from last Congress, I am glad to announce that I joined my colleagues as an original co-sponsor this year of S. 331, The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.  This bill addresses one of the great tragedies of our current disability system, a system that forces many people with disabilities to choose between working and maintaining access to necessary health benefits. This was never the intention of these programs. It is critical that we act now to overturn today's policies of disincentives towards work and replace them with thoughtful, targeted incentives that will enable many individuals with disabilities to return to work.  Over the years I have heard from Iowans who have been forced to leave the work force because of a disability. While they remain disabled and still require ongoing health benefits, they are eager to return to work. However, because of the risk of losing critical health benefits covered by Medicare and Medicaid, too many capable individuals are deterred from entering or re-entering the work force.  It is essential that our public disability programs encourage, not discourage, employment. This legislation tackles the risks and uncertainties disabled individuals face when trying to return to work. For individuals eligible for the Supplemental Security Income(SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, this legislation provides for continued coverage of critical benefits under the Medicaid program, such as personal assistance and prescription drugs. These services are vital to many people with disabilities. Furthermore, this proposal would provide beneficiaries with unprecedented access to private rehabilitation services. Currently, the Social Security Administration is unable to refer many beneficiaries for rehabilitation. This legislation would create opportunities for beneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs to access rehabilitation services from either the public or private sector, increasing choice, access and quality of these valuable services.  The most encouraging component of this legislative proposal is that which eliminates work disincentives and facilitates self-sufficiency among those with disabilities. This legislation prohibits using work activity as the only basis for triggering a continuing disability review. What's more, the proposal would expedite the process of eligibility determinations for individuals who have been on disability insurance but who lost it because they were working.  The risk of losing health care benefits provided through the Medicare and Medicaid programs is a major disincentive for millions of beneficiaries who want to be a part of our nation's dynamic workforce. The intent of these programs was never to demoralize or dishearten Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. I look forward to the passage of this legislation which will unlock the doors to employment for these invaluable citizens.                          ____________________
