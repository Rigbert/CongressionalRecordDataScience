Speaker I rise today to recognize the Potomac Trail Council. The Potomac Trail Council received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant for a project designed to improve access and interpretation along a one mile section of trail in Piscataway Park and Fort Washington Park in Accokeek, Maryland.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refuges and other sites in five states and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed, Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Potomac Trail Council is receiving a grant of $40,500 and $45,300 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Potomac Trail Council will make significant improvements to access and interpretation along a one mile section of trail in Piscataway Park. The route, which parallels Piscataway Creek (a tributary of the Potomac River) will be improved through several measures to control erosion and puddling, including the addition of permeable surface materials, french drains, and culverts. Six interpretive waysides and other signs will also be developed to provide trail users with key information and interpret features along the route. The Potomac Trail Council will coordinate work on the project in collaboration with park staff.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Potomac Trail Council that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Potomac Trail Council on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
