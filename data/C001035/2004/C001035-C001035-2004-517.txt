President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator Carper, to introduce the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2004, a bill designed to help the 225-year-old Postal Service meet the challenges of the 21st Century. This legislation represents the culmination of a process that began in the summer of 2002 when I introduced a bill to establish a Presidential Commission charged with examining the problems the Postal Service faces, and developing specific recommendations and legislative proposals that Congress and the Postal Service could implement.  It has long been acknowledged that the financial and operational problems confronting the Postal Service are serious. At present, the Postal Service has more than $90 billion in unfunded liabilities and obligations, which include $6.5 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury, nearly $7 billion for Workers' Compensation claims, $5 billion for retirement costs, and as much as $45 billion to cover retiree health care costs. The General Accounting Office's Comptroller General, David Walker, has pointed to the urgent need for ``fundamental reforms to minimize the risk of a significant taxpayer bailout or dramatic postal rate increases.'' The Postal Service has been on GAO's ``High-Risk'' List since April of 2001. The Postal Service is at risk of a ``death spiral'' of decreasing volume and increasing rates that lead to further decreases in volume.  In December of 2003, President Bush announced the creation of a bipartisan commission charged with identifying the operational, structural, and financial challenges facing the U.S. Postal Service. The President charged this commission with examining all significant aspects of the Postal Service with the goal of recommending legislative and administrative reforms to ensure its long-term viability.  The President's Commission conducted seven public hearings across the country at which they heard from numerous witnesses. On July 31, 2003, the Commission released its final report, making 35 legislative and administrative recommendations for the reform of the Postal Service.  As I read through the Commission's report, I was struck by what I considered the Commission's wake up call to Congress: its statement that ``an incremental approach to Postal Service reform will yield too little, too late given the enterprise's bleak fiscal outlook, the depth of current debt and unfunded obligations, the downward trend in First-Class mail volumes and the limited potential of its legacy postal network that was built for a bygone era.'' That is a very strong statement, and one that challenged both the Postal Service and Congress to embrace far-reaching reforms.  To the relief of many, including myself, the Commission did not recommend privatization of the Postal Service. Instead, the Commission sought to find a way for the Postal Service to do, as Co-Chair Jim Johnson described to me, ``an overwhelmingly better job under the same general structure.''  The Postal Service plays a vital role in our economy. The Service itself employs more than 750,000 career employees. Less well known is the fact that it is also the linchpin of a $900-billion mailing industry that employs 9 million Americans in fields as diverse as direct mailing, printing, catalog production, paper manufacturing, and financial services. The health of the Postal Service is essential to the vitality of thousands of companies and the millions that they employ.  One of the greatest challenges for the Postal Service is the decrease in mail volume as business communications, bills and payments move more and more to the Internet. The Postal Service has experienced declining volumes of First-Class mail for the past four years. This is highly significant, given that First-Class mail accounts for 48 percent of total mail volume, and the revenue it generates pays for more than two-thirds of the Postal Service's institutional costs.  The Postal Service also faces the difficult task of trying to cut costs from its nationwide infrastructure and transportation network. These costs are difficult to cut. Even though volumes may be decreasing, carriers must still deliver six days a week to more than 139 million addresses.  As Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I held a series of eight hearings, including a joint hearing with the House, during which we reviewed the recommendations of the President's Commission. The bill Senator Carper and I introduce today is the culmination of everything the Committee learned from dozens of witnesses over the past eight months.  First and foremost, the Collins-Carper bill preserves the basic features of universal service-affordable rates, frequent delivery, and convenient community access to retail postal services. As a Senator representing a large, rural State, I want to ensure that my constituents living in the northern woods, or on the islands, or in our many rural small towns have the same access to postal services as the people of our cities. If the Postal Service were no longer to provide universal service and deliver mail to every customer, the affordable communication link upon which many Americans rely would be jeopardized. Most commercial enterprises would find it uneconomical, if not impossible, to deliver mail and packages to rural Americans at rates charged by the Postal Service.  The Collins-Carper bill allows the Postal Service to maintain its current mail monopoly, and retain its sole access to customer mailboxes. It grants the Postal Service Board of Governors the authority to set rates for competitive products like Express Mail and Parcel Post, as long as these prices do not result in cross subsidy from market-dominant products. As a safeguard, our bill establishes a 30 day prior review period during which the proposed rate changes shall be reviewed by the Postal Regulatory Commission.  It replaces the current lengthy and litigious rate-setting process with a rate cap-based structure for market-dominant products such as First-Class Mail, periodicals and library mail. This would allow the Postal Service to react more quickly to changes in the mailing industry. The rate caps would be linked to an inflation indicator selected by the Postal Regulatory Commission. The goal would be to make rate increases more predictable and less frequent and to provide incentives for the Postal Service to operate efficiently. Price changes for market-dominant products would be subject to a 45-day prior review period by the Postal Regulatory Commission.  Our bill would introduce new safeguards against unfair competition by the Postal Service in competitive markets. Subsidization of competitive products by market-dominant products would be expressly forbidden, and an equitable allocation of institutional costs to competitive products would be required.  The President's Commission recommended that the regulator be granted the authority to make changes to the Postal Service's universal service obligation and monopoly. The vast majority of the postal community, however, shared my belief that these are important policy determinations that should be retained by Congress. TheCollins-Carper bill keeps those public policy decisions in congressional hands.  The existing Postal Rate Commission would be transformed into the Postal Regulatory Commission with greatly enhanced authority. Under current law, the Rate Commission has very narrow authority. We wanted to ensure that the Postal Service management has both greater latitude and stronger oversight. Among other things, the Postal Regulatory Commission will have the authority to regulate rates for non-competitive products and services; ensure financial transparency; establish limits on the accumulation of retained earnings by the Postal Service; obtain information from the Postal Service, if need be, through the use of new subpoena power; and review and act on complaints filed by those who believe the Postal Service has exceeded its authority. Members of the Postal Regulatory Board will be selected solely on the basis of their demonstrated experience and professional standing. Senate confirmation of all Board Members will be required.  The Governmental Affairs Committee dedicated two hearings to the examination of the Commission's workforce-related recommendations. The Postal Service is a highly labor intensive organization, using $3 out of every $4 to pay the wages and benefits of its employees. Their workforce is comprised of more than 700,000 dedicated letter carriers, clerks, mail handlers, postmasters, and others, who place great value on their right to collectively bargain. Our bill reaffirms that right. This bill only makes changes to the bargaining process that have been agreed to by both the Postal Service and the four major unions. We replace the rarely used fact-finding process with mediation, and shorten statutory deadlines for certain phases of the bargaining process.  Additionally, the Collins-Carper bill corrects what I believe to be an anomaly in the Federal workers' compensation law that results in high costs for the Postal Service. Under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), Federal employees with dependents are eligible for 75 percent of their take-home pay, tax free, plus cost of living allowances. In addition, there is no maximum dollar cap on FECA payments. As a result, employees often opt not to retire, staying on the more generous workers' compensation program permanently.  According to a March 2003 audit issued by the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General, the Postal Service's workers' compensation rolls include 81 cases that originated 40 to 50 years ago, with the oldest recipient being 102 years old. The IG's office found 778 cases that originated 30 to 40 years ago; and 1,189 cases that originated 20 to 29 years ago.  The Collins-Carper bill works to protect the financial resources of the Postal Service by converting workers' compensation benefits for total or partial disability to a retirement annuity when the affected employee reaches 65 years of age. This change would reflect the fact that disabled postal employees would likely retire at some point were they not receiving workers' compensation. I would like to note that the average postal employee retires far earlier than age 65, so this is still a generous program. It is important to point out that the Postal Service has reduced their workplace injury rate by twenty-eight percent over the past three years.  The Collins--Carper bill also puts into place a three-day waiting period before an employee is eligible to receive 45 days of continuation of pay. This is consistent with every state's workers' compensation program that requires a three- to seven-day waiting period before benefits are paid.  Our bill has reached an important compromise on the issue of workshare discounts. Some have raised concerns that the Postal Service has set rates so that mailers get a discount greater than the cost avoided by the Postal Service. While this may have occurred in a handful of instances, those mailers are still covering their attributable costs, as well as making a healthy contribution to overhead. The language in our bill sets a policy that the Postal Service shall not create new discounts greater than the cost avoided by the Postal Service. The only exception is in those cases where the Postal Regulatory Commission believes those rates are necessary.  The bill has also, for the first time, explicitly created the authority for the Postal Service to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers. This will allow the Postal Service to create agreements with customers to increase its revenue. I would point out that these agreements must cover all attributable costs, and will likely result in greater contribution to overhead. In addition, our bill requires that other similarly situated mailers will be able to enter into such agreements with the Postal Service.  Finally, our bill would repeal a provision of Public Law 108-18 which requires that money owed to the Postal Service due to an overpayment into the Civil Service Retirement System Fund be held in an escrow account. Repealing this provision would essentially ``free up'' $78 billion over a period of 60 years. These savings would be used to not only pay off debt to the U.S. Treasury and to fund health care liabilities, but to mitigate rate increases as well. In fact, failure to release these escrow funds would mean, for mailers, a double-digit rate increase in 2006--an expense most American businesses and many consumers are ill-equipped to afford.  The bill would also return to the Department of Treasury the responsibility for funding CSRS pension benefits relating to the military service of postal retirees. No other agency is required to make this payment. Ratepayers should not be held responsible for this $27 billion obligation.  The Postal Service has reached a critical juncture. If we are to save and strengthen this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for communication and their livelihoods, the time to act is now.  Our bill has the strong endorsements of the National Rural Letter Carriers Association, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the National Association of Postmasters of the United States, and the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service--which represents thousands of the major mailers, employee groups, small businesses, and other users of the mail. I am also very pleased to add Senators Ted Stevens, George Voinovich and John Sununu as originated cosponsors of this bill.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the Senate, and House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Tom Davis, who just last week passed a postal reform bill out of his committee by a vote of 40-0.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record, along with a letter sent to me from David Walker, Comptroller General of the General Accounting Office, addressing the need for comprehensive postal reform.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2468       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States          Senate.     Need for Comprehensive Postal Reform       Dear Chairman Collins: This letter responds to your request      for our views on the need for postal reform and is based upon      our prior testimonies related to this issue. In summary, we      believe that comprehensive postal reform is urgently needed.      The ability of the Service to remain financially viable is at      risk because its current business model--which relies on mail      volume growth to cover the costs of its expanding delivery      network--is not well aligned with 21st century realities.      Since we placed the Postal Service's transformation efforts      and financial outlook on our High-Risk List in April 2001, I      have testified on several occasions about the governance,      financial, operational, and human capital challenges that      threaten the Service's ability to carry out its mission. If      not effectively addressed in a timely manner, these      challenges serve to threaten the Service's ability to remain      self-supporting while providing affordable, high-quality and      universal postal services to all Americans.       The following key trends serve to reinforce our view that      enactment of postal reform legislation is needed:       Declining mail volume: Total mail volume declined in fiscal      year 2003 for the third year in a row--a historical first for      the Service, which has depended on rising mail volume to help      cover rising costs and mitigate rate increases. First-Class      Mail volume declined by a record 3.2 percent in fiscal year      2003 and is projected to decline annually for the foreseeable      future. Some of this decline is due to technology advances      (e.g. E-mail, digital phones, faxes, and electronic bill      payments) that are likely to increase in the future. This      trend is particularly significant because First-Class Mail      covers more than two-thirds of the Service's institutional      costs.       Changes in the mail mix: The Service's mail mix is changing      with declining volume for high-margin products, such as      First-Class Mail, and increasing volume of lower-margin      products, such as some types of Standard Mail. These changes      reduce revenues available to cover the Service's      institutional costs.       Increased competition from private delivery companies:      Private delivery companies dominate the market for parcels      greater than 2 pounds and appear to be making inroads into      the market for small parcels. Priority Mail volume fell 13.9      percent in fiscal year 2003 and over the last 3 years has      declined nearly 30 percent. Once a highly profitable growth      product for the Service, Priority Mail volume is declining as      the highly competitive parcel market turns to lower-priced      ground shipment alternatives. Express Mail volume is      declining for the same reason. In addition, United Parcel      Service (UPS) and FedEx have established national retail      networks through UPS's acquisition of MailBoxes Etc., now      called UPS Stores, and FedEx's recent acquisition of Kinko's.       Subpar revenue growth: The Service's revenues are budgeted      for zero growth in fiscal year 2004, which would be the first      year since postal reorganization that postal revenues have      failed to increase. However, as the Service has recognized,      even the zero-growth target will be challenging. In the      absence of revenue growth generated by increasing volume, the      Service must rely more heavily on rate increases to cover      rising costs and help finance capital investment needs.       Declining capital investment: The Service's capital cash      outlays declined from $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2000 to      $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2003, which was the lowest level      since fiscal year 1986, and far below the level of the late      1990s, when the Service spent more than $3 billion annually.      Capital cash outlays are budgeted to increase to $2.4 billion      in fiscal year 2004, but this level may not be sufficient to      enable the Service to fully fund its capital investment      needs. In the longer term, it is unclear what the Service's      needs will be to maintain and modernize its physical      infrastructure, as well as how these needs will be funded.       Renewed difficulties in substantially improving postal      productivity: The Service's productivity increased by 1.8      percent in fiscal year 2003 but is estimated to increase by      only 0.4 percent in fiscal year 2004. In the absence of mail      volume growth, substantial productivity increases will be      required to help cover cost increases generated by rising      wages and benefit costs and to mitigate rate increases.       Significant financial liabilities and obligations: Despite      the passage of legislation that reduced the Service's pension      obligations, the Service has about $88 billion to $98 billion      in liabilities and obligations that include $47 billion to      $57 billion in unfunded retiree health benefits. Under the      current pay-as-you-go system, the Service may have difficulty      financing its retiree health benefits obligation in the      future if mail volume trends continue to impact revenues      while costs in this area continue to rise. The Service has      recently proposed two options to Congress, so the Service      could prefund this obligation to the extent that it is      financially able.       Uncertain funding for emergency preparedness: The Service      requested $350 million for emergency preparedness for fiscal      year 2004, which it did not receive, and $779 million for      fiscal year 2005. If the money is not appropriated, funding      for this purpose may have to be built into postal rates.       Challenges to achieve sufficient cost cutting: The Service      achieved additional cost cutting to compensate for below-     budget revenues in fiscal year 2003. Despite this progress,      in the longer term it is unclear whether continued cost-     cutting efforts can offset declines in First-Class Mail      volume without impacting the quality of service.       Although we have discussed numerous actions that the Postal      Service can take within its existing authority to improve its      overall efficiency and effectiveness, we do not believe that      incremental steps toward postal transformation can resolve      the fundamental and systemic issues associated with the      Service's current business model. To avoid the risk of a      significant taxpayer bailout or dramatic postal rate      increases, we believe that Congress should enact      comprehensive postal reform legislation that includes the      Service's overall statutory framework, resolution of issues      regarding the Service's pension and retiree health benefits      obligations, and whether there is a continued need for an      escrow account.       The key areas of the Service's statutory framework that      need to be addressed include:       Clarifying the Service's mission and role by defining the      scope of universal service and the postal monopoly and by      clarifying the role of the Service in regard to competition      and its regulatory functions.       Enhancing governance, transparency, and accountability by      delineating public policy, operational, and regulatory      responsibilities; by ensuring managerial accountability      through a strong, well-qualified corporate-style board that      holds its officers responsible and accountable for achieving      real results; and by defining appropriate reporting      mechanisms to enhance the Service's transparency and      accountability for financial and performance results.       Improving flexibilities and oversight by balancing      increased flexibility for the Service--through streamlining      the rate-setting process and allowing a certain amount of      retained earnings--with appropriate oversight by a      independent regulatory body to protect postal customers      against undue discrimination, to restrict cross-subsidies,      and to ensure due process. In addition, the Service     needs additional flexibility to rationalize its      infrastructure and reshape its workforce. Any such additional      flexibility should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards      to prevent abuse along with enhanced transparency and      accountability mechanisms.       Making needed human capital reforms such as (1) determining      the Service's responsibility for pension costs related to      military service, funding retiree health benefits, and      determining what action to take on the escrow account      established in recent pension legislation; (2) deciding      whether postal workers' compensation benefits should be on      par with those in the private sector; and (3) clarifying pay      comparability standards.       We believe that Congress now has a rare opportunity to      assure the Service's long-term financial viability through      comprehensive postal reform legislation that addresses the      Service's key structural and systemic deficiencies, its      unfunded obligations, including its retiree health benefits      obligation, and the escrow requirement. Key legislative and      administrative actions in connection with transforming the      Postal Service can also serve as positive examples for other      key government transformation efforts.
