President, it is now my great pleasure to yield to the Senator from Mississippi, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Governmental Affairs with jurisdiction over the Postal Service. Senator Cochran held the very first hearings on deceptive mailings last year. He has been a tremendous supporter of the effort to curtail deceptive mailings. I really appreciate his leadership on this issue.
