And I've told my friends at Boeing that I don't know that that's going to be the conclusion. But I do know this: I am for working men and women having the right that they've had for some 70 years. And I believe that working men and women in America, organized or unorganized, are better off because we adopted a law to protect that right. Do not jettison.  And I close with this. I quote from a letter sent by hundreds of professors with expertise in this area: ``We are dismayed that a single complaint should be the basis for so fundamental a reversal of longstanding law.''  Do not take this step. Reject this bill. Vote ``no.''
