 This amendment will stop the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies funded in this bill from using the discriminatory method known as the senior death discount. Right now, heart disease, cancer, and strokes are the leading causes of death of people over 65. According to CDC, air pollution can be particularly devastating to the health of seniors.  The EPA should be creating regulations to protect everybody. However, now we are in the cost-benefit era, and that means each regulation has to be costed out. In other words, we must determine the burden regulations have on the private sector of our economy, including what will it cost them. We must also determine the benefit regulations have for all Americans.  In order to reach the proper evaluation of any regulation, you have to determine the cost of the harm that is being done. That is why this amendment is being offered.  Right now, the EPA is discounting the lives of senior citizens. You may have seen this ad in magazines and newspapers showing this forlorn senior. This lady has been told that since she is over the age of 70, she is only worth 63 percent of any other person, say someone age 69. You can understand her sadness, and a sadness that might be shared, incidentally, by some 19 Senators who are 70 years old or older. Try to tell these Senators they are worth only two-thirds of those younger, and you are in for a fight--and rightly so. Their lives are as important to them and to our Nation as anyone else's life.  We need to try to establish the cost to America in honest terms, to determine, for example, the real cost of the regulation relating to heavy diesel equipment, and not say senior citizens are worth less today than others.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of my amendment from the AARP be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         AARP,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2003.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     Senate Dirksen Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: AARP commends you for your efforts to      amend H.R. 2861, the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban      Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill for      Fiscal Year 2004, to prohibit the use of funds to ``apply      numerical values for adult premature mortality that differ      based on the age of the adult in a numerical estimate of the      costs and benefits of an agency action. . . .'' We urge that      you continue your efforts as the bill is folded into an      omnibus appropriations measure.       AARP submitted comments in May to the Office of Management      and Budget in response to its Draft 2003 Report to Congress      on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulations. In them, we      expressed our deep concerns regarding the arbitrary 37      percent discount to the life value of adults aged 70 and over      incorporated by the Environmental Protection Agency in its      cost-benefit analysis of the Administration's Clear Skies      Initiative. We noted that the discount lacked a sound      scientific basis, and we voiced concerns regarding its      ultimate impact not only on older persons, but on the rest of      the population as well.       OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs      subsequently called upon EPA to discontinue use of the age      adjustment factor cited above, and advised other federal      agency analysts that they should not use it either. At the      same time, the agency appeared to encourage other      methodologies that might assign monetary values for adult      premature mortality that differ based on the age of the      adult. Application of age-related analytical methodologies or      others involving population subgroupings--particularly when      monetary assessments are assigned to life value--hold great      risks. We are concerned that there may be insufficient      science to justify such action.       Again, AARP strongly supports your efforts as well as those      of Representative Thomas Allen, to ensure that the lives of      older people not be devalued, and that needed protections not      be shortchanged by the application of biased analytical      approaches. We urge your colleagues in conference to do the      same.       Should you have any questions, please contact me or have      your staff contact Jo Reed or Tim Gearan in our Federal      Affairs office at 202-434-3800.           Sincerely,                                                   Michael Naylor,                                             Director of Advocacy.
