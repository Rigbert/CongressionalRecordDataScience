Chairman, I want to make it clear the gentleman said ``this bill.'' This bill does not provide for any pay raise or cost of living adjustment for Members, with or without this provision. This provision prohibits what is provided for in the law that was passed in 1989 from going into effect so that when the bill comes those who demagogue the bill for being a pay raise are absolutely incorrect.  I know what the gentleman meant; I just wanted to clarify that.
