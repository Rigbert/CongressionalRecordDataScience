 Chairman, it seems to me if we are going to provide subsidies and incentives to corporations who are laying off hundreds and hundreds, if not millions of workers, then at the very least, it would be appropriate to say stop laying off workers here in the United States. To simply give these people incentives to invest abroad and then turn a blind eye on their disastrous policies here in America is a real sell-out of American workers.
