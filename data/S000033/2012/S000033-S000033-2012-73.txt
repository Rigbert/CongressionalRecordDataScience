 President, for a very long time, in a bipartisan way, a number of people have come together to save the U.S. Postal Service. Senator Lieberman and Senator Carper and Senator Collins and Senator Brown have worked very hard, as have many others, because if the Postal Service goes under or is dismembered, we are talking about 8 million jobs in this country--small businesspeople who are dependent on a strong Postal Service.  The Postmaster General originally was talking about shutting down 3,700 rural post offices in every State in this country. I hope Members understand that a post office in a rural town is more than just a post office. If that post office disappears, in many cases that town disappears. The Postmaster General was talking about specifically slowing mail delivery standards, shutting down half the processing plants in this country--over a short period of time, eliminating 200,000 jobs in this country.  I hope we can proceed, have a serious debate on these issues, hear all the amendments, but at the end of the day, I hope we will go forward and save the U.S. Postal Service.
