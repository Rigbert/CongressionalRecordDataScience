Speaker, I rise today to bring to your attention the retirement of Mr. David D. Clement, a key staff member on the Committee on Science. On March 21, 1997, Mr. Clement retired after 35 years of Government service.  Mr. Clement, a native of Vallejo, CA, began his career in the House of Representatives in June 1965 while still attending George Washington University. His early service on Capitol Hill included duty with the U.S. Capitol Police and the Clerk of the House. While serving as administrative assistant to the late Lawrence G. Williams, he was a congressional alternate member of the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission. He also served on the Republican staff of the Committee on Appropriations before joining the Science Committee in the spring of 1977. He was appointed as chief of staff and chief counsel by Congressman Robert S. Walker in January 1989.  Before coming to Washington, Clement served in the U.S. Marine Corps with the 1st Marine Division. He retired from the Naval Reserve in 1995.  He is a graduate of the George Washington University with a B.B.A. in 1969 and a M.S. in 1972. He also graduated from the George Mason University School of Law in 1980 and is a member of the bars of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Military Appeals, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and Mr. Clement's many friends, in thanking Mr. Clement for his many years of service to the United States of America.                          ____________________
