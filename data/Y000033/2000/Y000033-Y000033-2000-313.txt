Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman's amendment, if it had been narrow, would have been somewhat easier to look at and maybe understand, but it is so broad that it concerns me, because she strikes all the definitions, including the definition of ``wildlife-associated recreation.''  In our negotiations, I worked very hard to include in that hunting and fishing to be considered as one of the recreation activities to occur on these lands. Under her amendment, by striking the definitions, it would give the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, the ability to define what could occur on these lands. That is why I am worried about the amendment. It is so broad, it strikes everything. This, very frankly, is not the intent.  I am a hunter. I am a fisherman. I am a person who participates in the outdoors for a great many hours. Every hunting group that has any recognition at all supports this bill. The one group that does not support it is the animal rights group. There is a little contradictory work there. In fact, I am going over here in a little while to talk to the Safari Club that is actively involved in promoting this legislation. Members may not like that, but that is the fact of life, because they are the best conservation organization in existence in this world today, and I will say that without any reservation, and they are supporting this overwhelmingly.  I also recognize the importance and definition of activities that can include archery ranges and things like that. If we strike all these definitions, we really go to the problem of letting, again, the Secretary of the Interior make those decisions. I think that is incorrect.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall).
