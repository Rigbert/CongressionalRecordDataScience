President, I am very pleased today to join several of my colleagues--Senator Pryor, Senator DeWine, Senator Bingaman, Senator Smith, Senator Lieberman, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Coleman--in introducing the Keeping Families Together Act. This legislation is intended to reduce the barriers to care for children who are struggling with serious mental illness. It is intended to ensure their parents are no longer forced to give up custody of their children solely for the purpose of securing mental health treatment.  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, because he was an active participant in them, the Governmental Affairs Committee in the last Congress held extensive hearings on this issue.  What we heard was a tragedy. We heard case after case where familiesmade the wrenching choice to give up custody of their children in order to secure the mental health treatment that they needed. No family should ever be forced to make that decision.  Imagine what it feels like for a child who is suffering from mental illness to be wrenched from his family, put into either the juvenile justice system or the foster care system simply because that is the only way to get that child the care that he so desperately needs.  Serious mental illness afflicts millions of our Nation's children and adolescents. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of American children under the age of 17 suffer from a mental, emotional or behavioral illness. What I find most disturbing, however, is the fact that two-thirds of all young people who need mental health treatment are not getting it.  Behind each of these statistics is a family that is struggling to do the best it can to help a son or a daughter with serious mental health needs to be just like every other kid--to develop friendships, to do well in school, and to get along with their siblings and other family members. These children are almost always involved with more than one social service agency, including the mental health, special education, child welfare, or the juvenile justice systems. Yet no one agency, at either the State or the Federal level, is clearly responsible or accountable for helping these children and their families.  My interest in this issue was triggered by a compelling series of stories by Barbara Walsh in the Portland Press Herald which detailed the obstacles that many Maine families have faced in getting desperately needed mental health services for their children. Too many families in Maine and elsewhere have been forced to make wrenching decisions when they have been advised that the only way to get the care that their children so desperately need is to relinquish custody and place them in either the child welfare or juvenile justice system.  When a child has a serious physical health problem like diabetes or a heart condition, the family turns to their doctor. When the family includes a child with a serious mental illness, it is often forced to go to the child welfare or juvenile justice system to secure treatment.  Yet neither system is intended to serve children with serious mental illness. Child welfare systems are designed to protect children who have been abused or neglected. Juvenile justice systems are designed to rehabilitate children who have committed criminal or delinquent acts. While neither of these systems is equipped to care for a child with a serious mental illness, in far too many cases, there is nowhere else for the family to turn.  In some extreme cases, families feel forced to file charges against their child or to declare that they have abused or neglected them in order to get the care that they need. As one family advocate observed, ``Beat 'em up, lock 'em up, or give 'em up,'' characterizes the choices that some families face in their efforts to get help for their children's mental illness.  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a report that I requested with Representatives Pete Stark and Patrick Kennedy that found that, in 2001, parents placed more than 12,700 children into the child welfare or juvenile justice systems so that these children could receive mental health services. I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg, since 32 States--including five States with the largest populations of children--did not provide the GAO with any data.  Other studies indicate that the problem is even more pervasive. A 1999 survey by the National Alliance for the Mentally III found that 23 percent--or one in four of the parents surveyed--had been told by public officials that they needed to relinquish custody of their children to get care, and that one in five of these families had done so.  Some States have passed laws to limit custody or prohibit custody relinquishment. Simply banning the practice is not a solution, however, since it can leave children with mental illness and their families without services and care. Custody relinquishment is merely a symptom of the much larger problem, which is the lack of available, affordable and appropriate mental health services and support systems for these children and their families.  Last Congress, I chaired a series of hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee to examine this issue further. We heard compelling testimony from mothers who told us that they were advised that the only way to get the intensive care and services that their children needed was to relinquish custody and place them in the child welfare or juvenile justice system. This is a wrenching decision that no family should be forced to make. No parent should have to give up custody of his or her child just to get the services that the child needs.  The mothers also described the barriers they faced in getting care for their children. They told us about the limitations in both public and private insurance coverage. They also talked about the lack of coordination and communication among the various agencies and programs that service children with mental health needs. One parent, desperate for help for her twin boys, searched for 2 years until she finally located a program--which she characterized as ``the best kept secret in Illinois''--that was able to help.  Parents should not be bounced from agency to agency, knocking on every door they come to, in the hope that they will happen upon someone who has an answer. It simply should not be such a struggle for parents to get services and treatment for their children.  We also need to question what happens to these children when they are turned over to the child welfare or juvenile justice authorities. I released a report last year with Congressman Henry Waxman that found that all too often they are simply left to languish in juvenile detention centers, which are ill-equipped to meet their needs, while they wait for scarce mental health services.  Our report, which was based on a national survey of juvenile detention centers, found that the use of juvenile detention facilities to ``warehouse'' children with mental disorders is a serious national problem. It found that, over a six month period, nearly 15,000 young people--roughly 7 percent of all of the children in the centers surveyed--were detained solely because they were waiting for mental health services outside the juvenile justice system. Many were held without any charges pending against them, and the young people incarcerated unnecessarily while waiting for treatment were as young as seven years old. Finally, the report estimated that juvenile detention facilities are spending an estimated $100 million of the taxpayers' money each year simply to warehouse children and teenagers while they are waiting for mental health services.  The Keeping Families Together Act, which we are introducing today, will help to improve access to mental health services and assist states in eliminating the practice of parents relinquishing custody of their children solely for the purpose of securing treatment.  The legislation authorizes $55 million over 6 years for competitive grants to states to create an infrastructure to support and sustain statewide systems of care to serve children who are in custody or at risk of entering custody of the State for the purpose of receiving mental health services. States already dedicate significant dollars to serve children in state custody. These Family Support Grants would help States to serve children more effectively and efficiently, while keeping them at home with their families.  The legislation would also remove a current statutory barrier that prevents more States from using the Medicaid home and community-based services waiver to serve children with serious mental health needs. This waiver provides a promising way for States to address the underlying lack of mental health services for children that often leads to custody relinquishment. While a number of States have requested these waivers to serve children with developmental disabilities, very few have done so for children with serious mental health conditions. Our legislation would provide parity to children with mental illness by making it easier for States to offer them home- and community-based services under this waiver as an alternative to institutional care.  And finally, the legislation calls for the creation of a federal interagency task force to examine mental health issues in the child welfare and juvenilejustice systems and the role of those agencies in promoting access by children and youth to needed mental health services. The task force would also be charged with monitoring the Family Support grants, making recommendations to Congress on how to improve mental health services, and fostering interagency cooperation and removing interagency barriers that contribute to the problem of custody relinquishment.  The Keeping Families Together Act takes a critical step forward to meeting the needs of children with serious mental or emotional disorders. Our legislation has been endorsed by a broad coalition of mental health and children's groups, including the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Federation of Families for Children's Mental Health, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the National Child Welfare League, the National Mental Health Association, the American Correctional Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Fight Crime, Invest in Kids.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters of endorsement for the bill be printed in the Congressional Record, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 14, 2005.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Hon. Mark Pryor,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Jim Ramstad,     Hon. Nancy Johnson,     Hon. Pete Stark,     Hon. Patrick Kennedy,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Pryor and Representatives      Ramstad, Johnson, Stark, and Kennedy: As national      organizations representing mental health consumers, families,      advocates, professionals and providers dedicated to improving      the lives of children and adolescents living with mental      disorders and their families, we applaud your leadership in      reintroducing the Keeping Families Together Act in the 109th      Congress.       This legislation promises to help end a scandal that has      lingered too long in states throughout our nation. As you      know, thousands of families every year are forced to give up      custody of their children to the state in order to secure      vitally necessary mental health services. This unthinkable      practice tears families apart, is devastating for parents and      caregivers and leaves children feeling abandoned in their      hour of greatest need.       This practice occurs because most families have      discriminatory and restrictive caps on their private mental      health coverage or insurers fail to cover the required      treatment. The majority of these families are not eligible      for Medicaid coverage because of their income. This truly      unfortunate practice also exists because of the lack of      appropriate mental health services in many states and      communities for children and adolescents with mental      disorders. This was well documented in President Bush's New      Freedom Commission report on mental health (July 2003).       This legislation promises to help end this growing crisis      by providing grants to states to establish interagency      systems of care for children and adolescents with serious      mental disorders. The grants will allow states to build more      efficient and effective mental health systems for children      and families. It also eliminates barriers to home and      community-based care for children by enabling a greater      number of children to receive mental health services under      the Section 1915(c) Medicaid home- and community-based      waiver. The waiver promises to make appropriate services      available to children in their homes and communities and      close to their loved ones at a considerable cost savings over      providing those services in an institutional setting.       The legislation also calls for the creation of a federal      interagency task force to examine mental health issues in the      child welfare and juvenile justice systems. A GAO report      released in April 2003 showed that when parents give up      custody of their child to secure mental health services,      those children are placed in one of these two systems--     neither of which is designed to be a mental health service      agency.       No family in our nation should ever be asked to make the      heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights of their      seriously ill child in exchange for mental health treatment      and services.       We welcome this legislation as a critical step toward      ending this practice and toward delivering more cost      effective and appropriate services for children and families.       Once again, we thank you for your leadership and commitment      to ending this practice and for continuing to stand up for      children, families and common sense.

Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 2,000      sheriffs, police chiefs, prosecutors, and victims of violence      who constitute the national anti-crime group FIGHT CRIME:      INVEST IN KIDS, thank you for introducing the Keeping      Families Together Act. This bill would take an important step      toward ending the practice of inappropriately placing kids in      juvenile detention facilities solely because of the absence      of affordable and accessible mental health treatment for      them. These placements drain significant resources from an      already underfunded juvenile justice system, diverting      funding that would otherwise support effective violence      prevention programs for at-risk kids and intervention      programs for kids who have already committed a criminal or      delinquent act.       A July 2003 General Accounting Office report, Child Welfare      and Juvenile Justice: Several Factors Influence the Placement      of Children Solely to Obtain Mental Health Services, revealed      that over 9,000 kids in selected counties in 17 states were      placed in the juvenile justice system merely to obtain mental      health services. Furthermore, a House Committee on Government      Reform report demonstrated that two-thirds of juvenile      detention facilities inappropriately hold kids waiting for      mental health services. In 33 states, kids who did not have      any criminal charges were held in detention facilities while      awaiting community mental health treatment. Other kids had      been charged with an offense but would not have been placed      in detention but for the lack of available mental health      treatment. In fact, the House Committee report revealed that,      each night, nearly 2,000 kids wait in detention for community      mental health services, representing 7 percent of all youth      held in juvenile detention. It is estimated that juvenile      detention facilities spend approximately $100 million each      year to keep kids who are inappropriately placed as they wait      for mental health treatment. This cost does not account for      the additional service provision and staff time often needed      in juvenile facilities to care for kids with severe mental      health problems, although over half of responding facilities      reported that staff receives poor, very poor, or no mental      health training.       Every year, 1.4 million kids are charged with an offense      for which an adult could be tried in a criminal court. The      juvenile justice system is responsible for rehabilitating      these kids so that they can leave the system and become      productive citizens instead of continuing a life of crime, as      well as for preventing such acts in the first place.      Inappropriately placing kids who need mental health treatment      in juvenile detention facilities places an unnecessary      financial burden on the inadequately-resourced juvenile     justice system, and jeopardizes the safety of our      communities. The Keeping Families Together Act would provide      grants to help states provide and coordinate the needed array      of mental health services to children so that families do not      need to relinquish their kids to the juvenile justice system.      This legislation would also establish a federal interagency      task force to examine mental health issues in the child      welfare and juvenile justice systems.       We are proud that our Senator introduced the Keeping      Families Together Act to help keep families together, focus      juvenile justice resources on delinquent and at-risk kids,      and make our communities safer.           Sincerely,                                                     Mark Westrum,                                    Sheriff, Sagadahoc County, ME.
