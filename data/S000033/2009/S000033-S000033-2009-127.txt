 This amendment deals with an issue of significance to all 50 States in our country and maybe especially rural America.  In the midst of the financial crisis we are facing, our capabilities to support fire departments--both professional and volunteer--and the EMS services they provide is under great stress.  What my amendment would do is add $100 million for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program as well as for another important program for fire departments, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, or SAFER, Grant Program--$50 million for each program. In the $50 million for the SAFER Grant Program would be included $30 million that would go for addressing the real crisis rural volunteer fire departments are facing.  I say to the Presiding Officer, I do not know what the situation is in New Hampshire, but in Vermont--and I think in many parts of the country--we are seeing a real problem with recruitment and retention. Many people in urban areas may not understand that. But in rural America, most folks get their fire service and most folks get their EMS, their first responder service, from volunteers. If there are not volunteers available for one or another reason--and we have seen both recruitment and retention problems in volunteer fire departments--if those volunteers are not there, what is going to happen is, when fires happen, those fires are not going to be able to be contained. When somebody has a heart attack and dials 911, they are not going to get the kind of speedy ambulance service they need.  In the midst of this recession, what we are seeing is not only a reduction and a real stress on volunteer firefighting departments all over this country, and their EMS services, we are also seeing, in terms of professional firefighters, reductions in one part of the country after another part of the country, after another part of the country. Cities and towns under stress are cutting back, and they are doing it in ways which are certainly endangering the well-being and the health of the people in their communities.  Surveys by the International Association of Fire Fighters say that up to 5,000 firefighting jobs are in jeopardy. In Prince George's County, MD--not far from here--there is a new phenomenon called ``brownouts.'' This is where fire stations are closed, five at a time, to save money. In Atlanta, GA, the economic crisis has resulted in the shutting of five firehouses. In Flint, MI, 22 firefighters were laid off. Proposals in Columbus, OH, include laying off 238 firefighters. In Warren, OH, 17 firefighters received layoff notices. Orlando, FL, plans on laying off 46 firefighters. In Spokane, WA, up to 15 firefighting positions could be eliminated. There is also a serious problem about funding the equipment our firefighters need.  So we have a real problem. It seems to me at this moment this is a priority for this Nation, and it is something we should be addressing.  This amendment is supported by the volunteer firefighters of America.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the National Volunteer Fire Council. The National Volunteer Fire Council is strongly supporting this amendment, and they represent thousands of volunteer firefighters throughout this country.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              National Volunteer Fire Council,                                      Greenbelt, MD, July 9, 2009.     Hon. Bernie Sanders,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Robert Casey,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Sanders: I am writing to express the full      support of the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) for      your amendment to increase funding for the Assistance to      Firefighters Grant (AFG) program and the Staffing for      Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant program by      $50 million each in the FY 2010 Department of Homeland      Security Appropriations Act. The NVFC represents the      interests of the more than one million volunteer firefighters      and EMS personnel in the United States.       AFG helps fire departments and EMS agencies purchase      desperately needed equipment, apparatus and training. Nearly      20,000 fire departments applied for more than $3.1 billion in      funding through AFG in FY 2009--more than five times the $565      million appropriated for this year. The $380 million      allocation in the Committee-passed version of the FY 2010 DHS      Appropriations Act represents a reduction of 33 percent from      last year and is $10 million below the House-passed companion      bill.       AFG is a highly successful program that relies on input      from the fire service and a direct grant process to ensure      that funding quickly reaches the agencies that need it most.      An FY 2007 review of AFG by DHS found the program to be 95      percent effective, the second highest rating of any program      at DHS.       A needs assessment survey conducted by the Fireman's Fund      Insurance Company recently found that 60 percent of      respondents report that their fire department has delayed      equipment replacement purchases due to the economic downturn.      Fifty percent of respondents reported that if economic      conditions do not improve within the next 12 months that it      could affect their ability to provide service to their      communities. Local fire and EMS agencies need AFG funding now      more than ever.       SAFER funds assist fire departments to build staffing      capacity through hiring of career firefighters and      recruitment and retention of volunteers. There is no single      more significant challenge facing the volunteer fire service      than recruitment and retention. Since 1987, the percentage of      volunteer firefighters under the age of 40 has shrunk from 65      percent to approximately 50 percent today. As this trend      suggests, fire departments are increasingly having difficulty      recruiting and retaining the next generation of volunteer      firefighters. Volunteer fire departments can use recruitment      and retention funds for a variety of activities from      marketing campaigns to establishing modest incentive      programs.       Your amendment would provide critical additional funding to      assist first responders and signal to local fire and EMS      agencies that they remain an important national priority even      in these difficult budgetary times. Thank you again for      offering this amendment.           Sincerely,                                                  Heather Schafer,                                               Executive Director.
