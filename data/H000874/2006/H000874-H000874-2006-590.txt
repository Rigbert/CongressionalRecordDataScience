Speaker, I strongly support this important Resolution offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), urging the Russian Federation to fully protect the freedoms of all religious communities without distinction, whether registered or unregistered, as stipulated by the Russian Constitution and international standards.  It is undoubtedly true that the Russian Federation has made democratic progress since the breakup of the former Soviet Union. However, there is legitimate cause for concern that Russia is backsliding on some of the most basic democratic values, including the fundamental and inalienable human right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience.  As this Resolution points out, registration is critical for religious groups to fully enjoy their religious freedoms. In fact, many of the rights and privileges afforded to religious communities are contingent upon registration.  Yet, some religious communities have been unjustly denied registration or had their registration improperly terminated. Other religious communities refuse to seek registration on theological or other grounds. In addition, there have been arson attacks on unregistered Protestant churches, with little or no effective response to bring the perpetrators to justice. And, in some areas of the Russian Federation, law enforcement authorities have carried out violent actions against believers from unregistered communities peacefully practicing their faith.  These actions are counter to values that democratic society's embrace and they are simply unacceptable.  As the former Chair and Ranking Democrat on the Commission on Security and Cooperation and Europe, I am well aware of the history of religious persecution and discrimination in Russia. In fact, when I served as Chairman of the Commission, I frequently met with religious dissidents and their families in the former Soviet Union. For example, during a Congressional delegation trip in 1988, Congressman Smith and I met with Russian Baptists at the Hotel Pulkovo in Leningrad and with Father Gleb Yakunin at his apartment in Moscow. I also met with numerous Soviet Jewish refuseniks, some of whom were prosecuted for teaching Jewish traditions and history.  This Resolution, among other things, urges the Russian Federation to ensure full protection of freedoms for all religious communities without distinction, whether registered or unregistered, and to end the harassment of unregistered religious groups by the security apparatus and other government agencies. In addition, it urges the Russian Federation to vigorously investigate acts of violence against unregistered religious communities.  Mr. Speaker, I know there is sometimes a temptation to look upon Resolutions such as this one as mere words on paper without significant meaning. However, we know from experience that we must never under estimate the power of our democratic ideals and values.  The truth is, the signing of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975--with its emphasis on respect for human rights--was instrumental in focusing attention on human rights abuses, including religious persecution, in the former Soviet Union. And, the attention on these abuses was such an embarrassment to the former Soviet government that it slowly, if grudgingly, began to address them.  Today, we must be no less vigilant in holding the Russian government to account for these on-going abuses.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this Resolution.                          ____________________
