 President, I am pleased to join over 50 of my colleagues today in cosponsoring legislation to solve an unfortunate tax problem drastically affecting farmers in Washington State and throughout the Nation. This bill will prevent the alternative minimum tax from being applied to deferred payment contracts.  Farmers routinely use deferred payment contracts to assist their money management and farm operations. Wheat growers, potato growers, and other farmers in Washington State often enter into contracts requiring them to sell and deliver their crops on a specified date for a fixed amount. While these contracts may be entered into one year, the payments to the farmers agreed to in the contract, either in total or in part, often will not be received by the farmer until the following year. The Internal Revenue Service is now saying that farmers must pay taxes in the year of the contract, not the year of payment. I think it is wrong to require farmers to pay taxes on income they have not yet received. I believe most Americans would agree.  Farmers are not trying to avoid paying taxes. They simply consider it unfair to be burdened with a tax liability prior to receiving payment. I am particularly concerned about the retroactive approach the Internal Revenue Service has taken with regard to this issue. While the 1986 Tax Act omitted the exemption from the AMT for farmers, the IRS failed to impose the alternative minimum tax for 8 years. Now, all of a sudden, the IRS is imposing the AMT. And not only for the current year, but for all years open to audit. This could well cost family farmers tens of thousands of dollars. We cannot afford to impose such an egregious obligation on our family farms. It is not right. This bill will correct the situation.  This bill will make it clear that the alternative minimum tax shall not be applied to installment sales of farmers. It will insure that farmers pay taxes when they get paid, not before. It is that simple. While fancy terms like alternative minimum tax, deferred payment contracts, and installment sales of inventory property make the issue sound complex, it is really about simple tax fairness--paying taxes on income received, not on income expected.  The IRS Commissioner has stated that the IRS will not oppose this legislation. In addition, the Department of the Treasury welcomes ``the opportunity to work with [Congress] to address this matter through corrective legislation''. With a majority of the Senate cosponsoring this bill, my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and all parts of the country, I look forward to its timely consideration.                          ____________________
