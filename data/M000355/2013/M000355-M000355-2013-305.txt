 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend of mine and a distinguished citizen of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Mr. Robert Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell--better known across Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District as Bob--recently received the William Hacker, M.D. 2013 Leader of the Year Award from Kentucky's Leadership Tri-County. This organization, which represents Laurel, Knox, and Whitley counties, recognized Bob for his decades of service to the Bluegrass State.  From 1986 until his retirement last year, Bob served as Congressman Hal Rogers's district administrator for the Fifth District. In that job, he was Hal's eyes and ears throughout southern and eastern Kentucky. He oversaw three field offices, provided constituent services, and was Hal's liaison to State and local government. It is thanks to him that many people in Kentucky now enjoy the benefits of a multitude of infrastructure, economic development, and tourism projects.  Bob has also served as Hal's top political adviser and campaign manager, and was his field representative from 1981 to 1986. He has served on the executive committee of the Republican Party of Kentucky, been a delegate to Republican National Conventions, and was twice elected magistrate in Knox County.  Bob's father, the late Murrell Mitchell, also served as a magistrate of Knox County and was a member of the Knox County School Board. It was he who inspired Bob to seek fulfillment in public service. A graduate of Lynn Camp High School in Corbin, KY, Bob first served his country in the uniform of the U.S. Army. He was in the Army's military police and served in Vietnam.  Bob has been employed in the private sector, too: He has worked for L&N Railroad, United Parcel Service, and as the owner and operator of a grocery store. He has been a member of the Corbin Rotary Club and the Lynn Camp Optimist Club. And the Mountain Laurel Boy Scouts of America District honored him with its first-ever Daniel Boone Visionary Award.  Bob enjoys politics, obviously, as well as fishing and following college sports. He is an avid fan of Keeneland Race Course and has owned racehorses. But I believe what he is most looking forward to is spending more time withhis family and spoiling his grandkids. Bob and his wife, Nancy, have two daughters: Stephanie Alsip lives in Louisville with her husband Rick and their two sons, Trenton and Ethan. Jennifer Mitchell lives in Corbin with her two daughters, Tori Beth and Taelor Jade.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in saluting Mr. Robert Mitchell for over three decades of service to the people of my State. He is admired and respected across the Commonwealth as an ambassador, not just for Congressman Rogers, but for everything we're proud of in southern and eastern Kentucky. I wish Bob well in his retirement, and I rest assured he will find success in whatever endeavors lie ahead.                          ____________________
