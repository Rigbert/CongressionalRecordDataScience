President, it is my honor to pay tribute today to two exceptional Oklahomans and patriots, retired Army Chief Warrant Officer Michael ``Tony'' Dunne of Webber Falls, OK, and retired Army Chief Warrant Officer Brandon ``Ray'' Seabolt of Skiatook, OK. On August 14, 2018, both were awarded the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Valor, the highest civilian award presented by the Department of Defense.  On August 7, 2015, Tony was working at Camp Integrity, just north of Kabul, Afghanistan, executing duties as contractors for the Department of Defense when a potent vehicle-borne improvised explosive device impaled the main gate and knocked down a guard tower. Without hesitation, Tony rushed to the fight and evacuated a wounded servicemember from the scene, undoubtedly saving their life. From his actions that day and others, Tony has been honored for exceptional gallantry in repeatedly putting himself in harm's way to assist in countering multiple insurgent threats, helping to save lives at the risk of his own.  On December 17, 2015, Ray was serving as a counter-IED expert in congruence with U.S. Special Forces and Afghan partners when they were ambushed by enemy fire. Without regard for his own life, Ray jumped to action and single-handedly fended off the insurgent onslaught, allowing the recovery force to approach the scene with little resistance. Ray has deservedly been recognized for his bravery and confidence in supporting multiple engagements with the enemy with devastating effects and for providing tactical advice and assistance in the successful recovery of servicemembers.  Oklahoma is truly honored and proud to claim Tony and Ray, two patriots that exemplify the ultimate in bravery and courage in support of our country's most critical national security missions both at home and overseas.  Created in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Medal for Valor recognizes government employees and private citizens who perform an act of heroism or sacrifice, with voluntary risk to their personal safety in the face of danger. Tony and Ray's well-deserved medals, along with one other awarded on August 14, bring the total number of Medals for Valor to 17 awarded since September 11, 2001. This exemplifies the recognition of immense sacrifice that this small group has made for our Nation. Now, Tony and Ray's names will permanently reside in the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes, distinguished among our Nation's best.                          ____________________
