Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment would extend the authorization for the Park Service which, I think, most Members of this body support, particularly given the backlog we have heard about and the underfunding to levy these fees under what has been commonly called the Rec Fee Demo Program. However, it would not prematurely extend the authority to the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to extend these fees.  These fees, under current law for the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, are authorized by prior appropriation, not through the authorizing committee, through October 1 of next year. The authorizing committee has actually been processing, beginning work on an authorization bill, which will be the first time since 1996 that these were properly authorized for the Forest Service and the BLM. If this amendment would pass, that committee would have ample time to properly authorize the program before the expiration a year from next October.  So I think that this would address the concerns of many Members of the House who are split between those who feel very strongly we need these funds for the Park Service, and those of us who feel very strongly that levying these fees indiscriminately across the Forest Service and the BLM, to nondeveloped areas in particular, is of great concern. Basically, if you want to drive your car around a park and go hunting or go fishing or just walk with the kids or the dog, you have to buy a pass for nondeveloped sites, and a lot of us have strong concerns about that.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
