Mr. Speaker, as everyone is aware, the British and Irish Governments face an unprecedented opportunity to achieve real peace in Northern Ireland. For the first time since the partition of Ireland in 1922, all parties are participating in peace talks while a cease-fire is in effect.  The Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, has held two hearings on human rights abuses in Northern Ireland and on the prospects for improved human rights conditions as part of the current peace talks. At our hearings, international and American human rights experts, as well as victims and relatives of victims, provided compelling and eye-opening testimony about human rights abuses, the disregard for the rule of law, and the personal tragedies people in Northern Ireland have endured. All of our witnesses welcomed the interest and support of the U.S. Government and affirmed that American standards and ideals are critical to the success of the process.  After the first hearing, I led a human rights, peace mission to the north of Ireland. I met with leaders from political parties on all sides of the conflict and with key officials in the Government, including Secretary of State Mo Mowlam. I was pleased by Secretary Mowlam's intimate understanding of the human rights concerns and remain hopeful that human rights protections will be afforded to members of all communities in Northern Ireland.  While optimistic, I remain cautiously optimistic.  Unfortunately, not even the best of intentions guarantee that the final agreement will genuinely protect human rights. In peace processes around the world, most recently in Bosnia, and Guatemala, we have seen that the atmosphere at these negotiations, the pressure to get an agreement, and the reluctance to reopen old wounds can have the unfortunate side effect of making human rights an after-thought rather than a central element to the agreement.  I submit for the Record today, Mr. Speaker, my bill as amended, House Concurrent Resolution 152 which condemns violence and urges the participants of the multiparty talks in Northern Ireland to fully integrate internationally recognized human rights standards as part of the peace process. This resolution, which has broad bipartisan support and has been approved by the full International Relations Committee, puts Congress on record supporting human rights reforms in Northern Ireland. The text of the resolution is a culmination of information gathered on the trip and at the hearings. It identifies abuses and pronounces concrete recommendations for advancing human rights and building a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  In addition to condemning the violent crimes of paramilitary groups on both sides of the conflict, House Concurrent Resolution 152 addresses the failures of the British Government. Notwithstanding the abuses perpetrated by partisan paramilitary forces, or by the police for that matter, we must remember that the central responsibility for protecting rights and maintaining the rule of law belongs to the Government--which in this case, at this particular time, is the British Government. When governments resort to methods that are illegal, unjust, or inhumane, even when these methods are seemingly directed against the guilty or the dangerous, the effect is not to preserve law and order but to undermine it.  It is particularly saddening that the British Government, America's trusted ally, is the object of serious and credible charges of disrespect for the rule of law in the north of Ireland. All of the major human rights organizations, Amnesty International, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch have been particularly critical of pervasive restrictions on the due process of law in Northern Ireland and they have testified that law enforcement officials of the United Kingdom, members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, tolerate, and even perpetrate some of the gross abuses that have taken place in the north of Ireland.  Under emergency legislation applicable only to Northern Ireland, police have expansive powers to arrest and detain suspects and to search premises without a warrant. In addition, the Government can suspend the right to trial by jury--the much maligned Diplock Courts System--and the universally recognized right to be preserved from self-incrimination has been abridged.  It seems to me that the power to arbitrarily arrest, detain, intimidate; the power to deny timely and appropriate legal counsel; and the power to compel self-incrimination is an abuse of power normally associated with our adversaries, Mr. Speaker, not our allies.  Thus the resolution is a wake up call to our friends. Friends don't let friends abuse human rights.  Witness after witness at our hearings expressed a fear that as political issues are addressed, universal human rights such as the right to silence, the right to jury trial, the right to attorneys, and the right to work free of discrimination, just to name a few, will be neglected.  My resolution, which has broad bipartisan support, notifies negotiators in Belfast that the U.S. Congress believes that there must be reform on human rights issues if genuine peace is to be achieved. The resolution condemns political violence and recommends:  The establishment of a bill of rights for all citizens of the North;  A ``Truth Commission'', with international input, to investigate outstanding human rights abuses;  The repeal of the so-called ``emergency legislation'' which has limited human rights in Northern Ireland for over 25 years;  The establishment of a truly independent complaints mechanism for citizen inquiries regarding the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and other security forces; and  A ban on plastic bullets.  Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 152 has been reviewed and endorsed by the major human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, British Irish Rights Watch, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. In addition, the Irish National Caucus, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and the Hibernian Civil Rights Coalition have all urged swift passage of this Northern Ireland Human Rights Resolutions.  We have an obligation to do all that we can to ensure that this historic opportunity for the promotion and establishment of human rights for everyone in Northern Ireland is not squandered. I have been advised by leadership staff that when Congress reconvenes in January, we will look to move House Concurrent Resolution 152. In the meantime, it is my sincerest hope that negotiators at the current talks will need our call for addressing outstanding human rights violations and fully integrating human rights standards as part of the peace process. Without a strong human rights foundation, it is unlikely that any proposed peace settlement will be just or lasting.  I ask that House Concurrent Resolution 152, as amended, a list of current cosponsors, and a fact sheet of comments made by human rights groups about the resolution be made part of the Record.              Human Rights Groups Endorse H. Con. Res. 152       Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, British Irish      Rights Watch, Committee on the Administration of Justice,      Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and others urge passage of      Northern Ireland Human Rights Resolution.       ``Human Rights Watch fully supports the resolution now      being considered for passage by the Congress regarding human      rights in the Northern Ireland peace process. The resolution      rightly recognizes the gravity of past violations and the      role that such abuses have played in perpetuating the      conflict . . . the resolution is a signal that Congress is      eager to prevent the same lack of attention to human rights      issues which has doomed other peace processes and may      threaten the success of the Northern Ireland peace process if      action is not taken now . . . We heartily endorse the      resolution.''--Human Rights Watch       ``Amnesty International welcomes the resolution proposed by      the Congress which situates the centrality of human rights      within the peace process and raises a number of key concerns      which are in line with many of our own concerns. The      recommendations [in the resolution], if acted upon, would      make a significant contribution to developing a lasting peace      in Northern Ireland.''--Amnesty International       ``We very much welcome this resolution. It's the first      document of its kind that we have seen that does acknowledge      the role that human rights must play in the Northern Ireland      peace process. The individual issues that it raises are all      matters of burning concern to the people of Northern      Ireland.''--British Irish Rights Watch       ``Any effort by Congress to raise these [human rights]      issues is particularly welcome and deserves widespread      support. In that regard, the initiative taken by Chairman      Smith and supported by other members in relation to the      resolution on these issues and others is particularly welcome      . . . it would be helpful if the concerns of Congress on      these and other human rights could be raised with the British      and Irish governments, Senator Mitchell, and with the U.S.      administration . . . We look to the resolution receiving      widespread support and are grateful for the efforts of      Congress and hope they will continue.''--Committee on the      Administration of Justice       ``We join in your call expressed in the concurrent      resolution for repeal of emergency laws and the establishment      of a mechanism for independent investigations of threats and      intimidation of solicitors. We urge Congress to . . .      continue to press its concerns about human rights in Northern      Ireland . . . ''--Lawyers Committee for Human Rights                                  ____                            H. Con. Res. 152       Expressing the sense of the Congress that all parties to      the multi-party peace talks regarding Northern Ireland should      condemn violence, adequately address outstanding human rights      violations and fully integrate internationally recognized      human rights standards as part of the peace process.       Whereas approximately 3,000 people have died and thousands      more have been injured as a result of the political violence      in Northern Ireland since 1969;       Whereas the denial of human rights has been at the heart of      the violence and the conflict in Northern Ireland;       Whereas the Department of State's Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices for 1996 states that both Republican and      Loyalist paramilitary groups have engaged in vigilante      punishment attacks and the exile of informers ``by force'';       Whereas the Department of State's Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices for 1996 also states that members of the      Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), Northern Ireland's police      force, have committed human rights abuses;       Whereas emergency legislation, namely the Northern Ireland      Emergency Provisions Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act,      have provided the RUC with sweeping powers to arrest and      detain suspects without being charged, deny them access to      counsel for extended periods of time, and search their      premises without a warrant;       Whereas an unnecessary reliance on emergency powers and the      absence of jury trials in Diplock courts has created      significant problems in the judiciary in Northern Ireland,      including a dependency on confessions obtained through      abusive police tactics and the acceptance of uncorroborated      police statements;       Whereas these Diplock courts have, among other abuses,      violated the right to remain silent and have inconsistently      applied the controversial doctrine of common purpose,      convicting people such as Sean Kelly and Michael Timmons on      the premise that they should have anticipated the actions of      others around them;       Whereas the United Nations Committee Against Torture, the      United Nations Human Rights Committee, the European Court of      Human Rights and the United States Department of State's      Country Reports on Human Rights have raised serious concerns      about mistreatment of detainees in Northern Ireland in      prisons and in special holding centers where confessions have      been forced from people such as William Bell under duress;       Whereas the emergency laws have also led to life      threatening intimidation of defense attorneys and      interference in the attorney-client relationship;       Whereas the government authorities have failed to provide      an effective means of independently investigating threats      against solicitors and complaints of police harassment and      abuse raised by citizens and solicitors;       Whereas the murder of Patrick Finucane, a leading defense      and civil rights solicitor, is just one case in which the      government has refused to release the findings of its      inquiries and has ignored the call for independent public      inquiry for the purposes of identifying responsible parties;       Whereas in contravention of internationally recognized      standards and despite criticism by the United Nations      Committee Against Torture and the European Parliament, the      British Government uses plastic bullets only in Northern      Ireland and in a way that appears sectarian;       Whereas Catholic males are more than twice as likely as      Protestant males to be unemployed, and a series of important      proposals concerning employment equality await serious      attention by the government;       Whereas the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, the 1993 Joint      Declaration, and the 1995 Framework Document were signed by      the British and Irish Governments and have led to the multi-     party talks aimed at facilitating justice, peace, stability,      and an end to violence in Northern Ireland;       Whereas the multi-party talks, attended by the      representatives of the British and Irish Governments and      representatives elected from the political parties and      chaired by former United States Senator George Mitchell,      resumed on September 15, 1997;       Whereas for the first time since the partition of Ireland      in 1922 both sides of the conflict are attending multi-party      peace talks creating a momentous opportunity for progress on      human rights concerns; and       Whereas the objectives of the United States, which has      contributed to the International Fund for Ireland, has always      been to help facilitate a just and lasting peace based on a      guarantee of human rights and fair employment opportunities      for members on all sides of the conflict: Now therefore, be      it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) the Congress condemns the violence committed by      paramilitary groups on both sides of the conflict in Norther      Ireland and, at times, by agents of the British Government,      as illegal, unjust, and inhumane;       (2) the Congress commends and supports the new leadership      in both the British and Irish governments for fostering a new      environment in which human rights may be addressed and an      agreement may be reached expiditiously through inclusive      talks;       (3) the Congress commends the work of former United States      Senator George Mitchell, who as the Independent Chairman of      the talks has authored the ``Mitchell Principles'', signed by      all participants, rejecting violence and emphasizing      democratic, peaceful means for resolving the outstanding      political issues; and       (4) it is the sense of the Congress that--       (A) human rights abuses have been at the heart of the      conflict in Northern Ireland and respect for human rights      must now be at the heart of the peace process;       (B) human rights should be protected for all citizens in a      society and any peace agreement in Northern Ireland must      recognize the state's obligation to protect human rights in      all circumstances;       (C) the establishment of a bill of rights for the people of      Northern Ireland may advance and strengthen the peace      process;       (D) the multiparty negotiations should consider the      feasibility of establishing an independent ``Truth      Commission'', with international input, to look into      outstanding cases of human rights abuses committed by all      sides of the conflict, giving special consideration to those      who have been unable to obtain full disclosure about how      their loved ones met their deaths;       (E) during this unprecedented period of peace and all party      talks, emergency legislation that limits human rights should      be repealed;       (F) a truly indpendent compliants mechanism for the review      of citizen inquiries regarding alleged abuses of the Royal      Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and other security forces should be      established;       (G) there should be a mechanism by which all defense      solicitors have a vigorous independent investigation of      threats they receive and are accorded effective protection;      and       (H) plastic bullets hould be withdrawn from use in      accordance with the recommendations of the European      Parliament and many other international and local bodies.                               ____________________
