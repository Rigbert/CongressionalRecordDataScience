Chairman, I know the gentleman from Florida's speech was written by his staff, but he said that we could not pursue Osama bin Laden. If he had listened to my speech where I quoted back legislation that he voted for and I voted for which authorized the war with Afghanistan, it went on to the fact of any nation that harbors such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism. That pretty well covers Osama bin Laden.  I do not appreciate the gentleman raising these bizarre allegations. He may disagree with me, he may want to cede this authority to the President of the United States and abdicate our constitutional duties. That is fine. But do not raise these false issues. It does not go to Osama bin Laden. He is already covered. It does not go to Iraq. It is already covered. It does not go to a third country that is potentially threatening or any group threatening the United States. That is covered under war powers.
