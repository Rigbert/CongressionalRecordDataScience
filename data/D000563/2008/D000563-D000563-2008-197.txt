President, reserving the right to object, I am speaking on behalf of Senator Baucus. I note that the Senator from Iowa realizes the bill that was before us yesterday, S. 3335, would not only have taken care of his State of Iowa, which truly deserves disaster assistance, but also my State of Illinois and all of the States that faced that disaster problem this year. Unfortunately, it did not pass; otherwise, it would have been on its way to the House yesterday. Had we received more than five Republican votes, it might have passed the House and be on its way to the President. But the decision was made on the Republican side of the aisle not to vote for that measure that would have helped Iowa, Illinois, and all of the States.  The measure Senator Grassley brings before us leaves behind victims of disasters in States of Nevada, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas--to name a few--who would receive no relief under Senator Grassley's bill but would have under the bill he opposed. So it is sad. I wish this could have been resolved yesterday with the vote if the Republicans would have joined us. Unfortunately, they did not. We will have to take this matter up when we return. I hope we can find a way to help all of the victims, not just in the Midwest but all across the country, which is the tradition of the Senate and the House. Regretfully, I object.
