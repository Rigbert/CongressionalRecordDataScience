 President, I introduce important tax legislation to improve our Nation's soil conservation and water quality. This measure will extend the conservation expense income tax deduction to farmers who improve soil and water conservation and rent that farmland to family members on a cash basis. This legislation builds upon an existing and successful income tax provision that applies to similar improvements on share-crop rentals. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and thereby endorse an environmental tax policy that uniformly encourages conservation improvements on our Nation's farms.  Among all of our Nation's farmland, 4 out of 5 acres in the United States rely on private landowners and tenants to care for the natural resources. Even though all farmers should be encouraged to become good stewards of the land, current tax policy does not provide incentives to help all private landowners and tenants to make conservation improvements that are consistent with environmental policy. On the one hand, farm landlords operating on a share-crop basis are rewarded with an income tax deduction for soil and water conservation improvements. However, cash rent landlords who make the same conservation improvements are denied a similar income tax deduction. My legislation will eliminate this inequality.  Mr. President, 43 percent of our Nation's farmland is rented. Of that farmland, 35 percent is rented on a share-crop basis, and 65 percent is rented on a cash basis. Share-crop rentals are arrangements where landlords typically contribute the real estate and improvements, and tenants contribute the labor. Cash rentals are also arrangements where landlords usually contribute the real estate and improvements. However, the landlords also contribute labor since these agreements are many times within a family farm environment.  To further compare, share-crop landlords may deduct certain costs paid or incurred for the treatment or moving of earth for soil and water conservation such as leveling, conditioning, grading, and terracing farmland. Likewise, share-crop landlords may also deduct costs incurred to build and maintain drainage ditches and earthen dams. Cash rentals, however, are not provided a tax deduction even though they practice similar conservation methods. In other words, with the substance between these rentals being often the same, the tax treatment of conservation expenses is vastly different.  Mr. President, it may surprise you to know that many family farmers are cash rent landlords. The life cycle of a family farm is one where aging parents gradually pass the family farm to their sons or daughters. In many cases, because the children cannot initially afford to purchase the family farms from their parents, a parent-child business relationship often starts out as a rental. Sometimes it is a share-crop rental, other time they agree to a cash rent relationship.  Unfortunately, our tax and environmental policy toward these two relationships remains irrational. If a landlord share-crops with a stranger, then that landlord can deduct conservation expenditures. However, if a widowed farm-wife cash rents farmland to her daughter and watches over the grandchildren while she is in the field, the grandmother cannot deduct conservation expenditures. Furthermore, a retired father who cash rents to his son and provides labor assistance during harvest is denied a conservation tax deduction.  I believe that our tax policy should encourage and reward sound soil conservation practices regardless of the situation of the farmers. At a minimum, our tax policy should reward family farmers who make long term soil conservation improvements to any of their farmland. In fact, these sound conservation practices have already aided many farmers in reducing our level of soil erosion. The USDA reported in its 1992 Natural Resources Inventory that soil erosion has decreased by 1 billion tons annually. The USDA attributes one half of that decrease to improved conservation efforts by farmers. Nonetheless, our Nation's tax policy requires that family farmers on a cash rent basis bear much of the expense of this successful environmental policy. My legislation fixes this problem. Surely, it will yield even further soil and water conservation of our Nation's most valuable non-renewable resource, farmland.                          ____________________
