 President, I say to my friend from Texas, I don't know for sure, but the way the process will work--we have seen it before under majorities of both parties--is the majority leader has the ability to fill up the tree and then deny any amendments or pick amendments. Only the majority leader would be able to answer the question whether an amendment dealing with workplace enforcement or an amendment dealing with border security or, in the case of this Senator, an amendment dealing with the H-2A agricultural worker program, which is important to my State--all of that would be within the sole authority of the majority leader, who would pick and choose if any amendments were allowed, pick and choose which ones were given a chance to have a vote.  I say to my colleagues here on the minority side, we will have little or no control--or none, no control at all over what amendments would be allowed. It would be entirely controlled by the majority leader.
