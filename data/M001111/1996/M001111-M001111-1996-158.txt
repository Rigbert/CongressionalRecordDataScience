 President, let me congratulate my colleague, the minority leader, for an excellent statement. I hope that all of our colleagues take time to read it. Certainly, we do stop and question our role in the world often on this floor, and I think the words that Senator Daschle just gave to us are words that we all should heed. I appreciate his statement.                          ____________________
