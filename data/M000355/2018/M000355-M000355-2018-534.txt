 President, on an entirely different matter, last week, our efforts to restore regular appropriations hit another milestone. The President signed into law our first appropriations package. It will fund critical efforts in energy research and security, waterways and infrastructure projects, and in improving care at the VA.  Earlier this month, the Senate passed the conference report that will fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We anticipate that the House will take up the package this week, and work continues on other important legislation.  Soon, we will act to provide long-term stability and reforms to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board. We will also take up America's Water Infrastructure Act, which will bolster the efforts of the Army Corps of Engineers and make commitments to improving water quality and advancing hydropower.  Most immediately, we will continue to process the President's well-qualified nominees. We are, today, considering Jackie Wolcott to serve as U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and as U.S. Representative to the United Nations in Vienna. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her.                          ____________________
