It is timely because this week Congress will be voting on this unfunded mandate legislation.  If you read the description of this legislation on its face it seems so simple, so clear, so easy. It is legislation to discourage lawmakers from telling State and local governments what to do without providing them the money to do it. That is so basic who could argue with it? But life is a little more complicated.  [[Page H281]] As the gentleman from California has just told us, when you start applying it in specific instances, it raises a lot of questions. Some of the more conservative Members of the House and Senate that I have spoken to over the last several days, in positing questions to them, how would it affect environmental laws and the like, they said, well, I never thought of that; there must be an exception in the bill for that.  The fact is there is not. It is a good concept, but the Republicans in the House have taken the concept of unfunded mandates, they have gone too far, they have gone too fast, and they have gone to extremes.  Just consider when the committee sat and met on this bill, just last week, a few days ago, the chairman, the Republican chairman of the committee decided after they, the panel had defeated three Democratic proposals for committee rules changes on party line votes, they ended up saying that they would not have a hearing on this bill. They were just going to mark up the bill. No witnesses came in from the outside to testify. This bill was pushed through as part of the ``100 day breakneck speed, let us get it all done and get out of here'' approach. It is headed to the floor this week.  In their haste to pass unfunded mandates, the Republicans have ignored very real health and safety problems. They would create with this legislation concerns that every American family has to sit up and take notice of. Let me give you an example.  In many ways unfunded mandates legislation proposed by the Republicans puts the health and safety of our families at risk. The gentleman from California has talked about the clean air provisions, the clean water provisions. My district is on the Illinois River and the Mississippi River. And frankly, what is dumped in that river upstream is what we have to live with downstream. This is not a State-by-State concern. This is a national concern. It is one where we want to have consistent standards. If the Republican unfunded mandate approach prevails, future regulations of municipal discharges into that river will frankly be unenforceable. So they can set their own standards. And if some town upstream decides it, just by their own hook or crook, they are going to put in that river what they want to, we live with it downstream. That becomes our water supply. That becomes our channel for commerce in the Middle West. We have to live with what they dump because we are not going to go so far as to say, it is a Federal mandate.  The same thing is true when it comes to radioactive waste disposal. There are States which own nuclear powerplants. We have provisions in Federal law which apply to the privately owned plants as well as the government-owned plants in terms of their operation, safety and disposal of nuclear waste. If the Republican approach passes, future reauthorization of those bills establishing those standards will exempt, exempt the government-owned nuclear powerplants. Does that make any sense at all? Should we not have one consistent standard in America when it comes to safety?  Let me tell you another one. Where I live in central Illinois, because we have a lot of land out there, we have become dumping grounds for landfills taking the waste from all over the eastern seaboard. I have a lot of affection for my colleagues from New York City and particularly Brooklyn, NY, but I go to Taylorville, IL, and look at the landfill and see these boxcars coming in full of waste from Brooklyn, NY, being dumped in my backyard in Taylorville, IL, bad enough. But consider the fact that across the United States, there are 7,000 landfills owned by State and local governments which will now be exempt from future standards and changes in regulations by this Republican unfunded mandate bill. It means that Waste Management and other giants in the industry will be governed by Federal standards; those owned by State and local governments, those landfills will not. Do the families living in those communities around there think that is a better deal? I doubt it.  When they are concerned about the quality of water, the aquifer, the runoff, when they are concerned about the health of their children, serious concerns about cancer and disease, they want a consistent national standard. Who can blame them. That is what I want for my family.  Workplace safety, the gentleman from California spoke to. Let me mention one other: disaster standards. Think of the money this Federal Government spends every year on disasters. And we come in and say, we are going to establish standards so that in Illinois and California, Florida and wherever, if you want to qualify for Federal disaster relief, then for goodness sakes, help us out. Do not let people build on the flood plain. Do things to lessen damage, do not come to us and ignore these standards and hand us the bill.  But guess what? Republican unfunded mandate legislation, when it is all said and done, will say to your Governor, Pete Wilson, Mr. Rohrabacher, do what you want. Set your own standards. But then come rattling the cup afterwards, when you have a mud slide or earthquake. That is not fair. That is not fair to the Federal taxpayers. But because the Republicans put this bill together so quickly and in such haste to put it on the floor, they never stopped to consider the impact this is going to have.  This bill, the Republican unfunded mandate bill, unless it is changed on this floor, is a deadbeat's dream. Deadbeat fathers who do not pay child support, deadbeat companies that are polluting, deadbeat government units that will not accept their responsibilities, they are going to be doing what they want and we are going to end up holding the bag at the Federal level.  Let me say, I think the concept behind unfunded mandates is correct. I think the review of Government decisions that have an economic impact on local units of government is the right thing to do. But because we tried to do this overnight, in a hurry, slap it together, put it on the books and get moving, we are not stopping to think of the consequences.  I tell you this, we will be living with them. We will be living with the consequences. Because down the line, when it does not work, when thing have fallen apart, guess whose door is going to get knocked on? The same door that your Governor, Pete Wilson, knocks on every time he is in trouble, Uncle Sam's door. Please bail us out.  I do not think that is fair.                              {time}  1330  That may be your view of new federalism. It is not mine.
