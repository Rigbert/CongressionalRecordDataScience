I think it is important to remind those who are following this debate why we are here. We are here trying to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. We want there to be a debate between Democrats and Republicans on giving patients and families across America some rights when it comes to dealing with these insurance companies. The Republican leadership does not want this debate. We think the American people do. We think that is why we were elected--because families across America know there is real concern when you take your child to the hospital.  I literally ran into a doctor from Highland Park, IL, Sunday night who told me a terrible situation that just happened to him a week before. He is a cardiologist. A woman came in to see him in his office on a Thursday complaining of chest pains. He was worried and said: I want to get you into the hospital tomorrow morning for catheterization. It is a diagnostic process to find out what was wrong with her heart. She said: Fine. He said: We will do it tomorrow morning.  He called her insurance company. The insurance company said: No, we don't approve of the hospital where you want to send her. Let us call our hospital under her insurance policy, and we will see when we can get her scheduled.  They told that to the doctor on Friday. They never had a chance to schedule it. She passed away on Sunday. That was a decision made by the insurance company not to let this woman go to a hospital on a Friday morning to get the catheterization. They did not understand her problem.  Is this not what this debate is all about?
