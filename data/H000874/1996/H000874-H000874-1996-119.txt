Chairman, I would like to comment just briefly.  I tell my friend from Minnesota this is the easy work: 1.9 percent across the board is not a hard lift. What is a hard lift is telling people, ``You're not going to get as much money next year in Social Security or Federal retirement or on Medicare or Medicaid.'' I understand that. We have had that debate.  That is the hard business. Why? Because, I tell my friend from Minnesota, we are spending less and less and less on discretionary spending in America every year.
