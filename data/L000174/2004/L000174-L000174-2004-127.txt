Reid, and the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. McConnell. They were able to finish up the bill. I say again--as I said in my statement complimenting the Senator from Kentucky and his able staff and also my able staff--we have set an all-time record on a very complex piece of legislation in getting it through. I compliment the Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL. I compliment my friend from Vermont. Maybe we can break our record next year.  I extend my thanks to Paul Grove, the majority staff director, for his fine work on this bill; Tim Rieser, as well, on the Democratic side. It is always a pleasure to work with them. They are great professionals who have done a marvelous job in smoothing the passage that we have achieved tonight on voice vote.                          ____________________
