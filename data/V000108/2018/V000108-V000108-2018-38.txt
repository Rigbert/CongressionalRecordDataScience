Speaker, on June 12, 2018, I was absent from the House and missed Roll Call votes 258, 259, and 260.   Had I been present for Roll Call 258, on Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 5327, the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act, I would have voted Yes.   Had I been present for Roll Call 259, on Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 5041, the Safe Disposal of Unused Medication Act, I would have voted Yes.   Had I been present for Roll Call 260, on Approving the Journal, I would have voted No.                          ____________________
