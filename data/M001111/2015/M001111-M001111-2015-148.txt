 President, many of us have been working for years to protect Medicare access for seniors, invest in our community health centers, and expand access to health care for our children. So I am glad Democrats and Republicans in the House were able to come together on these issues. But it is disappointing that in a bill which takes so many good bipartisan steps forward, Republicans have insisted on trying to score political points with their base on women's health.  The House SGR bill includes language that is just one more example of using women's health as a political football. It is redundant, and it is unnecessary.  I am offering an amendment tonight that shows we are making sure women have comprehensive access to healthcare. It focuses on moving women's health care forward by providing a clean extension of community health care funding for 4 years, not 2, to provide certainty. It will invest $2 billion in safety net providers for women and their families through title X clinics. Finally, it will invest in strengthening the women's health care workforce to make sure women have access through their providers.  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.
