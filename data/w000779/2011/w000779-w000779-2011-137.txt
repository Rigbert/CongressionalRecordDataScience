The Senator from Washington juxtaposed their position compared to the speculators. Those people have a lot higher tax rate, for example, than do the speculators. So there is one advantage after another that the speculators have over the people about whom my colleague and I are concerned.  Is it the understanding of my colleague that the next best step to helpthose people and small businesses who need oil on a daily basis is to get the CFTC out of the regulatory swamp and to enact these position limits?
