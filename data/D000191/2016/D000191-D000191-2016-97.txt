Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott).  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I come down here to oppose this bill. I am not on the committee, but I was sitting in my office and it made me angry to hear people down here talking about H.R. 897.  You put out a title that says Zika Vector Control Act. That sounds like a good thing. People ought to be happy we are going to control the specter that is out there. But it is a lie.  This does nothing about Zika. It doesn't do anything with the research that the President has asked the money for. What it does simply is turn the applicators and the pesticide manufacturers loose on this country again.  I have been here long enough to remember all of the problems with the bird eggs that had soft shells and the birds were dying. All these animals were dying all over the place because of DDT and all of the things that happen with that kind of application freely in this society.  One of the things that you have to think about and what I would caution my congressional friends in the Republican Caucus of is that you ought to learn from history. Philadelphia was once full of malaria. Philadelphia was a malaria city. You kept the windows closed at night because you didn't want to get malaria.  Now, what we are seeing today because of global warming is that moving north from the equator are the organisms that create disease.  I heard somebody from Louisiana say: Oh, my God. We have got malaria. We have got all kinds of problems in Louisiana.  You are going to have them. You can find evidence everywhere that these organisms are there. But the answer is not to let there be unrestricted and uncontrolled application of pesticides.  That doesn't solve the problem because what it does is it creates another set of illnesses related to the effects of pesticides on human beings and on animals and on reproduction.  So what you are doing is you are saying: Well, if you spread this stuff out on the ground and all over the water and people are going to get in contact with that water, there is no question about it, directly or indirectly, and you are going to have the other diseases that come from this.  I won't give a whole long lecture on the effects of pesticides on people, but I will remind Members about something called Agent Orange.                              {time}  1400  Guys like me who were around during the Vietnam war saw that stuff being sprayed all over the trees. People said: Oh, that doesn't do anything. It is just that the leaves drop off.  Then we had an epidemic of physical illnesses that were secondary to Agent Orange. We told veterans for years: It is not a problem. It is not a problem. It was not that Agent Orange that got you.  Then we found out that, in fact, it was, and we have been paying and paying and paying.
