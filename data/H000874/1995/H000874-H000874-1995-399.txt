Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Again, I am not going to offer an amendment, again because I have not had that amendment protected by the rule. I regret that, and under the rule that we have adopted, unless I cut from this title, I cannot restore an item that has been cut out entirely. I think that is an unfortunate procedural situation into which I have been put and other Members of the Congress have been put.  Having said that, although I will not offer an amendment, I am hopeful that in conference we will restore the ACIR. That is an organization established some years ago to serve as an Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.  The new leadership of this House and the Senate has talked about a significant change. That change would incorporate shifting additional responsibilities back to the States and local governments in terms of getting rid of unfunded mandates and in terms of block granting certain programs. All of that gives additional responsibilities to the States and local governments and heightens the focus on how we are interrelating as a Federal Government with our States and localities.  Mr. Chairman, I think it regrettable that a small agency, with which many of us have participated in years past as state legislators, is being put on the chopping block by the committee's action. But, again, it is not in order for me to offer this amendment, so I will not, but I am hopeful, Mr. Chairman, that we will have, if the Senate puts it back in, the ability to retain it in conference. It is a very small sum of money, with, in my opinion, a very large payoff.
