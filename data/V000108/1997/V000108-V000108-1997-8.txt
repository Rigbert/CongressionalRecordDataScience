Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the work of the chairman, the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan], as well as the ranking member, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi]. I recognize the committee faced a number of very difficult issues, and I believe that they have done the very best job possible.  While I support the general thrust of the bill, I am very concerned about the specific issue of the current United States relationship with several countries located in the Caucasus, specifically Turkey, Greece, and Armenia.  The committee has decided to provide assistance to all three countries and has conditioned some of the aid. This conditioned aid is a reasonable response by the United States to a difficult situation. However, I am concerned about the very unreasonable attitude Turkey has displayed with respect to the conditions that we are placing on our assistance.  I would like to remind the House that last year this Chamber cut economic support fund assistance to Turkey on two separate votes. This year, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], others and I will not be offering an amendment to cut United States assistance to Turkey. That decision, at least for myself, is based only on the firm understanding that Turkey will act responsibly during the next 12 months.  Mr. Chairman, I want to make it clear that I do support the consensus policies on the Caucasus and Turkey developed by the committee. However, it is important for Turkey to understand that the assistance we are providing this year is not a blank check. The situation in Turkey must improve or next year I do not believe the House will be as accommodating as it has been this year.
