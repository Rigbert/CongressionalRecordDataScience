 The problem I have with it is that it does not stop what I am concerned about, which is a run on the bank; that as soon as creditors find there is an amendment in the bankruptcy legislation which gives a preference to a certain class of creditors, they then have to exercise their right and ultimately the utility companies will be driven to bankruptcy.  I did not enter this letter into the Record. The American Gas Association just put it the way it is. I do not know whether the time solution proposed by the Senator from Oregon solves this, but ``By creating a preferred class of creditors,'' which your amendment does, ``in effect the nonpreferred creditors would initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utility. As the preferred creditors''--those are your entities--``would in actuality control the bankruptcy proceedings through their status, in effect chapter 11 reorganization would not be an option. Liquidation of assets through chapter 7 would result.''  That is what I am trying to avoid. No matter what you do, you create this situation of preferred versus nonpreferred so the nonpreferred exert their rights now and throw the situation into bankruptcy.  This is not me saying it, this is the president and CEO of the American Gas Association saying that is what would happen.  I do not know whether a time delay solves that basic problem.
