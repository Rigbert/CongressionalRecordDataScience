This provision is a gift to the drug manufacturers and will likely have a devastating effect on our ability to protect our constituents.  Under the guise of a threatened pandemic, this legislation goes far beyond the scope of vaccine preparedness and includes language that is far more sweeping than any language previously passed by the House or the Senate. Instead of focusing on protecting American families from avian flu or ensuring that victims of any untested vaccine will be compensated for their injuries, the provision simply shields drug companies from any culpability for injuries caused by its actions. The scope of this immunity is so expansive that once the Secretary of Health and Human Services has declared a public health emergency even for a future threat, drug companies would not be held accountable for any injuries or deaths caused by the drugs they manufacture, including drugs that are not specifically used in a pandemic context. This is disgraceful and will deter Americans from taking vaccines and drugs if we ever experience a health crisis.  The only exception to the broad immunity given to drug companies in this proposal is the possibility that a victim could prove that the companyacted with ``willful misconduct.'' Knowingly committing health violations would not even suffice to state a claim. Knowing violations as well as gross negligence would be immunized from accountability. Even if the drug company acted with the intent to harm people, it would nevertheless be immune from criminal conduct unless the Attorney General or Secretary of Health and Human Services initiates an enforcement action against a drug company that is still pending at the time a personal claim is filed. That is unbelievable. I question whether such a role for the Secretary of HHS is even constitutional. Since when do we in Congress allow a political appointee of the administration to determine when, and if, someone injured by willful misconduct can be compensated for their injuries? Professor Erwin Chemerinsky sent a letter yesterday that outlines his concerns regarding the constitutionality of the provision and I ask that his letter be made part of the Record.  Passage of the Defense appropriations bill is of vital importance to all of us, but the inclusion of provisions that excuse even gross and deadly negligence on the part of drug companies makes it impossible for many of us to vote for this bill in good conscience. I urge my colleagues to strike the unjustified and extraneous provisions from the Defense appropriations bill in order to act quickly on this important bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                December 20, 2005.       Dear Senator: I understand that the Congress is considering      legislation that has been denominated as the ``Public      Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.'' This legislation      would give the Secretary of Health and Human Services      extraordinary authority to designate a threat or potential      threat to health as constituting a public health emergency      and authorizing the design, development, and implementation      of countermeasures, while providing total immunity for      liability to all those involved in its development and      administration. In addition to according unfettered      discretion to the Secretary to grant complete immunity from      liability, the bill also deprives all courts of jurisdiction      to review those decisions. Sec. (a)(7). I write to alert the      Congress to the serious constitutional issues that the      legislation raises.       First, the bill is of questionable constitutionality      because of its broad, unfettered delegation of legislative      power by Congress to the executive branch of government.      Under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may provide      another branch of government with authority over a subject      matter, but ``cannot delegate any part of its legislative      power except under the limitation of a prescribed standard.''      United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., 282 U.S.      311, 324 (1931). Recently, the Supreme Court endorsed Chief      Justice Taft's description of the doctrine: ``the      Constitution permits only those delegations where Congress      `shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle      to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed      to conform.' '' Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417,      484 (1998)(emphasis in original), quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr.,      & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). The breadth      of authority granted the Secretary without workable      guidelines from Congress appears to be the type of      ``delegation running riot'' that grants the Secretary a      ``roving commission to inquire into evils and upon discovery      correct them'' of the type condemned by Justice Cardozo in      A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S.      495, 553 (1935)(Cardozo, J., concurring).       Second, the bill raises important federalism issues because      it sets up an odd form of federal preemption of state law.      All relevant state laws are preempted. Sec. (a)(8). However,      for the extremely narrow instance of willful (knowing)      misconduct by someone in the stream of commerce for a      countermeasure, the bill establishes that the substantive law      is the law of the state where the injury occurred, unless      preempted. Sec. (e)(2). The sponsors appear to be trying to      have it both ways, which may not be constitutionally      possible. The bill anticipates what is called express      preemption, because the scope of any permissible lawsuits is      changed from a state-based to a federally based cause of      action. See Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8      (2003).       Usually, that type of ``unusually `powerful' '' preemptive      statute provides a remedy for any plaintiff's claim to the      exclusion of state remedies. Id. at 7 (citation omitted).      Here, rather than displace state law in such instances, the      bill adopts the different individual laws of the various      states, but amends them to include a willful misconduct      standard that can only be invoked if the Secretary or      Attorney General initiates an enforcement action against      those involved in the countermeasure and that action is      either pending at the time a claim is filed or concluded      with some form of punishment ordered.       Such a provision raises two important constitutional      concerns. One problem is that this hybrid form of preemption      looks less like an attempt to create a federal cause of      action than an direct attempt by Congress to amend state law      in violation of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64      (1938) and basic principles of federalism. Although Congress      may preempt state law under the Supremacy Clause by creating      a different and separate federal rule, see Crosby v. Nat'l      Foreign Trade Counc., 530 U.S. 363, 372 (2000), it may not      directly alter, amend, or negate the content of state law as      state law. That power, the Erie Court declared, ``reserved by      the Constitution to the several States.'' 304 U.S. at 80. It      becomes clear that the bill attempts to amend state law,      rather than preempt it with a federal alternative, when one      realizes that States will retain the power to enact new      applicable laws or amend existing ones with a federal overlay      that such an action may only be commenced in light of a      federal enforcement action and can only succeed when willful      misconduct exists. The type of back and forth authority      between the federal and state governments authorized by the      bill fails to constitute a form of constitutionally      authorized preemption.       The other problem with this provision is that the      unfettered and unreviewable discretion accorded the Secretary      or Attorney General to prosecute an enforcement action as a      prerequisite for any action for willful misconduct violates      the constitutional guarantee of access to justice, secured      under both the First Amendment's Petition Clause and the      Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. See Christopher v.      Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 n.12 (2002). In fact, the Court      has repeatedly recognized that ``the right of access to the      courts is an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition      the Government for redress of grievances.'' Bill Johnson's      Restaurants v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 741 (1983), citing      California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404      U.S. 508, 510 (1972). First Amendment rights, the Supreme      Court has said in a long line of precedent, cannot be      dependent on the ``unbridled discretion'' of government      officials or agencies. See, e.g., City of Lakewood v. Plain      Dealer Pub. Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988). At the same time,      the Due Process Clause guarantees a claimant an opportunity      to be heard ``at a meaningful time and in a meaningful      manner.'' Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965). The      obstacles placed before a claimant, including the insuperable      one of inaction by the Secretary or Attorney General, raise      significant due process issues. The Supreme Court has      recognized that official inaction cannot prevent a claimant      from being able to go forth with a legitimate lawsuit. See      Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982). The      proposed bill seems to reverse that constitutional      imperative.       Third, the complete preclusion of judicial review raises      serious constitutional issues. The Act, through Sec. 319F-     3(b)(7), expressly abolishes judicial review of the      Secretary's actions, ordaining that ``[n]o court of the      United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter      jurisdiction,'' i.e., the power, ``to review . . . any action      of the Secretary regarding'' the declaration of emergencies,      as well as the determination of which diseases or threats to      health are covered, which individual citizens are protected,      which geographic areas are covered, when an emergency begins,      how long it lasts, which state laws shall be preempted, and      when or if he shall report to Congress .       The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed      that the preclusion of all judicial review raises ``serious      questions'' concerning separation of powers and due process      of law. See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361 (1974);      see also, Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board      No. 14, 393 U.S. 233 (1968); McNary v. Haitian Refugee      Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479 (1991); Reno v. Catholic Social      Services, 509 U.S. 43 (1993). Judicial review of government      actions has long regarded as ``an important part of our      constitutional tradition'' and an indispensable feature of      that system, Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410      U.S. 356, 365 (1973).       The serious constitutional issues raised by this      legislation deserve a full airing and counsels against any      rush to judgment by the Congress. Whatever the merits of the      bill's purposes, they may only be accomplished by      consideration that assures its constitutionality.
