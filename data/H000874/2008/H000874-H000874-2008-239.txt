My belief is that comity requires that, not the rules. I believe comity ought to be followed to that extent. But if your contention is that you can have 200 people stand in that aisle and one every 20 seconds come in and take 20 seconds to change their vote and submit it and the Speaker is hostage to the 199 people waiting to step into the aisle while they're standing there, the answer to your question is yes, I believe the Speaker has the authority under the good order of the House, and I believe the presiding officer has the absolute authority.  Mr. Linder, who is sitting here, shut down a vote. I think he was within the rules. There were two people in the well. Now, that was changed----
