Thank God for George Bush. He's created the hurricanes, the earthquakes and the high price of gas.  There is only one group responsible for the high price of gas for the consumers of America and that's the United States Congress. They have done nothing, nothing since 1973 to increase the productivity of fossil fuels in the United States, and they still are doing nothing, Mr. and Mrs. America. They talk about it. They blame Mr. Bush. That's it. The best thing you can do is blame the other guy. The truth of the matter is that until we start drilling and until we start liquefying coal, until we use the offshore oil we have available, until we use the ANWR in Alaska, we're going to pay a lot more.  The prediction we have now, by the first of next year a barrel of oil will be, get this, $180 a barrel, because the consumers abroad in other countries are consuming oil at a greater rate than we are. But we sit here and say we're going to solve it by putting $800,000 on the dome of the Capitol to save, in 200 years, 10 bucks.  What's wrong with this Congress? And remember, I said ``this Congress.'' You haven't done the job. You're not doing the job. Until we wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America, and start drilling as we should drill, you're going to pay a lot more at that tank. You think about it, $200 a barrel 2 years from now, you'd better get a bicycle.                          ____________________
