I would just like to remind the good lady there are no grizzly bears in southeast Alaska. There are brown bears but not grizzly bears. And we should know a little bit about that after we talked about baiting bears today. They are not grizzly bears. They are brown bears. That means that you do not know, frankly, what you are talking about.
