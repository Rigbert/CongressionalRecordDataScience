 President, as the Senator from North Carolina, I believe, mentioned in his statement, the amendment he offered was in the original chairman's mark which was then stripped out at the subcommittee level, so I obviously support the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina.  One of the thoughts that my friend from Vermont and I were discussing is the possibility of a hour and half, or a 2-hour time agreement on the amendment, if that is acceptable to the Senator from North Carolina. That would give Senators notice that there would be a vote at a time certain in a couple of hours from now.  I am curious. I would ask Senator Leahy if he has any feeling about the appropriateness of such time agreement.
