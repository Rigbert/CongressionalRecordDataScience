Speaker, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cunningham] asked the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Moran] whether he was here. He, of course, perhaps knew, or at least may have known, that the gentleman from Virginia was not here.  As the gentleman well knows, I was here, and I would tell my friend from California that this was a bill that was passed by the Democrat House, by the Republican Senate, and signed by President Reagan. This was an attempt to put, as my friend from Virginia has said, the pension system on a sound basis. As the gentleman from California clearly knows, President Reagan, his OPM director, OMB and the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, then headed by Mr. Dole, as he is now heading that Senate, as the gentleman knows, made a determination that it needed to be changed, so we created the FERS system, which is for new employees and new Members of Congress, and we kept in place the Civil Service Retirement System. As the gentleman from Virginia has pointed out, that was a bipartisan fix of a pension system.  It created two systems, a new system, and left in place the old system. It did not deal, as I know my friend knows, with the military retirement system, and I would presume that my friend would not want us to arbitrarily and capriciously, with very short consideration, change the military retirement system, and the reason we should not do that is we have a moral obligation to our friends who served in the military, who served their country, and under one consideration, they did not do it for this reason, but we told our friends in the military, ``This is the deal, this is the pension system that we're going to give you,'' and I am going to yield to the gentleman in just a second, but I was intrigued with my friend's question, so I wanted to fully respond.
