President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent request, but I would be remiss if I did not recognize Senator Hagel's leadership on this issue and his articulate vision and years ago his brave service as a soldier in our Army.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be permitted to meet today at 7 p.m. in 215 Dirksen Senate Office Building to consider an original bill entitled the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, which will provide health care for needy children.
