 President, this is just one example of what a women living abroad might go through. We can think of all kinds of other situations in foreign countries that might necessitate the termination of a pregnancy. Many of these women are living in countries that don't have good health care systems in place, skilled providers, or access to safe or clean hospitals.  This ban is a huge mistake. It is in fact a double standard. I do not know of a health situation a man could encounter that would be dealt with at a military hospital in quite the same manner. Nor do I know of a health situation a man could encounter that a military hospital would not treat.  I thank the Senator from Washington for her amendment and for her leadership on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
