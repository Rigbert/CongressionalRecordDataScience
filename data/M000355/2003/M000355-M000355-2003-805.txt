 FRIST. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the majority leader for raising again the issue of the Burma sanctions bill. I say to him and our colleagues in the Senate that we have now been working for 2 days to try to get this matter cleared.  While we are involved in the minutia of the clearing process, Aung San Suu Kyi is still, in effect, in prison. We need to send a message to the military in Burma, and we need to send it this week.  I am not going to propound another unanimous consent request at the moment, but I want to put colleagues on notice that later in the day I will be doing that once again. In the meantime, the discussions continue. We hope we will be able to resolve this matter. I thank the majority leader very much for bringing that up.
