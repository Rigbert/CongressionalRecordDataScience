Speaker, this weekend in my home community of Toledo, Ohio, hundreds of alumni from Macomber-Whitney High School will gather together to renew friendships and recall their high school years in a first all class reunion. The weekend events will feature riverside gatherings, tours, and a dinner.  Vocational High School began training students in 1927. The school was moved to its own location, and Irving E. Macomber Vocational Technical High School opened its doors in 1938. Named for the man who helped develop Toledo's schools and parks, Macomber educated boys serving the entire city and was part of the Toledo Public School District.  Harriet Whitney High School began providing a vocational public education to high school age girls in 1939. The school's namesake was Toledo's first school teacher nearly a century before. Whitney, too, served the entire city and was part of the Toledo Public School District.  In 1959, Whitney and Macomber High School became joint-operational. The schools were next-door to each other and became known as Macomber-Whitney. Despite the fact that they shared an urban campus and some operations, the two schools remained completely separate in faculties, enrollments, and curriculum until the 1973-1974 school year. In the spring of 1972, an assembly was held for Macomber sophomores. They were told that they could major in one of several programs offered at Whitney, taking core courses at Whitney and other courses required for graduation at Macomber. The available programs included Distributive Education, Business Technology, Marketing, and Data Processing. About fifty boys signed up. After initial adjustment, the program change worked well.  The Macomber Macmen were members of the Toledo City League and sported the colors of black and gold. Their main rivals were the Scott Bulldogs, which was especially heated in their basketball match-ups. The Macmen earned a team state title came in 1989, when the boys basketball team won the Division I state championship. The Lady Macs won two league titles: one for track & field in 1987 and one for basketball in the 1990-91 season.  As enrollment declined toward the end of the last century, the decision was made to close Macomber-Whitney High School at the end of the 1990-91 school year. The Whitney building continued as home to adult education classes, but was demolished in 2011 by Toledo Public Schools. The Macomber building has been repurposed by a nonprofit organization.  Macomber-Whitney High School educated thousands of students in the proud tradition of Toledo Public Schools, teaching them practical skills necessary to enter the workforce. Through those years values were learned, traditions passed on, and friendships made. The memories of their time at Macomber-Whitney not forgotten, its alumni will recall past days with joy, fond recollection, and proud memories.                          ____________________
