President, I would like to speak for 20 or 30 minutes on the farm bill, if I might. I would first like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Thune, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Chambliss, and our distinguished chairman, Senator Harkin.  Let me point out that Senator Harkin did something very unusual. After handling one bill on the floor of the Senate, he then had the challenge of trying to move the farm bill, which is sometimes about as easy as pushing a rope. But he did it through committee in a day and a half. I think that is a record.  I have been through seven farm bills, two technical farm bills that were really farm bills, and I have never seen committee action be expedited in that fashion. So I wish to thank the chairman for that.
