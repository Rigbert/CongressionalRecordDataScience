  We should be able to do this. I am very proud of the work we have done so far. Under the leadership of the chairman and vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we have been able to negotiate and pass bills under regular order in a way we have been unable to do for years.  We did this by rejecting the awful and counterproductive budget ideas from President Trump and his administration and by pushing aside poison pill riders that would derail this process--such as attacks on healthcare, higher education, public schools, patient protections, workers' rights, and more.  I am particularly proud that we were able to work together and negotiate and pass our LHHS bill through the full Senate, something that has not been done in over a decade.  Our bill makes strong investments in families, patients, students, workers, and the middle class, and it rejects poison pill riders. It builds on the strong work we have done to increase access to childcare and early learning and includes targeted funding to address the opioid epidemic, especially in our underserved areas. It includes significant new resources to address the truly alarming issues of maternal mortality, to help us understand why so many women in our country are dying as a result of childbirth and pregnancy and prevent this from happening.
