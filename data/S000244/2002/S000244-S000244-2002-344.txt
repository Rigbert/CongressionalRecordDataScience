Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3375 would allow U.S. citizens who were victims of the bombings of United States embassies in East Africa on August 7, 1998, or their surviving family, to receive the same compensation as the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  The September 11 Victim Compensation Fund Act of 2001 created a compensation program administered by the Attorney General, through a Special Master, for people killed or injured as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  On August 7, 1998, agents of Osama bin Laden orchestrated near simultaneous vehicular bombings of the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,and Dar Es Salaam Tanzania. Twelve American Government employees and family members were killed and several others were injured as a result of these bombings.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3375, the Embassy Employee Compensation Act, directs the Attorney General to provide compensation for those American government employees and family members through the Special Master appointed to administer the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. The bill would authorize payments under the same standards for payments that are applied to people receiving payment under the September 11 fund. In the case of a deceased individual, the bill would allow relatives of that individual to be compensated under the same standards as well.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3375 is a matter of fairness and equity. It allows victims of the bombings of the U.S. embassies access to the same compensation system available to those killed or injured during the September 11 attacks in the United States by agents of Osama bin Laden.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
