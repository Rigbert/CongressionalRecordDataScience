Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly remarkable man, TheHonorable Joseph Flores of Toledo, Ohio. Recently retired from the Lucas County Juvenile Court, Judge Flores has graciously served our community for several decades. For many who came to this area, Joe Flores was the first person who greeted them and welcomed them to our community. Whether it was as attorney, mentor, or friend, he was dedicated to helping others recognize their potential.  A proud Mexican American, Joe was born August 2, 1934 to Carmen Ventura and Jose Suarez Flores in Toledo. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1956 with a degree in Political Science. He entered into the United States Navy's Officers Candidate School and completed 52 months of active duty, ending in 1961, having attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander.  While still in the Navy, Joe Flores met his wife, Mary Jane, a naval nurse, and the two were married in 1964. They are the parents of two children, Andre Jose and Maria Carmen. Returning from the Navy, Joe decided to attend law school. He graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1964 and practiced law in Findlay, Ohio for one year.  Moving to Toledo in 1966, Joe practiced law with attorneys Charles Doneghy and Robert Penn. Interestingly, all three became judges. He decided to run for elected office because he enjoyed interacting with people when Judge Doneghy would ask him to help at various events. Joe Flores was elected Judge of the Lucas County Juvenile Court in 1981. ``At that time, few Latinos were part of the legal community. Becoming known as the Judge who could speak Spanish, he ended up being asked to do a variety of translations. Judge Flores is thought to be the first elected Latino Judge in Ohio. Carlos Cordova was an acting judge at the time, but was not elected to the post. Since then, Ohio has had two other Latino Judges, Jose Villanueva (Cuyahoga County Common Pleas) and Gustalo Nunez (Lorain Municipal Court.)  Recognizing his contributions to the legal profession and the Hispanic community, the Latino Peace Officers Association created the Judge Joseph Flores Award in May 2003. The award will be given annually to a Latino Peace Officer who exhibits exemplary service to the community. The group decided to name the award after Flores due to his instrumental role in integrating the Toledo Police Department with more Latino Peace Officers.  I am pleased to pay special tribute to my friend Judge Flores for his pioneering efforts on behalf of Latinos in Northwest Ohio. Understanding the importance of a representative voice in the local community, he was the first Latino on many boards as he stresses the importance of community involvement for Hispanics/Latinos.  Judge Joseph Flores forged his career with courage and determination, despite facing many obstacles along the way. He blazed the trail where none existed, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of Latino leaders. Onward!                          ____________________
