Just a little history, Mr. Speaker. There are 561 total recognized tribes. We have recognized 16 of those through action of Congress, and 31 were recognized by the Department of the Interior.  And about the motion to recommit saying go back and follow the process, in the last 10 years, and the fact is longer than 10 years, I think 15 years or longer than that, 1978 was the last one, the so-called system worked and with a Bureau that, in fact, has suggested that they are not recognized. Well, what chance would the Lumbees ever have of being recognized? It wouldn't happen. So what this motion to recommit does is say, all right, we are just not recognizing them. It is really not a motion that says they have to follow the process.  And we do have the authority. The Congress has the ultimate authority. Like I said, we have already done 16 these, and it says right here that the Supreme Court ruled in the United States v. Sandoval that the Congress cannot arbitrarily recognize a group of Indians as a tribe, but its powers are very broad. All Congress has to do is determine that, one, the group has ancestors who lived in what is now the USA by the time of European discovery and, two, the group be a ``people distinct from others.'' And that is what the Lumbees are.  So this is a motion to really stop the recognition, let's not kid ourselves, because they will never be recognized through the process.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
