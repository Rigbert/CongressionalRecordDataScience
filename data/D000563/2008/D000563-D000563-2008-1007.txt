It is not as if we were imposing our will here. We are bringing to the floor the measure that passed the Senate Finance Committee. And when was the last time a bill came to the floor which you agreed with in all of its different sections? There are usually one or two things in there I wish were written differently.  I would say to my friends on the Republican side that if they believe we should say no to families in Kentucky, to families in States around the Nation who are struggling with heating bills, then they have to understand that has been part of the bipartisanship package brought to the floor, and they will be voting against those people and voting against the unemployed, and that will be the record they can carry home from this debate.                          ____________________
