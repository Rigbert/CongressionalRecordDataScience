Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  FEMA provides public assistance funds after a disaster or emergency to State, tribal, and local governments and some private nonprofits. These funds reimburse communities and other entities for activities such as debris removal costs, emergency protective measures, and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.  Currently, for projects under--however they chose that number--$122,100--I am surprised they didn't add on 10 cents--reimburses grantees based on cost estimates rather than actual costs. This bill would require FEMA to increase this threshold to $500,000. This would be temporary authority, expiring on September 30, 2021. We would require that this be closely tracked. There is a strong indication that this will actually expedite reimbursement, ultimately save funds, and will not subject these projects to abuse.  I am hopeful that my colleagues will support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
