Speaker, I don't know who ``we'' is. Somebody who introduces a bill on either side of the aisle doesn't make it a ``we'' bill.  And the reason they brought the nonbinding resolution to the floor, when they really wanted to bring the bill to the floor, is because it wouldn't have served their political purposes because everybody on our side of the aisle would have voted ``no.'' He knows it. That is why he didn't bring it to the floor, for politics; not for principle, for politics.  And to his credit, I understand the Speaker didn't want to bring it to the floor either. At least that is what is reported in the papers.  Now, Mr. Speaker, my question has still not been answered.  There have been more closed rules in this Congress than any Congress in recent memory, during the time I have served. Now, there have been a lot of bills passed, and we passed them on bipartisanly. We had about six, seven, eight, or nine naming a post office the other day.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
