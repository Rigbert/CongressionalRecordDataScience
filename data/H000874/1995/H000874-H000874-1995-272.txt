Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro], one of the leaders on our side of the aisle.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia.  Lifting the arms embargo is not something we should take lightly. But we cannot continue to allow innocent civilians to be killed, tortured, raped, and herded out of what have been called safe havens. What kind of safe haven allows the slaughter of innocents?  The arms embargo was put in place to prevent weapons from entering the former Yugoslavia. But it has not worked each night on the news, we can witness the atrocities being committed by the well-armed Serbs. The Serbs have slaughtered men, women and children. The survivors have been forced out of their homes so that the Serbs may realize their appalling goal of an ethnically pure Serbia.  The international community has not been able to defend the Bosnian, and through the arms embargo, the international community has not accorded the Bosnians their fundemental right to defend themselves. We must not continue down the same path that has led to ethnic cleansing, rape, murder, and torture. In Bosnia the battle lines may change daily but the line between right and wrong does not move. It is wrong for the Serbs to slaughter a defenseless people and it is wrong for the United States to stand by and watch. Lift the arms embargo. Allow the Bosnians to defend themselves.
