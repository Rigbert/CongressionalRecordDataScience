REID. I say to my distinguished friend, we completed the Homeland Security appropriations bill last week. That was a pretty important bill because it protects our Nation. If we are not so inclined to help the men and women who have signed up to represent us and defend this country, this is not a good sign for this Senate. Therefore, I truly believe there is nothing more important that we could be doing in this Senate than finishing this bill in an orderly fashion. To think we will have one normal voting day on this--that is what it will amount to--before cloture is invoked. One day. Thursday. That is it because we do not work around here on Mondays and Fridays.
