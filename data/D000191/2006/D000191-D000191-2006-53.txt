Speaker, today I had an extraordinary meeting with the head of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Mr. Lautenbacher, and his deputy, Mr. Hogarth. They met with six Members of Congress representing the west coast fishers in the United States, particularly from Oregon down into California.  These gentlemen met with us so we could ask them to ask, in all sincerity, when they are going to declare the salmon fishing season, which has been essentially closed by their agency, a disaster. Their answer was: never. Or maybe next year.  It was an extraordinary meeting. They said that because they allowed an extraordinarily limited season, that is, a fisherman can go out and catch up to 75 salmon, which won't quite pay for the fuel to leave the dock, on a few occasions during the year, that they can't anticipate whether or not it will be a disaster for those folks.  Now, the deputy was a little more honest, and he admitted that it was even worse than they thought. No one is fishing. No one is going out with fuel prices like this, and, in fact, there is virtually no activity. But they thought that people might go out. Maybe the price of fish will go way up. I said, to what, a hundred dollars a pound? What are we talking about? What would induce people to go out into the ocean and catch 75 salmon, a commercial fishing boat? They couldn't answer that.  So we said, your regional counsel recommended a disaster declaration, and you sent it back. When will you process that? They said, oh, well, we have already sent it back again. We said, why did you send it back? They said, well, because they made a recommendation of a disaster.  The people who manage this agency in the region recognized the disaster. They recommended a disaster declaration to the national bureaucrats. The national bureaucrats said, no, you can't do that. They sent it back. They had to strip out their recommendation and then they sent it back and they said, okay.  So when are you going to process all the facts on which they made that determination? They said, not until February. Well, why not until next February? Because people might go out and catch 75 fish, and that might make a difference in whether or not there is a disaster.  It is extraordinary tortured logic. You can't get there from here. So we said, how about you just issue the declaration of a disaster. No, their lawyers say they can't do that. I asked to see the legal opinion. They said, no, they couldn't show me the legal opinion; that they couldn't do that.  We asked to see the recommendation from the regional people about the disaster, and they said, no, you can't have that. You are only Members of Congress representing these people. You can't have those documents because we haven't made a decision yet. When are you going to make a decision? When it is too late for the fishers and their families. When they have already gone bankrupt. Whey they have already lost their boats. That is next winter when they might get around to making a decision about this year's season.  So, then, I said, okay, how about this: why don't you just close down this lame season that you have created, this 75-fish limit on a few days; just close it down, declare a disaster, and get some assistance to the fishers? They said, oh, no, they couldn't do that because they have already made a decision that is based on certain documents, and they couldn't go back on that. I said, just declare an emergency. No, they are not going to do that.                              {time}  2245  They are getting orders from somewhere higher up in this administration that is embarrassed, embarrassed about the politics, embarrassed that 4 years ago, to make hay in an election year, they diverted water from irrigation, from the river to irrigation. They got headlines. They made great political hay with us with it. Now if they declare a disaster on the returning salmon, the class of that year, they are essentially admitting that they impacted that.  In fact, in the Senate, they have already said that this is not a natural disaster. The Parliamentarian there ruled against emergency assistance by the junior Senator from Oregon, because he said this was not a natural disaster; it is manmade. The Bush Administration made this disaster through their mismanagement of the resources in that region.  So now we have the agency saying they are not going to declare a disaster. I think they are just trying to put the small fishers out of business. What the end game is, I am not sure. Maybe giant aquaculture. Who knows? But the point is they are refusing, despite the request of the Governor of Oregon, the Governor of California, the Senators from Oregon, the Senators from California, a large number of Representatives from Oregon and California, we have all requested a disaster declaration, and the White House is silent, and the bureaucrats say ``no.''                          ____________________
