Chairman, I thank the gentleman for proposing this Buy American amendment to this bill as well as many other bills that he has been successful in achieving this added language. I would not only like to support the gentleman on this effort, but to work with him to assure that both the letter and spirit of the law, as the gentleman has been able to pass here regarding Buy American, are working in every program of our government, let me point out, for example, the Department of Defense's purchase of food commodities, should be oriented toward U.S. farmers, U.S. produced commodities, not food brokers that might acquire their product from foreign sources.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to commend the gentleman and say I support the Buy American Act, and congratulations to the gentleman for bringing this Buy American amendment to America's attention.
