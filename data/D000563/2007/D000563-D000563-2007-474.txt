President, I join in this chorus to say how privileged and humbled I am to stand before this body and welcome back my friend and fellow colleague, Senator Tim Johnson. Tim and I served in the House together. We came to the Senate in the same year. I went up to campaign in South Dakota, and he has been a great friend to Illinois. I have known him more than 20 years.  I remember when I heard he had been stricken. I was stunned, as everybody was across America. As has been said before, the prayers of millions reached out to Tim and his family in their hour of need.  For those who don't know Tim Johnson, he is not a typical politician. He doesn't really struggle for media attention, as some of us might; but he got a lot more attention than he ever thought he would because the whole world watched anxiously during those moments of surgery and recovery and rehabilitation.
