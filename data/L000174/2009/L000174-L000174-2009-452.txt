President, I thank my friend from Alabama. I urge Members--if there are others--not to wait until 5. And I ask those on the other side of the aisle, if you wish to speak, please do so as soon as possible, because at some point--and we will do this only with notice to the Republicanside--I am going to ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and go to a vote.  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally divided.
