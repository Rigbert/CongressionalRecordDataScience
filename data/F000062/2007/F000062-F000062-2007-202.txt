  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is extraordinary that we are using Senate procedures to actually keep a 400-page amendment from being read.  I ask unanimous consent that when the amendment is modified, when it is broken into these clay-pigeon pieces, that I be recognized to request the yeas and nays on that amendment.
