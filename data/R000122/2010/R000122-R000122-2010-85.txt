President, I am here today not only to salute these great Americans but also to talk about the urgency of bringing the issue of Wall Street reform to the Senate for open debate and final passage. We have weathered and witnessed the worst financial crisis in the history of the country. We have seen wealth, trillions of dollars of wealth, evaporate because of this financial crisis. To hear people now talking about, well, this is not a good bill--the question is not whether we should delay further or go forward.
