Speaker, this Republican budget represents a set of values and priorities that are extreme, short-sighted, and out of touch with the direction in which Rhode Islanders and the American people want our country to move.                           medicare/medicaid  Perhaps the most glaring examples of the extreme provisions in this bill are the massive cuts in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This bill represents nothing less than a reversal of a generation of guaranteed health care for our most vulnerable citizens. For more than 30 years, the Medicare and Medicaid programs have exemplified our national commitment to care for seniors, disabled Americans, and low-income Americans. In essence, it is the tangible evidence that, in the most affluent and productive country in the world, we would not let millions of Americans suffer because they were too old, too poor, or too ill to fend for themselves.  The cuts to the Medicare program represent the most sweeping changes to the program since its establishment in 1965. And what makes these cuts so objectionable is that they are not about reforming Medicare, they are about providing tax cuts for the rich. These cuts are three times what is needed to keep Medicare solvent.  Republicans claim that this budget enables Medicare to grow at a healthy rate. The truth is that this bill reduces Medicare growth by 33 percent below that of private sector health-spending growth. What kind of health care can the elderly purchase at these below-market rates when we all know that their health needs are much greater than those of the working-age population?  This bill also eliminates Medicaid. No longer will the 18 million children who currently qualify for Medicaid be guaranteed health care coverage. No longer will seniors who have entered nursing homes and exhausted their resources be guaranteed that they will be able to remain there. Republicans have substituted this guarantee with a block grant to States that cuts Federal spending by an average of 18 percent over the next 7 years. The State of Rhode Island will be faced with attempting to continue access to vital health care services with a 37-percent reduction in Federal Medicaid dollars--clearly a daunting, if not impossible, task.                        education/direct lending  This bill also represents another example of accounting gimmicks used by Republicans to deliver on their promise of reaching their arbitrary budget targets. Republicans have created a special budget scoring rule for direct student loans. It is no wonder that the public has become so disenchanted with Congress--only Congress could change accounting rules so that a program that saved money last year is miraculously deemed to ``cost'' money this year.  The proposal to cap the direct loan program at 10 percent of total loan volume was not chosen because the program is not working; this program has achieved high grades from students, parents, and participating colleges and universities. Students and parents should know that the Republicans have chosen to reward banks instead of supporting the direct loan program which offers better service and more flexible repayment terms for students, simplified administration for schools, and greater accountability for taxpayers.  The proposal to cap direct loans at 10 percent of total loan volume eliminates the current choice that colleges and universities have between participation in the direct student loan program or the guaranteed student loan program. This year, 40 percent of student loans are direct loans--with 1,350 schools and approximately 2.5 million students participating in the program. In Rhode Island alone, there are 8 direct lending schools and 17,855 direct loans have been made. We must be clear--under this package, many colleges and universities that prefer the direct loan program would no longer be able to offer it to their students. It has been estimated that, as a result of this proposal, over 13,000 direct loans would be lost in Rhode Island. This cap denies colleges and universities the right to choose what is best for their students and undercuts free competition.                                welfare  President Clinton and a majority of Democrats, including myself, have indicated a willingness to support meaningful welfare reform. But instead, Republicans have opted for a welfare reform plan that is just plain mean to women and children. I supported a welfare reform bill that was tough on work and fair to children. I supported a welfare reform bill that has work at its heart and did not shred the safety net for children.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill so that we may continue to work toward a balanced budget that reflects the priorities and values of the American people.
