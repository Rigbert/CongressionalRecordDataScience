I know he waited a long time yesterday to speak, and I have waited as well. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.  I take the opportunity for a few minutes this afternoon to talk about an issue of enormous importance to millions of older people and their families. Specifically, it is the question of including prescription drug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's older people.  There is one, just one, bipartisan bill before the Senate to offer this vital coverage to the Nation's elderly. I have teamed up on this bill with Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine because the two of us believe it is critical that the Congress address this issue now and address it on a bipartisan basis. So Senator Snowe and I, in an effort to get this issue out of the beltway, beyond Washington, DC, as you can see in the poster next to me, are urging that seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Just as this poster says, send copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510.  What we are going to do, in an effort to get bipartisan support for our legislation, is come to the floor every few days--this is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate--andread directly from letters we are receiving from the Nation's elderly people. Here is one I just received yesterday from an elderly person in Central Point, OR. She wrote:       Dear Senator Wyden, I write to ask for your support for      Medicare coverage of prescription medicine. In my case such      coverage is a financial necessity. I suffer from rheumatoid      arthritis. My physician recommends that I use medicine to      combat it. The only problem I have is that the dosage I      require would require an annual outlay in excess of $1,000      a month. I desperately wish I could have the relief Enbrel      could give me. Please champion coverage.  Another letter I received from my home community, from an elderly widow, states that her Social Security is $1,179 a month. Each month, from that $1,179 check, she spends $179 on the medicine Fosamax, $209 a month on Prilosec, $112 on Lescol; that is $500 a month, each month, for her prescription medicine from her monthly Social Security check, which is the only income she has. Almost half of her income goes to pay for her prescription drug bills.  Here is a letter I have just received from King City, OR. The writer says:       I am a constant user of Lovenox inhaler. Two uses per day      come to $839. Fortunately, I drove a Chevrolet when my      friends were driving Cadillacs, and our family vacation was      spent in the U.S. not the South Seas, so I may be able to      carry the load at least for a while. My annual cost for this      one medicine is $30,600, just about what it would equal to      stay in a nursing home.  These are just a few of the bills that are coming into my office, coming into Senator Snowe's office, and our colleagues' here in the Senate as a result of the concern among the Nation's senior citizens that this issue be addressed. I hope we will see that more senior citizens follow just as we say in this poster: ``Send in your prescription drug bills.''  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses market forces to hold down the cost of medicine. That is the biggest problem, holding down the enormous cost of these medicines. More than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine, and the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill would use a market-oriented approach to address this issue. It is modeled on the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. Our view is, if health care is good enough for Members of Congress, we certainly ought to look at using that kind of approach for the Nation's seniors. We call it the SPICE bill, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, because we would cover all of the Nation's older people eligible for Medicare. It is absolutely key that we do this now.  When people ask, ``Can we afford to cover prescription drugs under Medicare?'' my response is: ``We cannot afford not to cover prescriptions any longer.'' The reason for that--and I know my colleague currently in the Chair was involved in aging issues when he was in the House and was involved with Social Security, so he is familiar with this. We know the most important drugs that would be covered under the Snowe-Wyden legislation are preventive drugs. They help to deal with blood pressure problems and cholesterol problems. They keep people healthy and well, and they keep them fit. That helps hold down the cost for what is called Medicare Part A, the acute care portion of Medicare that covers hospitals and institutional services. Under the Snowe-Wyden approach, we contain costs without shifting them onto the backs of somebody else.  One of the things that concerns me, there is a well-meaning bill that has been introduced that suggests we ought to have Medicare buy up all the drugs and act as a buyer for everybody. The problem with that approach is that it will result in tremendous cost-shifting onto the backs of other Americans who are having difficulty paying for their prescription drug bills. I don't want to see a 27-year-old divorced African American woman with two kids, who is working hard, playing by the rules and doing everything she can to get ahead, have to see a big increase in her prescription drug bill because the costs are shifted onto her when somebody doesn't think about the implications of trying to do this through approaches that don't involve marketplace forces.  So these are letters I am receiving from seniors across the country. Here is another one from Myrtle Creek, OR. This is a senior citizen who has to take a variety of medicines, including Albuterol, Dulcolax, and other drugs. She writes me that she spent $370 recently on prescription drugs from a Social Security check of $1,152. She went to a small drugstore in Myrtle Creek, OR--a terrific small community--and spent $370 from a Social Security check of $1,152 on her medicines.  I think a lot of these seniors are asking themselves, what is it that the Senate is so busy doing that it cannot work in a bipartisan way to be responsive to older people and families on this issue? I am very hopeful that if seniors just read what it says in this poster: ``Send in your prescription drug bills'' to Senators--Senator Snowe and I are particularly interested in hearing from older people because we want to do this in a bipartisan way. A lot of people think the prescription drug issue is just going to be fodder for the campaign in the year 2000 and in the fall of 2000 we will just have the Democrats and Republicans slugging it out on the issue. The last time I looked, it was more than a year until that election comes up.  I don't want to see seniors such as the ones I am hearing from in Myrtle Creek and King City, and all over the Willamette Valley in my home State--I don't want to see them suffer. I know the Chair doesn't want to see people suffer in Kentucky. Other colleagues feel the same way. If we can put down the partisanship for a little while and work together in an effort to get the vulnerable seniors across this country the coverage they need, we will have a truly lasting legacy from this session of the Senate.  I was codirector of the Gray Panthers, a great senior citizens group, for about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. Some of my most joyous memories are working with older people back then. We talked about how important it was to cover prescriptions.  Well, what has happened with the evolution of the pharmaceutical sector over those 20 years is, prescription drugs have become even more important since those days when I was codirector of the Gray Panthers; the drugs are even more important now because they do so much to promote wellness. We needed them before because you do need medications for so many who are acutely ill. But today, this could result in keeping people healthy and save Medicare, particularly the institutional part of the program, Part A, that it could save Medicare Part A money and we could do it through marketplace forces.  Snowe-Wyden doesn't go out and set up a price control regime. We give senior citizens the kind of bargaining power a health maintenance organization would have through the marketplace. Seniors would get to choose the various kinds of coverages that are available to Members of Congress, such as the President of the Senate and myself. It would not be bureaucratic. We know our health care doesn't create a whole lot of new redtape and bureaucracy. We know it works. So that is what Senator Snowe and I are trying to do.  This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to urge seniors, as this poster says, to send in their prescription drug bills. I intend now to come back to the floor of this Senate every few days until this session ends and read, as I have, directly from copies of these prescription drug bills I am receiving.  I know that so many Senators care about the needs of the elderly. I see Senator Chafee, who has long been an expert in health and a member of the Finance Committee; our friend, Senator Mikulski, who has championed the Older Americans Act issue so passionately for so many years in the Appropriations Committee.  When we have these colleagues who have expertise in these issues and we know how acute the need is and we know we can do it in a bipartisan way, as Senator Snowe and I have been trying to do, it would be a tragedy for the Senate to pass on this issue and say: Well, let's just put it off until after the year 2000.  We have consulted with senior groups. We have consulted with the insurance industry. We have consulted with those in the pharmaceutical sector. All of them have told us that ourbill, while perhaps not their first choice for how to ensure that seniors get their coverage, will work. It will get seniors the help they need, and it will be something that we can do and do now--not after the 2000 election, not after some other period of campaign activity, but it is something we can do now.  The Nation's seniors and our families can see as a result of my reading from these bills and what I am receiving from Oregon that I am very serious about their input. I hope that seniors and their families, as this poster says, will send in their prescription drug bill to their Senator. I hope they will be for the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. Frankly, I am much more interested in hearing from them about the need for Congress to act. We can act. We can do it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
