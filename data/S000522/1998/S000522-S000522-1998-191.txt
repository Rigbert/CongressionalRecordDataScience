Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, the distinguished chairman of the full committee, and for his work onthis very important legislation before us.  I just want to remind Members that during the course of the process of consideration of this bill we had 77 amendments that were offered in subcommittee, full committee, and on the floor from both sides of the aisle, 4 days on the floor for consideration and a number of very important and productive meetings of the conference committee. The issue that it all came down to, frankly and in all candor, was the Mexico City policy. It was the right-to-life issue.  Let me just say a couple of things on that this afternoon. I think it is important to clear up some of this information about the compromise language in the conference report that would impose some restrictions on U.S. assistance to foreign organizations that perform and promote abortions overseas.  During the last 3 years, the House has voted 10 separate times for the pro-life Mexico City policy, which prohibits U.S. population assistance to foreign organizations that perform abortions, violate the abortion laws of foreign countries, or engage in activities that change these laws. We have also voted to restrict aid to the United Nations Population Fund unless the UNPF ended its participation in the forced abortion program.  The People's Republic of China and the Mexico City policy was enforced throughout the Reagan and Bush administrations. It did not reduce family planning money by one dime. Rather, it protected genuine family planning programs by erecting a wall of separation between family planning and abortion. President Clinton repealed that policy. We in the House, thankfully, again and again have gone on record saying that wall of separation needs to be reerected.  Mr. Speaker, I and other pro-life Members were reluctant to agree to the compromise, and I want to say that very candidly and up front. We do give on this. Regrettably, we give but thus far there has been no give by the other side on this issue. We have done so because we believe this compromise is necessary to save some babies lives. We believe it will protect some unborn children by prohibiting a particularly ugly form of cultural imperialism in which U.S. taxpayers support entities that are actively engaged in bullying smaller nations into rejecting the traditions and moral values of their people.  Many of my colleagues have received some talking points sent out by population control organizations. These talking points are misleading and in many cases flatly untrue. First, the population control groups tell us over and over again that they are using what they call their own money to perform and promote abortions. This is a red herring. It is designed to divert attention from the undeniable fact that millions of our foreign aid dollars can and did finance some of the biggest abortion providers in the world.  Similarly, some of the biggest international population control grantees are actively engaged in efforts to overturn pro-life laws in countries around the world. This is because existing laws require only that the organization keep a set of books that shows that it did not use our money to pay for the actual abortions or for proabortion lobbying. This bookkeeping trick ignores the fact that money is fungible. When we subsidize an organization, we unavoidably enrich and empower all activities of that organization.  The Mexico City policy recognizes that money is fungible. Every million U.S. tax dollars that go to an abortion provider frees up another million dollars to pay for abortions and more proabortion lobbying.                              {time}  1545  The Mexico City policy also recognizes that our family planning grantees are seen as representatives in the countries within which we operate as extensions, as surrogates for U.S. foreign policies. When organizations prominently associated with the United States family planning programs perform and promote abortions, people in these countries logically associate these activities with the United States.  Opponents of the Mexico City policy also claim that if we require our family planning grantees to pledge not to perform or promote abortion, they will not participate in our programs. Yet when the Mexico City policy was in force, hundreds of population grantees agreed not to perform or promote abortions. Only two, let me repeat that, only two organizations decided not to agree to that and therefore were deprived of that money. More than 350 grantees took the money, and that wall of separation between destroying an unborn child and promoting violence against children and family planning was erected.  Some of the talking points that my colleagues have seen in their office claim that the compromise language would punish grantees for merely attending conferences at which somebody else discusses abortion. This too is demonstrably false. The Clinton administration knows it is false and the population control groups know it is false as well. The bill prohibits assistance of foreign organizations that, and I quote, engage in any activity or effort to change the laws of foreign countries with respect to abortion.  Every legislative provision has to be interpreted by the rule of reason. It is unreasonable to claim that activities that change laws includes merely attending a conference. As the conference report makes crystal clear, there is a world of difference between mere attendance and a situation in which an organization finances, sponsors and conducts a conference that is clearly designed to bring about the repeal of laws against abortion, as the International Planned Parenthood Federation recently did in the Francophone countries of West Africa and has done in other countries around the world.  Such sponsorship, financing and organizing should fairly be construed as an activity to change the abortion laws. But nobody on our side of this issue has suggested that such activities include mere attendance at a conference.  Finally, when pro-abortionists run out of arguments, they fall back on slogans that this is somehow a global gag rule because it says to organizations they have to choose, either be international abortion lobbyists or they can be representatives and surrogates of the United States in family planning programs.  The administration says that the purpose of our family planning program is to prevent abortions. If we want to prevent alcoholism, would we hire the liquor industry to do it for us? If we wanted to stop gambling, would we do it by giving grants to casino owners? If we wanted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an international anti-drug campaign, would we give the money to organizations that use their own money to lobby for the legalization of drugs? Of course not. If Congress stands behind the position that there must be a wall of separation between abortion lobbying and U.S. family planning programs, we can save innocent lives. That is what this is all about. Nothing could be more important. I urge a yes vote on the conference report.
