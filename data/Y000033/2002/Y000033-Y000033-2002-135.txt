Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I have been listening with great interest to the debate, and I want to congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), for bringing this to the floor to discuss. I also happen to agree with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall). This issue has been with us since 1906, and if anybody has a responsibility, it is this body, the Congress. Because it is our estimate, and when I say ours, the different accounting firms and not Andersen, but different accounting firms, there is about $12 billion unaccounted for that belonged to the American Indians. In my State alone since 1971, we cannot account for the BIA $800,000, and that is a short period of time.  But I will say that what the committee is trying to do here, and I hope that as we go through this process, what I am worried about, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) mentioned, this is the Indians' money, and he is absolutely right, but what is happening is it is going to be the lawyers' money. It is going to be the lawyers' money. What the committee has tried to do, and whether they are right or wrong, and why they picked 1985 I do not know, is try to, in fact, pick the date that has the modern communications system for accounting, the computer system that is in place so that they can account for that period of time.  I do not believe, and if I could ask, although I do not see the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) here, but somebody, perhaps the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) or the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), is there somebody who can tell me, this does not preclude or close off other investigations prior to 1985. Can anybody address that? Does anybody know? Is anybody listening?
