President, today at the World Summit on the Information Society, an agreement was announced to maintain the current structure for managing the Internet. This agreement marks a critical step toward ensuring the stability and security of the Internet and preserving its benefits not only for the United States, but for countries across the globe.  In late October I joined with the other cochairs of the Internet Caucus in a letter to the White House urging the administration to stand firm in its position to protect the Internet and resist efforts to undo the structure that has worked so well so far. I also joined Senator Burns in offering a resolution to maintain the currently effective status quo on Internet governance. The agreement that now has been reached in Tunis to maintain the current structure for managing domain names and the Internet is consistent with our efforts.  The value of the Internet is incalculable. The Internet has brought an unprecedented level of commercial exchanges in both the consumer and business-to-business realms. It has spawned and prompted the development of new ideas, businesses and relationships. It has empowered people who have never had access to power and otherwise would likely never have an opportunity to be heard, much less challenge or influence public policy and institutional power. It has introduced and cemented friendships across the globe, and it has distributed information and fostered greater understanding and awareness of others' ideas and others' cultures. Becoming part of a global Internet environment has also shown us we are part of the wider world in which all of us live. It is values like these that no doubt our world partners are seeking to preserve in their proposals, yet would unwittingly undermine.  The United States developed and nourished the Internet. The open economy and constitutional liberties that are the foundations of our Nation allowed us the privilege and extraordinary responsibility to serve as the great incubator that has unleashed these spectacular developments and benefits.  No doubt we can do even better. Some have benefited substantially more than others. We have further strides to make before eradicating the digital divide and narrowing the gaps between the haves and have-nots. We also need to be vigilant in maintaining the essential freedom and influences that have kept the Internet flourishing. We should work closely with other countries to address challenges and concerns as they arise. By proceeding prudently and knowledgeably, taking care not to jeopardize the innovations and openness that have allowed the Internet to thrive, we can foster progress and continue to enjoy the benefits the Internet continues to bring to the world.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the Internet Caucus cochairs to the White House and today's Associated Press article ``Deal Reached on Managing the Internet'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 2005.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The President of the United States, The White House,          Washington, DC.       Dear President Bush: As co-chairs of the Congressional      Internet Caucus, we are writing to applaud your position that      governance of the Internet should not be transferred to an      international government organization and to urge you to      communicate this position to the international community      during the upcoming World Summit on the Information Society      (WSIS) in Tunisia.       As you know, the Internet's domain name system (DNS) is      administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names      and Numbers (ICANN), a private, nonprofit organization based      in the United States that works closely with the U.S.      Department of Commerce. We believe that this privately-     operated approach fosters market principles and is the most      efficient way to administer the DNS. The greater the      government involvement in running the Internet's day-to-day      operations, the more likely that red tape and overly      burdensome regulations will result.       However, the U.N., with the support of countries including      China, Iran, and Cuba, released a report earlier this year      which included proposals to take control of administration of      the Internet from the U.S.-based ICANN and give it to a      bureaucratic U.N. body. Recently, the EU has signaled that it      would also support having an international body oversee the      Internet. We believe that it is unacceptable for the U.N. to      administer the Internet, and are extremely concerned that the      EU would move toward this position.       The United States is uniquely positioned to protect the      fundamental principles of free press and free speech upon      which the Internet has thrived. The U.S. Constitution      guarantees that basic rights, and to cede control of the      Internet to countries with at best questionable records      regarding these rights could jeopardize the continued success      of the Internet and lead to significant restrictions on      access to the Internet's wealth of information.       With the WSIS convening next month in Tunisia, we urge you      to continue to take a strong stand for the principles that      have guided the administration of the Internet to date and      fostered the phenomenal growth of the Internet: ftee market      principles, the freedoms of speech and the press, and limited      bureaucratic involvement.       Thank you again for your work to ensure the freedom and      effective administration of the Internet. We look forward to      continuing to work with you on this important issue.           Sincerely,     Bob Goodlatte,       Member of Congress.     Conrad Burns,       United States Senator.     Rich Boucher,        Member of Congress.     Patrick Leahy,       United States Senator.                                  ____                 Deal Reached on Managing the Internet                            (By Matt Moore)       A summit focusing on narrowing the digital divide between      the rich and poor residents and countries opened Wednesday      with an agreement of sorts on who will maintain ultimate      oversight of the Internet and the flow of information,      commerce and dissent.       The World Summit on the Information Society had been      overshadowed by a lingering, if not vocal, struggle about      overseeing the domain names and technical issues that make      the Internet work and keep people from Pakistan to Canada      surfing Web sites in the search for information, news and      buying and selling.       Negotiators from more than 100 countries agreed late      Tuesday to leave the United States in charge of the      Internet's addressing system, averting a U.S.-EU showdown at      this week's U.N. technology summit.       U.S. officials said early Wednesday that instead of      transferring management of the system to an international      body such as the United Nations, an international forum would      be created to address concerns. The forum, however, would      have no binding authority.       U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael Gallagher said      the deal means the United States will leave day-to-day      management to the private sector, through a quasi-independent      organization called the Internet Corporation for Assigned      Names and Numbers, or ICANN.       ``The Internet lives to innovate for another day,'' he told      The Associated Press.       Negotiators have met since Sunday to reach a deal ahead of      the U.N. World Summit on the Information Society, which      starts Wednesday. World leaders are expected to ratify a      declaration incorporating the deal during the summit, which      ends Friday.       While the summit drew thousands of people from around the      world, most western countries opted not to send their top-     ranking leaders, preferring instead to send government      workers and low-level figures.       However, other leaders were scheduled to attend, including      Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Senegal's Abdulaye Wade      and Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi. Venezuelan President Hugo      Chavez was due to fly to the summit Wednesday, organizers      said.       The summit was originally conceived to address the digital      divide--the gap between information haves and have-nots--by      raising both consciousness and funds for projects.       Instead, it has centered largely around Internet      governance: oversight of the main computers that control      traffic on the Internet by acting as its master directories      so Web browsers and e-mail programs can find other computers.       The accord reached late Tuesday also called for the      establishment of a new international group to give more      countries a stronger say in how the Internet works, including      the issue of making domain names--currently done in the Latin      languages--into other languages, such as Chinese, Urdu and      Arabic.       Under the terms of the compromise, the new group, the      Internet Governance Forum, would start operating next year      with its first meeting opened by Annan. Beyond bringing its      stakeholders to the table to discuss the issues affecting the      Internet, and its use, it won't have ultimate authority.       Viviane Reding, the EU Commissioner for Information Society      and Media, said the agreement paved the way for a progressive      forward motion in overseeing Internet governance.       ``This agreement was possible because of the strong belief      of all democratic nations that enhanced international      cooperation is the best way to make progress towards      guaranteeing the freedom of the Internet around the globe and      also to enhance transparency and accountability in decisions      affecting the architecture of the Web,'' she said.       ``The fact that the EU spoke with one voice in Tunis, and      had stood by its case for more cooperation on Internet      governance in the run-up to the summit, certainly strongly      influenced this positive agreement,'' she said.       U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Michael D. Gallagher      said the compromise's ultimate decision is that leadership of      the Internet, and its future direction, will remain in the      hands of the private sector, although some critics contend      that the U.S. government, which oversees ICANN, if only      nominally, could still flex its muscle in future decisions.       ``The rural digital divide is isolating almost 1 billion of      the poorest people who are unable to participate in the      global information society,'' the agency said in a statement.       Ahead of the summit, rights watchdogs say, both Tunisian      and foreign reporters have been harassed and beaten.      Reporters Without Borders says its secretary-general, Robert      Menard, has been banned from attending.
