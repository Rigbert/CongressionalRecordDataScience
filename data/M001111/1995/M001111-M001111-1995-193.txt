 President, I say to my colleague, what really is unfair is those people who are only going to get $760 back are the ones who are going to see all of the impacts to their family. Their kids will not be able to go to college. Their out-of-pocket expenses for health care are going to go up dramatically. They are going to see real-life costs to them. They are not going to see $760. They will have to pay more for doctors visits and more for their kid's education. They are going to see more costs to them. And then they are going to turn around to their neighbors, wealthier neighbors, and see them benefit dramatically from this budget proposal.
