Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th birthday of Fayette, OH, located in western Fulton County, OH in America's heartland. On August 2, 1997, this proud rural community will commemorate its milestone with a parade and festival, combined with the rural community's annual Bullthistle Festival.  The ``History of Fayette, Gorham Township, and Fulton County, Ohio'' notes that ``Fayette is located on a beach ridge. It crosses the west line of Franklin Township, a half mile north of the Fulton line, and runs northeast to Fayette and thence to the Michigan line. An ancient shore of Lake Erie came almost to Fayette. The beach ridges have but a small area. Interspersed with these are marshes and west prairies.'' The publication goes on to note that ``The first to settle within the present Fayette was Renesselear S. Humphrey.''  From the hardship and hard work of those earlier settlers, Fayette grew over the years into a thriving and vibrant community. It features the best of both worlds, a rural community but convenient to larger cities. It is a close-knit and good-hearted community of neighbors with agrarian and urban roots.  As part of the annual Bullthistle Festival, the citizens of Fayette will come together in a special ceremony commemorating the town's first 125 years. As flag flown over the U.S. Capitol will be presented to them during this ceremony. I will be pleased to join the community to remember 125 years of growth, and commit ourselves to its future. I know my colleagues join me in wishing the village of Fayette a Happy 125th Birthday.                          ____________________
