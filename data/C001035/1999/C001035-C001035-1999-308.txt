President, I rise in support of two amendments I have filed in connection with the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000.  My amendments, which are cosponsored by Senator Snowe, are expected to be accepted as part of the managers' package, which the chairman of the subcommittee will be sending to the desk shortly.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, and the ranking minority member, Senator Byrd, for their assistance and support of my proposals.  The amendments I am proposing will provide funding and National Park Service support for projects of great historical and international significant to my State and our country. Yet probably only a few of our colleagues have ever heard of St. Croix Island, nestled in the St. Croix River that separates Maine from Canada, or this island's place in the history of the United States and Canada and in the hearts of North Americans of French descent.  We have all probably heard of the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620, or the English colonial settlement at Jamestown in 1607, but few know the story of an even older settlement, dating back to 1604, when French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons, accompanied by a courageous group of adventurers that included Samuel Champlain, landed on St. Croix Island and quickly set about to construct a settlement. They cleared the island, planted crops, dug a well, and built houses, fortifications, public buildings, and gun emplacements. In the process, they were aided by Native peoples who made temporary camps on the island and assisted in various ways. At the same time, Samuel Champlain undertook a number of reconnaissance missions from the island. On one, he found and named Mount Desert Island, now the home to Acadia National Park.  By October, the settlement was ready. But the Maine winter was more than the seventy-nine settlers had bargained for. By winter's end, nearly half had died and many others were seriously ill.  The spring brought relief from the harsh weather. Sieur de Mons relocated his colony to Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and, in 1608, Champlain and a company of men founded Quebec.  According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and ``most ambitious attempt of its time to establish an enduring French presence in the `New World.' '' Many view the expedition that settled on St. Croix Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America. This rich and diverse culture spread across the continent, from Canada to Louisiana, where French-speaking Acadians came to be known as ``Cajuns.''  The rich history and cultural significance of the 1604 settlement at St. Croix Island are beyond question. Yet, with only four years remaining before the 400th anniversary of the settlement, there is still much to prepare for a proper and appropriate commemoration of this historical event.  Let me try to put the occasion in perspective. For the 300th anniversary of the settlement, U.S., British, and French naval ships, flagged out for the occasion, steamed up the St. Croix River and anchored off the historic island. Speakers at the ceremony honoring the anniversary included the consul general of France and the famous U.S. general and Maine patriot, Joshua Chamberlain.  Several thousand people attended the celebration.  In 1996, the U.S. National Park Service and Parks Canada agreed to ``conduct joint strategic planning for the international commemoration [of the St. Croix Island], with a special focus on the 400th anniversary of settlement in 2004.'' For its part, Parks Canada constructed an exhibit in New Brunswick overlooking St. Croix Island. The exhibit uses Champlain's first-hand accounts, period images, updated research, and custom artwork to tell the compelling story of the settlement.  The National Park Service, on the other hand, has plans to expand a small, existing site located just south of Calais, Maine. The Park Service plan envisions a modest, but appropriate outdoor exhibit overlooking St. Croix Island and exhibits in an indoor visitor center, preferably located in nearby Calais. These plans are intended to commemorate in an appropriate way one of only two international historic sites in the U.S. national park system and, as far as they go, the plans are a welcome first step. The next steps have yet to be taken and time is growing short. That is why I offered two amendments to this appropriations bill.  The first amendment makes $90,000 available in FY 2000 to finish pre-construction planning for and begin development of the outdoor site at Red Beach and to plan for the possible location of interpretive exhibits in Calais, Maine. Currently, no money is scheduled to be appropriated for the Red Beach site until FY 2002, and National Park Service officials in Maine and in the Northeast Regional Office agree with me that the funding schedule provides for too little too late. This money is needed now in order to ensure that the project is completed in time for the 400th anniversary celebration.  My second amendment asks the National Park Service to work with the people of Calais to make an indoor visitors center--known as the ``Downeast Heritage Center--a reality. The people of Calais and surrounding areas have worked tirelessly to move the project towards completion. They need the assistance of the National Park Service--which already has endorsed the concept--but which now must help with planning and financial assistance to bring the project from a dream to reality. My amendment asks and directs the Park Service to work with the people of Calais on this project and to ensure that appropriate exhibits are completed in time for the 400th anniversary celebration.  I further request that the Park Service include in its fiscal year 2001 budget submission funds for both the Red Beach site and the Downeast Heritage Center in downtown Calais.  My amendments seeks only a small commitment of funds that are designed to commemorate a 1604 settlement of enormous historical significance.  I again want to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for their assistance in helping our country prepare for a terrific 400th anniversary celebration of the early French settlement at St. Croix Island.  I yield the floor.                    amendment no. 1615, as modified       On page 76, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:       ``The Forest Service is authorized through the Forest      Service existing budget to reimburse Harry Fray for the cost      of his home, $143,406 (1997 dollars) destroyed by arson on      June 21, 1990 in retaliation for his work with the Forest      Service.''                                  ____                           amendment no. 1637   (Purpose: To provide funds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  Resource Management account for grants under the Great Lakes Fish and      Wildlife Restoration Program and for spartina grass research)       On page 10, line 15, strike ``$683,519,000'' and insert      ``$684,019,000''.
