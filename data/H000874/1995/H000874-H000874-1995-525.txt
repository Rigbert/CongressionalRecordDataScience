Speaker, I would thank the majority leader for the information he has given to us, to Members on both sides of the aisle, with reference to the schedule. I know I speak for the majority, that we are very pleased that there is the plan to give to the Members a pretty good understanding of what the schedule is going to be over the months of May and June and July. That would be very helpful to all of us I know.  I would urge the majority leader, as I have on my own said for almost all the years I have been here as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, to move the budget as quickly as possible so we can get our allocations to the Committee on Appropriations so they could report them out. As the gentleman knows, one of the problems we have had, not so much in recent years, but we had in the early 1980's, was the inability to pass appropriation bills prior to the September 30 end of the fiscal year, the consequential looking to continuing resolutions, the failure of funding the Government's operations for the new fiscal year, and so I would hope that we could see the budget come to the House as early in May as is possible, and I appreciate the majority leader's information and attention to these matters.
