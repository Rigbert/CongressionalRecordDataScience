It was an amazing period. I recall particularly the commentator, Rush Limbaugh, who enjoys some notoriety across America. He said: You know, if they closed down the Federal Government, no one would even notice. They were kind of goading us to go ahead and call the bluff of those who wanted to shut it down.  Well, in fact the Government was shut down when Congress failed to pass the necessary bills to continue the funding of Government agencies. And across America people started noticing. I am sure the Senator from California--I was then a Congressman from Illinois--received phone calls from people saying, ``Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that these workers cannot go to work and they're going to be paid ultimately? You mean to say the services that we depend on, that Government needs to do, aren't going to be performed?'' And that is exactly what happened.  I think the American people were outraged over this, outraged that the Government would shut down. If there were those on the other side who believed that the American people would rally to their cause over this Government shutdown and say, ``Oh, you've got it right, give tax cuts to wealthy people, and go ahead and cut Medicare and cut the environmental protection and cut education programs,'' that did not happen.
