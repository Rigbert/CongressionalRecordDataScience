 The information I have been given is this: Under the 13th amendment, Congress may prohibit hate crimes based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin, pursuant to that amendment. Under the 13th amendment, Congress has the authority not only to prevent the ``actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude'' but to ensure that none of the ``badges and incidents'' of slavery or involuntary servitude exist in the United States.  What the Justice Department and what the sponsors of this amendment have concluded is that the 13th amendment gives the appropriate Federal jurisdiction and nexus to pursue this matter under the question of whether or not this is a badge or incident of that form of discrimination.  I don't want to go any further. I am sure the Senator from Massachusetts will explain this in more detail, but this 13th amendment nexus, I think, overcomes the concern of the Senator from Utah about the interpretations recently handed down.
