 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding.  The chairman of the Committee on Rules has just made announcements for the four OSHA bills, the regulatory accounting bill, and I believe the DOD authorization bill. So on these I believe the Committee on Rules is inclined to make multiple amendments in order for those bills.
