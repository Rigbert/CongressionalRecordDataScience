The last time I saw him was in the Capitol Building about a year ago, and you could tell he was struggling a little bit. But it was a day when he was honored and everyone cheered him on and was happy to be there.  He was such an extraordinarily good man. And when the Senator and I value our own heritage and the fact that so many people from different parts of the world come here, proud to be American but also proud of their roots and try to do something for the country they came from or their family came from--Andy was one of those people.
