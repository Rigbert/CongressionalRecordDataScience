 President, very briefly, the FEC is clearly not underfunded. Its budget has more than doubled in the past decade. They are already getting $2 million more this year than last year under the budget of the Senator from Colorado, who has been quite generous to the Federal Election Commission--frankly, beyond what I would have done had I been in his shoes. The FEC's problems are certainly not on the financial side.  Senator Glenn would give them an extra $2.8 million over and above the additional $2 million that the distinguished Senator from Colorado is already providing for this agency. You are talking about a 16-percent budget increase, a 16-percent budget increase for the Federal Election Commission. I think the U.S. district court, in a recent case, said it best when they reported in a Wall Street Journal editorial of July 13:       If there is one thing all the players agree on, it is the      need for better disclosure of contributions and a crackdown      on violators. But a Federal court this week [the Wall Street      Journal referring to a court decision] signaled that the      Nation's electoral traffic cop, the Federal Election      Commission, is lax in carrying out even that basic function.  That is the point. The basic function of the Federal Election Commission is disclosure.  The distinguished Senator from Colorado has more than adequately provided funding for this agency. To give them the additional money offered by the distinguished Senator from Ohio would provide a 16-percent increase over last year. Clearly, that is not appropriate.  I yield the floor.
