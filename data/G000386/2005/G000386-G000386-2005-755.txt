 President, I rise today to introduce the ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.'' This bill will give Federal judges the discretion to allow for the photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting and televising of Federal court proceedings. The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act will help the public become better informed about the judicial process. Moreover, this bill will help produce a healthier judiciary. Increased public scrutiny will bring about greater accountability and help judges to do a better job. The sun needs to shine in on the Federal courts.  Allowing cameras in the Federal courtrooms is consistent with our Founding Fathers' intent that trials be held in front of as many people as choose to attend. I believe that the First Amendment requires that court proceedings be open to the public and, by extension, the news media. The Constitution and Supreme Court have said, ``what transpires in the courtroom is public property.'' Clearly, the American values of openness and educationare served by using electronic media in Federal courtrooms.  There are many benefits and no substantial detrimental effects to allowing greater public access to the inner workings of our Federal courts. Fifteen States conducted studies aimed specifically at the educational benefits derived from camera access courtrooms. They all determined that camera coverage contributed to greater public understanding of the judicial system.  Moreover, the widespread use in State court proceedings show that still and video cameras can be used without any problems, and that procedural discipline is preserved. According to the National Center for State Courts, all 50 states allow for some modern audio-visual coverage of court proceedings under a variety of rules and conditions. My own State of Iowa has operated successfully in this open manner for over 20 years. Further, at the Federal level, the Federal Judicial Center conducted a pilot program in 1994 which studied the effect of cameras in a select number of Federal courts. That study found ``small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the proceeding, courtroom decorum, or the administration of justice.''  I would like to note that even the Supreme Court has recognized that there is a serious public interest in the open airing of important court cases. At the urging of Senator Schumer and myself, Chief Justice Rehnquist allowed the delayed audio broadcasting of the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election dispute. The Supreme Court's response to our request was an historic, major step in the right direction. Since then, the Supreme Court has allowed for audio broadcasting in other landmark cases. Other courts have followed suit, such as the live audio broadcast of oral arguments before the D.C. Circuit in the Microsoft antitrust case and the televising of appellate proceedings before the Ninth Circuit in the Napster copyright case. The public wants to see what is happening in these important judicial proceedings, and the benefits are significant in terms of public knowledge and discussion.  We've introduced the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act with a well-founded confidence based on the experience of the States as well as State and Federal studies. However, in order to be certain of the safety and integrity of our judicial system, we have included a 3-year sunset provision allowing a reasonable amount of time to determine how the process is working before making the provisions of the bill permanent.  It is also important to note that the bill simply gives judges the discretion to use cameras in the courtroom. It does not require judges to have cameras in their courtroom if they do not want them. The bill also protects the anonymity of non-party witnesses by giving them the right to have their voices and images obscured during testimony.  So, the bill does not require cameras, but allows judges to exercise their discretion to permit camera in appropriate cases. The bill protects witnesses and does not compromise safety. The bill preserves the integrity of the judicial system. The bill is based on the experience of the States and the Federal courts. And the bill's net result will be greater openness and accountability of the nation's Federal courts. The best way to maintain confidence in our judicial system, where the Federal judiciary holds tremendous power, is to let the sun shine in by opening up the Federal courtrooms to public view through broadcasting. And allowing cameras in the courtroom will bring the judiciary into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 829       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
