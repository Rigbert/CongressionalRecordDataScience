Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate this legislation has to be on the floor, and I say has to be on the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, last month's partial Government shutdown effectively closed the entire National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. For the first time in the history that I can remember, in 24 years, this has occurred. In the process it locked out thousands of visitors who had paid for the parks and paid for the refuges, hundreds that had paid for the refuges, supported by the hunters, fishermen, and bird watchers seeking to enjoy our parks and refuges, by an action of the Secretary of the Interior, by in fact saying the nonessential workers had to go home so we had to shut it down. If they were nonessential then, what are they today?  To prevent the closure of the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona Governor Fife Symington made a commonsense proposal which would have allowed the park to operate during a shutdown with State employees. Unfortunately, the proposal was rejected by the Interior Department. So visitors from around the world and across the country who came to see the Grand Canyon were locked out.                              {time}  1615  Arizona was not alone in its effort to keep Federal lands open to the public. As the gentlewoman from Arkansas will soon tell you, her State and Mississippi had an agreement with the regional director of Fish and Wildlife to operate certain refuges during the shutdown.  I want to stress this, refuges are managed by the States today, under the agreement with the Department of the Interior. But this agreement was rejected by the department's lawyers in the District of Columbia under the direction of Secretary Babbitt.  In a bipartisan effort to help States in an effort to keep the national parks and refuges open during the Government shutdown, I introduced H.R. 2677, the National Parks and National Wildlife System Freedom Act; this bill merely requires the Interior Department to accept, not require, but for them to accept the services of qualified State employees to operate parks and refuges during a Government shutdown. My bill is very similar to H.R. 2706, introduced by the gentlewoman from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], which limited itself to continuing hunting programs on refuges. This bill has no budget impact, since the States would be supplying funds to operate the parks and refuges.  Moreover, this bill is voluntary for the States. States do not have to do this. This is not a requirement. But when a State steps forward and says, ``Yes, we can, in the case of a shutdown,'' when the Secretary for the first time in history shut down refuges, when a State comes forward and says, ``We will because we already set the bag limit, we already set the take, we already set the season, we already set the species. We will operate these refuges.''  The bill does not address the issues of liability, which you will hear later. The State employees are stepping into the shoes of Federal employees of allowing our States who normally operate the parks and refuges, and, as a result, the standard liability rules will apply. By the way, when was the last time there was any lawsuit against the Federal Government in a refuge or a park? I hope someone will answer that. I cannot remember it, nor have I seen it; in fact, if it occurs, it does come to my mind maybe we ought to put something else on the endangered species, and that would possibly be the legal profession.  We will hear from some in the minority who are concerned about the expedited process or procedures used to bring this bill to the floor today. I do have some sympathy with that. The full Committee on Resources held a 2\1/2\ hour hearing on this bill about last week with the minority members participating very actively. Because of the sense of urgency involved to get this bill to the House and Senate before a possible, and I say possible, Government shutdown in 4 days, it is imperative this bill be on the floor no later than today. As a result, no markup was held.  Under the rules, we can bring the bills to the floor and allow our States to keep the parks and refuges open and require the expedited process to be used.  The bill has bipartisan support. It has been endorsed by the Western Governors' Association, which passed a resolution of support. It is also supported by the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus.  This is a commonsense proposal to help prevent our constituents from being locked out of parks and refuges during future Government shutdowns.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, if I may say, this bill would not be necessary if this Secretary of the Interior had acted accordingly. Yes, sometimes we have shut down our monuments. Yes, we have shut down some of our parks. When a Governor steps forward and says because of the State activity because of the deadlock between the President and the Congress, let us have the opportunity, but more offensive to me is when a State now has the authority to manage fish and wildlife on a refuge to have one person, one person to say all nonessential employees go home, we are going to shut down these refuges regardless of what the State has done in the past. This legislation is voluntary. It just requires the Secretary to accept a proposal from the State official as is offered to the Secretary of the Interior.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
