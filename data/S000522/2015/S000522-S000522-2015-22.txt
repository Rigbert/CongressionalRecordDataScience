I thank my good friend.  You know, mention has been made about Margaret Sanger. I have read three of Margaret Sanger's books. In one of them, called The Pivot of Civilization, she talks about the cruelty of charity of caring for indigent women who carry babies to term, that you should not give them help, that charity is cruel.  She was a racist. Read her books. Read her birth control review. I went to the Library of Congress, got many copies of it and read through it. She had many programs that talked about focusing on Blacks and others for extermination. Just read her books. And, again, The Pivot of Civilization is one of the worst.  Let me also say to my friends that they talk about how these videos have been doctored. Well, there is a new report that just came out called the Coalfire Forensics Analysis. It finds that the videos are authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing.  The events depicted in the missing footage fall into five common categories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording equipment, meals, and restroom breaks.  At each interview, four devices recorded conversations, two video recorders with microphones and two audio-only devices. I ask my friends and colleagues on the other side to take a look at that analysis.  Again, you just attack the whistleblower. You attack the organization. But you don't look at the evidence.  I have watched those tapes several times and was sickened by just how inhumane these individuals are in cutting little babies into pieces in order to procure their body parts.  Seven million babies since 1973 killed in Planned Parenthood clinics. They ought to be called Child Abuse, Incorporated. It is the most unsafe place in America, for a child to be in a Planned Parenthood clinic.  I submit the Coalfire Forensics Analysis Report for the Record.          [Prepared by Coalfire Systems, Inc., Sept. 28, 2015]                   Digital Forensics Analysis Report               (Delivered to Alliance Defending Freedom)                           Executive Summary       In September, 2015, CGS, the prime contractor on behalf of      Alliance Defending Freedom, engaged Coalfire Systems, Inc.,      the sub-contractor (hereinafter ``Coalfire'') to conduct a      computer forensics analysis of certain raw video and audio      data files. Coalfire's objectives for this project are to:       Forensically evaluate video and audio files provided by The      Center for Medical Progress (``the Organization'') through      CGS (``raw'' video and audio), and determine whether the raw      video or audio content of the files have been edited or      otherwise altered;       Compare the raw video and audio to certain files posted to      YouTube (``Full Footage'' videos and a ``Supplemental''      video) for the purpose of determining inconsistencies between      the files.       The scope of Coalfire's analysis did not cover or include:       Validation of those individuals depicted in the video or      audio, who recorded the video and audio files, the location      where they were recorded, when they were recorded, or the      purpose of the recordings;       Providing an opinion on the chain of custody prior to      receipt of source materials by Coalfire;       Coalfire's analysis was limited to only the source      materials received from the Organization and did not include      interviews of participants in the videos or audio.       A flash drive containing recorded media was received via      FedEx by Coalfire on September 17th, 2015, where it was      examined using industry-standard forensic tools and      techniques. The flash drive contained (i) a total of ten (10)      videos with audio recorded on two (2) separate devices, and      (ii) a total of eight (8) audio recordings made with two (2)      audio-only devices.       Coalfire's analysis of the recorded media files contained      on the flash drive indicates that the video recordings are      authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or editing.      This conclusion is supported by the consistency of the video      file date and time stamps, the video timecode, as well as the      folder and file naming scheme. The uniformity between the      footage from the cameras from the two Investigators also      support the evidence that the video recordings are authentic.       With regard to the ``Full Footage'' YouTube videos released      by the Organization, edits made to these videos were applied      to eliminate non-pertinent footage, including ``commuting,''      ``waiting,'' ``adjusting recording equipment,'' ``meals,'' or      ``restroom breaks,'' lacking pertinent conversation. Any      discrepancies in the chronology of the timecodes are      consistent with the intentional removal of this non-pertinent      footage as described in this report.       Furthermore, four of the five raw video recordings, which      also contained audio captured from the video recording      device, are accompanied by a raw audio recording captured      from a separate audio-only recording device. The raw audio-     only recordings last for the duration of their associated raw      videos. These raw audio recordings support the completeness      and authenticity of the raw video recordings since they      depict the same events within the same duration as captured      from the two separate video recorders.                                  ____Digital Forensics Analysis Report of Video Recordings by The Center for                          Medical Progress (CMP)       The Coalfire forensic analysis removes any doubt that the      full length undercover videos released by Center for Medical      Progress are authentic and have not been manipulated.      Analysts scrutinized every second of video recorded during      the investigation and released by CMP to date and found only      bathroom breaks and other non-pertinent footage had been      removed. Planned Parenthood can no longer hide behind a      smokescreen of false accusations and should now answer for      what appear to be the very real crimes revealed by the CMP      investigation.--Casey Mattox, Senior Counsel, Alliance      Defending Freedom       American taxpayer money should be redirected to fund local      community health centers and not subsidize a scandal-ridden,      billion-dollar abortion business. Planned Parenthood is an      organization that cares about one thing: making a profit at      the expense of women's health. The investigative videos,      whose authenticity was confirmed by the report, show that      Planned Parenthood is an abortion-machine whose top      executives and doctors haggle and joke about the harvesting      and selling of baby body parts. Women deserve far better.--     Kerri Kupec, Legal Communications Director, Alliance      Defending Freedom                           Facts and Findings       Forensic analysis of CMP's recorded media files indicates      that the video recordings are authentic and show no evidence      of manipulation or editing.       The events depicted in the missing footage fell into five      common categories: commuting, waiting, adjusting recording      equipment, meals, and restroom breaks.       At each interview, four devices recorded conversations (two      video recorders with microphones and two audio only devices).      The recordings were cross-referenced and found to be      consistent.                       Coalfire v. Fusion Report       The Coalfire report had access to every second of released      audio and video investigative footage recorded by CMP and      analyzed that footage to verify and authenticate all of the      videos on the CMP YouTube page.       The Fusion report had access only to four full length      videos released on YouTube between July 14 and August 4, and      none of the source material.       The Coalfire report also confirmed that one segment of      missing video highlighted by the Fusion Report was later      uploaded in full to CMP's YouTube page.       Coalfire is an internationally recognized third-party      digital security and forensics firm with experience providing      evidence for civil and criminal investigations.       Fusion is a small company formed to develop material for      Democratic party campaigns.       Both reports verify there is no evidence of fabrication or      misrepresentative editing, nothing was dubbed or altered.      Fusion's ``analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of      substantive video manipulation.'' Coalfire found the videos      to be ``authentic and show no evidence of manipulation or      editing.''  Ms. DeGETTE.
