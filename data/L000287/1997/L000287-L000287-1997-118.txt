Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Smoke-Free Transportation Facilities Act, legislation that would ban smoking in all transportation facilities that receive Federal funds.  The Smoke-Free Transportation Facilities Act would provide a breath of clean air for travelers. It will provide some relief to the traveler who cannot simply get up and leave when others expose them to tobacco smoke and the risk of premature death.  Smoking and second-hand smoke are class A carcinogens. Cigarettes kill more than 434,000 Americans each year. Tobacco addiction costs the American public more than $65 billion each year in health care costs and lost productivity. Tobacco is a known killer, yet there are no Federal laws or regulations governing smoking in public areas. For this reason, millions of people are exposed to the dangers of second-hand smoke each day. The exposure to second-hand smoke is particularly prevalent in transportation stations, as travelers have little choice other than to remain in the airport, train station, or bus terminal as they await their departure.  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect travelers from the dangers of second-hand smoke. I believe we all have the right to breath clean air. The Smoke-Free Transportation Facilities Act will help ensure that people who have to travel, or even choose to travel, can breathe a little easier.                          ____________________
