I ask the Senator whether yesterday we brought to the floor an opportunity for the Republicans to join us in a bipartisan way to come up with a clear package of incentives for renewable energy, energy that we need now and for future generations, and yesterday when that measure came to the floor as it originally passed the House of Representatives, I ask the majority leader what the support level was on the Democratic side and whether there were more than four Republican Senators who joined us in that effort.
