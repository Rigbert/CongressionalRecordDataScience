President, I wish to recognize the outstanding work of the VIEWS volunteers at Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center of Gresham, Oregon. They devote many hours to helping seniors in emotional crisis.  Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center began in 1985 as an outreach program for seniors at risk of suicide, and soon developed several programs to address various levels of depression or emotional crisis among seniors, including Volunteers Involved in the Emotional Well-being of Seniors (VIEWS). Over the last ten years, Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center has trained more than 100 peer counselors who have, in turn, provided crucial counseling to over 400 seniors. Without the help of these volunteers, many of Oregon's seniors would have sunk deeper into isolation and despair. As a result of the assistance of these invaluable volunteers, the medical professionals at Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center have been able to extend their reach far beyond what their limited budget would otherwise allow.  These volunteers are performing extraordinary work. I am proud that my own State of Oregon has initiated this effort, and I again wish to congratulate the VIEWS volunteers for being an example of what we can do to help others make a positive difference in the lives of seniors.                          ____________________
