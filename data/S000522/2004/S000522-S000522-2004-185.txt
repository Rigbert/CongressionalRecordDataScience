I do, Mr. Chairman, just for an explanation to the body. Originally, we thought we could work out a word change that would be acceptable, but it would still be subject to a unanimous consent request. We were informed there would be an objection, so that is why we vacated the rewording of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
