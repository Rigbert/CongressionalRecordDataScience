Speaker, during the week of June 12, the House of Representatives considered H.R. 1561, the American Overseas Interests Act. Although this bill is not perfect, I voted in favor of this legislation because it includes several important provisions which I have historically supported.                        humanitarian assistance  H.R. 1561 included language from the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act which restricts U.S. aid to any country that prohibits or restricts the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to other countries. I strongly believe that we should not allow humanitarian assistance to be used as a political weapon while innocent victims are deprived of food, fuel, and medical supplies.                        streamlining government  The consolidation of USAID, ACDA, and USIA into the State Department in H.R. 1561 was one of the most contentious issues during debate. While I support the work of these agencies, I also believe that we must remain committed to streamlining government. Secretary of State Christopher proposed a similar consolidation earlier this year. The Department of Defense is now more efficient and productive due in part to the consolidation.  I supported Representative Ackerman's amendment which would have required the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget to conduct a cost-benefit analysis prior to the implementation of this bill. Regrettably, this failed. Congress has been considering cutbacks and elimination of virtually every Federal agency, and, as such, none should be immune from efforts to reduce Government spending.                     commitment to israel and egypt  H.R. 1561 also recognizes the United States' ongoing commitments to Egypt and Israel and maintains critical funding for the Middle East. As our steadfast ally in the Middle East, Israel has served as a leader in the efforts to bring stability to the region. We are sending a strong message of support to this region, but we are also acting in our own national self-interest to support a strong and democratic Israel. This region was once considered to have the potential to initiate a major world war. Today, we are witnessing the development of a lasting peace. To withdraw our moral and practical support at this point in the peace process would preempt what we have accomplished thus far.                  the u.s. role in the united nations  H.R. 1561 also attempts to redefine our Nation role in the United Nations. This is not to say we should abandon the basic principles of the United Nation, but this bill would make the United Nation more accountable for its programs and practices. By extending current law, H.R. 1561 ensures that the United States maintains a voice in the U.N. budget process by allowing the President to withhold up to 20 percent of appropriated funds for the United Nation if it fails to effect consensus-based decisions. The bill will also give greater authority to the inspector general [IG] of the United Nation. H.R. 1561 withholds 20 percent of the U.N. budget and 50 percent of the peacekeeping budget until the President certifies that the United Nation has increased the powers of the IG, and has given the IG access and sufficient resources to conduct investigations and protect the identity of whistleblowers.  Having witnessed firsthand peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Haiti, I believe we must reevaluate the position of the United States within the United Nations, and define the role in which the United States can best serve not only the interests of the United Nations but also those of the American people.                               east timor  There are provisions in this bill which I do not support. H.R. 1561 authorizes the resumption of International Military and Education Training [IMET] for Indonesia. The IMET Program was eliminated for Indonesia in 1992 due to flagrant human rights abuses by the military in East Timor. This bill authorizes funding for this program, yet there has been no significant improvement in cases of human rights violations. I had planned to introduce an amendment to H.R. 1561 which would have eliminated the authorization of United States funding for military training in Indonesia. This issue is not about the efficacy of American military training and the value of exposing foreign military personnel to the professional and ethical standard of the American Armed Services. Rather, it is whether we will ignore continuous human rights abuses and use our dollars to pay for this training.  Unfortunately, time constraints prevented me from bringing my amendment to the floor. I believe that American taxpayers should not be asked to pay for this. We should not tolerate human rights abuses by the military in East Timor and I will continue to work in the appropriations process to help the people of East Timor.                                 bosnia  I voted against lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina because I believe it would have a detrimental effect in the absence of a larger, more coherent strategy. Although the intent is to strengthen the Bosnian Moslems' position in the field, I am concerned that if the embargo is lifted, a large scale offensive would be initiated by the Bosnian Serbs against highly populated urban centers. The health and safety of civilians, as well as U.N. peacekeeping forces, would be put in greater risk.  Ending the arms embargo could also force the evacuation of U.N. forces. Both the administration and the House Republican leadership have stated that this would require a commitment of U.S. troops. I believe we need to pursue a more comprehensive strategy to address the situation in Bosnia and reach a negotiated and enduring peace. Implementing only one aspect of an inherently complicated plan will only result in further suffering of the Bosnian people.                       africa and latin american  Finally, I hope two issues will be addressed during the appropriations process as well as when the Senate considers its version of the reauthorization. H.R. 1561 cut assistance to Africa and Latin America far below the administration's request. I voted in favor of two amendments to increase funding for the Development Fund for Africa by $173 million and to increase assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by $9 million. While both amendments failed, an engaged debate brought to light the concerns over drastic cuts to these regions which are certain to be addressed again during the appropriations process.                               conclusion  I anticipate many changes to this legislation as it progresses to the conference report. I hope that the conference report represents a continuing commitment by the United States to play a leadership role in the world while recognizing the profound changes in the world and the many demands, both at home and abroad, on our resources.
