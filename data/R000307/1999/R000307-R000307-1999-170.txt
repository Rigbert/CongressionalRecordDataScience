President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 11. I further ask consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, for debate only until 12 noon.
