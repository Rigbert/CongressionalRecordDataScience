 President, on Tuesday, the Foreign Relations Committeedischarged a resolution which speaks to the situation in Darfur, Sudan. I am alarmed by reports of atrocities there. I am worried that genocide may be unfolding.  We need to make a determination about what is going on in Darfur and respond accordingly. Administration officials have termed it ethnic cleansing. This would be horrific in and of itself. But we also have to ask whether or not Khartoum's actions are an intent to destroy in whole or in part a particular ethnic or racial group or groups. If so, what should we do about it? These are questions we must answer right away.  As you know, the administration has been heavily involved in negotiations between the government in Khartoum and southern Sudanese rebels. If an agreement is reached, it will bring an end to twenty years of civil war between the Muslim north, and non-Muslim south.  It will end 20 years of attacks against Muslims in the Nuba mountains and southern Sudanese; 20 years during which the government of Sudan targeted civilians either with its military forces, or through government allied militias; 20 years during which 2 million people have died; 20 years during which millions were displaced both within Sudan and beyond its borders.  The war sparked outrage among members of the international community because of the brutality of attacks against men, women and children. Some cast the war as Muslim versus Christian. I think this captures only a fraction of the story. Arab militias took southern, non-Muslims, black Africans captive as slaves. They pursued a scorched earth policy in southern villages. Muslims living in the Nuba Mountains, who happen to be black, were victims of attacks as well. One is left to wonder if the real cause of the attacks wasn't good old fashioned racism. And while the United States continues to spend valuable diplomatic time and political capitol to bring an end to the north-south conflict, history is repeating itself in western Sudan.  Early last year, ethnic minorities living in western Sudan took up arms to protest Khartoum's arming of Arab militias in the region, and what they believed was economic marginalization by the government in Khartoum. The wisdom of this course of action on the part of the rebels may be debatable. What is not debatable is the disproportionate response of the government--ethnic cleansing in Darfur by means of a well orchestrated campaign of attacks aimed specifically at non-military persons who belong to the same ethnic groups as the rebels.  Khartoum is employing the same tactics in Darfur that they used against those living in southern Sudan: Aerial bombardment of civilians with helicopter gun ships and planes, and attacks by government supported Arab militias known as janjaweed, which employ scorched earth tactics against villages inhabited by black Africans. We are receiving reports of a variety of abuses perpetrated by the janjaweed--routine rape of women, murder of men, the wanton burning of children--from credible sources working in Darfur. In my view, these deliberate attacks and atrocities against civilians constitute crimes against humanity.  President Bush's statement on Sudan issued on April 7, while helpful, was inadequate. He condemned the atrocities in Darfur, but the statement does not speak to the ethnic nature of the attacks. We all know that ethnic cleansing has the potential to turn into genocide. By failing to highlight this very dangerous dimension of Khartoum's campaign, the president failed to speak to the most alarming aspects of the crisis.  The statement says that President Bush expressed his views condemning the atrocities directly to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Since U.S. officials have acknowledged that the actions constitute ethnic cleansing, describing them as well ``organized,'' and ``comprehensive,'' I sincerely hope the President took Bashir to task about the particular evil of such actions. Given the vagueness President Bush's statement, however, one is left to wonder.  Our Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Rich Williamson, has said that 30,000 people are dead as a result of the conflict. One million people--25 percent of the population--are displaced, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  All of them are in dire need of assistance because on top of razing entire villages and firebombing civilians, in addition to burning crops, raping women, torturing men and throwing children into burning huts, on top of all the misery the government has heaped on the people of Darfur for months, Khartoum has refused to allow humanitarian relief organizations free, unfettered, regular access to the region. According to the State Department, it takes aid workers 2 months to get visas. And this is an improvement--it used to take 3 to 4 months.  After pursuing a scorched earth policy in Darfur for months--burned crops, stolen cattle and poisoned wells--the government's latest outrage is cynically ordering people to return to their homes. The few agencies on the ground in the area indicate that people cannot venture even 100 yards outside the displaced persons camps without being attacked. Even if they are able to make it home safely, there is absolutely no likelihood of people surviving in communities that literally no longer exist. At this point, return is not an option and Khartoum is well aware of this.  And the attacks by the janjaweed continue despite the April 8 cease-fire agreement.  Over 100,000 people have fled across the border into Chad. They too are still subject to attack from the janjaweed. UNHCR is in the midst of attempting to relocate refugees farther from the border to enhance their safety. Only half of refugees are living in camps in more secure locations. The other half are making do the best they can. A report issued by Refugees International indicates that many refugees are living in the open with no food, water or shelter.  According to UNHCR's public documents, it needs $27 million to address the needs of refugees in Chad. It has less than half of that on hand. Soon the rainy season will make roads impassible, preventing the delivery of food and shelter materials. The World Food Program is attempting to stockpile food in advance of the rains, but they have a 35 percent funding shortfall as well. We have contributed significant funds, but we and the rest of the international community need to do even more.  Congress needs to do more as well. S. Con. Res. 99 speaks to the nature of the violence and urges the President to do two main things:  First, develop a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to the nearly 1 million people who have been driven from their homes that does not necessitate permission from the government of Sudan. I hope that this plan includes immediate use of the commodities we are holding in the Emerson Trust stockpiles. I would also encourage the administration to come up with a way to deliver food through neighboring countries, including Chad.  Let me also say that I expect and welcome a request in the forthcoming supplemental for money to meet the humanitarian needs engendered by the crisis in Darfur.  Second, it urges the Secretary of State to develop options to increase sanctions on Sudan if the attacks in Darfur do not stop immediately.  I co-sponsored this resolution because I think that these are important steps. They are only steps however. If we do not see any change on the ground by the end of May, we should go even further than this resolution suggests.  We should amend the Sudan Peace Act, which was aimed at jump-starting the north-south peace process, so that it is relevant to the situation in Darfur. Three changes are essential. First, the act, Public Law 107-245, imposes sanctions on the government of Sudan if the President determines that it is not making a good faith effort to negotiate a peace agreement. The act should be amended to require that the President certify that neither the government nor government allied militias have attacked civilians in Sudan 30 days from the enactment of the act and every 90 days thereafter. If the President cannot certify such, then the sanctions in section 6, paragraph 2 should be triggered.  The same certification should apply to humanitarian access. This is already in the legislation, however the requirement is obviously not explicit enoughfor the White House. Despite the restrictions placed on the non-governmental organizations attempting to go into Darfur, on April 21, the President certified the government of Sudan had not unreasonably interfered with humanitarian efforts. Making the law more explicit may prevent another such mistake.  Finally, we should add a requirement that our permanent representative to the U.N. Security Council pursue a Security Council Resolution condemning the government of Sudan for its actions in Darfur, and calling for accountability for those who are found responsible for orchestrating and carrying out the atrocities.  Mr. President, the administration has said that it will not attempt to secure the north-south peace agreement at the expense of the people in Darfur. I agree. In fact, a north-south agreement will be meaningless in the face of ethnic cleansing in western Sudan. I believe that we must ratchet up the pressure on the Government of Sudan, and our partners in the international community to bring an end to the criminal acts of the government in Khartoum.                          ____________________
