Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in Northwest Indiana. On September 18, 1999, in a salute to their workers' durability and longevity, the Hammond Carpenters Union Local 599 will recognize their members with 25 years or more of dedicated service. They will be recognized at a pin ceremony during their 100 year anniversary celebration banquet to be held this Saturday at the Operating Engineers Local 150 Hall in Merrillville, Indiana. These individuals, in addition to the other Local 599 members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are a testament to the proto-typical American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.  The Carpenters Local 599, which received its charter in 1899, will honor members for their years of devoted service. The members who will be honored for 60 years of service include: Frank E. Caise and Frank Rueth. The members who will be honored for 50 years of service include: Willard Rains and Wayne Verble. The members who will be honored for 45 years of service include: Ronald Carlson and Leo Ceroni. The members who will be honored for 40 years of service include: Ezequile J. Lopez and Walter Wisinski. The members who will be honored for 35 years of service include: Donald Archer, Robert L. Farkas, Paul Hornak, Joseph W. Komoroski, Robert Lowry, Harold G. McMillion, Bernard Ritchey, Edward T. Scheeringa, Darrell E. Sills, and John Verbeek. The members who will be honored for 30 years of service include: G.A. Argentine, Charles A. Gibbs, Raymond J. Maida, Rudy Medellin, and William R. Underwood. The members who will be honored for 25 years of service include: Daniel R. Brown, Timothy P. Foley, and John S. Perz.  As Orville Dewey said, ``Labor is man's greatest function. He is nothing, he can be nothing, he can achieve nothing, he can fulfill nothing, without working.'' The men and women of Local 599, in addition to all of the local unions in Northwest Indiana, form the backbone of our economy and community. Without their blood, sweat, and tears, Indiana's First Congressional District would not be the place I love, nor would it be my proud home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and outstanding members of the Hammond Carpenters Union Local 599, in addition to all the hard-working union men and women in America. The men and women of Local 599 are a fine representation of America's union men and women; I am proud to represent such dedicated individuals in Congress. Their hard labor and dauntless courage are the achievement and fulfillment of the American dream.                          ____________________
