Speaker, I take to the floor of the House today to praise a great legislator, a lifelong public servant, a combat veteran, and a personal friend. It may come as a surprise to those listening here in Washington, DC, but I am talking about one man--Senator Robert Presley of Riverside, CA.  Senator Presley represented the 36th State senatorial district of the great State of California. He was first elected to the senate in 1974. To give an idea of the span of his career, I note that I have staff in my office who were just learning to walk then, a first-class stamp cost about 15 cents, and the State budget was at the incredible level of $20 billion.  Having graduated from the FBI Academy, Senator Presley went on to a successful career in law enforcement. He maintained that interest in protecting and serving the public in the senate by concentrating on anticrime legislation, prison construction, and child-protective services. Though that is not all, Mr. Speaker. Bob authored major legislation on clean air, wildlife conservation, toxic-materials control, education reform, attorney discipline, parks and recreation, and domestic violence.  Known as one of the hardest-working legislators, Senator Presley's committee service was comprehensive. He was chairman of the senate appropriations committee and the senate select committee on children and youth. He served on and was chairman of the senate natural resources and wildlife committee. He sat on the judiciary local government and agriculture and water resources committees. He also headed the joint committee on prison construction and operations. Not only did Bob work hard, he worked openly and fairly with all, regardless of party affiliation. He was, and is, interested in the improvement of California as his first, second and third priorities.  Knowing that the wellspring of leadership is found in the local community, Bob is a member of the Riverside Lions, Elks and Moose lodges, American Legion, Air Force Association, and VFW.  Mr. Speaker, people here in Washington will often be introduced as the member from the ``great State of California.'' Yet, who is it that makes California great? Who is it that makes our State that wonderful place in which we want to raise our families, grow our businesses, build our dreams.  It is citizen leaders like Bob Presley who consistently listen and learn, and then lead our communities to reach their full potential. It is the personal friend who without regard to mere party, will gladly and fruitfully guide younger politicians and community leaders. It is the decorated combat veteran who returns victorious, only to dedicate himself to keeping the peace at home. It is the enlightened legislator who serves his fellow citizens for two decades in the senate. It is Senator Robert Presley, a true original who is worthy of the sincerest form of flattery--imitation. Fortunately, we will still enjoy the expertise and concern of Senator Presley. He is now affiliated with our wonderful University of California, Riverside. We all look forward to working with Bob in this next chapter of his public service.  Thank you Bob for all you've done and the example you've set. All of your neighbors and fellow citizens owe you more than we can say.                          ____________________
