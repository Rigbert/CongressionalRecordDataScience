President, 3 weeks ago we came to the floor of the Senate and asked our Republican colleagues to join us in a bipartisan effort to extend unemployment compensation benefits for those across America who have lost their jobs. This fairly routine and common political request was met with opposition from the Republican side. It came as a surprise because we know the unemployment we face in this country is not confined to States represented by Democratic Senators, it is nationwide. The recession has cost us so many jobs and, sadly, I am afraid that, although there are signs of recovery, it will be some time before many unemployed people actually do get back to work.  It is said there are six unemployed people for every available job. The frustration that creates for those who are unemployed is obvious. So the object of our request was to ask our Republican colleagues to join us in extending unemployment insurance benefits for those who are about to see them expire.  Unfortunately, the Republican side objected, and they objected because they said they wanted to offer some amendments. It is not unusual to offer an amendment to anything that comes to the Senate floor, but in the case of an emergency such as this, an economic emergency where people have, within the last few weeks or months, seen their livelihood extinguished because they have no job and no benefits coming in, it is a little hard to understand why some Members on the Republican side of the aisle insist on offering amendments that have virtually nothing to do with unemployment.  Let me give one example. The Senator from Louisiana wants to offer an amendment that would, once again, punish an organization known as ACORN. ACORN is not in Illinois--it has not been for many years--so I don't know on a personal basis, but from what I read, it is an organization involved in grassroots organizing. It helps organize States to pass increases in the minimum wage in each State. They have also organized to register voters in many States. They have been involved in counseling people who are about to lose their homes to avoid foreclosure.  Having said those good things, there were clearly acts of wrongdoing by employees of ACORN. In fact, a couplewere videotaped. What we saw on those videotapes, a few weeks ago, was nothing short of outrageous. The employees involved were fired by ACORN. I have suggested, if there is any criminal activity associated with it, it should be investigated and prosecuted, no ifs, ands or buts. But, unfortunately, this has become a big cause on rightwing radio and TV: go after ACORN. Some Senators are inspired by that to come to the floor on a frequent basis and offer ACORN amendments--one after another after another. We think some four or five different amendments have been offered, ways of punishing ACORN.  The House has already passed an amendment saying ACORN cannot do business with the Federal Government. There have been amendments offered--I have offered one of them--calling for a complete investigation of the organization. Other appropriations bills have limited any expenditures involving this organization. So it is not as if it has been ignored or glossed over or excuses are being made. There is a full investigation being ordered, action taken against it.  But for some Senators, particularly one from Louisiana, it is not enough. We have to go back and debate ACORN again. We have to debate it on a bill for unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Another Senator wants to extend a program called E-Verify. E-Verify, conceptually, is sound; that is, you could verify whether a person applying for employment is, in fact, a citizen; that you could have a number or computer contact verifying the name and Social Security number of the person. It is sound in principle, but it turns out in operation it has been a problem. Many times, the numbers have not matched when they should have, people have been disqualified from jobs when they should not have been, and the system clearly needs to be repaired and improved. It will last for 3 more years, this system, if we do nothing. A Senator from Alabama has come to the floor and said he wants to make this a permanent program, despite some of the obstacles and problems we currently have with it.  So a Senator from Louisiana wants to flog ACORN, this organization, again; a Senator from Alabama wants to extend a law beyond the 3 years it is going to be in existence to make it permanent; and they are holding up unemployment benefits for people all across America. We are now doing nothing in the Senate except making speeches because these Senators insist on their amendments and will not agree to unemployment benefits until they get them.  Twenty-one days after we requested an extension of unemployment benefits, the Republican Senators and leadership are continuing to hold us up. Two hundred thousand Americans will lose their unemployment insurance this month if the Republicans continue to obstruct a vote to extend the benefits. To put it in perspective, around 200,000 people live in Birmingham, AL, and in Montgomery and in Mobile. The Republicans are refusing to help roughly the number of people who live in the three biggest cities in that State, all because a Senator wants to vote to extend, permanently, the E-Verify Program.  Around 200,000 people live in Baton Rouge, LA, and in Shreveport as well. Republicans are refusing to help roughly the number of people who live in those two biggest cities in Louisiana outside New Orleans, all because the Senator from Louisiana wants one more chance to give one more speech for one more amendment about ACORN. Yes, one more.  Meanwhile, here is what I learned from one of my constituents in Chicago who wrote and said:       I have been out of work 9 of the last 12 months. I have      applied for over 200 jobs and I still am unemployed. I am      educated, worked since I was 15 years old and cannot find      work. I have applied for everything from hourly to above my      skill level including city and state jobs and have not heard      from most.       Further, Peoples Gas cut off my service this week--for      months I have let them know what I was able to pay and have      paid it, they still cut off my service. What are we citizens      to do. . . .       My son and I will be living on the street any day. Where is      the help?  That is from one of my writers from Chicago. Here is a letter from a woman in Genoa, IL.       . . . I am currently one of many who is unemployed and      almost out of benefits. I have 2 young children I am      responsible for and have made a full time effort to look for      work. I have applied at gas stations, McDonald's,      restaurants, everywhere. There are just no jobs. Can you      please tell me if the Senate will be voting on the extension      [of unemployment benefits] sometime soon? I am expecting my      last check next week and then I don't know what I am going to      do about keeping a roof over mine and my children's heads.       Please help us from becoming homeless. Any kind of response      on this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  How can my colleagues on the Republican side hear stories like that, if they are even listening to these unemployed people, and refuse to help so they can come to the floor and debate their amendments? For goodness' sake, tomorrow is another day. There will be another chance to give a speech and debate an amendment. Why wouldn't you let the unemployment compensation benefits go forward for people such as those who have written to me? The unemployment rate in my State is 10.5 percent, and I think it is my duty to help these people with a safety net that will help them get by while they are just one out of six applicants for every available job. While they struggle to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads, we ought to be doing our part in the Senate.  Apparently, yesterday when we voted to go to the unemployment benefits, 13 Republican Senators voted no, against moving to the extension of unemployment benefits. In case some of those Senators missed it, here are the unemployment rates in the States represented by the Republicans who voted against even debating an extension of unemployment insurance: Texas, 8.2 percent; Mississippi, 9.2 percent; Missouri, 9.5 percent; Alabama, 10.7 percent; Kentucky, 10.9 percent; South Carolina, 11.6 percent. I don't understand it. How could you represent a State with over 10 percent unemployment and vote against unemployment benefits for the people there who are searching for jobs? That, to me, does not represent family values. It doesn't represent what this Senate ought to be about. For goodness' sake, it doesn't represent the kind of bipartisanship that was always behind voting for unemployment benefits.  This Republican obstruction, when it comes to something this basic, is fundamentally unfair. It is way past time. We should not be playing games and posturing. We ought to stop the politics. We ought to be voting in the next 5 minutes so we can respond to the people who write to us in desperation and tell them, in fact, we are moving the bill forward so they will have the basics in life to take care of their families.                              Health Care  I also wish to say a word or two about health care because that is the issue that, while we work on others, is coming to the floor soon for a historic debate. Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, has sent a bill to the Congressional Budget Office to score it, which basically means to find out will it cost us money. If so, will it add to the deficit? Will it reduce the costs of health care? The Congressional Budget Office is doing that analysis at this current time.  It is clear we desperately need this because we find fewer and fewer businesses offering health insurance across America, and the cost of health insurance is going up so fast people cannot afford it. The New York Times reported that insurance brokers and benefits consultants say small business clients are going to see premiums go up on health insurance an average of about 15 percent for the coming year. That is double the rate of last year's increase. When Republican Senators come to the floor--and they did this morning--and say: Let me tell you, if you pass health care reform, the cost of health insurance will go up, what they don't say is, if you don't pass health care reform, health insurance costs will go up anyway and possibly higher. What we are trying to do is slow the rate of growth in the cost of health care across America.  In one national survey, nearly three-quarters of small businesses that did not offer benefits cited high premiums as the reason. So as the premium costs go up and businesses offer less coverage, individuals have to go out ontheir own and it is even more expensive. Small businesses pay up to 18 percent more than large firms. What we have tried to do in the health care reform we are working on is to give small businesses a chance. I joined with Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas as well as Senators Snowe and Collins of Maine in introducing the SHOP bill, which has become part of the health care reform.  It is an effort which we put together with the help of the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the National Realtors Association and the SEIU labor union to try to find a way that small businesses could afford health insurance, allow them to pool into larger groups, allow them to shop from a market of health insurers so they would have some choice to lower the cost, the overhead costs they face, and to lower the premium costs, so small businesses could offer health insurance.  But it is not just small businesses that are stuck. Many Americans actually stay in jobs today because they are afraid that if they move from one job to another, they will lose their health insurance. Even business owners, the risk takers among us who have so often led us out of the recession, are less willing to take that risk when it comes to people who are sick and need employment.  Melissa Wilhelm in Chicago knows what I am talking about. Melissa spent years as a research associate, then decided it was time for a change in her professional life. She felt she had outgrown the position she was in. She said: I did not want to put the widget in the hole every day.  Melissa had good reason to want the most out of each day. Only a couple of years earlier, at the age of 35, Melissa had been diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma, an aggressive type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. As frightening as her diagnosis was, one thing Melissa did not worry about was how she was going to pay for her cancer treatment. She had a good health insurance policy. In fact, she had two, one through her employer and another one through her graduate school.  In 2006, thank God, Melissa went into remission. It was after her recovery that Melissa decided it was the time for a career change. She wanted to start her own education consulting company.  Knowing her medical history, she knew her first step was to meet with a health insurance agent. Melissa said the agent actually laughed in her face. Getting affordable health insurance as a self-employed cancer survivor is apparently a laughable request in the world of insurance. Melissa was not alarmed at that point. She qualified for 18 months of COBRA coverage and assumed she would have enough time to shop around. But a couple of months later, she came home from vacation to bad news: her COBRA insurance had been terminated. She apparently missed paying one monthly payment. It had been sent to the wrong place. But for COBRA, since she missed the payment, it was the end of the story, the end of her coverage. She was not refunded the $2,000 she had already paid in premiums; they just cut her off. Suddenly, she became one of the uninsured, a cancer survivor without insurance.  She had one last option: the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan, our State's high-risk pool, a pool for those individuals unable to buy health insurance otherwise. But the coverage would not come cheap; it would cost her $780 a month, plus a $2,000 deductible--a price she had no choice but to pay. As she waited for her coverage to be finalized, she put off checkups and CAT scans. It was risky, but, as she said: I did not want to drag myself and my family into bankruptcy. Those apparently were the choices: go to the doctor or face bankruptcy--not much of a choice in modern-day America.  We know health care costs are a major factor in two out of three bankruptcies in our country today. How many families can even entertain the idea of paying $25,000 a month for chemotherapy? Not many. And none of us should ever be in a position where professional growth is not an option because it means giving up health care coverage.  Melissa said: People do not have the ability to leave their jobs. They cannot afford to be more productive or more challenged. That is not the American spirit. And Melissa is right.  Melissa was living the American dream, pursuing new goals and opportunities with the entrepreneurial spirit we need in this country. But she was stopped--stopped cold because of her lack of health insurance.  Melissa eventually succeeded and started her business as an educational consultant. She is currently helping evaluate Chicago public schools at risk of failure and developing good practices so that students can do better. With a Ph.D. in child development policy, Melissa is certainly up to the task. I think we can use more people like her, determined to improve their lives even though they have to battle cancer and the health insurance companies at the same time. Health care reform will free more people to leave dead-end or unfulfilling jobs and to pursue new goals without fear of becoming uninsured.  Today, many of the unemployed spend countless hours trolling job sites, motivated at least in part by the desperate need for health care. What if these people had a safety net, a health care option outside of employer-provided health care? Maybe, like Melissa, they would strike out on their own, open the restaurant or the business they always wanted to open. Maybe those businesses would grow, employ more people.  It is clear that small businesses suffer in today's health insurance market more than most. It is extremely difficult for those businesses to compete against big firms that are able to spread the cost of unexpected illness across a large pool.  The bottom line is this: We have a health care reform bill that is now being carefully reviewed, as it should be. It is one we will debate at length. The critics will come to the floor, as they did this morning, and will tell us what is wrong with the bill. But the fact of life is, those who are criticizing the bill have no alternative. Their alternative is to stay with the current system.  The current system of health care in America is too expensive, the cost is going up too quickly, fewer and fewer people are insured each year, and more of us are bearing the costs of the insured as they are treated in hospitals and by doctors who pass along that cost to other people.  We are the victims of health insurance companies which on a whim can deny coverage, can claim there was a preexisting condition unreported or a cap on the amount of money they will pay, or the fact that you are sick, they just do not want to be there. That is the reality of what we face today.  Those on the other side of the aisle who will not participate have opted out of the health care debate and really have little room to criticize unless they want to step forward with their own proposal and their own plan. And the honest answer is, they don't have one. They don't have an answer.  I hear from many of my constituents who ask me what we are going to do to get this economy moving again. That is our highest priority. But in addition to that we have to liberate families and businesses and individuals from the fear they have of health insurance they can't afford, health insurance companies that just say no, or the fact that losing or changing a job can cost them the peace of mind they need to protect their families.  We can do a lot more for the American people. I hope we will have the cooperation of the Republican side in doing this. It would be great if we had a bipartisan bill. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come around and be part of the solution.  I yield the floor.
