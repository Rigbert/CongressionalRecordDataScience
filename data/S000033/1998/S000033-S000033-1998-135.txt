 Speaker, let me quote from a letter that I recently received from Colchester, Vermont, from a senior citizen who does not have a lot of money. She wrote, ``The list of persons who qualify for the section 8 program'' that she is applying for ``puts my name on a list with 990 persons ahead of me. When you enter your seventh and eighth decade, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to surmise that the likelihood of ever deriving benefit from this program is pretty minimal.'' And that is the story all over this country, elderly people needing affordable housing, working people needing affordable housing.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when we have given huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America, when we spend $2 billion for B-2 bombers that the Pentagon does not want, when we provide $125 billion a year on corporate welfare, we do not have to continue the assault on affordable housing and on education.  Yes, the Northeast and the rest of this country was hurt by a disaster; and, as Americans, we must rise up, as we always have, to protect those people who were hurt. But let us not take away from the elderly and the working people and the poor to do so. It is unnecessary. Vote down this rule and support emergency relief.
