 President, I rise today to recognize two acts of selfless courage that exemplify the willingness of Iowans to accept and fulfill their Nation's call to duty. The actions of US Marine Corps Sgt. R.J. Mitchell and Sergeant Major Bradley Kasal have earned each of them the Navy Cross. Awarded for their actions during a November 2004 assault on Fallujah, the Navy Cross is among the highest awards for gallantry our Nation can bestow on those who serve. More than this, they have earned the respect of a nation and the thanks of its people by ensuring that the cause of freedom and its protection not only survives but thrives in the face of every challenge.  Sergeant Mitchell, who grew up near Carson, IA, was awarded the Navy Cross on July 28. Sergeant Major Kasal, originally from Afton, IA received his award May 1 as well as a promotion to sergeant major. During an assault on a house in Fallujah, both Iowans charged to the aid of fellow wounded marines, remaining in the line of fire and continuing to provide leadership to fellow marines until the last injured marine was safely evacuated. Over the course of the engagement, both sustained wounds from enemy fire and shrapnel but continued on in harm's way, saving the lives of several marines as a result of their selfless actions.  I extend my personal gratitude, that of all Iowans, and all Americans, to these brave marines. It is in their selfless acts of courage that the very meaning of honor can be found. The Navy Cross is more than an adornment, it symbolizes the respect and appreciation of the American people. Through these heroic acts in service to their country, Brad Kasal and R.J. Mitchell truly embodied the motto of Iowa, ``Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.''                          ____________________[Page S8533]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                             A CALL TO DUTY
