Speaker, one year ago this Friday, the Capitol Building was shaken by a maniacal and senseless shooting spree. This day reminds us once again that the risk is always present for those we ask to defend this free society. The vagaries of life are such that there are those, either demented or angry or for whatever reasons, that take unto themselves the opportunity to commit violence.  We lost Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson so that many others might be safe and to indicate that the Capitol of the United States, freedom's house, will not only be accessible, but also protected.  This past May we rededicated the Capitol Police headquarters in honor of Officer Chestnut, Detective Gibson, and Officer Christopher Eney, the first Capitol Police officer killed in the line of duty during a training accident in 1984. This resolution complements the renaming of the headquarters building. Henceforth, every tourist, staffer, Member or head of state that uses the ``memorial door'' will remember the public service of these three men and the ultimate sacrifices that each of them made.  While this resolution renaming the document door specifically honors Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, the memorial door is a tribute to all of the men and women of law enforcement who leave their homes each day and take to their duties to defend America's principles, to defend Americans, and to defend an orderly society.  Just down the street from this building stands the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Since last year's tragedy, the names of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson have been added to a long list of fallen officers including their colleague, Officer Eney and others from departments around the Nation.  In the last year we have taken some very positive steps in insuring that this type of incident does not happen again. While we can never guarantee that there is not another shooting, the security enhancement plan is an important step in the right direction. With additional officers, acquisition of new equipment, and a restructuring of the department, we can work to decrease the chances of another shooting while retaining the accessibility that the American public and the World over have come to know.  Let us not forget the ultimate sacrifice that these two brave officers made. I thank my colleague Representative Delay, for bringing forward this resolution and I urge my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson on this solemn one-year anniversary by passing this resolution.                          ____________________
