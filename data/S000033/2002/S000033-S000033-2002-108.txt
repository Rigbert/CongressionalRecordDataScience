 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I respectfully request that the following be included in the Congressional Record.             On Behalf of Jessica Walters and Falinda Hough                      Regarding UNDERAGE DRINKING       April 8, 2001       JESSICA WALTERS: We are talking about teen alcohol. There      is a lot of teen alcohol going around, and it needs to stop.      If it doesn't stop, a lot more people are going to get      killed. We think the reasons why teens drink is because they      get into fights with their parents, and they get so mad where      they end up drinking. Teens go to parties where they have      peer pressure to drink, and they end up doing it because they      think they will be cool. Then they get hooked on it where      they can't stop. It only takes one time. It can also be      inherited by their parents that are alcoholics, and it      already is in their bloodstream.       Over in Canada, the teens are allowed to drink at the age      of 18. They should not be allowed. They might be more      responsible at that age, and then again, maybe not.       FALINDA HOUGH: Ways we can help. Police in every bar. The      national government can give grants to cities that can help      police in every bar. Watch out for fake IDs. National      governments can give states money to buy the technology      where, when they enter the bar, they can scan on the back of      IDs to tell whether they are of age or not.                                  ____                                          On behalf of Lee Goldsmith, Robby Short, and Greg Howard                       regarding school id badges       April 8, 2001       LEE GOLDSMITH: Thank you for coming up this morning. Who is      going to begin?       ROBBY SHORT: I will. A current issue at Mount Anthony is      whether or not to have students wear ID badges. The main      reason is to know who belongs at the school and who is      actually not supposed to be there.       Currently, teachers at Mount Anthony are required to wear      their ID badges. Visitors and substitutes are given stickers      that say either ``visitor'' or ``substitute'' on them. So the      only unknown factor is the students.       I do see all the subs and visitors wearing their badges,      but I see many teachers not wearing theirs. I think the      teachers feel that the ID badges are kind of tedious, and      they don't need to be wearing them. And I think a lot of      students feel the same way.       GREG HOWARD: We did the pros and cons.       Just to list some of the pros: There are several good      reasons why students should wear identification tags at all      times. If a fire or some other emergency occurs, it will be      easier to identify students and to identify strangers by who      is and who is not wearing the tags.       Another idea was that, if fire codes were put on the tags,      they could be used for other things, such as to unlock doors      and to check school books in and out of our library, at      least. Other people wanted to use the cards, not only for ID,      but as debit cards, so students could buy lunches.       And the last idea is that people could take attendance, or      teachers could use the cards to take attendance in the      morning, which would give them more time to teach their      subjects instead of taking attendance.       LEE GOLDSMITH: Going over the cons, real quick. Basically,      the biggest argument against this is there just isn't enough      money and there are better things to spend it on.       And there were a lot of pros we came up with, and it would      work very well in principle, but not in practice. We think      that students would lose them a lot, and teachers and      administrators would have a lot of trouble enforcing the      rules and making students wear the identification. And people      would just, you know, forget them.       And also, there are a lot of students who think that it's      against our right to privacy, and a lot of people don't want      to wear the tags, and they think that it's just--it will make      us feel like we are in--not really a prison, but we are not,      like, welcome there and we are not at home, which is      obviously how we should feel.                                  ____                                                           On Behalf of Dan Hill                      regarding affordable housing       April 8, 2001       DAN HILL: I am presenting on affordable housing for young      adults. Especially for people in Burlington here, there is      not a lot of affordable housing for young adults.       I can read from my report, but I don't want to.       The housing situation here, especially here in Burlington,      is horrible. If one has UVM here--pardon me, Professor. It is      just, here in Burlington, you have 50 percent of the housing      being taken by the colleges. And I believe you have about      14,000 students here. If you say that the University of      Vermont provides about 49 percent of its housing here for its      students, and all the rest of the students have to go out,      and that is over 7,000 who have to find apartments here in      Burlington. And we actually need 7,400 housing just to meet      the current needs of the residents living here.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Let me jump in and just ask you a      question right now.       DAN HILL: Yes.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: We have a very serious housing crisis      in the Burlington area, and in fact, we have a very serious      crisis in communities around the state and all over the      country. What do you think should be done?       DAN HILL: I think that more money should be put into      building more suitable housing, affordable housing, for young      adults, and not just young adults, but anyone who needs them.      If you look at the problem and you just go anywhere, the rent      is just so high here in Burlington. And not many people make      that much money.       Especially when you are a young adult, you don't have your      college diploma or anything, you are just out of high school,      or in     high school, and you have a job that pays you about $8 an      hour, and you probably make 800 a month, net.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Dan is making a very, very important      point. And that is, if you are working, earning $8 an hour or      $10 an hour, just do the arithmetic and figure out how you      would be able to pay rents of--what?--500 or 600 a month?       DAN HILL: It's about $750 for a two-bedroom apartment.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: So if you had a kid and were making $8      an hour, you do the arithmetic. And what you find is that you      end up spending 50 or 60 percent of your income for housing,      which leaves very little left over to do other things that      human beings need to do.                               ____________________
