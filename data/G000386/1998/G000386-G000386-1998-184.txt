 President, today I introduce the Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act. This legislation is an important first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs.  I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Graham of Florida join me as a cosponsor of this legislation, which has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative John Mica.  The Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act will establish a program under which long-term care insurance may be obtained by current and former employees of the federal government. The premiums will not be subsidized by the government and will be paid for entirely by the employee or retiree. However, this legislation will make long-term care insurance more affordable to by using the government's purchasing power to negotiate volume discounts.  It is my belief that the participation of a large employer such as the federal government in the long-term care insurance market will act as a catalyst to encourage other large employers to offer similar plans. This legislation will establish a larger market for long-term care insurance and help ensure the availability of competitively priced, high quality insurance products.  This measure will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare for their long term care needs by making insurance more widely available and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                S. 2477       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
