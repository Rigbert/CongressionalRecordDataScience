 Give us that opportunity. Give us that opportunity to say ``yes'' to the American middle class. Give us the opportunity to say ``yes'' to certainty in our economy. Give us the opportunity to say ``yes,'' we agree on something, and aren't you proud of the fact that when we agree, your Congress can act? Let's say ``yes.''  Vote ``no'' on the previous question, and then vote ``yes'' for the middle class.
