Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 127) calling on the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to transfer Charles Ghankay Taylor, former President of the Republic of Liberia, to the Special Court for Sierra Leone to be tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 127       Whereas on January 16, 2002, as requested by United Nations      Security Council Resolution 1315 (2000), an agreement was      signed by the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone and      the United Nations to establish the Special Court for Sierra      Leone;       Whereas the Special Court for Sierra Leone was given the      power to prosecute persons who have committed and ``bear the      greatest responsibility'' for war crimes, crimes against      humanity, other serious violations of international      humanitarian law, and certain crimes under Sierra Leonean law      committed within the territory of Sierra Leone during that      country's brutal civil war during the period after November      30, 1996;       Whereas on June 4, 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone      unsealed an indictment issued on March 3, 2003, against      Charles Ghankay Taylor, former President of the Republic of      Liberia, charging him with seventeen counts of war crimes,      crimes against humanity, and other violations of      international humanitarian law relating to his role in      directly supporting and materially, logistically, and      politically abetting the rebel Revolutionary United Front      (RUF) and its actions, including its notorious, widespread,      and systematic attacks upon the civilian population of Sierra      Leone;       Whereas the indictment of Charles Taylor includes charges      of terrorizing civilians and subjecting civilians to      collective punishment, mass murder, sexual slavery and rape,      abduction and hostage taking, severe mutilation, including      the cutting off of limbs and other physical violence and      inhumane acts, enslavement, forced labor, forced military      conscription, including forced conscription of children,      theft, arson, looting, and pillage, and widespread attacks      upon the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and      humanitarian workers by the Revolutionary United Front      combatants;       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front was notorious for      brutally murdering and torturing civilians, including the      amputation of limbs with machetes, and by carving ``RUF''      onto the bodies of thousands of victims, including women and      children;       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front made widespread use      of abducted children as laborers and soldiers and forced many      of the abducted children to perform severe human rights      abuses, constituting a serious crime under the jurisdiction      of the Special Court for Sierra Leone;       Whereas on August 11, 2003, Charles Taylor departed Liberia      for Calabar, Nigeria, where he was granted asylum and,      according to press reports, agreed to end his involvement in      Liberian politics;       Whereas in September 2003 the Government of the Federal      Republic of Nigeria warned Taylor that it would ``not      tolerate any breach of this condition and others which forbid      him from engaging in active communications with anyone      engaged in political, illegal or governmental activities in      Liberia'';       Whereas the United States, Nigeria, and other concerned      nations have contributed extensive political, human,      military, financial, and material resources toward the      building of peace and stability in Liberia and Sierra Leone;       Whereas the Special Court for Sierra Leone has contributed      to developing the rule of law in Sierra Leone and is      deserving of support;       Whereas on March 17, 2005, the United Nations Secretary-     General reported to the United Nations Security Council that      Charles Taylor's ``former military commanders and business      associates, as well as members of his political party,      maintain regular contact with him and are planning to      undermine the peace process'' in Liberia;       Whereas David Crane, Chief Prosecutor at the Special Court      for Sierra Leone, stated: ``Unless and until Charles Taylor      is brought to justice, there will be no peace. Charles Taylor      is a big cloud hanging over Liberia. He is still ruling the      country from his house arrest in Calabar. His agents remain      influential in the country.'';       Whereas on March 22, 2005, Jacques Klein, the United      Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General to      Liberia, stated: ``Charles Taylor is a psychopath and a      killer . . . He's still very much involved [in and is . . . ]      intrusive in Liberian politics.''; and       Whereas Charles Taylor remains a serious present and      continuing threat to Liberian and West African subregional      political stability, security, and peace, and to United      States interests in the region: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress urges the Government of the      Federal Republic of Nigeria to expeditiously transfer Charles      Ghankay Taylor, former President of the Republic of Liberia,      to the jurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone to      undergo a fair and open trial for war crimes, crimes against      humanity, and other serious violations of international      humanitarian law.
