 President, let me just say, I had not planned to speak on this resolution, but I, too, watched that ball game. I think it was, as the distinguished assistant Democratic leader said, possibly one of the most exciting football games ever. So we all do commend the Ohio State Buckeyes for their great victory.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and its preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.
