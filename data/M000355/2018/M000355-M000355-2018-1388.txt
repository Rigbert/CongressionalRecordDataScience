 Overnight, he completed a sensitive diplomatic mission and returned home from North Korea with three freed American prisoners. The families of these three men, and the entire country, are so grateful.  This episode offers just one more example of the complex, relentless foreign policy challenges that confront our country. Clearly, America was fortunate that our new Secretary of State was prepared to execute his responsibilities from day one. Leadership and expertise matter.  Yesterday, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee heard from another well-prepared leader, Gina Haspel--President Trump's selection to head the Central Intelligence Agency. Ms. Haspel's testimony showcased the judgment and poise that have defined her 33-year career of selfless service with the Agency. Her testimony confirmed what her gold standard resume and her bipartisan support from seasoned national security leaders had actually already told us: Gina Haspel has the experience, the talent, and the unique skill set to excel in this important job at this important moment.  Since 1985, she served the Nation in clandestine operations around the globe and rose to the highest levels of Agency leadership. True to the best traditions of intelligence professionals, numerous former Directors have lauded her qualifications, notwithstanding whether their service was for Democratic or Republican administrations. Her nomination carries the full-throated endorsement of 53 of our Nation's most respected national security leaders.  Today, more than ever, the value of Ms. Haspel's insights and experiences cannot be understated. Her career has encompassed both the Cold War and the ongoing Global War on Terror. In a moment when our national security demands excellence in each of these areas--great power competition and counterterrorism alike--Ms. Haspel stands uniquely ready to assume the responsibilities of CIA Director as perhaps its most qualified candidate in the Agency's history. As the Intelligence Committee continues its consideration, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this fine nominee. We will all sleep better at night knowing Gina Haspel is on the job.                          ____________________
