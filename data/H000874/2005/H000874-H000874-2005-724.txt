Speaker, the majority leader anticipated my next question.  And I appreciate your comments. This is, obviously, a very serious issue and we are prepared to deal with it seriously. We appreciate the fact that this provides for sufficient time in debate for the issues to be raised and addressed by the House of Representatives.  My second question, which you have anticipated, is that in fact Members can expect at 12 midnight, at the conclusion of the 3 hours of debate between 9 p.m. and 12 midnight, for the vote to occur on the pending legislation; is that accurate?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, the gentleman is absolutely correct. And hopefully, as the gentleman knows, every hour is incredibly important to Terry Schiavo. The Senate has passed the bill, so we will be taking up a Senate bill and, hopefully, we will expedite this process as fast as the House rules will allow us.
