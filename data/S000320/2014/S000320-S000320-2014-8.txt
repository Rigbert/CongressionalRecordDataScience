 President, along with my fellow Alabama colleague Jeff Sessions, I wish to pay tribute to Charles D. McCrary, who retired this month from his position as the president and chief executive officer of Alabama Power Company.  Mr. McCrary's involvement with Alabama Power extends back to the summer of 1970, when he joined the company following his freshman year at Auburn University. During a long and distinguished career, he assumed positions of increasing responsibility, rising from vice president for Southern Nuclear Operating Company, to president of Southern Company Generation, chief production officer of Southern Company and president of Southern Power Company. On October 25, 2001, Mr. McCrary became the tenth president and CEO of Alabama Power, which generates electricity for over 1.4 million Alabama customers.  A Birmingham native, Mr. McCrary attended Shades Valley High School and received his bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from Auburn University, followed by a juris doctor from Birmingham School of Law. He was admitted to the Alabama State Bar in 1979.  Mr. McCrary is married to the former Phyllis Brantley of Birmingham and is the father of two sons, Doug and Alex.  Throughout his tenure at Alabama Power, Mr. McCrary has served the company and its customers with the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. He also oversaw Alabama Power during some of our State's most severe natural disasters, including Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which caused 825,701 outages, the largest number of outages in company history; Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with 636,891 outages; and the tornado disaster on April 27, 2011 with 412,000 outages. In the wake of these disasters, Mr. McCrary initiated the policy of publicizing when customers could expect their power to be restored. This practice of announcing utility restoration commitments has since become an industry standard.  Mr. McCrary also pioneered ``Target Zero,'' a program for ensuring that employees are properly trained and equipped to do their jobs safely. This practice too has become a touchstone within the utility industry.  Mr. McCrary is a dynamic leader both in his community and throughout the State of Alabama, and serves as chairman of the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama and on the boards of Regions Financial Corporation, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International Inc., Protective Life Corporation, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Southern Research Institute, and the Auburn University Board of Trustees.  Committed to fostering economic development at both the regional and State levels, Mr. McCrary has advanced cooperative efforts between cities, counties, and business leaders in order to bring several industries, including automotive, aerospace, and steel manufacturers to Alabama.  Please join me and Senator Sessions in congratulating Charles on his retirement and in thanking him for his leadership at Alabama Power, for his dedication to improving his local community, and for his decades of service to the great State of Alabama. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
