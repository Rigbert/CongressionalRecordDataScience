President, if I might further ask a question, if the Senator from Arizona wants to make it clear that overstays on visas do not disqualify you from the pathway to legalization unless a final order has been entered saying you must be deported, I wish the Senator would clarify that language. As it stands, you have said if you are subject to--meaning you could be charged with--having overstayed your visa, you could be deported then you are disqualified. I think if you would clarify and tighten the language, it would overcome some of the serious concerns we have. The example the Senator used in other cases of terrorists and people we clearly don't want in the United States, I don't think you will have much, if any, argument. But when it comes to this particular circumstance, I think the language is subject to an interpretation you may not want.
