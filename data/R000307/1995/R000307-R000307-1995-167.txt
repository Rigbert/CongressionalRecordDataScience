Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Peterson], in coauthoring this amendment with myself, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Pete Geren], the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Cooley], and many other members of the unfunded mandates caucus. This has the support of the unfunded mandates caucus.  It is bipartisan in nature. The gentleman has simply explained the amendment very well. What it does is to equalize the threshold and brings it down to $50 million in regards to the private sector.  It is my considered opinion that all mandates should fall under the careful scrutiny of the Congressional Budget Office. A mandate is a mandate. In fact, I think there are some of us that would support lowering the threshold to zero. This is really an effort by the gentleman from Minnesota, myself, and others, to make the threshold apply to rural and small-town America.  Obviously, if you exclude the smaller mandates, that is going to impose a greater burden on small communities. So the gentleman's amendment is certainly appropriate to that effort.                              {time}  1600  There has been some concern about the fact whether or not the CBO can do this job. They can. We have been in contact with the CBO, and I think I should point out to Members that the CBO cost estimates have not always been in agreement with the cost estimates that are prepared by State and by local governments. So if you had a $100 million threshold, as opposed to $50, look what happened in regards to the Motor Voter Act. The cost of implementation as estimated by CBO was $28 million. It costs $26 million alone in regards to California.  It is a good amendment. I rise in support of it. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota.
