Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the many contributions that Emmanuel Baptist Church has made to my district during the past 100 years of existence. Founded as the Oakwood Baptist Church in 1898 and merged with Heston Street Baptist Church in 1911, the congregation moved to its current location, on Laskey Road, in 1961. The Church established a school in 1967 and grew, grade by grade, until a new high school building was built in 1978. This school can now be proud of an enrollment over 400.  The Church ministers to community members of all ages; from a weekly club, AWANA, for preschool through sixth grade, to a part-time visitation pastor, Rev. Charles Vermilyea, who calls on those hospitalized or with special needs. Other ministries include Ladies Alone for widows, Shepherds Ministry for those mentally handicapped, and Campus Bible Fellowship for students at the University of Toledo. Their charity does not stop there, as 20% of the weekly offerings go to missionary endeavors.  The activities of the Church also extend far beyond the boundaries of my district. In fact, this Anniversary celebration began with plans to build a new auditorium for a mission church in Crato, Brazil. Dozens of parishioners traveled to Brazil to assist in the building of the auditorium.  The Emmanuel Baptist Church has been a meaningful part of our community for over 100 years, and we hope for just as many years to come. Let us offer prayer and honor to the members of Emmanuel Baptist Church just as they have offered prayer and honor to the members of our community for a century.                          ____________________
