Chairman, Democrats worked with the health care and technology industries to write a bill that would lead to the widespread use of information technology in medicine, a necessity. The effective use of it can reduce medical errors, health care costs, and save lives.  Mr. Chairman, we should be taking up the Dingell-Rangel bill today, a bill that was virtually identical to the bill that passed unanimously in the United States Senate. Instead, we are voting on a Republican bill that fails to provide for the development or adoption of interoperability standards, that fails to provide funding to help providers transition to an electronic medical records system, and that fails to strengthen privacy protections.  What a shame. What a missed opportunity. We should oppose this bill, and we should bring the Rangel bill to the floor.
