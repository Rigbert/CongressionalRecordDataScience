 What this amendment addresses is a provision in the appropriations bill which says that no court can overcome what we have done by the appropriation language, which basically eliminates the right of the bureau to grant these new applications to give convicted felons firearms. With my motionto strike, we will in fact say to the courts, you can consider no applications from convicted felons. It is in fact lessening the responsibility of the courts that is presently in the bill. It does not broaden the scope or jurisdiction of the bill.  Now those on the other side, my friend, the gentleman from Mississippi, frankly believe that some convicted felons ought to have firearms. I do not think any should. My language will make it clear that a court cannot give a convicted felon a firearm. I think it is not only sensible, it is parliamentarily acceptable and I think the gentleman's point of order should be ruled down.
