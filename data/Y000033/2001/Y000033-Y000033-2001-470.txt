Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate and honor a young student from Alaska who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in his community. Justin Gonka of Anchorage has just been named one of Alaska's top honorees in The 2001 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  Mr. Gonka is being recognized for his dedication and continuous support of the Special Olympics. Justin has assumed numerous roles within the Special Olympics and hopes to one day become a coach. Besides being a great student, Justin has also helped to recruit other young people get involved and volunteer for the Special Olympics.  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution this young man has made. People of all ages need to think about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and next door neighbors. Young volunteers like Mr. Gonka are an inspiration to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.  The program that brought this young role model to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all young volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past six years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with nearly 100,000 youngsters participating since its inception.  Mr. Gonka should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I applaud Mr. Gonka for his initiative in seeking to make his community a better place to live, and for the positive impact he has had on the lives of others. He has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. His actions show that young Americans can, and do, play an important role in our communities.                          ____________________
