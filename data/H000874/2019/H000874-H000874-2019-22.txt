Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The irony is that the reason we got cooperation in the Nixon case and in the Clinton case is because those administrations cooperated. This administration has absolutely not cooperated.  The gentleman has those letters, and he put them down as if they mean something. They are further evidence of delay. The committee requested legitimately.  What the gentleman didn't say--he said we ought to go to court. Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the gentleman knows what happened when we went to court, because we have gone to court five or six times. We haven't lost a case yet. We have not lost a case yet where the court has said that Congress is entitled to that information.  So these letters are fine, but they are delay and dissemble as we throw them on the table, as if they mean something.  The gentleman says the Russians interfered in our election. They did. The irony is, one of the reasons that the Obama administration didn't get more involved in that is because there was knowledge by some that they were interfering on behalf--or suspicion of--Mr. Trump because of some of the evidence we have heard.  Mr. Stone's case, Mr. Gates testified about the knowledge that the President had about WikiLeaks and of the President's invitation for WikiLeaks to release information.  Sondland changed his testimony. We have gone to court. The administration has refused to cooperate.                              {time}  1515  The gentleman ignores those facts. They are facts, and they are facts that are generally accepted across the land, even by those who are supporters of the President.  So we are going to have this discussion. They are going to have this discussion in the Senate. But the President chose not to come to the House to defend against the allegations. His counsel said they weren't going to participate. They had the opportunity; they did not take it. We will see what happens from there.
