Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  The ranking member of our committee indicated, and I agree with him, that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon) raised some very legitimate and good points. The good news is that we have time to, I think, develop this issue further between now and the time of conference. I am pretty confident that the Senate will include similar language in their bill, so this will be a conferenceable item if it is not in the bill.  Clearly what the gentleman from Ohio seeks to do is to raise the issue of whether or not there ought to be a consistency in reporting costs so that OPM on behalf of Federal employees and Federal employees, generally, can make an assessment as to the costs that are being incurred by the insurers and, determining the cost, then what ought to be the appropriate level of premiums for the insurance that is gotten.  I think this is particularly cogent in a time when health care costs and premiums in particular for Federal employees and for all employees are starting to rise very, very substantially. So I understand what the gentleman from Ohio is saying. I think the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon), who chairs the relevant subcommittee, makes some very good points; but I think either way what the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook) is saying, we need to look at this very carefully, and I am convinced that the gentleman from Oklahoma and I and the subcommittee, whatever happens on this amendment, are going to look very carefully at this between now and the markup.
