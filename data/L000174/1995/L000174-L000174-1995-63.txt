 Mr. President, I find flag burning a reprehensible form of protest. We have, in this the greatest democracy on Earth, freedom of speech, and we have so many ways that we can have political debate and well-understood protests, that it seems like a slap at so many people in this country, certainly those of us who serve our country and are sworn to uphold its laws, and a particularly vile form of protest. It demeans an important symbol of our country and shows disrespect for the sacrifice so many have made to preserve our freedoms. I know that the veterans, the Gold Star Wives, whom the distinguished Senator from California just referred to, and others who are pressing for this amendment are doing so out of sincerity and out of a strong sense of patriotism.  I feel fortunate that we live in a country where the vast majority--I would say 99.9 percent--of our citizens share a deep respect for the flag and all that it symbolizes. It was one of the first things that my grandparents saw when they came to this country--not speaking a word of English but knowing it was a symbol of freedom.  Indeed, most of us do not need a law or the Constitution to require us to honor America. We do so willingly and spontaneously, as I do when I fly the flag at my home in Vermont.  We salute the flag and we stand for ``The Star Spangled Banner'' not because the law compels it, but out of respect. These are ways of expressing our thanks to those who have left us such a rich heritage. It is that respect that comes voluntarily, that comes from a sense of our history and our debt to prior generations that inspires us to salute, not the command of law or outside imposition of any legal requirement.   I believe that we are being asked to take steps down a road that leads to a weakening of the Bill of Rights and our fundamental guarantees of freedom. No right is more precious than that of freedom, and no freedom is more important than the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. Even though, for a good cause, this proposed constitutional amendment would restrict others' free speech rights, it would set a dangerous precedent.  I believe--and I have said it many times on the floor--that the first amendment is the most valuable bedrock in our Constitution and in our democracy. The first amendment guarantees us the right to practice any religion we want, or no religion if we want. It gives us the right of free speech. That right is unprecedented in any other significant country on this Earth. It guarantees diversity of religion, diversity of belief, diversity of speech, and if you have protected diversity, you have a democracy.  I cannot believe that there is a Member of this Senate--certainly not myself--who was not offended, in 1989 and 1990, by the publicity-hungry flag burners. I am offended to see the American flag burned or trampled overseas. I am offended when our President and Commander in Chief and his family are subjected to mean-spirited and defamatory characterizations, and when nationally syndicated radio personalities talk about how to shoot to kill Federal law enforcement officers.  I am offended when anyone makes such a suggestion.  I am offended by militant extremists who called our Senate colleague from Pennsylvania a representative of ``corruption and tyranny'' when he chaired a hearing exposing their ideas. I am offended by those who spew racial and ethnic hatred. I am offended that the Supreme Court of the United States required Columbus, OH, to allow the Ku Klux Klan to erect in a public square the KKK's ``symbol of white supremacy and a tool for the intimidation and harassment of racial minorities, Catholics, Jews, Communists and other groups hated by the Klan.'' There is certainly much that offends in our contemporary society.  But we must resist the temptation to make an exception here to limit one form of obnoxious speech. The guts of the first amendment is its extraordinary protection of antigovernment, political speech. Nowhere else in the world or through history has there been such a profound commitment to allow unrestricted criticism of those in power. The shouts of protest disturb, provoke, challenge, and offend. We must tolerate them because they also demonstrate the strength of America.  Polls and resolutions of State legislatures are being cited as reasons to support this proposed constitutional amendment. I have thought hard about the argument that this is a populist amendment and that the States should be given the opportunity to decide whether to amend our Constitution. In many settings, this would be a strong argument. But here, we are confronted with a proposed amendment to the Bill of Rights, and to that part of the first amendment intended to protect the minority from an orthodoxy of the majority.  We are this year commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. While that profound conflict raged, in June, 1943, the Supreme Court decided West Virginia State Board of Education versus Barnette, a case that raised the question whether children attending public schools could be compelled to salute the flag and pledge allegiance. The Court held, over the vigorous dissent of Justice Frankfurter, that the State could not employ such compulsion to achieve national unity, even in that time of world war.  The Supreme Court's opinion was written by Justice Robert Jackson, a former Attorney General of the United States who later served as the chief prosecutor at the Nurenberg trials. Let me quote from Justice Jackson's opinion:       The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw      certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political      controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and      officials and to establish them as legal principles to be      applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and      property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship      and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be      submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no      elections. . . .       The case is made difficult not because the principles of      its decision are obscure but because the flag involved is our      own.       Nevertheless, we apply the limitations of the Constitution      with no fear that freedom to be intellectually and      spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the      social organization. To believe that patriotism will not      flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and      spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an      unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to      free minds. We can have intellectual individualism and the      rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds      only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal      attitudes. Where they are so harmless to others or to the      State as those we deal with here, the price is not too great.      But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not      matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test      of its substance is the right to differ as to things that      touch the heart of the existing order.       If there is any fixed star in our constitutional      constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can      prescribe what shall be orthodox politics, nationalism,      religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to      confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any      circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now      occur to us.  If World War II itself was not a circumstance that permitted an exception to the first amendment to foster patriotism and national unity, I do not believe that the potential for disrespectful political protest of today's Government policy provides the justification required by article V of the Constitution for its amendment. There exists no compelling reason for limiting the Bill of Rights.  I am proud that earlier this year the Vermont Legislature chose the first amendment over the temptation to take popular action. The Vermont House passed a resolution urging respect for the flag and also recognizing the value of protecting free speech ``both benign and overtly offensive.'' Our Vermont attorney general has urged that we trust the Constitution and not the passions of the times.  Vermont's action this year is consistent with its strong tradition of independence and commitment to the Bill of Rights. Indeed, Vermont's own Constitution is based on our commitment to freedom and our belief that it is best protected by open debate. Vermont did not join the Union until the Bill of Rights was ratified and part of the country's fundamental charter.  Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to Congress and he cast the decisive vote of Vermont for the election of Thomas Jefferson. He was the same House Member who was the target of a shameful prosecution under the Sedition Act in 1789 for comments made in a private letter. Vermont served the Nation again in the dark days of McCarthyism when Senator Ralph Flanders stood up for democracy and in opposition to the repressive tactics of Joseph McCarthy. Vermont's is a great tradition that we cherish and that I intend to uphold.  I have deep respect for the position of William Detweiler, the national commander of the American Legion. When he testified this year before the Judiciary Committee he shared with us his concern that we, as a country, ``slide down that slippery slope * * * every time we deny our heritage.'' But the slippery slope that most concerns me is the proposed restriction of the Bill of Rights and the precedent such an amendment would establish.  Never in our history as a Nation have we narrowed the Bill of Rights through constitutional amendment. Our history has been one of expanding individual rights and protections.  Some of our colleagues contend that because the flag is such a unique national symbol, this will be the only time that we will be called upon to limit first amendment rights. Unfortunately, no one can give that assurance or make such a guarantee. Just this session, in the wake of the bombing in Oklahoma City, the Senate passed a terrorism bill that includes new limits on associational rights and, in the heat of the moment, 84 Members of this body voted to censor the Internet and criminalize private, constitutionally protected speech that might be considered indecent during consideration of the telecommunications bill. We cannot be so sure that without the bulwark of the first amendment our rights will be protected.  Barely 5 years ago a similar proposed constitutional amendment was considered and rejected by this Senate after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the conviction in the Eichman case resulted from an unconstitutional application of the Flag Protection Act of 1989. Little has changed. Indeed, in the intervening years, following the protests sparked by Desert Storm, there have been only a handful of flag burnings. None was reported in 1993 and three were reported in 1994, as the drive to amend the Constitution built momentum.  In 1990, 42 Senators stood up for the Bill of Rights and voted against the constitutional amendment we are voting on again today. I urge my colleagues to join with me to preserve the Constitution and protect the very principles of freedom that the flag symbolizes. Fundamental constitutional principles are too important for partisan politics or short-term expediency. Let us not allow this matter to devolve into the bumper sticker politics of emotion that has so dominated this Congress.  One of the best statements that I have ever seen in all the years that we have been debating this issue is that by James H. Warner, a former Marine flyer who had been a prisoner of the North Vietnamese for 5\1/2\ years. I ask that his full statement from July 1989 be printed in the Record and urge my colleagues to consider it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 1995]     When They Burned the Flag Back Home--Thoughts of a Former POW                          (By James H. Warner)       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of      war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force      base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I      looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as      tears filled my eyes. I saluted it. I never loved my country      more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver      Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared      with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to      serve the cause of freedom.       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when      I saw it for the first time after 5\1/2\ years, it hurts me      to see other Americans willfully descreate it. But I have      been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of      hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the      flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish      the flag burners. Let me explain myself.       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we      did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were      wrong if we would only apologize, we could be released early.      If we did not, we would be punished. A handful accepted, most      did not. In our minds, early release under those conditions      would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades of our country      and of our flag.       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say,      they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured and      some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the      summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutriton. I had      long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal      parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our      cause worth all of this? Yes, it was worth all this and more.       Rose Wilder Lane in her magnificent book ``The Discovery of      Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men      must know in order to be free. They must know that all men      are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free.      Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept      bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal      to teach slaves to read.       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp.      Maoists believe that ideas are merely the product of material      conditions; change those material conditions, and one will      change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``reeducate''      us. If we could show them that we would not abandon our      belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the      falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by      teaching them about freedom through our example. We could      show them the power of ideas.       I do not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of      war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a      photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a      flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country      protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''       ``No.'' I said, ``That proves that I am right. In my      country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that      people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an      instant his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto      the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting      I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his      eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten      the satisfaction. I felt at using his tool, the picture of      the burning flag, against him.       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party,      was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British      definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view, Bevan      responded forcefully that if Khrushchev really wanted to know      the difference, he should read the funeral oration of      Pericles.       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides'      ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted      democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the      Spartans, he said the Athenians did not fear freedom. Rather      they viewed freedom as the very source of their strength. As      it was for Athens, so it is for America--our freedom is not      to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish      those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate      America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to      hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread      freedom. The flag in Dallas was burned to protest the      nomination of Ronald Reagan, and he told us how to spread the      idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America into      ``a city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't      be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.
