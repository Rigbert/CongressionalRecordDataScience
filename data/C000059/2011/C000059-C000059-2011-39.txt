Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California, are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Superintendent of Schools Dr. Wendel Tucker is one of these individuals. On June 30, 2011, Dr. Tucker will retire after 45 years of dedicated service to the students of the Alvord Unified School District.  For the last 18 years, Dr. Tucker has worked for the Alvord Unified School District. He started his career there as an Intermediate School Principal and worked his way up to the Assistant Superintendent of Operational Support Services and finally as the Superintendent of Schools. Dr. Tucker has worked in both the Adventist School system and in public education. He also teaches at the college level and is involved in a variety of community activities. Dr. Tucker is an active member of various boards including the California Baptist University Board of Visitors, La Sierra University Foundation, the City of Riverside's Mayor's Higher Education Business Council, Trustee for the Riverside Public Library and Member of the Parkview Community Hospital Foundation Board and Executive Committee.  Dr. Tucker's professionalism and dedication to the education profession are highly respected not only throughout Alvord, but by the greater educational community in the Inland Empire. Dr. Tucker's name is also well known by institutions of higher education, and by the County Office of Education and the City and County of Riverside. Most importantly, Dr. Tucker has touched the lives of countless students and employees of the Alvord Unified School District during his years of dedicated service.  In light of all Dr. Wendel Tucker has done for the community of Riverside a dinner will be held in his honor on April 28, 2011. Dr. Tucker's tireless passion for education has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. He has been the heart and soul of the Alvord Unified School District and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
