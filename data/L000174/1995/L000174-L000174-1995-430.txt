President, Vice President Gore is going to travel to Moscow this week to meet with Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. The meeting takes place amid a renewed challenge to President Yeltsin and the Prime Minister by conservative elements of the Russian Duma. Certainly just this morning's newspapers gives us a pretty clear understanding of what is happening.  I want our Vice President and their Prime Minister to know that I support their efforts to strengthen cooperation between our two countries. I believe here in the United States, despite our concerns about issues like Chechnya, Russia's continuing efforts to establish democracy and an open market economy actually merit our support. I believe that the American people want to engage the Russians constructively. We want to assist them with reform. Most of all, we want to prevent a return to the authoritarianism of the old Soviet regime.  One topic of conversation between the Vice President and the Prime Minister will be the future of United States aid to Russia. Some Senators have argued that the aid should be terminated, or at least substantially curtailed, and I do not agree.  Indeed, I find that after a slow start 3 years ago, the United States aid program to Russia is now making a significant contribution to advancing political and economic reform. I would like to just lay out a few examples.  The largest element of U.S. aid is to provide technical assistance to help the Russians privatize their state-owned enterprises. Think what we have here. We have people who have lived their entire lives in a centrally planned economy. They do not have any idea how to run a private enterprise. They have never had to sell their products. They have never had to worry about productivity. In fact, when the Berlin Wall fell, there probably were not more than 100 people in the Soviet Union who actually knew how to analyze an honest corporate profit-and-loss statement. They also did not have stock markets, banks or the legal system necessary to support private enterprise. You could not enter a contract in Moscow and have it enforced in St. Petersburg. You could not enter a contract in Moscow and have it enforced in other parts of Moscow.  I think it is in our national interest to help them acquire this know-how. Thanks in large part to our assistance, 50 percent--50 percent--of the Russian gross domestic product now comes from the private sector, and with United States help the Russians are drafting a commercial code, setting up stock markets, and training their police to fight the organized crime that could so easily stifle entrepreneurship.  I support this aid effort. I support the aid effort because I think that the more successful private enterprise Russia has, the more people are going to be resisting any attempt to reestablish Communist dictatorship.  I want to assure other Senators we are simply not shoveling money out the door to them. In fact, many aid dollars are going to Americans. We are sending Americans over to show people how to run a private enterprise economy.  More and more, we are leveraging our taxpayer dollars with contributions from the private sector. There are private enterprises that are interested in participating in the assistance program as a part of an effort to sell products. There are also lots of volunteers. In fact, these enterprises and volunteers allow us to multiply what we do.  Another significant element is bringing Russians to the United States. Most of us remember the days of the Soviet Union. The Government prevented most Russians from seeing what life outside their country was like. Unless you held a special privileged position in academe or the government, you could not leave. Most people only had a vague notion of the advantage of living in an open society. I think that the more Russians actually visit the West, talk to Americans, see how we live, the more likely it is they will resist a return to totalitarianism.  Some have suggested that we suspend all aid to show our objections to the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran, or Russian actions in Chechnya. Of course, I am intensely concerned about what is happening in Chechnya. Russian military violence against civilians has far exceeded accepted standards of civilized behavior, regardless of what they claim was the provocation by Chechen separatists. Use of landmines aimed primarily at the civilian population is just one of the egregious things they have done.  By its actions in Chechnya over the last 6 months, the Russian Government shows it still has a lot to learn about democratic values and respect for human rights. I hope now with the current negotiations they are finally learning. In fact, that is why I joined with Senator McConnell this spring in insisting on shifting some of our proposed aid to Russia to provide humanitarian assistance to the Chechens as a token of our disapproval.  Let us think about what we are talking about as far as aid to Russia is concerned. We are talking about $200-$300 million overall in aid. Think about what we spent in waging the cold war over the years with the former Soviet Union. This does not even cover the interest on what we used to spend. It is also a drop in the bucket compared to the Russian Government budget. If we cut the aid off, nobody in the central government in Russia is going to notice, because the amounts would not be that large. The people who will notice are those reformers and those entrepreneurs and those in the private sector in Russia who are pointing to the West and the United States especially as somebody who is helping them move to democracy. They will notice, because they are the ones who will find their voices not heard as well if aid is cut off.  And so, Mr. President, I support the Vice President's mission to Moscow. I believe that promoting democratization of the second greatest military power in the world enhances U.S. security. I know that the Vice President will convey forcefully to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin America's concerns regarding Chechnya and the Iran reactor sale. I also know that he will work to strengthen dialog and cooperation between our two countries. And I do not know of any better way to promote world peace.                          ____________________
