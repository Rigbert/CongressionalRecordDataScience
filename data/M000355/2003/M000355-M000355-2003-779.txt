 President, last night at about this time we passed a Burma sanctions bill 97 to 1, which I hope sent a strong message to the thugs who are running the country at the moment that someday--and hopefully someday soon--they will have to honor the results of the 1990 election, won overwhelmingly by Aung San Suu Kyi and her party.       As I suspect the military junta may be trying to decipher      what took place in Washington yesterday, I thought I would      take a moment or two to help them out.  The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly condemned and sanctioned the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, for its May 30 attack against Suu Kyi and her supporters and for its continued repressive actions that violate the human rights and dignity of the people of Burma.  I also had an opportunity to talk today to Secretary Colin Powell, who is going out to Phnom Penh to the ASEAN Regional Forum next week, and I think they can anticipate a strong message from him when he is out in the region at that time.  Fifty-seven Senators cosponsored the legislation that passed last night to impose an import ban, expand visa restrictions, and freeze SPDC assets in the United States. Ninety-seven Senators voted to repudiate the actions of the Burmese junta.  This was a vote for freedom in Burma that demonstrated unequivocal support for Suu Kyi and all democrats in that country.  The generals in Rangoon should take note that a provision was included in the bill that guarantees that every year Burma will come up for discussion and debate in Congress. Every single year, we will have an opportunity to take a look at the fate of freedom in that country.  It is my hope we will not need that opportunity. It is my hope that Suu Kyi and other democrats will be governing Burma and that the only debate on the floor will be about the level of foreign assistance America should provide to a newly free Burma.  If this hope is not realized, within a year we will again discuss the persistent rapes of minority girls and women, the use of child and forced labor, and the manufacturing and trafficking of narcotics.  If the junta continues its repressive rule, we will again examine the number of political prisoners languishing in Burmese jails, efforts taken to counter an exploding HIV/AIDS infection rate, and opportunities to further democracy and the rule of law throughout the country.  If, however, American leadership translates into a full court press on junta, we might be able to celebrate a new dawn for democracy for the people of Burma.  The comments of Secretary of State Colin Powell in the Wall Street Journal today are both welcomed and promising.  As I indicated earlier, he is going to the ASEAN regional meeting next week, and I think the regime in Burma is going to hear a good deal more about the U.S. position on their behavior and activities.  He said this:       By attacking Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, the      Burmese junta has finally and definitively rejected the      efforts of the outside world to bring Burma back into the      international community. Indeed, their refusal of the work of      Ambassador Razali and of the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi and      her supporters could not be clearer. Our response must be      equally clear if the thugs who now rule Burma are to      understand that their failure to restore democracy will only      bring more and more pressure against them and their      supporters.  Secretary Powell must work tirelessly to secure the release of Suu Kyi and all other democrats who continue to be detained by the SPDC. U.N. Special Envoy Razali's brief meeting with her does not assuage my fears that she is under intense pressure or that her supporters continue to be tortured or killed. She and her supporters should be released immediately and unconditionally.  In the future, it might behoove Razali to temper his enthusiastic comments to more accurately reflect the climate of fear in Burma. He failed to secure Suu Kyi's release, and I am surprised that he did not say more to condemn the outrageous actions of the thugs in Rangoon.  Let me close by thanking my colleagues--and their staffs--for their support of this legislation. I could ask for no better allies than Senators Feinstein and McCain on this issue, and I look forward to continue to work with them to free Suu Kyi and bring democracy to Burma. Senators Frist, Lugar, Biden, Baucus, Grassley, Hagel, and Brownback also deserve recognition for their support of freedom in Burma. The people of Burma will count on our support in the future--and we should not, and must not, fail them.  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of Secretary Powell's op-ed and an editorial from today's Baltimore Sun on Burma be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 12, 2003]                          Standing for Freedom                          get tough on rangoon                          (By Colin L. Powell)       United Nations Special Envoy Razali Ismail has just visited      Burma and was able to bring us news that Aung San Suu Kyi, a      Nobel Peace Prize winner and the leader of a peaceful      democratic party known as the National League for Democracy,      is well and unharmed. The thoughts and prayers of free people      everywhere have been with her these past two weeks. Our fears      for her current state of health are now somewhat lessened.       On May 30, her motorcade was attacked by thugs, and then      the thugs who run the Burmese government placed her under      ``protective custody.'' We can take comfort in the fact that      she is well. Unfortunately, the larger process that      Ambassador Razali and Aung San Suu Kyi have been pursuing--to      restore democracy in Burma--is failing despite their good      will and sincere efforts. It is time to reassess our policy      towards a military dictatorship that has repeatedly attacked      democracy and jailed its heroes.       There is little doubt on the facts. Aung San Suu Kyi's      party won an election in 1990 and since then has been denied      its place in Burmese politics. Her party has continued to      pursue a peaceful path, despite personal hardships and      lengthy periods of house arrest or imprisonment for her and      her followers. Hundreds of her supporters remain in prison,      despite some initial releases and promises by the junta to      release more. The party's offices have been closed and their      supporters persecuted. Ambassador Razali has pursued every      possible opening and worked earnestly to help Burma make a      peaceful transition to democracy. Despite initial statements      last year, the junta--which shamelessly calls itself the      State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)--has now refused      his efforts and betrayed its own promises.       At the end of last month, this rejection manifested itself      in violence. After the May     30 attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy, we sent U.S. Embassy      officers to the scene to gather information. They reported      back that the attack was planned in advance. A series of      trucks followed her convoy to a remote location, blocked it      and then unloaded thugs to swarm with fury over the cars of      democracy supporters. The attackers were brutal and      organized; the victims were peaceful and defenseless. The      explanation by the Burmese military junta of what happened      doesn't hold water. The SPDC has not made a credible report      of how many people were killed and injured. It was clear to      our embassy officers that the members of the junta were      responsible for directing and producing this staged riot.       We have called for a full accounting of what happened that      day. We have called for Aung San Suu Kyi to be released from      confinement of any kind. We have called for the release of      the other leaders of the National League for Democracy who      were jailed by the SPDC before and after the attack. We have      called for the offices of the National League for      Democracy to be allowed to reopen. We are in touch with      other governments who are concerned about the fate of      democracy's leader and the fate of democracy in Burma to      encourage them, too, to pressure the SPDC.       The Bush administration agrees with members of Congress,      including Sen. Mitch McConnell, who has been a leading      advocate of democracy in Burma, that the time has come to      turn up the pressure on the SPDC.       Here's what we've done so far. The State Department has      already extended our visa restrictions to include all      officials of an organization related to the junta--the Union      Solidarity and Development Association--and the managers of      state-run enterprises so that they and their families can be      banned as well.       The United States already uses our voice and our vote      against loans to Burma from the World Bank and other      international financial institutions. The State Department      reports honestly and frankly on the crimes of the SPDC in our      reports on Human Rights, Trafficking in Persons, Drugs, and      International Religious Freedom. In all these areas, the      junta gets a failing grade. We also speak out frequently and      strongly in favor of the National League of Democracy, and      against the SPDC. I will press the case in Cambodia next week      when I meet with the leaders of Southeast Asia, despite their      traditional reticence to confront a member and neighbor of      their association, known as Asean.       Mr. McConnell has introduced the Burmese Freedom and      Democracy Act in the Senate; Reps. Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos      have introduced a similar bill in the House. We support the      goals and intent of the bills and are working with the      sponsors on an appropriate set of new steps. Those who follow      this issue will know that our support for legislation is in      fact a change in the position of this administration and      previous ones as well. Simply put, the attack on Ms. Suu      Kyi's convoy and the utter failure of the junta to accept      efforts at peaceful change cannot be the last word on the      matter. The junta that oppresses democracy inside Burma must      find that its actions will not be allowed to stand.       There are a number of measures that should now be taken,      many of them in the proposed legislations. It's time to      freeze the financial assets of the SPDC. It's time to ban      remittances to Burma so that the SPDC cannot benefit from the      foreign exchange. With legislation, we can, and should, place      restrictions on travel-related transactions that benefit the      SPDC and its supporters. We also should further limit      commerce with Burma which enriches the junta's generals. Of      course, we would need to ensure consistency with our World      Trade Organization and other international obligations. Any      legislation will need to be carefully crafted to take into      account our WTO obligations and the president's need for      waiver authority, but we should act now.       By attacking Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters, the      Burmese junta has finally and definitely rejected the efforts      of the outside world to bring Burma back into the      international community. Indeed, their refusal of the work of      Ambassador Razali and of the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi and      her supporters could not be clearer. Our response must be      equally clear if the thugs who now rule Burma are to      understand that their failure to restore democracy will only      bring more and more pressure against them and their      supporters.                                  ____                [From the Baltimore Sun, June 12, 2003]                        Time for Tyrants to Fear       A year ago, when the military junta illegally controlling      Manmar last released its democratically elected leader, Aung      San Suu Kyi, from house arrest, the generals promised a      dialogue aimed at national reconciliation.       True dialogue in the nation once known as Burma would lead      to a decided weakening, if not the total loss, of the      generals' power, so that hasn't happened.       And as of yesterday, Ms. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize      laureate, remained back in detention after a violent      government attack late last month on her and her supporters--     and even after a Untied Nations envoy spent days trying to      gain her release.       Given that Myanmar's military also has a long record of      slave labor and drug trafficking, what more do responsible      nations need to now get tougher with this regime?       With that in mind, these days are critical--starting with      passage late yesterday of a U.S. senate bill to ban imports      from Myanmar, seize the regime leaders' U.S. assets and bar      U.S. visas for them.       This ban should give greater weight to heightened U.S.      diplomatic effort to isolate these despots.       Virtually all Senate leaders from both parties, led by      Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell and California Democrat      Dianne Feinstein, supported the ban. Maryland Sens. Barbara      A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes were among its many co-     signers, Mr. Sarbanes having signed on just yesterday after      activists complained he hadn't.       A House subcommittee has approved a similar bill.      Everything possible should be done to see that this ban--     affecting a quarter of Myanmar's exports, worth about $350      million a year--becomes law soon.       But even just Senate passage of the ban gives Secretary of      State Colin L. Powell a bigger stick when he attends a      meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)      in Cambodia next week--a gathering at which the United States      needs to lean even harder on Thailand and Japan to back off      aiding this terrible regime.       Time is well past for allowing Myanmar's generals to      enslave their own people. As Senator McConnell said yesterday      in calling for the import ban vote: ``It's time for tyrants      to fear in Burma.''       The import ban likely won't bring down these generals in      itself. But it provides a key tool in building an effective      worldwide movement--with roles for ASEAN, the European Union      and the United Nations--to end their illegal reign.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also the Travel Goods Association of America today came out for the legislation and for an import ban as well. This is an important organization related to this whole issue of import restrictions--an organization that potentially would benefit from continuing imports from Burma. But they said they don't want to make money off of this regime. They, too, have announced their support for a ban today.  I ask unanimous consent that a press release indicating their support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:TGA Announces Support for A Total Ban On U.S. Travel Goods Imports From          Burma--Applauds Passage of Legislation by U.S. Senate       Princeton, NJ, June 12, 2003.--Travel Goods Association      (TGA) President Anne L. DeCicco announced today that, due to      the on-going cruel and repressive nature of the ruling regime      in Burma, TGA--the national trade association of the travel      goods industry (luggage, handbags, briefcases, backpacks,      flatgoods, etc.)--has called for an immediate and total ban      on U.S. travel goods imports from that nation (SEE POLICY      STATEMENT BELOW). Furthermore, TGA appauds Rep. Tom Lantos      (D-CA) and Rep. Peter King (R-NY), and Diane Feinstein (D-CA)      and their colleagues in both the House and Senate, for      introducing The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003      into both houses of the United States Congress. The bills      call for a ban on all imports from Burma until it can be      determined that the ruling Burmese government has made      substantial and measurable progress to end its human rights      abuses. The legislation passed the Senate on June 11, 2003 in      a 97-1 vote.       ``The government of Burma continues to abuse its citizens      through force and intimidation, and refuses to respect the      basic human rights of its people. TGA believes this      unacceptable behavior should be met with condemnation from      not only the international public community, but from private      industry as well,'' said DeCicco.       According to the U.S. government's ``2002 Country Report on      Human Rights Practices'' on Burma, the Burmese government has      ``. . . continued to restrict workers rights, ban unions, and      use forced labor for public works and for the support of      military garrisons. Other forced labor, including child      labor, remain a serious problem despite recent ordinances      outlawing the practice.''       Additionally, in 2000, the International Labor Organization      (ILO)--for the first time in its history--called on all ILO      members to impose sanctions on Burma.       ``TGA is pleased to learn that Congress, led by the U.S.      Senate's historic vote on Wednesday, is taking an important      step towards ending the human rights crisis that is happening      in Burma today. We hope that Congress' efforts are only the      first step towards international condemnation and sanctions      on Burma through the United Nations,'' commented TGA Chairman      Tom Sandler of Samsonite Corporation. He continued, ``TGA,      through its trade policy, promotes best practices to ensure      that travel goods are produced in a socially responsible      manner by encouraging its members to operate under programs      that are compliant with applicable labor laws. Thus, the      association and its membership fully support the legislation      introduced by Reps. Lantos and King, as well as Senators      McConnell and Feinstein and calls upon the U.S. House of      Representatives to follow the Senate's lead in the swift and      immediate passage of such important legislation.''       The necessity for Congressional action is highlighted by      the recent attacks of the country's ruling military junta on      Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's pro-     democracy opposition, and her supporters. These attacks      illustrate that Burma's regime has grown more oppressive than      ever, despite worldwide condemnation.       TGA International Committee Chairman Michael Korchmar of      the Leather Specialty Company, noted that, ``TGA also wants      to recognize and applaud the efforts of its own members that      have already imposed bans on U.S. imports of Burmese travel      goods from their own firms. Thanks in large part to the      efforts of TGA members, U.S. imports of travel goods from      Burma fell an incredible 74 percent between 2001 and 2002.''      Furthermore, TGA applauds the efforts of numerous U.S. and      international governmental and non-governmental organizations      to force Burma to respect the basic human rights of its      citizens.                                  ____                                     Travel Goods Association,                                     Princeton, NJ, June 12, 2003.                Policy Statement on Burma, June 12, 2003       The Travel Goods Association (TGA)--the national trade      association of the travel goods (luggage, briefcases,      handbags, backpacks, flatgoods) industry--hereby expresses      its strong support for a full and immediate ban on U.S.      travel goods imports from Burma and strongly encourages the      U.S. government to:       Impose an immediate and total ban on U.S. imports of travel      goods from Burma;       Maintain this ban until Burma's rulers demonstrate that      they respect and enforce basic human and labor rights for its      own citizens;       Continue both unilaterally and through multilateral      organizations to exert diplomatic, economic, and political      pressure on Burma to respect and enforce basic human rights      for its own citizens; and       Sign into law current legislation in Congress to impose      such sanctions.       The TGA supports a U.S. ban on Burmese travel goods because      Burma's military regime has:       Consistently rejected international demands to stop      government-sanctioned forced and child labor practices      against its own people;       According to the U.S. government's ``2002 Country Report on      Human Rights Practices'' on Burma, ``. . . continued to      restrict worker rights, ban unions, and used forced labor for      public works and for the support of military garrisons. Other      forced labor, including forced child labor remained a serious      problem, despite recent ordinances outlawing the practice;''      and       Repeatedly failed to comply with internationally recognized      conventions on labor, including forced and child labor. Due      to its ``widespread and systematic'' use of forced labor, the      International Labor Organization (ILO) in 2000, for the first      time in its history, called on all ILO members to impose      sanctions on Burma.       Through its trade policy, TGA:       ``Promotes best practices to ensure that goods are produced      in a socially responsible manner,'' by ``Encouraging TGA      members to operate under programs that foster socially      responsible production practices compliant with applicable      labor and environmental laws and regulations; Encouraging the      United States, other governments and foreign trade      associations to recognize and support programs designed to      achieve these goals; and Pursuing policies that encourage      development of human rights and democratic values in      countries in which TGA members conduct business and      discourage trade with countries that promote or support      terrorism.''       Strongly supports the travel goods industry's use of      effective social responsibility programs;       Applauds and supports the efforts of TGA member companies      that have already imposed bans on U.S. imports of Burmese      travel goods for their own firms;       Recognizes and applauds the efforts of numerous U.S. and      international governmental and nongovernmental organizations      to force Burma to respect the basic human rights of its      citizens.                          ____________________
