 Mo served NTEU with great ability for 31 years after working in this House for former Representatives Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut and Chris Dodd, also of Connecticut.  NTEU represents approximately 150,000 Federal employees working in 31 Federal agencies. Mo has been tireless in the effort to ensure that Federal civilian employees receive the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve. Mo spent a considerable part of her years at NTEU educating Congress and administrations about the important work Federal servants carry out.  At a time when some in Congress and in the current administration are denigrating Federal civil servants, threatening to reduce their pay and benefits and deeply cut the budgets of agencies for which they work, I am more than a little sad to see Mo retire. But as she does, Madam Speaker, I am certain that Mo will keep inspiring us all to continue the fight with the same resolve that she showed every day of her career.  I hope my colleagues will join me, Madam Speaker, in wishing Mo Gilman well and thanking her for her extraordinary work on behalf of our country.                          ____________________
