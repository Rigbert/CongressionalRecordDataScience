'  No matter how powerful any group is or any set of individuals, our duty is a different one, and that is, to work together across this aisle for the best legislation, the best law making that is humanly possible to serve the people that sent us here, through regular order. And that means hearing from the membership, especially on a matter of such extraordinary magnitude as we were just asked to vote upon.  This is the Congress of the United States, and we are a deliberative body. We are not a military order. There are no generals, and they are not able to command down the ranks. We operate through consensus. And when that process breaks down, we don't produce good legislation and, in turn, do not serve the American people.  On the matter that was before us, I think it's fair to say that most committees that should have met did not. They were discharged of their duties in a strange process that I hope I never see again.  The bill came to the floor with a closed rule. A few Members said to us after the vote, ``Well, where is your alternative? If you don't like this, where is your alternative?'' And our answer was, we had alternatives, but we were summarily denied the ability to present them through regular order. There was no reason to go to the Rules Committee, as it was a closed rule. We were not allowed to invite witnesses--and many of us asked, it's not like we didn't try. But let the record be very clear, Members were not able to testify, and therefore, we were not able to glean the best intelligence from our country as this bill moved forward.  ``There is no temple but the Capitol, and no oracle but the Constitution.'' I really believe this Congress met its duty, its sworn obligation today in this truly historic vote. We have a lot of work to do. And I think one thing happened today that is actually very good for the Republic, and that is, whatever artificial line may exist down that middle aisle, I think it crumbled, andthere is a new working energy inside this institution to do what should have been done in the first place.  Now, we have respect for our leadership, and we have respect for the President of the United States. And whatever was presented a few weeks ago that had to be acted upon with such urgency, we are willing to remain and to reconstitute ourselves and to exercise the duties of the office to which we have been elected as our constitution demands.  People don't have to be fearful, Wall Street doesn't have to be worried, we can take care of this. If we look to some of the institutions that have run up into a little trouble these last few weeks, we've seen what the FDIC has done. The insurance programs are working. Savings deposits are safe in our institutions. One can argue whether we should increase the FDIC-insured rate over $100,000 per depositor, but if we do this right, we can really give strength back to our credit markets because this is not a liquidity crisis, this is a credit crisis related to accounting standards.  We can hear from the best accountants in America. That should have been done. They could have helped us work through this; they were not given voice. We can take a look at the housing crisis, its foreclosure crisis--which is at the heart of the credit seize-up--because we have markets that aren't working there, we have a lot of empty properties, people being foreclosed. There was nothing in this legislation that would do workouts at the local level. Why didn't the Federal Reserve, you know, and the administration, they wanted all this money, but they didn't want money to help Main Street bankers and mortgage holders and families try to work out loans at the local level where we can save people in their homes. My goodness.  These are issues America has dealt with before. There should be calm across the country. The Congress has made a decision, and I believe that we will present a better bill in a very short period of time.  I thank you, Madam Speaker. And what a joy it was to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to do what was right, not what was fast.                          ____________________
