Speaker, at a time when crime concerns are on every citizen's mind, those who have dedicated their lives to law enforcement are to be commended. I would like to make a special commendation to Officer Timothy J. Mitchell, a very devoted law enforcement officer from Indiana's First Congressional District. Officer Mitchell retired from the Schererville Police Department in April of this year. He will be honored by family, friends, and members of the Schererville Police Force at a testimonial dinner tomorrow night at Teibel's Restaurant in Schererville, IN.  Tim joined the Schererville Police Department on March 31, 1977, after receiving an honorable discharge with the rank of sergeant from the U.S. Air Force in 1976. He worked in both the patrol and detective division of the police force, and was promoted to the rank of corporal on February 15, 1984. During his career with the Schererville Police Department, Tim participated in the Officer Friendly Program. This program began within the northwest Indiana region in the early 1970's, and was designed to educate children on issues of safety and encourage communication between police officers and children. As Officer Friendly, Tim visited schools throughout the region, teaching lessons of safety to children during dangerous times of the year, such as Halloween and summer, and promoting such programs as Bicycle Safety.  Tim was also a participant in the Schererville Police Department's Drug Awareness Resistance Education program [DARE]for 2 years. The first Schererville police officer assigned to the DARE Program, Tim was instrumental in charting the program's course since its implementation in the department in 1989. As a DARE officer, he presented a program designed to encourage youth to ``say no to drugs'' by means of explaining the harmful effects of drugs. In addition, Tim took the initiative in further promoting the ``say no to drugs'' campaign by serving as a drug and alcohol instructor at Grimmer Middle School in Schererville, IN, as well as speaking on the subject for various organizations. Tim has chosen to utilize his experience and talents in teaching children by earning his bachelors degree in elementary teaching at Purdue University-Calumet. He hopes to spend his retirement teaching at Grimmer Middle School.  In recognition of his efforts, Tim was selected Schererville's Man of the year by a local newspaper in 1991. Recipients of this honor are selected for their tireless dedication and service to their communities by means of public service, leadership, or simply caring for their town. Tim was especially honored for his dedication to the promotion of drug education among northwest Indiana's young people.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Officer Timothy Mitchell on his 20 years of service to the Schererville Police Department. His wife, Rhonda, and their children, Crystal and Terry, can be proud of his devoted service to the citizens of Schererville.                          ____________________
