  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, this Homeland Security appropriation falls short in many areas: port security, first responders, interoperable communications, and aviation.  In aviation, recent tests by the Inspector General and the GAO show that there are unacceptable, continuing vulnerabilities to our system of aviation, and their conclusion is simple: the performance of finding explosives and other threat objects will not improve until we give the screeners 21st-century technology to fight 21st-century threats. The junk they are working with was thrown out a decade ago because it was inadequate for the United States Capitol before 9/11, but we are still using it in our airports and demanding they find threat objects that the machines simply cannot find. The Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the Committee on Appropriations is failing the test too. They are failing to protect the American traveling public.                          ____________________[Page H3339]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]       DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATION FALLS SHORT  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
