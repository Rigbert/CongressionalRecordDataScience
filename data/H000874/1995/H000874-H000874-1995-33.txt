Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I am pleased that the process that was started in the 103d Congress is finally nearing implementation. Very frankly, we had a political discussion, in the 102d and 103d, about merit hiring and about doing away with patronage; doing away with the politicization of the ministerial duties of the House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, I was for that. I thought we were moving in the right direction. In fact, we adopted in the last Congress a rule which would have said that employees could not be removed for purely political reasons. That, in fact, they would be treated as merit employees if they were performing administerial functions.  One of the first acts of this Republican leadership was, frankly, to delete that rule from the rules of the House of Representatives, while at the same time projecting legislation, which had been killed by Republicans in the Senate, as their legislation, which had been previously passed in the 103d Congress, and providing for the covering of the House of Representatives under the laws that we had passed vis-a-vis employees' rights and working conditions to the private sector, that they be applied to the Congress.  That legislation was supported by over 400 Members of this body, and as some of my colleagues may recall, I was the floor leader on this side of the aisle for that legislation.  Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding my support of that policy and this resolution, my colleagues should not be fooled that the passage of this resolution will ensure that the employees of this House will be treated fairly, equitability, and nonpolitically. I want to call to the attention of every Member of this House the recent actions that have been taking place by the Clerk.  I want to say something at the outset. I have a great deal of respect and affection for the Clerk of this House. I think she has operated in what I perceive to be an open and fair fashion over the last few months of her tenure. I appreciated that. It was, frankly, in juxtaposition to some other leaders dealing with personnel in this House, and so it was doubly appreciated.  As many of my colleagues may have read in recent press reports, however, 10 employees have recently been dismissed by the Clerk, contrary to the management plan submitted to and approved by the Committee on House Oversight; contrary to the rules of the 103d Congress, which stated that employees cannot be dismissed without cause and cannot be dismissed for reasons other than their nonperformance or malfeasance in office.  Mr. Speaker, the rules of the 104th Congress, did not include the referenced language of the 103d Congress.  Some may think that these dismissals were part of the transition, which would have been understandable, I suppose, except for the fact that the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Roberts], a member of the Committee on House Oversight, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and then the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, properly expressed outrage on this floor when members of the travel office in the White House were removed, notwithstanding they served at the will of the President.  Mr. Speaker, there was an expression of outrage and, in fact, the Treasury-Postal bill was held up by the gentleman from Virginia because of that concern. I think that concern was appropriate, and I said so on the floor of this House then when it was the Clinton White House acting.  Some may think, as I said, that these were part of the transition. In fact, each of these employees were kept on through the transition, and each was in receipt of a letter from the Clerk in May offering them continued employment.  Each employee was informed that they were specifically being dismissed in December, just a few days ago, without cause.                              {time}  1200  I was surprised to learn these employees had all been offered continued employment prior to their dismissals. I was shocked to learn that one of the employees had, as recently as July, been given a promotion. I was shocked that one employee had been asked to make suggestions for his replacement. I do not know what that does to the morale of the employees who remain. I was appalled, Mr. Speaker, that a Vietnam veteran with 23 years' experience, who had started his employment with the House by filling out a Standard 171 Form, not a political employee, a ministerial employee, not fired for cause, a Vietnam veteran, 23 years of seniority, and just a few short weeks before that, maybe a few months, a noncitizen had been hired in this office at a comparable salary with comparable responsibilities.  Shame, shame, shame that we would treat employees so cavalierly and then stand on this floor and say how we want to protect the rights of veterans in America whom we sent overseas to defend this country and then a few days before Christmas say, ``Guess what, we have a noncitizen whom we have hired who probably can do your job.'' That was not said specifically. I want to make that clear. But the inference is very clear. The inference is very clear. ``We have got somebody else to do the job.'' Twenty-three years of experience.  I was further troubled, Mr. Speaker, to learn that in spite of repeated representations by many in the majority that a ``nonpartisan, professional work force'' was being employed, several recent hires in the Clerk's office come from the Republican National Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. Clearly, the same happened from the Democratic National Committee under Democratic leadership of this House. But it is wrong to tell the employees or to imply to the public that this is going to be merit hiring, nonpolitical, and then pursue that practice.  Earlier this year, we learned a number of senior managers in the office of the chief administrative officer are also either former staff of the Republican National Committee, the Republican National Campaign Committee, or former political appointees of the Reagan or Bush administrations. That is not wrong. I do not allege it to be wrong. What I do allege is, if you say you are going to hire on merit and retain on merit and performance, then do not replace folks with political appointees and expect your personnel to believe, in fact, they work in a merit-based system.  It is becoming increasingly apparent hiring is being done on the basis of political affiliation. What is so troubling, Mr. Speaker, about these recent firings is that each of these employees had been given the impression, as I have said, that they had been performing their jobs in a professional, competent manner. In fact, they were told they were not, I underline not, removed for cause. Each of these employees had made it through the transition period.  Let me reiterate that. They had made it through the transition period. I was told by the Clerk herself that the transition was over in the summer. I talked to her just a few days ago, and she reiterated that.  Let me make it clear, I do not question the ability of this Clerk or her attitude or fairness. But this instance is one that I think does not comport with my experience for that practice. Suddenly, after further recent partisan hirings, these employees have been dismissed. Despite repeated inquiries on my behalf, no reasonable business purpose for these terminations has yet been stated to me, and I suggest has not been submitted to the committee.  The Clerk's office has an employee manual. I have got that employee manual right here, issued by this Clerk, not a prior Clerk, in this Congress. It lays out clear steps for dismissal. Each employee was given this manual when they received their offers of continued employment, presumably so they knew the rules of the road as employees. Yet this manual and its process was ignored.  Now, very frankly, the Clerk says, ``Oh, no, the employees serve at the will of the Clerk.'' Let me read the language: ``Two steps, notice of action. Suspensions, terminations, and,'' conjunctive, in addition to, and counsel, I am sure, understands that interpretation, ``and all performance-based actions requiring the following two-step approach''; in other words, in other words, not only do performance-based terminations require these two steps, it is an ``and'', but suspensions and terminations also, according to this manual, require those steps. They were not taken, period.  This was clearly a termination. They are terminated. Many Members of the House took to this well when President Clinton dismissed members of the travel office. As I said previously, they were outraged that employees were fired for seemingly partisan purposes. I was outraged because a number of them were my constituents. I think what was done was wrong, and as chairman of the Treasury, Postal Committee, I assured that everyone but one received offers of employment in the executive department, and those who wanted it got it at comparable levels.  So let there be no mistake, when the White House did it, I thought it was wrong. When the Clerk does it, I think it is wrong.  My colleagues, I would ask that that outrage that was expressed on the Republican side of the aisle at those firings to be at least evidenced today and now.  There have been no allegations of mismanagement or poor performance by these employees. I understand that the Compliance Act relates to discrimination. That act goes into effect, of course, on January 22 of this coming year or January 23. However, each of these employees is being terminated in such a way that even if they wanted to explore their rights under that act, I believe they are precluded.  It can be argued that some of them, perhaps all, will be on the payroll technically and, therefore, may be included. We will see.  I have repeatedly raised my concerns that a goal which I strongly supported, ending patronage in the House of Representatives for ministerial employees and assuring a professional work force for the administrative functions of the House, is being seriously undermined beneath the rhetoric of professionalism.  A number of these employees have expressed concerns over their treatment in the media. It has been brought to my attention that the word has been spread that these employees better watch out. Let no one in this House be mistaken, I and my colleagues, I hope on both sides of the aisle, will not stand for any reprisals being taken against any employee for exercising their rights of free speech.  The new Republican majority may feel at will to enforce a gag rule on this House from time to time. But we ought not to, and it would be wrong to, enforce a gag rule on our employees or former employees by threats of recrimination.  Mr. Speaker, I believe these dismissals were wrong. They superficially, at least, appear to be based on partisanship. But whether they are or not, they were wrong, and they have left the staff of the House of Representatives, in my opinion, demoralized and feeling insecure.  If dismissals are not based on job performance, for those who are not involved in policy making, and clearly those employees in policy making are subject to the will of the policy maker; that is the way it must be and should be. But for those people that we ask day to day to come to this House, to come to this Capitol and perform duties for us in a professional manner, unrelated to formulation or promulgation of policy, they ought to know that if they perform, for Republicans or Democrats, in a fashion that brings credit on this institution and facilitates the work of this House, that they will be continued in their employment.  Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in support of this resolution. I supported it as a Member of the Committee on House Oversight. The gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], the chairman of the Committee on House Oversight, has rightfully said that this moves the process forward. I agree with him. I am pleased that we are moving. I will vote for this legislation.  But I would hope that all of the leadership of this House would review this matter, not just for concern with these ten but concern for every person who works for this institution, people of whom we are proud, people of whom we are very appreciative for the work they do for us and for the American people, and people whom we ought to treat with respect and the dignity they deserve.
