Unfortunately, we still haven't seen this commonsense plan, so I would like to offer my own.  This is a drill bit. The drill bit goes into the ground. Oil comes out of the ground. Oil goes to a refinery. Gasoline comes out of the refinery. More gas, price comes down.  Let me repeat that for those on the other side who seem not able to understand that.  This is a drill bit. The drill goes down into the ground. Oil comes out of the ground. Oil goes to the refinery. Gasoline comes out of the refinery.
