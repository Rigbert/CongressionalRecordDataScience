On December 17, 2009, U.S. Navy Commander Peter J. Carty passed away after a two-month battle with cancer. He will be deeply missed.  Commander Carty was born in September 29, 1965 in Portland, Oregon, to parents William and Janet Carty. He grew up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania with his siblings David, Jeanmarie, Robert, Timothy and Elizabeth. He graduated from high school in 1983 and attended the Virginia Military Institute. He graduated in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. Following graduation, Peter was commissioned into the United States Navy as an officer and was assigned to the USS Jarrett (FFG-33) stationed at Naval Station Long Beach. Peter continued his career in the Reserves, eventually earning the rank of Commander.  In 1994, Peter received a Master of Business Administration from the University of Southern California and went on to work as the Western Regional Manager for Parker Hannifin Corporation. Peter is survived by his wife, Carmina; his son, Andrew; stepdaughter, Lauren; parents, and siblings. Peter joins his older brother David who passed away in 2008 after a battle with cancer.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men like Commander Carty who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. Commander Carty was a true patriot who will be sorely missed by his family and friends, but his legacy and service to our great nation will always be remembered.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks on June 14th, Flag Day, as a tribute to the life and legacy of Commander Peter Carty.                          ____________________
