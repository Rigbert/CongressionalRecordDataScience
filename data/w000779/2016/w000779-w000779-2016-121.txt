President, I thank Chairman Hatch for his good work and his very gracious comments.  I note our colleagues have been very patient, so I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator Alexander be recognized for 7 minutes and, immediately after Senator Alexander, Senator Stabenow be recognized for up to 10 minutes.
