President, I have submitted this resolution with my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse and Senator Clinton, to honor the life and accomplishments of George Sears Greene, the distinguished general from Rhode Island who helped lead the Union to victory at the Battle of Gettysburg.  General Greene was born and raised in Apponaug, RI before moving to pursue work in New York. At the age of 18, he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point and excelled in his studies there, graduating second in his class.  After resigning his commission in the Army in 1836, Greene went on to become a founder of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects. As an engineer, Greene designed projects throughout the United States including a reservoir in Manhattan's Central Park and municipal water and sewage systems for several cities, including Providence.  But General Greene is perhaps best known for his heroism at Gettysburg. Greene returned voluntarily to the defense of the Nation at the age of 60, when the governor of New York appointed him colonel of the New York 60th Infantry regiment. At Gettysburg, General Greene led the 3rd Brigade of New York at Culp's Hill. His regiment's defense of the Union army's right flank helped secure victory for the Nation at that decisive battle.  General Greene's memory will be honored this Saturday at the 100th anniversary rededication ceremony of his monument on Culp's Hill. I ask that you join Senators Whitehouse, Clinton and me in recognizing his exemplary public service.
