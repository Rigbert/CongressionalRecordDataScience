The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so ordered.  The amendments (Nos. 1184 and 1185) were agreed to, as follows:                           AMENDMENT NO. 1184(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding assistance under                         the Camp David Accords)       On page 128, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following      new section:     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ASSISTANCE UNDER THE                    CAMP DAVID ACCORDS.       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) Egypt and Israel together negotiated the Camp David      Accords, an historic breakthrough in beginning the process of      bringing peace to the Middle East.       (2) As part of the Camp David Accords, a concept was      reached regarding the ratio of United States foreign      assistance between Egypt and Israel, a formula which has been      followed since the signing of the Accords.       (3) The United States is reducing economic assistance to      Egypt and Israel, with the agreement of those nations.       (4) The United States is committed to maintaining      proportionality between Egypt and Israel in United States      foreign assistance programs.       (5) Egypt has consistently fulfilled an historic role of      peacemaker in the context of the Arab-Israeli disputes.       (6) The recent elections in Israel offer fresh hope of      resolving the remaining issues of dispute in the region.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that the United States should provide Egypt access to an      interest bearing account as part of the United States foreign      assistance program pursuant to the principles of      proportionality which underlie the Camp David Accords.
