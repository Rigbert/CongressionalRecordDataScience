 It says:       We, Rabbis from across the country, call on our elected      officials to exercise moral leadership for the protection of      the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.       Since its founding, the United States has offered refuge      and protection to the world's most vulnerable. Time and time      again, those refugees were Jews. Whether fleeing the pogroms      in Tzarist Russia, the horrors of the Holocaust or      persecution in Soviet Russia or Iran, our relatives and      friends found safety on these shores.       We are therefore alarmed to see so many politicians      declaring their opposition to welcoming refugees.       Last month's heartbreaking attacks in Paris and Beirut are      being cited as reasons to deny entry to people who are      themselves victims of terror. And in those comments, we, as      Jewish leaders, see one of the darker moments of our history      repeating itself.  They go on to talk about the United States turning away the SS St. Louis in 1939, and 900 Jews were sent back to Europe. The Holocaust Museum tells us that 200 of them perished in the Holocaust because the United States refused to accept them as refugees.  They end by saying:       As Rabbis, we take seriously the biblical mandate to      ``welcome the stranger.'' We call on our elected officials to      uphold the great legacy of a country that welcomes refugees.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Oklahoma.
