Speaker, on July 17, 1995, Representative Walker and I introduced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 in order to continue the process of prioritizing NASA's missions and programs for the remainder of this century. The multiyear space station authorization bill, which the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics and the full Science Committee endorsed by wide margins with strong bipartisan support, placed the space station at the top of NASA's list of priorities and provided the programmatic stability NASA needs to reduce costs. The bill builds on this strategy to focus NASA on the goal of becoming the leading R&D agency it once was. By moving NASA away from operating large, expensive programs such as the space shuttle and Mission to Planet Earth, this authorization act will enable NASA to focus on those activities which the agency does best, namely space science and technological research. At the same time, the bill preserves U.S. national interests in the space shuttle and Mission to Planet Earth by laying the foundation to privatize the space shuttle and bring the emerging commercial remote sensing industry into Mission to Planet Earth.  By taking these steps, we bring new revenue streams and capital assets from the private sector into Government space missions. More importantly, we introduce market efficiencies into the large operating systems that NASA created but was never intended to run. In this manner, Congress enables NASA to leverage its resources against those space activities that the private sector cannot perform.  As needed as these measures are, this bill is also important for what it does not do. The Fiscal Year 1996 NASA Authorization Act does not force the precipitous closing of any NASA field centers. While we have encouraged NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin to more aggressively to streamline and consolidate the NASA bureaucracy, Congress must ensure that this process proceeds logically and with long-term programmatic goals in mind. NASA's ongoing zero-based review is the first attempt to restructure the agency without affecting its programs. While this is a commendable effort, congressional action to prioritize NASA programs will also have an impact on the agency's structure. The authorization bill Chairman Walker and I introduced begins this process by focusing first on NASA's priority programs and then calling for an assessment of Government assets that match those priorities. This assessment will enable the NASA Administrator to identify those elements of NASA that are crucial to its future and then empower the President to work with Congress on those bureaucratic adjustments deemed necessary to bring the agency into line with national priorities. Our bill complements the intention of the VA/HUD/Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee to have the NASA Administrator report his intentions for bureaucratic streamlining to Congress prior to any action, but does not empower the Administrator to close any NASA field centers without first studying the implications of and seeking congressional approval for such an action.  In the end, this bill will help us build a new NASA that once again can lead the United States into a sound economic and technological future.                          ____________________
