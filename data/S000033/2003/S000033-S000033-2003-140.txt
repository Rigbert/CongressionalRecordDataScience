 Speaker, it is an honor to recognize the contributions of Ron Pickering, an individual of great importance to the working people of America, and particularly my state of Vermont. For the past ten years he served with distinction as the President of the Vermont AFL-CIO. Ron was a remarkably effective and dedicated leader of Vermont's most important labor council.  He has also served most capably as the international representative for PACE [the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union], in which capacity he serviced many contracts in New England.  I have known Ron for many years, both as a personal friend and as colleague in the struggle for workers' rights. It is with a sense of deep respect that I say that Ron Pickering reinvigorated the trade union movement in the state of Vermont and laid the groundwork for some of the most important labor victories in the state's history.  Ron has been one of the best and most influential advocates for working people the state of Vermont has ever seen. His effectiveness in the State House in Montpelier has meant that working men and woman have had a voice, and a most eloquent voice, in the deliberations of state government.  Together with his wife Gloria, who has time and again been at his side while he traveled throughout the state of Vermont, Ron Pickering has stood up for the labor movement, for the needs of working Americans, and for the rights of those who put in a hard day's work--every day--to see that America remains productive and strong.                          ____________________
