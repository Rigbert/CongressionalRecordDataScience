Speaker, it is with a sense of deep gratitude and sorrow that I rise to pay tribute to the life of Sister Anne Louise Stoelzel, an Ursuline sister of Toledo, Ohio who passed from this life on Nov. 19. Sister Anne Louise dedicated her life to the education of young women and men, and helped build St. Ursula Academy in our community into a premier institution of advanced learning at the high school level. She tutored students even into her 80's and remained a smiling and vibrant presence to all who knew her.  Sister Anne Louise took on the task of moderating the school's large, and growing alumnae association for 30 years, no small task, after having taught mathematics for two decades. In 1990, she received the Alumna of the Year Award and was sought out and loved by the school's graduates. She remembered them, followed their lives, amazingly, kept in touch with thousands of girls, their families, and their lives.  She was an avid fan of St. Ursula sports teams and a regular attendee at games as St. Ursula's winning teams rose to fame locally and statewide. She rooted on the bench with all she had in her.  Sister Anne Louise was a Toledoan through and through. She carried its values. She grew up in the Old West End, a parishioner at Rosary Cathedral, and a woman in service to Christ throughout her most generous life. She held bachelor of arts and science degrees from the former Mary Manse College in Toledo, and received a master's degree from the Catholic University of America. Her pursuit of lifelong learning took her to many universities--Notre Dame, St. Louis University, Bowling Green, Ohio State, and the University of Toledo.  No measure can be placed on the gift of the life of one woman to her community. The life of Sister Anne Louise stands as living testament to a woman who loved others more than herself, who believed in the education and potential of young women to excel and make contributions to life beyond what we know today. It was to that future that she gave herself long before even the laws in the United States afforded women equal opportunity in education.  Our entire community sends its sympathies to the sisters of St. Ursula and the loving community of women and men that surrounded her, and St. Ursula's ongoing mission toward education of young women, and the advancement of learning for the betterment of humankind. Sister Anne Louise lived with distinction the legacy of St. Angela Merici, the foundress of the Order of St. Ursula. May Sister Anne Louise rest in peace, a beloved daughter of the Lord who served with love and faith throughout her precious life.               St. Ursula Grad Taught Math at Alma Mater                 sister anne louise stoelzel, 1922-2005       Sister Anne Louise Stoelzel, 83, a graduate of St. Ursula      Academy who taught mathematics at her alma mater for 20 years      and was moderator of the school's alumnae association for 30      years, died Tuesday of congestive heart failure in the      Ursuline Center.       Sister Anne Louise retired from classroom teaching in 1991,      but she continued to tutor math students until about two      years ago.       ``She was a very good teacher and very patient,'' Sister      Kathleen Padden said. ``As a tutor, she taught not only the      girls from the academy, but boys from St. Francis [de Sales      High School] and students from the public schools whose      mothers might have been alumnae.''       She was a strict teacher, ``but an excellent teacher,''      said Fran Sears, whose daughter, Ellen, was a student of      Sister Anne Louise's. ``She knew and understood math      perfectly,'' Mrs. Sears said.       Sister Anne Louise was moderator of the St. Ursula Alumnae      Association from 1971 to 2001 and was moderator emerita      afterward. She received the Alumna of the Year Award in 1990.       Not only was she a regular at St. Ursula reunions, she kept      in touch with alumnae and followed the events of their lives.       ``She knew all the grads, all the alumnae. She knew their      families and their daughters and granddaughters,'' Mrs. Sears      said. ``You mentioned somebody, she could tell you about      her.''       Sister Anne Louise was a fan of St. Ursula sports teams and      followed local high school sports, Mrs. Sears said.       She was born Marie Kathryn Stoelzel and grew up in the Old      West End. She was a parishioner of Rosary Cathedral when she      entered the Ursuline Community in 1943.       Sister Anne Louise received bachelor of arts and bachelor      of science in education degrees from the former Mary Manse      College. She received a master's degree from Catholic      University of America in Washington.       She was awarded National Science Foundation grants to      pursue her post-graduate education during summer breaks. Her      studies took her to the University of Notre Dame, St. Louis      University, DePauw University, Bowling Green State      University, the University of Toledo, and Ohio State      University.       Sister Anne Louise previously taught at the elementary      schools of St. Teresa and St. Thomas Aquinas in Toledo and at      Lima, Ohio, Central Catholic High School.       She and her sister, Gertrude Trompeter, were close, and she      visited the Trompeter home on holidays and other occasions,      her brother-in-law, Carl Trompeter, said. She also took a      keen interest in her four nephews--they called her Aunt      Marie--and their families.       Her sister died Nov. 19, 2003.       There are no immediate survivors.       Visitation will begin at 3 p.m. today in the Ursuline      Center, where there will be a vigil service at 7 tonight.      Funeral services will be at 10 a.m. tomorrow in the Ursuline      Center. Arrangements are by the Coyle Funeral Home.       It is suggested that tributes be to the Ursuline Sisters      Retirement Fund.                          ____________________
