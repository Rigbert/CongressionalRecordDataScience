 First, if I can ask the leader, there are not bill numbers on the energy packages to which the gentleman referred. Have these bills been introduced, are there going to be hearings held on them, have hearings been held on them, will they be considered by committee? Can the gentleman fill us in on some of that information?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the bills are being worked on as we speak. We anticipate many of them being introduced today, if not today, tomorrow. Most of the bills have already been considered or voted on in the past on energy policies. We do not anticipate the need for any committee action on many of these bills. Some of them are suspension-type bills, and we anticipate bringing some on suspension calendar and then others by rule.
