  This isn't salary. It's a retirement package for the senior executives.  Some call it a ``golden parachute.''  By any definition, it's a very generous deal.  DOD pays the top five executives, including Mr. Augustine, $3,552,909.  Now, this isn't Mr. Augustine's salary, for example.  These are just retirement benefits.  He gets a lot more, but it comes out of another DOD pool of money.  How many pools of money does DOD have for corporate pay.  Mr. President, this tells me we need a cap.  I am told that when the idea of a cap was first debated over in the Pentagon, a DCAA bureaucrat made this suggestion:  Why not set the cap at $1 million?  Mr. President, the Pentagon's weak-kneed attitude on executive pays tells me that a cap is mandatory.  On March 5, 1996, the DOD inspector general, Ms. Eleanor Hill, came out in favor of a $250,000 cap.  I thank her for doing that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place her letter of recommendation in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                Inspector General,                                        Department of Defense,                                     Arlington, VA, March 5, 1996.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recently, the Department provided its      views on S. 1102, ``To amend title 10, United States Code, to      make reimbursement of defense contractors for costs of      excessive amounts of compensation for contractor personnel      unallowable under the Department of Defense contracts''. In      response to a request from Senator Grassley's office, we      offer our views on the legislation for your consideration.       We support a permanent $250,000 cap on allowable individual      compensation costs under DoD contracts. This is not a      limitation on total compensation but on the costs charged to      the Government. Furthermore, we would also support a      limitation on all Government contractors. This additional      limitation would prevent DoD contractors who also have      contracts with other Government agencies from charging this      compensation to non-DoD contracts.       I hope this information is helpful as the Congress      continues consideration of this important issue. If we can be      of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me      or Mr. John R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at      (703, 604-8324.           Sincerely,                                                     Eleanor Hill,                                                Inspector General.
