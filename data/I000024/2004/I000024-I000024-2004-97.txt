President, I would like to at least mention this is a bill that is in the committee I chair. It is one that has been requested by virtually every community we have in Oklahoma. In fact, the Senator who is presiding right now was a cosponsor of this bill. It passed the committee by a vote of 12 to 6. It passed the House of Representatives, once on a voice vote and the second time by a vote of 413 to 2--413 to 2. Virtually every Republican and Democrat voted for it. In fact, every Democrat voted for it. Only two Republicans did not vote for it. The House cosponsors include Congressman Jim Oberstar.  Wastewater treatment works are responsible for treating municipal and industrial waste to a level clean enough to be released into the Nation's waterways. I have to say, I cannot think of any one bill that means more to local communities. Having been a mayor of a major community at one time, this is a very critical bill. It is one I am hoping there will be no objection to when we come back from this recess in September.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
