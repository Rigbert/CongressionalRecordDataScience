 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dennis Griffin, a resident of Bowling Green, KY, who is being recognized as one of the top local developers in the Nation. Mr. Griffin is 1 of 10 economic developers who received a leadership award from the American Economic Development Council.  Mr. Griffin has been president of the Bowling Green-Warren County Chamber of Commerce since 1986, the same year he moved to Kentucky. Since taking over as president of the chamber of commerce the local economy has soared. Mr. Griffin is best described by Bowling Green Mayor Johnny Webb in a recent article in the Daily News. Mayor Webb said,       Things were not going too well in Bowling Green. It had      been some time since we had recruited a new industry. It was      almost like a lightbulb coming on when (Griffin) came in and      got his feet on the ground. He is the catalyst to      development.  Mr. President, during the last 9 years, Mr. Griffin has worked hard to develop the region. He is responsible for starting 56 new companies, and establishing 6,000 new jobs; an investment of more than $400 million in the community. But that's not all, Mr. Griffin also worked hard to help 72 existing industries expand, which created an additional 2,500 jobs, investing another $100 million in the community.  Mr. Griffin, just like the Energizer Bunny, is still going strong even after 9 years of service. In the last year alone, 10 new plants have decided to call Bowling Green their home and 9 companies have expanded.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this outstanding Kentuckian. I think that all will agree that through his hard work and dedication for his community, Mr. Griffin proves that he truly deserves the honor of being one of the country's top local developers.                          ____________________
