Speaker, reclaiming my time, if am I to understand about the discussions then as to what would be in the CR, the advice I would have, for whatever it might be worth, is that we try to consider it prior to Friday, in light of the fact that Friday is the last day, and if a glitch occurs, for whatever reasons, I would hope that the majority would bring a CR to the floor either Wednesday or Thursday, so that if we have a problem that we may be able to deal with that either Thursday or Friday.  But if we have not considered it until Friday and a glitch occurs, we are going to be in a bad spot with reference to the end of the fiscal year and the lack of funding authority for many agencies at that point.  I do not know whether the gentleman wants to comment on that or not, but I yield to him if he does.
