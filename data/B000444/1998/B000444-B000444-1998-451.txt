 As I understand, I just learned that the allocation of time was based on Democrat-Republican, as opposed to supporting and opposing the amendment. Although I have a great affection and loyalty to my friend from California, I have a diametrically opposed position.  I ask unanimous consent the time she consumed be charged not to those in opposition to the amendment but those who support the amendment, meaning Senator Coverdell. I am managing the time of those who are opposed to the amendment of Senators Coverdell and Feinstein.
