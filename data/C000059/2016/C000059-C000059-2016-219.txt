Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment to the Corona, California community is truly exceptional. Next week, on January 21, 2016, Maryann Sherman will be honored as the 2015 Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Maryann has dedicated herself to the Corona community.  Maryann Sherman has been a pillar of the Corona, California community since 1966. She initially worked in her father's music store on Main Street, while she was an active parishioner and teacher at her church, St. Edwards Parish. Maryann later became employed with the Corona Norco Unified School District in the 1980s, and has recently retired as the Librarian at Jefferson Elementary School.  During her time as Librarian at Jefferson Elementary, Maryann developed ways to help engage and give back to the school community. She helped coordinate funding and programming for parents on how to use the computers, applications and a variety of other programs. Additionally, she always looked for ways to assist less fortunate students through finding resources for them. Maryann also helped serve her community while working as a Corona Public Library Trustee. She utilized the library's resources to help promote literacy to community individuals who may have not had the opportunity otherwise. Her commitment to giving back to the community has followed her from Jefferson Elementary to her new project, heading a fruit and vegetable program for the needy in our city twice a month.  Maryann is also dedicated to her family. She has been married to her husband, Tom, for 43 years. Together they have two children, Colonel Thomas Sherman and a daughter, Nancy Sherman. Maryann is a devoted mother and was very active in both of her children's school Parent Teacher Organizations. It was this involvement that helped lead her to working full time with the Corona Norco Unified School District.  Maryann's tireless passion for her family, community service and giving back has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Maryann a friend, fellow community member and great American. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Maryann achieving the Citizen of the Year award.                          ____________________
