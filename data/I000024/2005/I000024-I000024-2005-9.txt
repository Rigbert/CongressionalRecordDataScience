President, I returned 2 days ago from Iraq. There was an article in yesterday's Hill magazine that was erroneous--there will be a correction printed--where they inaccurately stated the number of times I have been over to Iraq. It has actually been 10 times. I have been doing this not because I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but because I believe it is our constitutional responsibility to see firsthand that our guys over there are getting the equipment they need to prosecute the war, and they have been.  I want to share with you what happened the first of this week because even though the vote took place yesterday, on Thursday, the vote for the Iraqi security forces actually took place on Monday and Tuesday. We had a chance to go up there and visit with them.  The interesting point is, we saw this coming. There have been a lot of politicians coming back and talking about how bad things are over there. I can't figure out where they get their information because as we have been approaching these elections over the last few months, we have noticed the IED incidents have been down 30 percent and suicide bombs have been down 70 percent.  There is a road that goes from where we get off the C-130s to go into the Green Zone. Mr. President, you have been there. We were averaging about 10 terrorist incidents on that road each week up until June. We haven't had one since June. So we see all these good things are happening, and then the unexpected quality of the training we are getting for the Iraqi security forces. These guys right now--and I think this is significant because people keep asking, What is the exit strategy? I can tell you what I believe. One Senator believes we are going to be out.  Right now there are 214,000 Iraqi soldiers who are trained and equipped. At the end of this month, while we are drawing down--we are drawing down probably 15,000 to 20,000 of ours troops--they are going to increase to 220,000. By the end of 2006, it is anticipated they will be at 300,000. The goal is to get 10 divisions of Iraqi security forces. Ten divisions of Iraqi security forces equal 325,000 troops. That will happen by July of 2007.  In terms of the way we are functioning now, we will be out of there, but there will still be some troops there. We still have troops in Kosovo and in Bosnia, but the heavy lifting will be over. They will be taking care of themselves.  I see the incredible courage of these people. Up in Fallujah 3 nights ago, I had all of the Iraqi security forces that had voted that day come in. They were all rejoicing, and I said to them--this is kind of funny. I said to them, through an interpreter: When is it going to be that you are going to be able to be on your own without our support? Is that going to be in the near future?  And they said: No, no--which broke my heart when I heard this. Then I found out, in the Iraqi language, ``yes'' means ``na'am.'' So they are saying, ``Yes, yes,'' and when they shake their head this way, it also means ``yes.'' Anyway, a little advice in case that happens to anyone.  These people are ready. They are so proud of the level of training they have had. Keep in mind, this is in the Sunni triangle. These are the Sunnis who are supposed to dislike us.  Several weeks ago, I was there and I met General Mahdi, who is in charge of the Iraqi security forces in Fallujah. He had been in charge--under Saddam Hussein he was a brigade commander. He hated Americans until he started working with the Marines. He said he learned to love the Marines so much that when they rotated them out, they all got together and they cried. That guy right now, General Mahdi, is now over the eastern one-third of the entire city of Baghdad. We do not have our military there. It is all under Iraqi security. We have half of the city under security now. It is going to be up to 75 percent in a very short period of time.  I think, when we see the successes--and even if that were not true, if one stops and realizes the bloody regime of Saddam Hussein, yes, the targets for the terrorists right now are not Americans, they are Iraqis, and they are killing some of the Iraqis, but when one stops and puts it on a chart, during the 10 years that Saddam Hussein had his bloody regime, on a monthly basis he was torturing to death more people than the terrorists are killing today. When one looks at the way that they have done it, the forms of torture, include gouging out of eyes, severe beatings, electric shocks--there is a testimonial here about a 3-month-old baby girl who was taken, and they gouged her eyes out in front of the father, smashed her head and broke it open against a concrete wall.  There is a lot of talk on the other side of this issue about prisoner abuse. We do not have prisoner abuse. The documentation is right here about what they do with their prisoners. They will put them in shredders. If they are lucky, they will shred their head first. If they are unlucky, they will put their feet in there. This is what has been happening over there, but it is all over now, and they are in charge of their own destiny.  I have enjoyed so much visiting with the members of Parliament who were going to be up for election. This would have been on Wednesday, and they were going to be up the next day. One lady was quite outspoken and quite negative in terms of what her people were saying to her. I said: Did it ever occur to you 5 years ago that there would be an opportunity for a woman to serve in Parliament, let alone to talk the way you are talking? She stopped and said: You know, I think that is right.  So we are seeing such a change now in the attitudes. The polls look so good. The polls are showing that 70 percent of the people in Iraq are appreciative of the Americans being there. They want them to stay and get out when they are able to stand up on their own.  I met with the election commission, and to handle the election the way they did was totally unprecedented. We could never have predicted how smoothly things would go. We talked to the people, and I want to particularly pay tribute to IFES, the International Foundation of Electrical Systems. They have done a great job. They had people on the ground, and they have truly been able to conduct an election that is actually comparable and better than many other mature countries, maturing democracies. It has been a great success. I am rejoicing with all the people of Iraq today and with the people of America.  Lastly, I pay tribute to the brave people of Iraq who for the third time this year have gone to the polls in record number to vote for a brighter and more democratic future in Iraq. The early reports indicate that across the 18 provinces of Iraq, Iraqis again turned out in massive numbers to votein favor of a democratic Iraq. In doing so the Iraqis demonstrated to us all the importance of voting.  Earlier this week I was in Iraq and had the opportunity to see first hand the preparations for the historic election on December 15. I even had a chance to witness some of the early voting that took place in Iraq. It was a moving experience and one that demonstrated that the great sacrifice that America has made in Iraq helped to free people from tyranny and start them on the road to a democratic future.  While in Baghdad, I met with the Chairman of the Independent Election Commission of Iraq, IECI, Isadin Al Mohamaady and the members of the commission. I had an opportunity to see first hand the extensive preparations that were being undertaken by the Iraqis. I was impressed by the sacrifice made by the members of the commission and their staff, many of whom have paid the ultimate price for democracy with their lives. However, the spirit that I found in Baghdad, Fallujah, and everywhere I went, was one of determination, professionalism, and a dedication to making sure that Iraqis could freely select their future leaders at the ballot box.  It is important also to recognize the work of the International Foundation for Election Systems also known as IFES that has played a critical role in helping advance free and fair elections in Iraq and in 120 countries around the world. With the support of U.S. taxpayers, IFES was able to provide critical assistance that helped to make these elections possible.  I stand here to salute the brave Iraqis who at great personal risk sent an important message to the world about the triumph of the ballot over the bullet. Iraqis of all ethnic groups have joined together with unity and determination to freely choose their leaders in a free and fair election. They have sent a message around the world that the best way to defeat tyranny is at the ballot box, the source of power of the people, by the people and for the people.                          ____________________
