President, the legislation before us is a benefit to special interests, the gun lobby. It will deny individual Americans the right to go to court to challenge the conduct of individuals who negligently or allegedly negligently sold weapons. It would be a great distortion of the law. I hope my colleagues will resist this legislation.                             Cloture Motion
