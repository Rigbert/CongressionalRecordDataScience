 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the second Bluegrass Chapter Honor Flight. I had the privilege of meeting 38 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who arrived in our Nation's Capital yesterday morning to see the memorial on the National Mall dedicated to them.  Thanks to the national nonprofit organization, Honor Flight, which transports World War II veterans from anywhere in the country to see their memorial, and a group of dedicated volunteers, veterans from all over the stateare able to make this memorable trip, free of charge.  The World War II Memorial was completed in 2004 and is a fitting tribute to the men and women who put on their country's uniform to fight the greatest and most destructive war the world has ever seen. Anyone who has ever visited this special place will agree that its stateliness is nothing short of awe-inspiring much like the men and women for whom it was built and who are so deserving of their title as ``the Greatest Generation.''  On the memorial's field of gold stars, known as the Freedom Wall, the inscription reads ``Here We Mark the Price of Freedom.'' The veterans from my home State of Kentucky who visited today paid that price with their blood, sweat and tears; their families paid with sleepless nights and constant fear for the safety of their loved ones; and many of their fellow fighters paid with their lives.  We should remember the bravery of the men and women who served, and the World War II Memorial is a fitting tribute for all those who sacrificed in defense of our Nation and our way of life.  Mr. President, it is really a moving experience to be in the company of some of the men and women of the ``Greatest Generation,'' and I ask unanimous consent that the names of the World War II veterans from Kentucky who were here yesterday be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the names were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Kentucky World War II Veterans       Elmer Morgan, William Coffey, Curtis Lesmeister, Lewis      Grahm, Morgan Bradford, Leslie Spillman, Ralph Holman,      Richard Thompson, William Richmond, Frank Parks, Vaiden Cox,      James Wells, Daniel Rateau, Kenneth Becker, Morris Alford,      James Hartman, Richard Doty, Melvin Campbell, Sr., Salvador      Miceli, Veachel Lile.
