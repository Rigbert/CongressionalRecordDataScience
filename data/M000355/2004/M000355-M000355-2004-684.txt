 President, tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1805, the gun liability bill. The consent agreement worked out by the managers just a few moments ago means that we will make significant progress on many somewhat contentious issues tomorrow. Senators should anticipate rollcall votes throughout the day.                          ____________________
