Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.  Can we possibly be debating whether researchers at the National Cancer Institute should be on the job Monday? You know, we can count the phone calls when people call and say they are upset because they did not get their Social Security checks, they did not get their veterans' checks. It is that kind of political pressure which has resulted in this very measure that we are considering.  How can we measure the loss to this Nation if the research, the medical research which we count on to find cures for diseases to alleviate the death and suffering in America is not taking place? That is what is at stake in this debate. That is why it goes far beyond whether the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] gets an appropriate seat on Air Force One, whether or not the President has his exact language.  What we have at stake here are 700,000 Federal employees sitting home without pay while Members of Congress still receive their paychecks. That is an outrage.  What we need to hear are the voices of the American people who are sick and tired of this political charade. To think that we would even debate whether or not the researchers will come to work on Monday to proceed at the National Cancer Institute to look for cures for cancer, that is shameful.  I sincerely hope both political parties take a look in a mirror or at the image we are projecting to the United States. The political pettiness behind this debate has reached Olympic standards.
