 To the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, you say in your report that they are not needed for war fighting, that they are needed because of the needs within the Pentagon, within the bureaucracy. The marines themselves say they need the additional generals to fill vacant war-fighting positions.  Now, it seems to me that we ought to be able to have the Armed Services Committee and the Marine Corps talking off the same song sheet if there is a need for it. Those are the Marine Corps' own words. I underscore in this effort the word ``vacant''--to fill vacant war-fighting positions.  First, if you look at these, to say that these are war-fighting positions--and I am using the Marine Corps' rationale, not the Armed Services Committee's rationale--I think that would really be stretching the point. Three of the positions, by the Marine Corps' own request, are in the Pentagon. I hope I do not insult people when I say that is not war fighting. I understand that the entire military is dedicated to war fighting, yes, but close to the battlefield, no.  Two of these generals are for recruiting. That is not war fighting. Three are high-level joint headquarters positions. That is not war fighting. Five or six are connected with Marine combat forces, and that is getting close to war fighting. But now, just reading the request of what the marines want to do with 14 additional generals does not fully explain the issue. So you have to dig deeper.  When you get down to the nitty-gritty, Mr. President, you see that few, if any, of the new generals would actually fill vacant--emphasis on ``vacant''--war-fighting positions. Now, that is, again, the Marine Corps rationale for these generals, not the Senate Armed Services Committee rationale for generals. So to back up the assertion I just made, you need to examine each proposed billet. I have done that. To do that, you need two documents. You need the Department of Defense directory entitled ``General Officer Worldwide Roster.'' I have it here. This is the March 1996 issue. And you also need the ``United States Marine Corps General Officers Position List,'' provided by the Director of Personnel Management on July 9, 1996.  If you go down the list--and I am not going to go through all these positionsbecause I do not think I have to in order to justify my statements--you can look at the first position at the top of the list. No. 1, commanding general of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force. Now then, if you consult the Department of Defense directory, they say the position is already filled by Lt. Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm. General Wilhelm wears a second hat as commander of the Marine Corps Forces Atlantic.  If you look at the second position on the list, it is deputy commanding general, First Marine Expeditionary Force. If you look at the directory in the Department of Defense, that position is also filled. It is filled by an acting brigadier general, Edward R. Langston, Jr., a senior colonel doing a general's job. He wears a general's insignia but is paid as a colonel. In military language, he is ``frocked.'' General Langston is the deputy under Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the commanding general. Mr. President, I could go through all the positions, but the results are the same.  Bottom line: All but one of the existing positions is filled. Only one is actually vacant. That is why I have said that the marines say they want an additional 14 marines to fill vacant war-fighting positions. The Senate Armed Services Committee says they need them not for war fighting, but for other purposes.  I want to place in the Record the status of each of the proposed posts that I have referred to. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Possible Assignments for New Generals       Main argument: The Marine Corps says it needs the      additional 12 generals to fill critical billets as follows:       No. 1.

He or she wears the insignia of a brigadier general      but is paid as a colonel. The Marine Corps refers to this      status as ``frocked.''
