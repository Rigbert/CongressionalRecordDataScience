President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hatch as an original cosponsor of the ``Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1995.'' We are seeking to give law enforcement additional tools to combat counterfeiting crimes that cost our Nation's companies billions of dollars each year.  Increasingly, we suspect that the lost revenue to legitimate U.S. companies is going into the pockets of international crime syndicates and organized criminals, who manufacture, import and distribute counterfeited goods to fund their criminal enterprises. No enterprise is safe from counterfeiters.  We are a nation of innovators. We lead the world when it comes to intellectual property and high technology. Our companies trademarks indicate quality around the world. Domestic and international counterfeiters are ripping off these companies, picking their pockets, and defrauding the consuming public.  Vermont, with one of the lowest violent crime rates in the Nation, is home to businesses that benefit from a strong work ethic and dedication to quality. That is part of the reason that Vermont products are trusted and respected across the nation and around the world.  Vermont maple syrup producers comply with stringent standards so that syrup lovers around the world are not disappointed. They have to be constantly vigilant against counterfeiters who use the Vermont label to get a free ride on the reputation for excellence syrup from my State enjoys.  Burton Snowboards of Burlington faces the same problem. This company is the world leader in making snowboard equipment, but loses an estimated $1 million annually to copycat boots made in Korea.  The IBM facility in Essex Junction makes 16 and 64 megabyte memory chips, known as DRAM [dynamic random access memory chips]. These memory chips, which can be used in medical equipment and computers, are likewise the subject of counterfeiting.  This bill takes important steps to address the problem of counterfeiting in several ways. It seeks to expand our existing racketeering law to cover crimes involving counterfeiting and copyright infringement and to give our law enforcement officers additional, needed authority to seize counterfeit merchandise and impose fines on counterfeiters. As a former prosecutor, I know that penalties and punishment can deter crime and this bill moves in the right direction.  We must make our laws more effective in combatting counterfeiting crimes here at home and also confront the international nature of the problem. Copycat goods with the labels of legitimate, American companies are manufactured, distributed and sold in foreign cities around the globe. We should insist that our trading partners take action against all kinds of intellectual property violations: Whether counterfeiting or copyright piracy, it amounts to theft and fraud on the consuming public. We cannot tolerate our trading partners and international allies acting as safe havens for pirates.  Trademark counterfeiting is not a joke. It costs in jobs, tax revenue, markets, and credibility. Many products being counterfeited can lead to health and safety hazards and even cost lives.  I look forward to our proceeding with prompt hearing on this important measure and to its early consideration and passage.                          ____________________
