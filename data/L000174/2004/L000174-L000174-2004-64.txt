President, earlier we discussed Judiciary Committee jurisdiction.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   October 7, 2004     Hon. Bill Frist,     Capitol Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Capitol Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Capitol Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Capitol Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: We write to raise serious concerns about a      provision of S. Res. 445, the McConnell-Reid Senate      Intelligence and Homeland Security Oversight Reform Proposal,      that would create a new Homeland Security and Governmental      Affairs Committee.       While we commend the Senate for taking strong actions to      revamp congressional oversight of the Executive Branch's      intelligence and homeland security functions, we strongly      oppose any action to remove from the Judiciary Committee its      jurisdiction over criminal law, law enforcement, domestic      intelligence activities, domestic surveillance authorities,      the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of      Justice, and investigative guidelines issued by the Attorney      General. As organizations with longstanding expertise and      experience in these areas, we believe it is essential at this      critical time in our Nation's history that the Judiciary      Committee retain its jurisdiction over these issues and      ensure continuity of congressional oversight. Its members and      staff have developed years of experience in these complex      legal issues, which have serious implications not only for      safety and security but also for civil liberties and civil      rights. In particular, the Judiciary Committee's deep      substantive expertise and historical role in civil liberties      issues is increasingly important as government powers expand      to fight terrorism.       We urge you to clarify that jurisdiction over these law      enforcement and domestic intelligence issues, including      oversight of the FBI and Justice Department, remain with the      Senate Judiciary Committee.
