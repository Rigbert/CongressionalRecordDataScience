Chairman, I want to thank the Congressman for being so vigilant on this particular request for plant genome sequencing at Loyola University of Chicago. No one has been a stronger advocate in this Congress than has the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).  We will work with him as this legislative process moves forward, and urge the gentleman to also consider pursuing funding in the National Science Foundation plant genome initiative. But we will continue to work with the gentleman.
