President, today, I am joining my colleagues from Maine, Connecticut, and Delaware, in introducing the Protect Children from Dangerous Lighters Act, a ban on novelty cigarette lighters.  Novelty lighters, also known as toy-like lighters, are cigarette lighters that look like small children's toys or regular household items. In the hands of small children they can be very dangerous. Because they are so well disguised as toys, a child could easily pick one up to play with it without realizing that it could be very hazardous.  The result of this mistake can be deadly: In Oregon, two boys were playing with a novelty lighter disguised as a toy dolphin and accidently started a serious fire, causing the death of one boy and the permanent brain damage of the other. Also in Oregon, a mother suffered third degree burns on her foot when her child was playing with a novelty lighter shaped like a small toy Christmas tree and set a bed on fire.  Incidents like these happen all over the country. In Maine, a young boy took a miniature baseball bat off a shelf at a convenience store, accidentally ignited a flame and seared his eyebrow. In North Carolina, a boy sustained second degree burns after playing with a novelty lighter that looked like a toy cell phone. In one of the most tragic examples, a 2-year-old and a 15-month-old from Arkansas were killed in a fire they accidently started while playing with a novelty lighter shaped like a toy motorcycle.  These injuries and deaths cry out to us to take action and remove these dangerous lighters from shelves everywhere.  A ban on novelty lighters would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to treat novelty lighters as a banned hazardous substance. That means novelty lighters will not be manufactured, imported, sold, or given away as promotional gifts anywhere in this country. This measure will keep novelty lighters out of the hands of children and prevent injuries like those that have already brought tragedy to too many families.  A number of states and cities have taken it upon themselves to ban these dangerous lighters. Oregon and four other States have already enacted such bans, and thirteen other states are currently considering similar measures. It is clear that this is an important safety issue, and it is time for the Federal Government to pass this bill so that children in all states will be protected.  A Federal ban on novelty lighters has widespread, nationwide support. Along with the Oregon Fire Marshal, the National Association of Fire Marshals supports a federal ban on these lighters and has been active in promoting public awareness on this issue. I want to thank the Congressional Fire Services Institute for their leadership in building support for this bill. The cigarette lighter industry, represented by the Lighter Association, is a partner in supporting a ban on novelty lighters. Finally, consumer groups, such as Safe Kids USA and others have endorsed this approach.  Congress should act now to avoid the suffering caused by the senseless deaths and serious injuries that result from novelty lighters being mistaken for toys. Dangerous tools containing flammable fuel should not be dressed up in packages that are attractive to children; especially when young children do not have the capacity to differentiate these lighters from common toys. Please join me in banning dangerous novelty lighters by cosponsoring the Protect Children from Dangerous Lighters Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 723       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Children from      Dangerous Lighters Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Lighters are inherently dangerous products containing      flammable fuel.       (2) If lighters are used incorrectly or used by children,      dangerous and damaging consequences may result.       (3) Novelty lighters are easily mistaken by children and      adults as children's toys or as common household items.       (4) Novelty lighters have been the cause of many personal      injuries to children and adults and property damage      throughout the United States.     SEC. 3. NOVELTY LIGHTER DEFINED.

SEC. 4. BAN ON NOVELTY LIGHTERS.
