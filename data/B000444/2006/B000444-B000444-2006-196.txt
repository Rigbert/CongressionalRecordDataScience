 President, today I would like to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of the late Estonian President Lennart Meri. President Meri was an inspiration to his countrymen, a true friend of the United States, and a stalwart advocate for freedom. His passing on March 14, 2006, was a tremendous loss to the people of Estonia and the world.  Born in 1929 to the renowned diplomat and Shakespearean translator Georg Meri, Lennart's early childhood exemplified the plight of the Estonian people. Living in a country ravaged by war and subjected to the brutality of Soviet occupation, Lennart attended nine different schools and studied in four different languages. He was eventually deported from his homeland to Siberia along with thousands of other Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. During his forced exile, he helped feed his family by picking potatoes.  President Meri experienced more hardship as a boy than most men do in a lifetime, but he was quick to turn his struggles into opportunities. In the course of his itinerant education he became fluent in French, German, English, and Russian. He also developed a tenacity that would serve him well throughout his life.  Lennart eventually came back to Estonia to study history and languages, graduating from Tartu University with honors in 1958. The Soviet Government prevented Lennart from working as an Estonian historian, but he again found possibility where others might have only seen discouragement. Instead of accepting defeat, he established himself as a writer, filmmaker, and dramatist, and used these avenues to preserve Estonia's national identity.  For over 20 years, the Soviet Union refused to allow Lennart to venture beyond the Iron Curtain. Ultimately, when he did travel abroad, he served as a lone, unofficial emissary of what was by then an almost forgotten country. He established contact with politicians and journalists, recounting the story of Estonia to whoever would listen. When the collapse of the Soviet empire finally freed his country, Lennart was able to continue representing his newly independent homeland as an Ambassador and Foreign Minister. Ultimately, Lennart served two terms as President of the country he had loved and championed for so long.  Lennart's accomplishments were myriad; he helped build Estonia's Foreign Service from the ground up, established strong ties with the West, and reached an historic agreement with Boris Yeltsin to end Russia's military presence in Estonia. Beyond these remarkable achievements, though, Lennart left behind a bequest of liberty that will endure along with the free nation of Estonia. I hope each of us will appreciate that legacy and continue working to advance the cause of freedom.                          ____________________
