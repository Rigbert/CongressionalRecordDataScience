 President, I rise because my State and our country have lost one of our last links to a bygone era. On Tuesday, April 28, Robley Rex passed away a few days shy of his 108th birthday. He will forever be remembered as Kentucky's last World War I-era veteran.  Ninety years ago, a teenaged Robley Rex landed in France, caring a rifle and wearing a U.S. Army uniform. He was a long way from Christian County, KY, where he was born in 1901 and raised.  Wanting to see the world and fight for his country, Robley enlisted in the Fifth, and later the 28th, Infantry Division and was deployed to Europe. After leaving the Army in 1922, he returned to Kentucky and settled in Louisville, where he became a postal worker and ordained Methodist minister.  Robley was not only the Bluegrass State's preeminent veteran, he was also its preeminent volunteer on behalf of veterans. Decades after his own active service ended, he continued to serve his fellow soldiers by volunteering at the Louisville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, right up until the last years of his life.
