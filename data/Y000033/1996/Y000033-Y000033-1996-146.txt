Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I thank the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie] for his kind words.  This is an ability here to work together, and I can assure the gentleman we will be watching this very closely to make sure what we have stated on the floor today. The gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] has done an excellent job, and of course the ranking member has also done the job.  I would suggest respectfully that this is long overdue in the energy field. It does in fact, as has been mentioned before, create $36 or $37 million for the Federal Government and $9 million for the State. And may I suggest one thing. It is a level playing field with the IRS.  I want to suggest one thing I do agree with. If there is bad accounting on the oil company's side, we will be watching this very closely. But equally if there is bad accounting on the Interior side, we will be watching that very closely. So no one should be to blame. We should solve this problem, and that is what we are trying to do with this legislation.  I would suggest though, Mr. Speaker, that we have a letter from a bipartisan group of Governors, including my Governor, Tony Knowles, and Gov. Pete Wilson, Gov. Philip Batt, Gov. Bill Graves, Gov. Marc Raciot, Gov. Benjamin Nelson, Gov. Gary Johnson, Gov. Edward Schafer, Gov. Frank Keating, Gov. George Bush, Gov. Michael Leavitt, and Gov. Jim Geringer supporting this.  And, by the way, it says: ``This legislation provides the best opportunities for Federal and State cooperation and partnerships in natural resources policy that has ever emerged from this Congress.'' So I want to suggest this is strongly supported by Governors and should be supported, and I do welcome the support from the gentleman from Hawaii.  This ability, as he mentioned, to govern, is by doing the art of possible, by coming to a solution, and I do support this legislation.
