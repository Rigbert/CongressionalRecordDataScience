President, I am calling up tonight the amendment I debated on the Senate floor on Monday, with Senator Dodd and other Members who were present. This amendment would direct regulators to impose strong risk- and size-based capital standards on financial institutions as they grow in size or engage in risky practices. I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Brownback.  Our amendment is aimed at addressing the too-big-to-fail problem at the root of the current economic crisis by requiring financial firms to have adequate amounts of cash and other liquid assets to survive financial challenges without turning to the taxpayers for a bailout.  I note this amendment would ensure that the Nation's largest banks and bank holding companies are required to meet, at a minimum, the same capital standards that are imposed on smaller community banks.  That is right. It may be odd to realize, but the fact is, under current law, regulators can allow larger financial institutions to follow capital standards that are actually less stringent than those that are applied to smaller depository institutions. That makes no sense whatsoever, and that is why this amendment has the strong support of the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC Chairman, Sheila Bair.  She has written me a letter endorsing this amendment. She points out it is a critical element to ensure that U.S. financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during future periods of financial stress. ``It is imperative,'' she writes, ``that they have sufficient capital to stand on their own in times of adversity.''  This amendment would apply to some of our largest banks as well as bank holding companies, and it would also apply to nonbank financial institutions that are identified for supervision by the Federal Reserve by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, established by the bill.  This council is the council of regulators that will be created so we have an entity that would look across the economy to identify financial institutions and practices, risky practices that could pose a systemic risk to our economy.  Since I did debate the amendment at length on Monday, I am not going to go on at length tonight, especially since there are others of my colleagues who are waiting to speak. I would note that I have had a very good discussion with the managers of the bill, and I look forward to working further with them in the hopes that we can schedule this amendment for a vote tomorrow. I note this is a bipartisan amendment and that we have consulted at length with the chairman of the Banking Committee.  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Chairman of the FDIC be printed in the Record, which letter further describes the amendment and the need for it, and I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   Federal Deposit                                        Insurance Corporation,                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2010.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express my strong      support for your amendment number 3879 to ensure strong      capital requirements for our nation's financial institutions.      This amendment is a critical element to ensure that U.S.      financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb      losses during future periods of financial stress. With new      resolution authority, taxpayers will no longer bail out large      financial institutions. This makes it imperative that they      have sufficient capital to stand on their own in times of      adversity.       During the crisis, FDIC-insured subsidiary banks became the      source of strength both to the holding companies and holding      company affiliates. Far from being a source of strength to      banks as Congress intended, holding companies became a source      of weakness requiring federal support. If, in the future,      bank holding companies are to become sources of financial      stability for insured banks, then they cannot operate under      consolidated capital requirements that are numerically lower      and qualitatively less stringent than those applying to      insured banks. This amendment would address this issue by      requiring bank holding companies to operate under capital      standards at least as stringent as those applying to banks.       The crisis also demonstrated the dangers of excessive      leverage undertaken by large nonbanks outside of the scope of      federal bank regulation. Notable examples included the      excessive leverage of the largest investment banks during the      run-up to the crisis, and the extremely high leverage of      Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To remedy this and prevent      regulatory gaps and arbitrage, large nonbank financial      institutions deemed to be systemic must be held to the same,      or higher, capital standards as those applying to banks and      bank holding companies. Again, the amendment accomplishes      this goal simply and directly.       Finally, and more broadly, the crisis identified the      dangers of a regulatory mindset focused exclusively on the      soundness of individual banks without reference to the ``big      picture.'' For example, an individual overnight repo may be      safe, but widespread financing of illiquid securities with      overnight repos left the system vulnerable to a liquidity      crisis. A financial system-wide view requires regulators,      working in conjunction with the new Financial Services      Oversight Panel, to develop capital regulations to address      the risks of activities that affect the broader financial      system, beyond the bank that is engaging in the activity.       We at the FDIC remain committed to working with you towards      a stronger financial system. This amendment will be an      important step in accomplishing this goal.       If you have further questions or comments, please do not      hesitate to contact me or Paul Nash, Deputy for External      Affairs.           Sincerely,                                                   Sheila C. Bair,                                                         Chairman.
