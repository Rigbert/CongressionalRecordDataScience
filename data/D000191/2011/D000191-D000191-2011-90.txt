 We're being blackmailed by the Government of Brazil, and so we are giving precious U.S. taxpayer dollars, $147 million, to Brazil for their cotton farmers while I have got small farmers going broke. Now, come on.  And now we hear from the gentleman from Georgia, well, that's what the law says. Hey, you just repealed health care. You can change the farm bill. We can do away with these obscene subsidies, $3.4 billion bilked from U.S. taxpayers going to subsidize cotton farmers, who use subsidized water on top of that, whose total crop value was $4 billion. So $3.4 billion of it is our taxpayer subsidy. This is indefensible.  Take this step now, and then next week you can repeal the farm bill and replace that.
