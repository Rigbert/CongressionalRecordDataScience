President. I am introducing today the Transportation Extension Act of 2003 which will extend the expiring Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century an additional 5 months. Senators, Jeffords, Bond, Warner, Voinovich, Crapo, Chafee, Cornyn, Murkowski, Thomas, and Allard join me as original cosponsors on this short-term extension.  As my colleagues may be aware, we are now 7 days from the expiration of TEA-21. Despite the best efforts of Senator Bond and myself, we have been unable to secure the necessary floor time for consideration of a comprehensive 6-year bill.  This bill provide 5 months worth of the $35.5 billion allowed under the Budget Resolution and a corresponding amount of obligation limitation. This is a significant, 7-percent increase in highway funding over 2003, which will translate into over 100,000 new jobs.  Of course, the best thing we can do to create economic opportunity is enact a comprehensive, 6-year reauthorization. As we all know, highway bills are jobs bills. A highway bill drafted at $255 billion over 6 years as proposed by the Environment and Public Works Committee will create about two million new American jobs. This combined with the tax cuts signed by President Bush is the best stimulus the economy can receive.  Let me be very clear that my preference is that we would be completing a 6-year comprehensive bill, not working on a five-month extension, but reality is that the funding needed to do a comprehensive 6-year bill at $255 billion has not yet been identified. Because of that, I believe the best outcome for the long term program is to do a 5-month extension and continue to work on a comprehensive 6-year bill.
