 President, I want to discuss my vote on the Criag amendment that it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate act to expand access to Medical Savings Accounts.  I commend Senator Craig for offering this amendment. I support expanding access to MSAs. I recently introduced S. 1067, the Medical Savings Account Availability Act of 2001, with my colleague from new Jersey, Senator Torricelli. My support for MSAs is long standing. Senator Torricelli and I introduced in the last Congress a comparable bill to expand access to Medical Savings Accounts. I think we will improve access to MSAs with the support of Senator Craig and many other Senators, particularly on my side, who I know want to see MSAs within the reach of everyone.  As my colleagues know, I have argued during this debate that tax material should not be included in this bill. I do not consider this amendment a tax amendment because, if adopted, it would not have the effect of changing tax law.  Earlier in this debate, I sought and received agreement from the Chairman of the Finance Committee that health related tax matters will be considered at a markup of the Finance Committee in the near future. I look forward to pursuing this issue at that time.
