Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to speak on the untimely passing of Maynard Hollbrook Jackson. I was blessed to know Maynard Jackson for almost 40 years. Maynard Jackson was a wonderful human being, a gifted, brilliant politician. He was the kind of individual who was not afraid to take risks. Maynard Jackson was alwaysgetting in the way for the common good.  In 1968, moved by the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy, he ran for the United States Senate in the Democratic primary against incumbent Senator Herman Talmadge. He later made history by becoming the first African American mayor of a major southern city. His leadership as vice mayor of Atlanta and later as mayor of Atlanta for three terms transformed our city into the gateway to the New South. As mayor, Maynard Jackson emerged as a role model for other big-city mayors and younger elected officials. We often heard, if Maynard Jackson can do it, so can we. His accomplishments created a greater sense of possibility, a greater sense of hope, a greater sense of optimism.  Mr. Speaker, it is so ironic and almost eerie, really strange that Maynard Jackson's passing would happen at almost the same time as the Supreme Court's decision in support of affirmative action. He was one of the great champions for diversity, inclusion, and fairness, not just in government and business but in all areas of American life.  Perhaps Maynard Jackson's greatest accomplishment as mayor was the building of the Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. Under Maynard Jackson's leadership, Atlanta Hartsfield became one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. At one time, Atlanta Hartsfield included more minority contractors than any other airport in the country. Maynard Jackson insisted that if majority contractors were to participate in construction of the airport, so would minority contractors.  Maynard Jackson must be remembered as one of the founding fathers, not just of the new Atlanta, not just of the New South, but of the new America. He will be missed by all of the good people of Atlanta, all of the good people of Georgia, and the Nation and around the world. As mayor, he established in a profound way the sister city program. Many of our cities around the world became sister cities of the city of Atlanta. He traveled far and broad to carry the message of hope.  Mr. Speaker, my prayers are with his wife, Valerie, his children, and all members of the Jackson family. We all mourn for the family. We mourn for the citizens of Atlanta, for the citizens of Georgia, and for all of his friends.                          ____________________
