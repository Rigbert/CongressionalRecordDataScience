Chair, years ago, there were people that served in this body that denied that America should pass a Clean Water Act. Today, in many places in our country when we turn on the tap, we trust what we drink. We had to change our way of life. Yes, we had to make investments, but we produced a stronger country.  There were those who fought against the Clean Air Act. You can go back and read the Record. There are always those folks who have difficulty embracing the future.  This amendment blocks funding for the Department of Energy's Climate Model Development and Validation program. This is climate science denial at its worst.  It used to be that people said, well, it is okay that industry dumps in the water. It kind of washes everything out somewhere. Well, when the bald eagle became an endangered species, it became pretty clear that all of that pollution was causing long-term damage. Now the world's top scientists are telling us that we have a rapidly closing window to reduce our carbon pollution before the catastrophic impacts of climate change cannot be avoided.  So far, the world has already warmed by 0.9 degrees Celsius, and we are already seeing the effects of climate change. Most scientists agree that 2 degrees Celsius is the maximum amount we can warm without really dangerous tipping points, although many scientists now believe that even 2 degrees is far too much, given the effects we are already experiencing all around the world. But absent dramatic action, we are on track to warm 4 to 6 degrees Celsius by midcentury. That is more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit.  Even with the pledges to reduce carbon emissions as part of COP 21, we are still in danger of experiencing the drastic consequences of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and drought. The International Energy Agency has concluded that increased efforts are still needed--in addition to existing pledges--to stay within the 2-degree limit.  We are already seeing the devastation from climate change, including, recently, the evacuation of climate refugees from the Isle de Jean Charles near New Orleans. So you sort of think to the world you knew versus the world of the future, and you have to embrace the future, and you have to help those who are going to follow us.  There are multiple lines of evidence, including direct measurements, that life is changing. The projections that these models anticipate are critical as they provide the guideposts to understanding how quickly and how steeply the world needs to cut carbon pollution in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  The goal of the Department of Energy's Climate Model Development and Validation program is to further improve the reliability of climate models and equip policymakers and citizens with tools to predict the current and future effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, and drought.  This amendment scraps this program. It says ``no'' to enhancing the reliability of our climate models. Who wouldn't want that? It says ``no'' to investing in the security of the people of this Nation and the Nation's assets themselves. It says ``no'' to improving our understanding of how the climate is changing, and it says ``no'' to informing policymakers about the consequences of unmitigated climate change. That is absolutely irresponsible and an outcome this Nation cannot afford.  It is interesting. There is an author, Richard Louv, who has written a book, ``Last Child in the Woods.'' What it talks about is how America has become so technologically sophisticated that most people have lost a real connection to nature, especially our children, who spend 8 hours in front of a blue screen. But perhaps it is because of that technological advancement and lack of connection to nature that we do not have a population--including, perhaps, some who serve in this Chamber--that observe what nature is actually doing in her powerful force.  I would urge our colleagues to read that book and to think a little bit about reconnecting to nature, paying attention to what the temperature is of the lake near you or the ocean near you. Pay attention to what is happening in our coastal communities. Pay attention to what is happening in agriculture and our ability to produce food for the future because of changes in weather.  What is happening with rainfall? There is a lot going on. What happens to clouds in your region of the country? How close do they come to the Earth? When the rain falls, how severe are those weather events? These events are happening around our country and around our world.  Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition, obviously, to this amendment and urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment because I don't think it leads us into the future. I think it takes us back into the past, to a world that does not exist anymore.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1845
