President, I would like to take this opportunity to thankSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski for including funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] Fund in the fiscal year 1996 omnibus appropriations bill.  The CDFI Fund is a key priority for President Clinton. Its inclusion in title I indicates an honest effort by Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski to address the President's concerns by providing real dollars for the programs important to the administration. If more disagreements had been resolved with this level of cooperation and compromise, we would be debating a bill today that the President would be eager to sign.  President Clinton and Vice President Gore campaigned in 1992 to create a new partnership with the private sector to revitalize economically distressed communities. The President and Vice President spoke passionately about their vision for supporting local community development banks. After the election of 1992, both Republicans and Democrats in the last Congress turned the President's vision into ground-breaking legislation that created the CDFI Fund. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously and was approved by a 410-to-12 vote in the House.  Unfortunately, previous fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills terminated the CDFI Fund before even giving this program a chance to succeed. That was a shortsighted mistake, and one that this bill corrects.  The fund is a small but very innovative program. For a modest $50 million budget, the fund has the potential to make a significant impact in distressed communities.  How would CDFI succeed in areas where more traditional financing has failed?  The fund would create a permanent, self-sustaining network of financial institutions that would be dedicated to serving distressed communities. These financial institutions include a fast-growing industry of specialized financial service providers--community development financial institutions. The fund would also provide incentives for banks and thrifts to increase their community development activities and invest in CDFI's.  The CDFI Fund's initiatives would be an innovative departure from traditional community development programs because they leverage significant private sector resources. The Department of Commerce estimates that every $1 of fund resources would leverage up to $10 in non-Federal resources. And these locally controlled CDFI's would be able to respond more quickly and effectively to market-building opportunities than traditional community development organizations.  I would like to share with you two examples from my own State of the potential benefits of the CDFI program. The Vermont Development Credit Union [VDCU] is an innovative depository institution providing counseling-based financing and other banking services to moderate and low-income Vermonters since its inception in 1989. Located in Vermont's only Enterprise Community, the credit union is uniquely positioned to provide credit to the State's neediest residents. VDCU is applying for CDFI funding to help them make long-term loans for affordable housing, expand small business lending, and develop partnerships with other service providers to find creative solutions to community development financing.  Another Vermont organization hoping to participate in the CDFI program is the Vermont Community Loan Fund [VCLF]. This statewide nonprofit community development financial intermediary has been providing flexible financing and technical assistance to low-income Vermonters for almost a decade. Financial assistance from the CDFI Fund will allow the VCLF to make long-term loans for affordable housing, undertake new initiatives such as lines of credit for nonprofit organizations, and develop a viable small-scale equity product for Vermont's smaller businesses.  Access to credit is a significant hurdle for low-income Vermonters and small business start-ups in rural areas. The Vermont Development Credit Union and the Vermont Community Loan Fund have proposals that would address these needs in many parts of Vermont. All that is lacking is the capital that the CDFI program can provide.  The CDFI Fund is an idea that could bring real growth and improvements to our most disadvanted communities. I congratulate Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond on giving the program the chance to succeed.                          ____________________
