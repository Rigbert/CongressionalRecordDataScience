Speaker, I want to thank my friend the distinguished ranking member from Baltimore for his remarks. I also want to thank him for his outstanding service on this subcommittee. He brings a perspective that is critical to the subcommittee and his leadership I think will redound to the benefit of Federal employees for years to come. I thank him for all his work and leadership.  I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida. The gentleman from Florida brings, in my opinion, a new perspective to the chairmanship of this subcommittee, a perspective that is a positive one and I too think that that will also redound to the benefit of Federal employees. And so I thank him for his leadership and service on this committee.                              {time}  1230  Mr. Speaker, this measure before us would allow activity and retired Federal employees, military personnel and their spouses to purchase long-term care insurance as a group.  I do not see her here on the floor, but I wanted to make some comments as well about my colleague, the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella). She has played a critical role in the formulation of this particular piece of legislation that is important to Federal employees and she has an appreciation for the long-term care costs and the challenges that families face. I want to congratulate her for her efforts.  The advantages of pooling, Mr. Speaker, incorporated in this bill for the Federal workforce is significant. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that using the leverage of a risk pool this size could drive down the costs of insurance as much as 15 percent to 20 percent. My colleagues often hear me say that it is incumbent on the Federal Government to be a model employer, whether it be in pay, benefits or diversity, I think that it is critical that the Federal Government be a standard for other employers to emulate.  Mr. Speaker, hopefully, other employers will follow our lead in this legislation and start providing this benefit because it makes such a difference and is such an important area.  In the Washington metropolitan area, Mr. Speaker, the costs of long-term care can exceed $50,000 per year, average at least $3,000 to $3,500 a year, well beyond the means of almost every family; I do not mean poor families, almost every family will find this cost too much for them.  This bill gives families some measure of security, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Scarborough), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella), and others who have worked so hard to bring this matter to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend for yielding me the time.
