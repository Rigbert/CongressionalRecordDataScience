 President, I am very proud today to introduce legislation designed to help small businesses hurt by the power crisis in the Western United States.  This bill authorizes funds for the Economic Development Administration to operate a revolving loan fund to assist small business owners in California and other States affected by the shortage.  This fund will help dozens of small manufacturers with so-called ``interruptible contracts'' that have been forced to lay off employees and, in many cases, close their doors.  Interruptible contracts are defined as price discounts to users who agree toreduce consumption during peak demand periods.  But while companies can withstand infrequent power interruptions, the fact is that California has been hit hard by the electricity crisis and the service interruptions have come far too frequently.  Today, even small business owners who chose not to join the interruptible list--and opted instead to brave the higher gas and electric bills--have found the price spikes too much to handle.  Sadly, many of these firms have discovered that they too are being forced to shut down because they can't pay their electricity bills. Here are a few examples of companies that have been affected:  A small business owner in San Diego operating a fluff-and-fold laundry facility was forced to close when his December electricity bill jumped fourfold to $4,000. At this time last year, his monthly bill was roughly $1,000.  The Saint-Gobain Calmar company--a plastics manufacturer in Los Angeles with roughly 300 employees--has been forced to stop production 22 times in the past six months because of the business' ``interruptible'' status. Although the company has been able to avoid layoffs up to now, the owners say the outlook is not good.  Another example is the McKoen and Associates potato-flake plant in Tulelake, California. The owner of the facility says he may be forced to lay off about 100 employees permanently due to the mandatory shut downs.  While all California companies, both large and small, are feeling the crunch of the power shortage, smaller firms are taking a larger hit because these companies pay a larger percentage of their budgets to energy and gas bills.  Small businesses, classified as those with 500 workers or fewer, employ 37 percent of the California's total workforce.  This current power drain has led to higher costs for businesses throughout the Northwest.  Some aluminum and paper manufacturers in Washington and Oregon have already been forced out of business--and they are not alone.  The bill I am introducing today authorizes $25 million for a revolving no-interest loan fund to be operated by the Economic Development Administration.  The bill allows small businesses, as defined by the Small Business Administration to be eligible for loans if their monthly gas or electric bills are at least double what they were a year ago.  If a company's gas bill, for example, was $4,000 in the months of January, February, and March 2001 and the company averaged only $2,000 in January, February, and March 2000, that company is eligible for a loan.  The legislation will allow small business customers of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, or San Diego Gas and Electric who are not covered by a State-mandated cap to apply for the no-interest loans to stave off lay offs, re-hire employees, and keep their facilities up and running.  Small business that were covered by a State cap on energy expenses will not be eligible for the loan program.  The bill is designed to help both small business owners who opted for the ``interruptible list'' and those who tried to brave the cost spikes and failed.  The legislation will not affect those who are not covered by a State mandated program that caps retail electric commodity rates.  I believe this measure will be of great assistance to the hundreds of small businesses in the Western region that are facing skyrocketing costs for power.  I urge my colleagues to join me on this important legislation to help keep these hard working businessmen and women from being forced to lay off employees and close their doors.                                 ______                                       By
