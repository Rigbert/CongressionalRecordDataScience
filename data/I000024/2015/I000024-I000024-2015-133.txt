I say to my good friend that I am concerned about that.  As the Senator from Michigan knows, there are several titles in this bill. I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is about 90 percent of the bill. But what the Senator is referring to here is in the banking title of the bill.  I understand--and I can't say this for certain--that there are a couple of amendments that address this. One amendment may be that of the Senator from Michigan.
