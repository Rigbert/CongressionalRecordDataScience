 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Ralph Boling, a fine Kentuckian who passed away at the age of 76 on September 27, 2004.  Mr. Boling, a native of Hancock County, KY, dedicated his life to serving others. His service began with a stint in the U.S. Army. After protecting his country, he returned to his beloved Hancock County and served as an auctioneer, an oil-well driller, the Hancock County road foreman, and the superintendent of the Hawesville Water Works.  In 1970, Mr. Boling was elected sheriff of Hancock County. He served until 1973, was reelected to a second term in 1978, and served until 1981. By taking this post, Mr. Boling was continuing a family tradition: Both his father, Claude, and his mother, Leva, had previously served as Hancock County sheriff. President Ronald Reagan then appointed Mr. Boling to serve as the United States Marshal for the western Kentucky district, a post he held for 12 years.  Mr. Boling resigned as a U.S. Marshal to run for judge-executive of Hancock County. On November 2, 1993, he defeated the two-term incumbent with over 58 percent of the vote; he carried each of the county's eight precincts as well as absentee ballots. During his 5-year tenure, Mr. Boling worked tirelessly with people across party lines to put the community first. He successfully closed the county's landfill and pushed for the creation of the county's career center. Thanks to Mr. Boling, the Hancock County Career Center is a resource for job opportunities, worker training and continuing education today.  Mr. Boling's proud family tradition of public service continues with his granddaughter, LeAnn Crosby, who works as a field representative in my Bowling Green, KY, office.  His dedication to the Hancock County community went beyond a career choice. He was a member of Hancock Lodge No. 115 and served various positions in the organization. He was a member of the Fraternal Order of Police and was active within the Blackford Baptist Church. And one of his greatest passions was rooting for my alma mater, the University of Louisville basketball team.  Today I ask my colleagues to joining me in paying tribute to the life of Mr. Ralph Boling. He will be missed by his family, his friends and constituents in Hancock County, and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
