 We are anxious to get to work here. In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to meet on January 7, tomorrow, for the purpose of hearing testimony on the Keystone Pipeline; that the meeting be chaired by Senator Murkowski, with Senator Cantwell as ranking member; that the following Senators not currently serving on the committee be considered Members of the committee for the purpose of this meeting: Senators Daines, Cassidy, Gardner, Capito, Hirono, King, and Warren; I further ask that the meeting be considered to comport with all Senate rules relating to the conduct of committees and that customary and authorized expenses be permitted.
