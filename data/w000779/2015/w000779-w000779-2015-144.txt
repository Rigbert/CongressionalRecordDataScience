President, most of us have heard the metaphor that small businesses are the engines that power our economy. What we don't hear people talk about as much is the fuel that feeds the engines: capital. Without capital, entrepreneurs cannot see their ideas to fruition, successful business owners cannot expand to meet the needs of the market, and eager job seekers must take their skills elsewhere. Without capital, Main Street falters.  Today, more than 7 years after the start of the Great Recession and many policy reforms later, access to capital remains a challenge that stands in the way of small business growth, economic development and job creation in Oregon and across the country. Despite this, government regulation continues to tie the hands of many potential lenders; namely, credit unions. According to some estimates, credit unions could lend an additional $16 billion to small businesses, helping them create nearly 150,000 new jobs in just 1 year if Congress loosened restraints on credit union business lending.  With this in mind, I am pleased to introduce today the Credit Union Residential Loan Parity Act, which would increase access to capital by exempting certain loans from the member business lending cap imposed on credit unions. Currently, loans made for one- to four-person, non-owner occupied housing are treated as business loans when they are made by credit unions. As such, these types of loans count against a credit union's business lending cap, and thereby limit a credit union's ability to provide loans to small businesses. My legislation would address this issue by allowing credit unions to treat these types of loans as residential loans--as they are when they are made by other financial institutions--therefore exempting these loans from the business lending cap. In doing so, this legislation would increase the availability of business capital, providing greater opportunities for small businesses to receive credit union loans to help them continue to grow and expand, create jobs and support our local economies.  I am hopeful that this legislation will be received by colleagues for what it is: a simple step to help ensure America's small businesses have access to the fuel they need to power our economy. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1440       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Credit Union Residential      Loan Parity Act''.     SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF A NON-OWNER OCCUPIED 1- TO 4-FAMILY                    DWELLING.       (a) Removal From Member Business Loan Limitation.--Section      107A(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C.      1757a(c)(1)(B)(i)) is amended by striking ``that is the      primary residence of a member''.       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the      amendment made by this Act shall preclude the National Credit      Union Administration from treating an extension of credit      that is fully secured by a lien on a 1- to 4-family dwelling      that is not the primary residence of a member as a member      business loan for purposes other than the member business      loan limitation requirements under section 107A of the      Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757a).                                 ______                                       By
