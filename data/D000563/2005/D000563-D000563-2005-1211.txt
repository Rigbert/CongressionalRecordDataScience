The Food and Drug Administration does this. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is involved in this testing to determine whether there is pesticide residue on apples and tomatoes, vegetables and fruits that come in. And if there is just the slightest residue of certain pesticides, we confiscate the shipment, stop the shipment from coming into the United States for fear that just the slightest residue of the pesticide or the fruits and vegetables may be a danger to public health in America.  That is why it is so difficult for many of us who listen to this debate to understand that at the same time another agency of our Government, with the cooperation of a special interest group, the pesticide industry, is actually testing concentrations of these same pesticides on innocent people in America.  I think the Senator has gone on to say it is not just college students standing and being paid $15. The testing reaches a level where they are testing on fetuses and on neonates of uncertain viability?
