 President, later this week Senators will have an opportunity to do three big things with a single vote.  By voting for the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act that will soon come over from the House, Senators will be able to extend the temporary tax relief working Americans continue to need nearly 3 years into this administration, prevent more job losses in the middle of a jobs crisis by blocking a new regulation on U.S. manufacturers, and facilitate the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs through the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. One vote, three accomplishments. That is to say nothing of the other things the bill would do such as the doc fix and unemployment insurance.  My suggestion is that once this legislation comes over from the House, we pass it without delay. Based on the merits of the bill, it should be a strong bipartisan vote. Nothing could be more bipartisan right now than preventing job loss or facilitating the creation of new private sector jobs.  The President has said job creation is his top priority. Here is a bill that helps him achieve it without a dime of taxpayer money. The President says he wants to extend the payroll tax extension. Here is a bill that does it. The President says he wants unemployment insurance extended. This bill does that. The President says he wants the two parties to compromise. This is it. There is no reason this legislation shouldn't have the President's enthusiastic support.  The only reason--the only reason--for Democrats to oppose this job-creating bill would be to gain some political advantage at a time when every one of them says job creation is a top priority.  Here is what the junior Senator from West Virginia, a Democrat, had to say just today about the pipeline measure contained in the House bill:       I'm for the Keystone Pipeline. All the trade unions,      everyone's for it. It creates thousands of jobs.  I couldn't say it better.  The House actually had a stand-alone vote on the Keystone XL back in July. Forty-seven House Democrats voted for it. I would suggest to my friends on the other side that they join with us and close out the year on a bipartisan note.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was written to appeal to both parties, and I have yet to hear anyone on the other side offer a single good reason for opposing it. So far, the only reason Democrats have given for opposing this bill is that they would rather extend the payroll tax cut on its own without adding language about a pipeline that many of them say they support anyway. So evidently they would vote for both these things separately but not together. That makes absolutely no sense.  Look, you are either for this pipeline project and the jobs that would come with it or you are not. If you are for it, there is no reason to oppose it just because it is not offered as a stand-alone measure. That doesn't make any sense.  It is time to stop the posturing. Here is a bill that contains top priorities from both sides. Let's take it up and pass it without any more theatrics. Let's pass this job-creating bill and give Americans the certainty and the jobs they deserve.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
