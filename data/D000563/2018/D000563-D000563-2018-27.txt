President, on November 28, Quincy, IL, lost a legend in Coach John ``Jack'' Butler Mackenzie at the age of 77. Jack was the architect of an amazing soccer program at Quincy University. He led the Franciscan school's soccer program to nine National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, NAIA, National Championships and 516 victories, making him the tenth all-time in NCAA history for wins, regardless of division. He did all of this while setting examples as a coach, a father, grandfather, and leader.  Jack was born on February 26, 1941, to John ``Scottie'' and Mary Jane Mackenzie. He attended McBride High School in 1959 and earned a scholarship to play football at the University of Missouri. After a year, Jack left to attend Washington University in St. Louis, earning both a bachelor's degree in physical education and a master's in education.  Jack married his high school sweetheart, Sharon Bechtold, in June of 1962. He enjoyed telling people that he fell in love with her in sixth grade. Jack worked at Augustinian Academy in St. Louis and was on the cusp of making a big decision.  In 1969, at the urging of his best friend, Frank Longo, who introduced soccer to Quincy, Jack moved from St. Louis to run the Quincy University soccer program. QU had already wontwo NAIA national championships in the program's first 5 years of existence when Jack arrived, but the QU Hawks reached new levels of success under Jack.  Jack's Hawks finished in the top three in the national tournament 12 times, including nine championships. They won five consecutive titles from 1977 to 1981. During his four-decade career, Jack won the NAIA National Coach of the Year four times. Thirty one All-American athletes came out of his program.  Jack loved the game of soccer, and soccer's popularity in Quincy exploded. The Quinsippi Soccer League formed in the late 1960s, helping young kids learn about soccer in elementary school. Jack helped teach adults who volunteered to coach the league, offered practice drills and strategies for helping boys and girls learn the game.  With QU's success, the school moved to NCAA Division I in 1984 and then to Division II in 1995, joining the Great Lakes Valley Conference. Quincy University didn't dominate as they did in the early days of Jack's tenure, but they regularly made the playoffs and had winning records.  In 2011, Jack's Hawks won the Great Lakes Valley Conference for the first time since joining the conference. It was Jack's last season coaching the team full time. It wasn't the biggest victory he had ever had, but it was one he loved like the others.  In retirement, Jack remained active in the community. He helped out with Special Olympics teams. He rarely missed a home game of QU's soccer team. Jack was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame, NCAA Hall of Fame, United Soccer Coaches Hall of Fame, St. Louis Players, and QU Hall of Fame. Legends Stadium, where QU plays soccer, has its playing surface named after Jack.  Jack Mackenzie had a gift for storytelling and the ability to make someone's day more enjoyable. He loved his ``beautiful game,'' the kids who learned from him, and his family. His best story was really his own. When kids play on Jack Mackenzie field, it will be remembered as a game based on love.  Jack is survived by his wife of 56 years, Sharon, and six children--Scott; Christopher, wife Leigh, and their children, Julian and Isabella; Kevin, wife Susan, and their sons, Andrew, Tyler, and Luke; Brian, wife Bonnie, and their children, Kate and Jack; Beth Hilbing, husband Chad, and their children Jake, Grace, and Sam; and Megan Henke, husband Adam, and their daughter, Genevieve.                          ____________________
