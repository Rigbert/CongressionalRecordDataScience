Mr. Chairman, as the author of H.R. 1675, I am pleased that the House is considering this important legislation, which would be the first comprehensive reform of our refuge law since the enactment of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966.  I am also grateful that the author of that historic law, Congressman John Dingell, and a number of other distinguished Members including the cochairman of the House Sportsmen's Caucus, Pete Geren, and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, Jim Saxton, have joined with me in this bipartisan effort.
