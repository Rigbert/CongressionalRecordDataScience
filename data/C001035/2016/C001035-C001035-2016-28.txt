President, earlier today the Senate held a cloture vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, a bill that would fund military construction and veterans programs in fiscal year 2017 and provide $1.1 billion to respond to the Zika public health crisis.  There has been a great deal of misinformation on what the bill would do and which organizations and providers would be eligible to receive funding under the bill. I would like to ask a question of the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, who helped to write the Zika funding package.  Is it accurate to say that family planning service providers that receive Medicaid reimbursement would be eligible to be reimbursed for family planning services through funding provided in this bill?
