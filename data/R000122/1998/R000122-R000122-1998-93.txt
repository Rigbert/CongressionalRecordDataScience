President, this amendment would disallow the deduction for advertising expenses for tobacco companies who violate the Food and Drug Administration rules with respect to advertising. It is a sensible and constitutionally sound way to reinforce the important provisions that are necessary to prevent easy access to smoking by teenagers. The record has shown very clearly that the history of the tobacco industry is a history of advertising that invites, entices, some would even say seduces youngsters into smoking. If we are serious about preventing teenage smoking, underage smoking, we must have effective ways to curtail the advertising to marketing that is directly targeted to youngsters in our society. The record from numerous documents released in the ongoing litigation suggest strongly, overwhelmingly that the tobacco industries have for years deliberately targeted youngsters as young as 12, 13 and 14 years old to get them to start smoking.  If we are serious about our primary goal, which is to eliminate access to smoking by underage smoker, then we must pass this amendment.  In anticipation of further debate tomorrow on this particular measure, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
