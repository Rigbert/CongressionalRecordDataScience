I appreciate that response.  Lastly, I ask my friend, one of the significant issues that will be confronting us in the coming months will be the extension of the debt limit to ensure that America continues to pay the bills that it has incurred and therefore maintain fiscal stability not only in this country but throughout the world. The Speaker and you have both made, I think, very positive comments on the fact that, as unwanted as such a vote may be, it is, nevertheless, as the Speaker pointed out, an adult vote--that I took to mean a responsible vote--to ensure the fiscal stability of our country.  Does the gentleman anticipate a clean up-or-down vote on that issue when it becomes timely to vote on that issue sometime in March of April?
