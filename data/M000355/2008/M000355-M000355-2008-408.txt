 President, I wish to take a moment to commend our new Senator from Mississippi for what we typically refer to around here as his maiden speech. He obviously has chosen a topic that is at the top of the list of concerns for the people of Mississippi and addressed them very effectively.  I also wish to say not only to the Senator from Mississippi but to his constituents, what a spectacular start he has gotten off to in the Senate. He is an active and an aggressive member of both the Armed Services Committee, which is important to his State, and the Commerce Committee as well.  I commend him for that outstanding speech today and thank him for all he is doing for the people of Mississippi.  I yield the floor.
