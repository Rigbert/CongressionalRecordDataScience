Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) for his comments. I think they were well taken, as the comments from the gentleman from Texas were well taken. And I will join him and I know the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) will as well to ensure that their fears are not realized.  Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on our side?
