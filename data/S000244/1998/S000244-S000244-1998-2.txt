Speaker, I rise in support of the point of order on the motion to recommit because it is not germane to House Resolution 611.  Clause 7 of rule XVI of the rules of the House of Representatives provides that ``no motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under color of amendment.'' Prior rulings of the House have held this provision applicable to motions to recommit with or without instructions. A motion to recommit is not in order if it would not be in order as an amendment to the underlying proposition.  The constitutional prerogatives of the House, such as impeachment and matters incidental thereto, are questions of high privilege under rule IX of the House rules.  A joint or simple resolution evincing the disapproval of the House is not a question of privilege under the rules of the House.  Furthermore, the fundamental principle of such a censure resolution is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose of an impeachment resolution.  I would point out to the Chair that the motion to recommit with instructions that is under consideration here is not even a censure motion. It is a sense of the Congress resolution, and I would refer the Chair to the last four lines of their resolution, that William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, by his conduct has brought upon himself and fully deserves the censure and condemnation of the American people and this House.  It says he deserves the censure but it does not censure him.  We have heard an awful lot about the rule of law during this debate, which I think has been one of the finest debates that the House of Representatives has had.                              {time}  1200  This is our opportunity to uphold our rules, our laws, and I would strongly urge the Chair to sustain the point of order.
