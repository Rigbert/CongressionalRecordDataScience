 There are mines in her State as well as many other States where this amendment will simply allow acres and acres of mill site waste to be dumped, with nothing back to the taxpayers.  I hope my colleagues will support me when I offer the amendment to strike the language in this bill, and I hope, as a Congress, we do what we should have done so long ago, which is to look at the 1872 mining law. If the mining companies, indeed, do need more dump sites, ask what we get in return. We should have a fair debate on the mining law. It should not just be in this Interior bill which comes to us at 5 o'clock, when we need to pass a tax bill that we want to start on tomorrow and everybody wants to finish tomorrow, forcing a bill to pass with a huge giveaway. Let's give something back, make sure we have responsible mining reform, and make sure we do it right for the taxpayers who deserve a lot better.  I appreciate the questions from the Senator from California. I will be offering my amendment in a short while. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the taxpayers, on behalf of what is right and fair for people who pay their taxes every day, for other industries to pay their royalties, to pay a fair share. Let's do the mining reform law correctly.  I thank my colleagues. I know the Senator from Illinois wants to discuss this, and I see the Senator from Nevada.
