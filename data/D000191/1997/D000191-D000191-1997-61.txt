  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we are hearing some creative accounting on the other side. They are saying American families who earn $25,000 a year do not pay taxes so they should not get a child tax credit.  They do pay taxes, and they should be entitled to a credit; a rookie cop, a beginning teacher.  But let us talk about real creative stuff on their side. They want to tax people who do not have earnings. Graduate students would have to pay taxes on their tuition waivers under a little provision they stuck into this bill.  Now if someone were a graduate student, they would give you a stipend of $300 or $400 a month, but they get a $5,000 relief from their tuition. The Republicans are saying, ``You should pay taxes on that $5,000 you don't get.'' Now what kind of opportunity is that?  This is such a bad idea that the last time this provision of law expired, I sponsored legislation to fix this problem, and even Ronald Reagan agreed that we should not charge graduate students taxes on money they do not earn. But the Republicans have stuck it in this bill to help pay for tax cuts for corporations and for the wealthy. That is outrageous.                          ____________________
