' He correctly points out that this President, unlike his predecessor, ``assiduously'' consults with home State Senators from both parties. Senate Republicans nonetheless stall confirmations virtually across the board. For example, they are filibustering the Bacharach nomination from Oklahoma and the Kayatta nomination from Maine, despite the support of Republican home state Senators.  Professor Tobias observes that the judicial nominees of President Obama are ``noncontroversial . . . of balanced temperament, who are intelligent, ethical, industrious, independent and diverse vis a vis ethnicity, gender and ideology.'' None of these characteristics or their outstanding qualifications matter to Senate Republicans intent on obstruction. The explanations that Republicans offer for their unprecedented stalling of nominees with bipartisan support, indicate that Republicans are fixated on a warped sense of partisan payback. They recognize none of the distinctions with the circumstances in 2004 when President Bush was seeking to pack the Federal courts with conservative activist ideologues and Senate Republicans ran roughshod over Senate practices and traditions. They ignore the history since 2004, the resolution of the impasse by recognition of a standard limiting filibusters only to situations of``exceptional circumstances,'' or the marked difference in the role they have been accorded by President Obama and me in connection with his judicial nominations from their home States.  After this vote, the Senate remains backlogged with 18 judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, including 13 nominations from before the August recess. They should be confirmed before the Senate adjourns for the year. If the Senate were allowed to act in the best interests of the American people, it would vote to confirm these nominees and reduce the judicial vacancies that are plaguing our Federal courts and that delay justice for the American people. Sadly, it appears that Senate Republicans will persist in the bad practices they have followed since President Obama was elected and insist on stalling nearly a dozen judicial nominees who could and should be confirmed before the Senate adjourns this month.  By this point in President Bush's first term we had reduced judicial vacancies to 28. In stark contrast, there are still close to 80 judicial vacancies today. If the Senate were allowed to confirm the 20 judicial nominations currently pending, we could take a significant step forward by filling more than one-quarter of current vacancies and could reduce vacancies around the country below 60 for the first time since President Obama took office. Even that would be twice as many vacancies as existed toward the end of President Bush's first term.  That so many judicial nominations have been delayed by Senate Republicans into this lameduck session need not prevent the Senate from doing what is right for the American people. Those who contend that it would be ``unprecedented'' to confirm long-stalled nominations in this lameduck session are wrong. The fact is that from 1980 until this year, when a lameduck session followed a presidential election, every single judicial nominee reported with bipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been confirmed. That is the precedent that Senate Republicans are breaking. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, no consensus nominee reported prior to the August recess has ever been denied a vote--before now. That is something Senate Democrats have not done in any lameduck session, whether after a presidential or midterm election.  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees, including three circuit court nominees, in the lameduck session after the elections in 2002. I remember I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who moved forward with those votes, including one on a very controversial circuit court nominee. The Senate proceeded to confirm judicial nominees in lameduck sessions after the elections in 2004 and 2006. In 2006 that included confirming another circuit court nominee. We proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in the lameduck session after the elections in 2010, including five circuit court nominees.  That is our history and recent precedent. Those who contend that judicial confirmation votes during lameduck sessions do not take place are wrong. I have urged the Senate Republican leadership to reassess its damaging tactics, but apparently in vain. Their new precedent is bad for the Senate, the Federal courts and, most importantly, for the American people.  Further, their partisan spin on the past does nothing to help fill longstanding vacancies on our Federal courts, which are in dire need of additional assistance. Arguments about past Senate practice do not help the American people obtain justice. There are no good reasons to hold up the judicial nominations currently being stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. A wrongheaded desire for partisan payback for some imagined offense from years ago is no good reason. A continuing effort to gum up the workings of the Senate and to delay Senate action on additional judicial nominees next year is no good reason.  It is past time for votes on the four circuit nominees and the other 14 district court nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. When we have consensus nominees before us who can fill judicial vacancies, especially judicial emergency vacancies, the Senate should be taking action on these nominations to help the American people. Doing so is consistent with Senate precedent, and it is right. Let us do our jobs so that all Americans can have access to justice.  John Dowdell is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. He is currently a shareholder and director at the Tulsa law firm of Norman Wohlgemuth Chandler & Dowdell, where he has worked for nearly 30 years. After law school he served as a law clerk to Judge William J. Holloway, Jr. on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. His nomination was reported nearly unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last June.  Jesus Bernal is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Since 1996 he has served as a Deputy Federal Public Defender and is currently the Directing Attorney in the Riverside Branch Office. After graduating from law school he served as a law clerk to Judge David V. Kenyon of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. His nomination was reported by voice vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee last July.  Today, we are finally being allowed to vote on two consensus nominees who were stalled for months for no good reason.                               Exhibit 1                 [From the Miami Herald, Dec. 10, 2012]               Obama, Senate Must Fill Judicial Vacancies                            (By Carl Tobias)       Now that President Obama has been reelected and Democrats      have retained a Senate majority, he must swiftly nominate,      and the upper chamber expeditiously approve, judicial      nominees, especially for the four Florida vacancies, so that      the courts can deliver justice.       On Thursday, senators confirmed 94-0 Circuit Judge Mark      Walker for the Northern District of Florida. However, the      Judiciary Committee delayed action on Circuit Judge Brian      Davis for the Middle District three times until the June 21      meeting when the panel reported Davis 10-7. The committee      also only held a September hearing for Magistrate Judge      Sherri Polster Chappell, whom President Barack Obama      nominated to the Middle District in June and finally approved      her on Thursday.       Moreover, the bench experiences 64 vacancies in the 679      district judgeships. These openings erode speedy, economical      and fair case resolution.       Observers criticized Obama for nominating too slowly in      2009, but he has since picked up the pace. The chief      executive assiduously consulted Republican and Democratic      senators from states where vacancies occurred before      nominations. He has suggested noncontroversial nominees of      balanced temperament, who are intelligent, ethical,      industrious, independent and diverse vis-a-vis ethnicity,      gender and ideology.       Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the      Judiciary Committee, has rapidly set hearings and votes,      sending nominees to the floor where many have languished. For      instance, the Senate recessed September 22 without      considering 19 excellent nominees; most enjoyed strong      committee votes.       Republicans should cooperate better. The major problem has      been the Senate floor. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the      Republican Minority Leader, has rarely agreed to ballots,      invoking unanimous consent, which allows one senator to halt      votes. Especially troubling has been Republican refusal to      vote on qualified consensus nominees, inaction that      contravenes Senate custom. When senators have cast ballots,      they overwhelmingly confirmed most nominees.       The 64 district vacancies are crucial. The Middle and      Southern District each experience two. Obama has nominated 33      highly competent prospects nationwide. The President      nominated Judge Davis and Judge Walker during February and      Judge Chappell in June. Obama must quickly propose candidates      for the 31 openings without nominees. Senators approved Judge      Walker because he is well qualified. The chamber failed to      consider the other similarly qualified Florida nominee, Judge      Davis, before recessing in September but must vote on him in      the lame duck session that began November 13. The committee      reported Judge Davis in June 10-7 with Senator Lindsey      Graham, R-S.C., not voting. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas,      voted against. He ``had a concern about some intemperate      language that dates back to 1995 in what otherwise appears to      be an unblemished record'' and would ``keep an open mind.''       Judge Davis was held over thrice at the request of Senator      Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking member, who appeared      concerned about Davis' answers in the May hearing and to      later written questions. On June 21, Grassley voiced concern      about Davis' perspectives respecting a few issues,      particularly implicating race, and voted No.     Now that the committee has reported Judge Chappell, the      Senate must quickly consider her, while the chamber should      expeditiously process Circuit Judge William Thomas, whom      Obama nominated for one Southern District vacancy November      14.       The administration should keep closely conferring with      Florida Senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio, who expressed      strong support for Walker, Davis, Chappell and Thomas, and      soon propose a fine nominee for the Southern District opening      created November 16 when Judge Patricia Seitz assumed senior      status. The Senate, for its part, must speedily process that      nominee.       The 64 vacancies undermine the delivery of justice.      Accordingly, President Obama must swiftly nominate, and      senators promptly approve, numerous excellent judges now that      senators have reconvened for their lame duck session.
