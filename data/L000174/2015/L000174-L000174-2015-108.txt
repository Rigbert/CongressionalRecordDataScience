President, last week more than 25 million Americans watched the U.S. women's soccer team win for the third time soccer's most coveted title--the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. This thrilling victory was the most widely viewed women's soccer game in our Nation's history. Americans are proud of this impressive victory, and we applaud these world-class athletes for their contributions to our Nation's legacy.  Anybody walking down the road by our farm house the night of the soccer game--we had our windows open--would have heard Marcelle and I screaming with joy at the victory.  But as the celebrations fade, we should all be troubled by the way FIFA discriminates against some of the teams that compete in the World Cup. The U.S. women's team will receive $2 million for winning the Women's World Cup. The 2014 men's World Cup winner was awarded $35 million. In fact, men's teams that lost in the first round of the 2014 men's World Cup were awarded $8 million--four times more than the champion U.S. women's team. The reason for this extreme disparity? Gender.  So today, I am introducing a Senate resolution that calls on FIFA to immediately eliminate this discriminatory prize award structure. Opponents of equal prize awards in sports point to revenue as the reason behind this disparity. But revenue should not be and cannot be accepted as a means for discrimination. In fact, they ought to ask this: How many people watched the women's soccer team? Most teams would give anything to have that viewership.  The 24 women's teams that took part in FIFA's tournament are role models--not just to women and girls but to men and boys across the globe. The World Cup champions should be rewarded for their performance, for their grit, and for their teamwork, rather than devalued for their gender.  Nelson Mandela, a person I met often and admired, once said: ``Sport has the power to change the world.'' Well, sports bring us together in our communities and on the global stage. They remind us what we have in common, they inspire us to dream, and they push beyond every boundary.  This weekend, millions of people watched American tennis star Serena Williams win the women's final at Wimbledon, marking her sixth championship at the All England Club. The next day, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic won the men's final on the very same court. Both of these athletes competed against the very best players in the world, and they were awarded the very same amount of prize money for their impressive victories. This is because Wimbledon chose to be on the right side of history in 2007 by ensuring pay equity for female and male athletes. For years, tennis champions such as Billie Jean King and Venus Williams fought for equal treatment for the future champions of their sport.  I hope the story of the American Women's World Cup champions not receiving fair treatment will inspire more people to join the fight for equal prize awards. With the resolution I introduce today, let the Senate be on record in support of fair treatment for all World Cup champions as we urge FIFA to change its policy, just as the All England Club did years ago.  The fight for gender equality continues and is a fight worth winning. In 2009, I proudly voted for passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify the statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination. And I supported Senator Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, which would ensure that all Americans receive equal pay for equal work.  We have had a lot of civil rights fights in our Nation's history. The battle for true equality has persisted for too long. Let's join together. Let's send a powerful message of equality to those who aspire to one day become a champion. Equal pay for equal work should no longer be an ideal, but instead the reality for all.                          ____________________
