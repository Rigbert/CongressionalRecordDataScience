 President, I am pleased to vote for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act because it will open the doors of college to more students across the country. I want to commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this bill. I have been honored to work with him and the other members of the committee to produce this comprehensive solution.  In response to the recent student loan scandals, this bill reforms the student loan process so that it puts the interests of students first and makes the system more transparent. To help address rising college costs, this bill takes a number of steps to increase user-friendly information available to students and parents about college costs. I am also pleased that this bill will make it easier for students to apply for financial aid by replacing the current 10-page application with a new 2-page version. This bill offers more help for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Specifically, it strengthens TRIO programs to make students more prepared for higher education. It also expands and improves GEAR UP programs, which are a critical tool to help guide and prepare disadvantaged students for high school graduation and college enrollment.  I am especially pleased that the bill includes my proposal to train math and literacy coaches in colleges of education. As I have been working to improve our schools, I have recognized that we need to provide additional support to students in math and reading. By addressing those areas, we can improve the graduation rate and help students graduate prepared for college and careers. When I introduced the PASS Act, S. 611, earlier this year, I included reading and math coaches as a key way to improve the graduation rate. I am pleased that this higher education reauthorization includes a grants program that will help train those coaches, so we have a ready pipeline of qualified coaches to address these critical areas.
