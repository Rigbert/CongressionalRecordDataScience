President, I bring this to the attention of the Senate to highlight not only this moment in the Senate's history, but also to note that qualifications and hard work do count. Although no longer working for the Senate, McKinley Wise has continued to use his skills over the past 20 years and is currently working in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about opportunity and providing every American the same chance at life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hard work is the key to success, but people need the opportunity to perform. The Senate gave that opportunity to Mac Wise in 1978, and both are better for it.                             Exhibit No. 1  Former U.S. District Court Reporter, First Black Reporter on Senate                                  Floor       February 24, 1978, was the day a dream came true. McKinley      (Mac) Wise, a former Official Court Reporter in the United      States Court in Philadelphia, Pa., had long dreamed that some      day he would have the honor and privilege of being the first      black court reporter to serve on the Senate floor--but he      thought it was just another of his dreams.       G. Russell Walker, Chief Reporter, Official Reporters of      Debates, United States Senate, had Mac's name on his list of      highly qualified reporters to call upon in an emergency. He      made that call to Mac on February 24, inquiring whether Mac      could report for temporary duty in connection with the      expected lengthy debate on the Panama Canal Treaties.       Mac lost no time in rearranging the busy schedule of his      reporting firm, McKinley Wise & Associates, Inc., of      Philadelphia, and four days after the call he was on his way      to achieving another ``first'' in his long career of      ``firsts.''       When he arrived at the Office of the Official Reporters of      Debates, Mac was cordially greeted by all of the reporters,      transcribers, and staff, and before he knew what was      happening, he was there--on the Senate floor--with his      Stenograph machine.       A feeling of awe came over Mac when he realized that here      he was at last, sitting among this august and distinguished      body of United States Senators. At first, Mac had a      supervisor beside him, identifying the speakers, and      explaining the procedures. Mac said, ``I was able to conquer      the words spoken, but when it came to putting them into the      proper format, it was an art to which I had never been      exposed. In the beginning I felt inept, but said to myself,      `The job must do done', and I did it.''       Everything went along smoothly until the arrival of Morning      Business, which was somewhat like taking pleas before a      magistrate. The proceedings go very rapidly, because it is      usually routine to the lawmakers, with deviations coming      later in the office where proper headlines and sub-headlines      are inserted.       Mac said that the cooperation of his colleagues overwhelmed      him, and that their knowledge on just about any subject was      astounding. No one was ever too busy to take time to answer      any question that Mac had.       Mac said, ``I think that being the first black reporter on      the Senate floor, especially at a time when a debate of      critical importance to the country was taking place, is      something which I will never forget. It isn't often that one      of your wildest dreams comes true.''       Mr. Walker, Chief Reporter of the Official Reporters of      Debates, confirmed the fact that McKinley Wise was the first      black or any other minority reporter to serve on the Senate      floor. Walker said that, to his knowledge, no black or      minority reporter has yet served on the floor of the House.       When asked how he came to call Mac Wise, Mr. Walker      replied, ``We had before the Senate in late January the      Panama Canal treaties, and there was a very good possibility      of the Senate having 12 and 14-hour-a-day sessions, and we      needed more reporters. I went through our file and saw      McKinley Wise's name. He was well-certified, with all of the      certificates, well-qualified, and he seemed to have a good      background.       ``I asked for and received authority to call him, which I      did, to see if he could come down and assist us. It was a      Friday when I called Mac, asking if he could come in the      following Tuesday. Not many reporters could leave their      business and come to Washington on short notice, but Mac was      there, and he did a magnificent job.''       Mr. Walker went on to say, ``Ordinarily, when someone comes      into this office as one of the Official Reporters of Debates,      he or she is given great in-depth training in all of our      forms, and parliamentary procedures, Senate rules, and so      forth. I didn't give Mac any of that. We just wanted somebody      to write, and write fast, because this is the kind of debate      where there was not at that time a lot of parliamentary      procedure going on; it was mostly stand-up, straight, hot and      heavy debate.       ``As I said before, he did a magnificent job.''       Mac was born in Jeanrette, Louisiana, but with his parents      moved to Port Arthur, Texas, at a very early age. He was      graduated from Lincoln High School there, after which he      served in the United States Navy, where he was given a      stenomask reporting in order to report courts-martial and      other related proceedings. Mac found the stenomask      unsatisfactory, and while in the Navy started studying      stenotype at the Certified School of Stenotype in San      Francisco, California, completing his course after being      discharged from the Navy.       Since then Mac Wise has had a varied reporting career,      involving free lance work in New York City, substituting in      many of the courts in New York City; serving as an assistant      in the Philadelphia County courts,     free-lancing in Philadelphia, before becoming an Official      Court Reporter in the United States District Court in      Philadelphia, where he served the Hon. Charles R. Weiner and      the Hon. J. William Ditter, Jr., from 1967 to 1975.       Mac left his official job to return to the free lance      field, and is now the owner of McKinley Wise and Associates,      Inc., with a staff of seven certified reporters. Daily copy      is the specialty of the firm.       During the time when Mac was reporting in the Federal      courts in Philadelphia, he was a member of USCRA. He is a      member of PSRA and NSRA. Mac is now serving NSRA as Chairman      of the Free Lance Committee, as a member of the Advisory      Committee, Professional Examination Service, the Committee on      Testing, and the Ad Hoc Committee for Professional Standards.       Mac is the holder of the following certificates from NSRA,      RPR, CP, CM, and in Pennsylvania holds the CSR certificate,      as well as being a Qualifier in the PSRA Speed Contest at 280      wpm.       USCRA is proud of the fact that one of its former members      has achieved the distinction of being the first of his race      to serve on the floor of the Senate.                          ____________________
