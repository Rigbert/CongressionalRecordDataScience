Louise Slaughter was not just a Congresswoman and Rules Committee Chair and Ranking Member. She was a respected colleague and a dear friend. She and I served together for more than thirty years in this House, and I will always remember her for her tenacity, her confidence, and her determination to make the American Dream attainable for everyone in this country.  Louise's drive to fight for better conditions for working people in New York and in our country can be traced to her childhood. The daughter of a blacksmith from a Kentucky coal mining town, she grew up with a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by those working hard and trying to make it in America. Those experiences shaped her as a legislator in her adopted home of upstate New York, where she fought to ensure that communities had safe drinking water, clean air, and economic opportunities.  In Congress, Louise dedicated herself to these same causes while promoting human rights and freedom abroad. We served together on the Helsinki Commission at the end of the Cold War, and I fondly recall traveling with her to the former Soviet Union, where we shared the experience of meeting with leaders and citizens of the newly independent states yearning to embrace American-style democratic institutions. I got to know her late husband Bob on those journeys and remember him fondly as well.  Back home, Louise made a difference for our country in Congress, serving as the Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Rules Committee. In that position, she helped shape nearly every piece of legislation passed when Democrats held the Majority from 2007 to 2011, including the Recovery Act, Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and student loan reforms. Working Americans owe Louise Slaughter a debt of gratitude for being their champion and fighting so hard over the years on their behalf.  As we remember Louise, let us remember her for the courage she displayed, for her indefatigable nature, and for her wisdom and wit. I join with my colleagues in marking the one-year anniversary of her passing, and I extend once more my condolences to her family. I thank Rep. Tonko for leading the House's tribute, and I thank Rep. Morelle for continuing his predecessor's commitment to outstanding service for the people of New York's Twenty-Fifth District.                          ____________________
