Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. I include in the Record remarks by Luna Aguilar. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.              March For Our Lives Remarks by Luna Aguilar       Every month, every week, every day we hear about a hate-     filled person, usually a white-supremacist man, getting a gun      to kill others without mercy. We are here today because the      shooting at Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida hurts all      of us, and we will not take this anymore!       The students who were murdered in Florida, and many more      who are killed by gun violence throughout our country, had      dreams to fulfill in the rest of their lives. They were      robbed of their dreams because our country allows nineteen-     year-olds to legally own weapons of destruction, and we let      one man kill seventeen innocent lives. Teachers and faculty      at schools across the country have given up their lives to      protect their students from mass murderers, and now that is      their legacy. But they should not have to be mourned as      martyrs. They should be remembered as teachers, heroes who      educated the future generation.       We, as a nation, have decided that we value gun ownership      without adequate background checks, without limits, more than      the lives of our youth. But we, the youth, the future of our      country, are deciding, right here, right now, that our lives      are worth more than the right to own an assault weapon.       This same outrage should have pushed a change of policy on      guns after Columbine, Sandy Hook, Orlando, and Las Vegas.      This outrage should have supported the victims of excessive      police force in Ferguson. Stephon Clark was shot twenty times      in his grandmother's yard while unarmed just two days ago.      Are we speaking up for him too? This outrage should be heard      in response to the deaths of immigrants at the hands of      border patrol agents. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants,      members of the LGBTQIA community are all subject to gun      violence in our neighborhoods, and we must speak up for them      too. This will not be an exclusive fight. We are targeted      because of the color of our skin, because of our religion,      because of who we are. Undocumented immigrants already fear      having their families torn apart by ICE, and they also fear      of dying at the hands of an extremist. Marginalized women      also fear for their lives. We will not live in fear any      longer!       We must not succumb to fear and make our schools into      prison-like settings. We cannot arm our teachers. We cannot      fill our schools with officers that feed the school to prison      pipeline! More guns and more oppression is not the answer. I      am trained in Alternatives to Violence. This is an      international program that started right here in New York      state prisons to address violence in a compassionate way. In      our youth program with Wind of the Spirit Immigrant Resource      Center, we learn nonviolent communication and restorative      justice. If we taught this in our schools, and in our      communities, we would increase the level of safety for      everyone. If we had more social workers in our schools, we      would be healthier, safer. We should invest our resources      into the well-being of students so no one ever feels the need      to hurt others. We need social workers, not police. Why are      we as a nation so violent, so hateful? Restorative justice is      proven to work, and we are more than capable of implementing      this into our school systems.       Other countries have one occurrence of gun violence, and      they act on it immediately. Thoughts and prayers are welcome      in these devastating times, but they must be followed by      action, legislation, and prevention measures. Why has our      government refused to act? AR-15s should not be in the hands      of any civilian in this country. Congress needs to ban these      machines that serve no other purpose than to kill as many      individuals as possible within a matter of seconds. Our      nation must raise the age of owning a gun to twenty-one.      Thorough background checks that bar individuals with a      violent history, particularly those with domestic violence      histories, must be part of the process of owning a gun. We      must enforce red-flag laws, laws that allow for the removal      of weapons from people who have been flagged for past      violence.       I've been to marches to support undocumented immigrants. I      participated in the vigil for Heather Heyer, who was murdered      during the Charlottesville protests. I've been to the Women's      March to fight against sexism and to stand up with my fellow      sisters of all backgrounds. I stand here today denouncing gun      violence because marching and demanding change works! We are      a youth-led movement and we will not stop until we succeed in      keeping guns out of the hands of murderers.       I am only sixteen, and I am already tired of standing up      for what is right while legislators sit and do nothing! When      will it be enough? Why must I continue to scream at Congress      and at our society to prove that I matter? Why are      legislators responding to the gun lobby instead of us? What      will it take for us to see each other as human beings that      are worth more than property or profits? This march is just      the beginning of long-overdue conversations, and of work too      long left undone. We must continue to fight, and to fight for      everyone.       We must speak out. Say it with me so that our legislators      in our towns, in Trenton, and in Washington, DC, hear our      call: I'm going to say: shatter the silence. And you respond      with: stop the violence. Shatter the silence. Stop the      violence. Shatter the silence.                          ____________________
