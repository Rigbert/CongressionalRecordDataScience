 He has an opportunity, does he not, to clean up an agency that is already in a lot of trouble because of the IRS scandals, because of the new responsibilities they have been given to enforce ObamaCare? This is an agency in trouble already before it wades into a political thicket such as this, particularly when it appears as if this whole regulation really originated at the White House, not at the IRS.  I am reminded that the Commissioner of the IRS during the Nixon administration was asked by the White House to help target President Nixon's enemies, and the Commissioner of the IRS said: No. No.  I wonder if my friend from Arizona agrees with me that the appropriate response from the new Commissioner of the IRS--responsible for cleaning up this troubled agency--to the White House ought to be, no, I am not going to participate in your effort to quiet the voices of your political foes.
