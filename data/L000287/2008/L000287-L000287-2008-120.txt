Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Tom Lantos, this good and decent man, an American by choice, but a citizen of the world. He was a warrior for human rights, a warrior for justice and fairness. He spoke up and he spoke out for people around the world.  Madam Speaker, the world community has lost a powerful voice for human rights and for human dignity.  How do you honor a man? How do you pay tribute to a man like Tom Lantos? We could name buildings, streets, schools, post offices, but the best way for us to honor Tom Lantos is to pick up where he left off, continue to fight for human rights, continue to fight for peace, continue to build a world community at peace with itself.  Tom, thank you for all you did to make us all free. We will miss you my friend, my colleague, my brother.                              {time}  2000
