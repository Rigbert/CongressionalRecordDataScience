Even farms with a significant amount of open space tend to have significant forested acreage and both are feeling tremendous development pressures. While many agricultural producers in my state would like to purchase easements to keeptheir lands working, a 2008 Natural Resource Conservation Service rule prohibited the agency from protecting tracts with more than two-thirds of their acres under forest cover. This rule has hampered conservation efforts in Vermont. Has it had a similar effect in Michigan?
