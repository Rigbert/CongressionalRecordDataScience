Speaker, today and every day, wage-earning, salary-earning Americans and small business owners across the country will pay 6.2 percent of every dollar they earn up to $87,400 to Social Security, or twice that in the case of the self-employed. This is a heavy burden on the working, wage-earning, salary-earning people of America, particularly those of modest means. And again, it only falls on income below $87,400 so those who earn $3 million or $5 million a year pay a tax at a fraction of the rate of someone who earns $30,000 or $40,000 a year.  The theory is that Social Security in collecting these funds will collect $180 billion more than necessary to pay this year's benefits. That money is supposed to be set aside into a trust fund to meet the future obligations of Social Security. If all those moneys that have been set aside, and they are, unfortunately, just debt instruments, but if those debt instruments were honored, Social Security would have adequate funds to pay full benefits until the year 2042 under conservative assumptions, perhaps longer, and after that it would have a 23 percent shortfall. That is a problem, and we should deal with it.  But enter Mr. Greenspan, a gentleman who does not need Social Security, a gentleman who pays taxes at a fraction of the rate of average wage-earning Americans, a gentleman who does not know or socialize with anyone who needs Social Security. The fact is 20 percent of retired Americans are totally dependent on Social Security, and more than half would fall into poverty tomorrow if Social Security benefits were not there. Just 3 years ago the great Alan Greenspan said in supporting the President's reckless tax cuts which favor the wealthy, those who do not pay Social Security taxes in particular, those who invest for a living, he said that we could have it all; there was so much of a surplus, we could cut taxes on rich people, and we could still provide for Social Security benefits in the future.  Well, 3 years later, confronted with record deficits created by the Bush administration, Alan Greenspan, forever consistent, says the tax cuts should be made permanent, we should continue to borrow money, which we are doing, to finance tax cuts, but we can no longer afford Social Security, is what Mr. Greenspan says. So we are going to borrow money. In fact, this year we are going to borrow $180 billion that is being paid in by working, wage-earning Americans as a surplus into Social Security, which will be immediately borrowed and spent. Some will be spent on things that are good that the government does; some will be spent to give tax cuts to wealthy people.  Mr. Speaker, it is a new kind of transfer tax. We tax wage-earning, salary-earning Americans on every penny of their income. We then overtax them,supposedly to provide their future benefits, borrow that money, and then transfer it to wealthy investors who do not pay a penny in Social Security taxes.                              {time}  1415  This is Mr. Alan Greenspan's world. He hears the pain of those people at the top, those who need further tax cuts, those who have done so well over the last decade. He is willing to say that we should borrow money to finance their tax cuts. He is willing to say we should borrow money from the Social Security trust fund to finance those tax cuts for wealthy people. But now, astoundingly, he says there is not enough money in Social Security to pay benefits. So he just recommends a couple of little things. First, we cut cost-of-living adjustments for seniors. Well, Social Security is already underadjusted for the cost of living of seniors. They have huge increases, in pharmaceutical, medical costs and other things, and the 2.1 percent they get does not reflect their real cost of living and many saw their Medicare or their insurance go up more than their puny increase in Social Security. But Mr. Greenspan does not know any of those people. He has never talked to them. He is not aware of them. They do not belong to the same clubs that he does.  But he also said in his let-them-eat-cake mode that we should just increase the retirement age a little bit more. We are already phasing it up to 67. If Mr. Greenspan had to work for a living, work hard like a logger or a mill worker or many other professions in this country or was in a profession where he could not work forever, unfortunately he can as long as George Bush reappoints him, he would realize that it is a problem if you increase the retirement age further beyond 67. Many Americans cannot physically work that long to collect their benefits and many others will not have the opportunity to work that long. But Mr. Greenspan is not concerned about those people. It is more important to borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund, to bankrupt the system in the future to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, and that is George Bush's priority, too.                          ____________________
