 President, their preliminary analysis shows that this provision would take away the wages and reduce it dramatically for waiters and waitresses, bartenders, barbers, baggage porters, cooks, dishwashers, hairdressers, maids, manicurists, massage therapists, parking lot attendants, personal care and services workers, service station attendants, taxi drivers, and chauffeurs.  It appears, indeed, that the provision in this bill will dramatically reduce the income of thousands of workers in my State and other States.  I again reiterate that is why we are opposed to this bill.  I yield the floor.
