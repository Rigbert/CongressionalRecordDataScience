 Madam Chairman, from the beginning there are people on the poles of this issue who have wanted this to be a debate about forest policy and not a debate about schools, about vital county services. I have to say a few of the last speakers are succeeding in dragging us back to that point.  Successfully, throughout the day, we have been addressing the needs of the schools, the needs of counties that are more than half owned by the Federal Government, with few alternatives, with depressed rural economies, with underfunded schools, with few sheriffs deputies and other tremendous needs going unmet.  What we heard out of the last few speakers, they want to assassinate the administration here. Well, let us get it straight. Who proposed giving this money to the counties and schools to begin with? It was the President, in the budget a year ago.  What did the Republican majority do in the last Congress on this issue? Nothing. They did not even hold a hearing.  Now, this Congress there has been some action, but not through a regular process. It did not go through my committee where I sit, the Committee on Resources, which it should have by all rights. Now we are down on the floor and there are people here who would just as soon blow this up as opposed to get something done here today.  This is an important issue. This is not a perfect bill. It is not the bill I would have written. It is probably not the bill that we would have had if it had gone through the regular process, but it is vitally important and it is the best we can do today here in the United States House of Representatives.  The administration has not sent a veto threat. They have raised concerns about parts of this bill, concerns which can be worked out with the Senate if it is going to be signed into law, and it needs to be signed into law. For the sake of the kids and the counties, it must pass.  So let us not go where the poles in this debate want us to go. Let us not drag this out into a debate of forest policy. We can debate that every day of the week and we can all disagree and we can come down here and just have a great time pounding on each other or we can do it in committee, we can do it in the hallways, in the cloakrooms, everywhere else. This is not about forest policy. It is about money. It is about vital funds for kids, for schools, for counties, for law enforcement, for roads and infrastructure. Please support passage of this bill.                              {time}  1530
