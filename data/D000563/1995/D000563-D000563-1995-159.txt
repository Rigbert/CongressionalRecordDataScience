Chairman, everyone seems to agree that we should put more money into water and sewer programs. We all know there are a lot of communities that need them. Otherwise they cannot improve their systems for public health reasons. The obvious question here is whether or not this provision, when it comes to livestock feed programs, should be allowed to continue.  I agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts it should not. So many of these farmers, and cowboys and ranchers want to be rugged individualists and say, ``No, I'm not going to buy crop insurance, I'm on my own, buddy, leave me alone,'' and then things get tough, and guess what?  They come and knock on Uncle Sam's door and say, ``Well, now I need some help.''  What this amendment says is, ``Grow up.'' If you got crop insurance available, buy it, and, if you don't, you're going to pay. If you have a disaster, you're not going to get as much money from the Federal Government.''  Is that a radical suggestion? I think that ought to be the policy across the land, to tell producers and business people that, if there is insurance available, use it, and, if they do not use it, they are going to suffer as a result of it.  Now, to say we are going to hold them harmless regardless I think creates bad conduct on their part. The gentleman from Missouri and I were co-chairs of a disaster task force. We now spend or compensate for about 95 percent of the disasters and losses in the United States. We cannot afford to continue to do it. Individuals have to accept more personal responsibility.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Shays). The gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] has 30 seconds remaining.
