Speaker, due to unavoidable circumstances relating to my health, I was physically absent from the House of Representatives on November 16, 2018. On that day, I missed two recorded votes.  On Roll Call No. 419, on the Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended, H.R. 5787, had I been present, I would have voted ``Aye.''  On Roll Call No. 420, on Passage of H.R. 6784, had I been present, I would have voted ``Aye.''                          ____________________
