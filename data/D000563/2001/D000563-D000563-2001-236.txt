Senator Fitzgerald has contacted airlines and I have contacted them as well.  My understanding is one of the major airlines in our country visited Rockford this week. We all believe this is a resource that should be available, no matter what we do in Chicago with O'Hare or even in Peotone. We are 5 to 10 years away from seeing any significant change. In the meantime, Rockford is a resource that should be examined and utilized to try to reduce congestion and delays at O'Hare and to provide quality air service to the people living in and around the Rockford area.
