Chairman, I yield myself 40 seconds to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney).  Mr. Speaker, I have heard from some individuals who are concerned, as I am, that the section in this bill that clarifies the National Voter Registration Act, section 902(a), does not make reference to subsection (e) of 1973gg-6 of that act.  Is it the gentleman's understanding that this subsection (e) will remain in full force and effect with the passage of this bill?
