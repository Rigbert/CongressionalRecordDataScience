President, Senator Kyl spoke on the floor yesterday about the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, S. 3205, which he introduced two weeks ago on October 12, 2000. I had planned to speak to him directly about this legislation when I got into the office yesterday, but before I had the opportunity to speak to him, even by telephone, my colleague instead chose to discuss this matter on the Senate floor.  I have worked with Senator Kyl to pass a number of matters of importance to him in past Congresses and in this one. Most recently, for example, the Senate passed on November 19, 1999, S. 692, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and on September 28, 2000, S. 704, the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. Moreover, in the past few months, we have worked together to get four more judges in Arizona. I was happy to help Senator Kyl clear each of those matters.  Unlike the secret holds that often stop good bills from passing often for no good reason, I have had no secret hold on S. 3205. On the contrary, when asked, I have made no secret about the concerns I had with this legislation.  An earlier version of this legislation, which Senator Kyl tried to move as part of the Intelligence Authorization bill, S. 2507, prompted a firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights organizations, as well as the Department of Justice. I will include letters from the Department of Justice, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Center for National Security Studies and the American Civil Liberties Union for the Record at the end of my statement. I shared many of the concerns of those organizations and the Justice Department.  I learned late last week that Senator Kyl was seeking to clear S. 3207 for passage by the Senate, even though it had been introduced only the week before. I do not believe the Senate should move precipitously to pass a bill that has garnered so much serious opposition before having the opportunity to review it in detail and ensure that earlier pitfalls had been addressed. Let me say that having reviewed the bill introduced by Senator Kyl, it is apparent that he has made efforts to address some of those serious and legitimate concerns.  Senator Kyl has suggested that if the Justice Department was satisfied with his legislation, I or my staff had earlier indicated that I would be satisfied. I respect the expertise of the Department of Justice and the many fine lawyers and public servants who work there and, where appropriate, seek out their views, as do many Members. That does not mean that I always share the views of the Department of Justice or follow the Department's preferred course and recommendations without exercising my own independent judgment. I would never represent that if the Justice Department were satisfied with his bill, I would automatically defer to their view. Furthermore, my staff has advised me that no such representation was ever made.  That being said, I should note that the Department of Justice has advised me about inaccurate and incorrect statements in Senator Kyl's bill, S. 3205, which are among the items that should be fixed before the Senate takes up and passes this measure.  I have shared those items and other suggestions to improve this legislation with the cosponsor of the bill, Senator Feinstein, whose staff requested our comments earlier this week. My staff provided comments to Senator Feinstein, and understood that at least in the view of that cosponsor of this bill, some of those comments were well-taken and would be discussed with Senator Kyl and his staff. Indeed, my staff received their first telephone call about S. 3205 from Senator Kyl's staff just yesterday morning, returned the call without finding Senator Kyl'sstaff available, and hoped to have constructive conversations to resolve our remaining differences. Yet, before these conversations could even begin, Senator Kyl chose to conduct our discussions on the floor of the Senate. There may be more productive matters on which the Senate should focus its attention, but I respect my colleague's choice of forum and will lay out here the continuing concerns I have with his legislation.  First, the bill contains a sense of the Congress concerning the tragic attack on the U.S.S. Cole that refers to out-dated numbers of sailors killed and injured. I believe that each of the 17 sailors killed and 39 sailors injured deserve recognition and that the full scope of the attack should be properly reflected in this Senate bill. I have urged the sponsors of the bill to correct this part of the bill. I note that last week the Senate passed at least two resolutions on this matter, expressing the outrage we all feel about the bombing attack on that Navy ship.  Second, this sense of the Congress urges the United States Government to ``take immediate actions to investigate rapidly the unprovoked attack on the'' U.S.S. Cole, without acknowledging the fact that such immediate action has been taken. The Navy began immediate investigative steps shortly after the attack occurred, and the FBI established a presence on the ground and began investigating within 24 hours. The Director himself went to Yemen to guide this investigation. That investigation is active and ongoing, and no Senate bill should reflect differently, as this one does. We should be commending the Administration for the swift and immediate actions taken to this attack and the strong statements made by the President making clear that no stone will be left unturned to find the criminals who planned this bloody attack.  Third, as I previously indicated, the Department of Justice has suggested several corrections to the ``Findings'' section of this bill. For example, the bill suggests there are ``38 organizations'' designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) when there are currently 29. The bill also states that ``current practice is to update the list of FTOs every two years'' when in fact the statute requires redesignation of FTOs every two years. The bill also states that current controls on the transfer and possession of biological pathogens were ``designed to prevent accidents, not theft,'' which according to the Justice Department is simply not accurate.  Fourth, the bill requires reports on issues within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee without any direction that those reports be submitted to that Committee. For example, section 9 of the bill would require the FBI to submit to the Select Committees on Intelligence of the Senate and the House a feasibility report on establishing a new capability within the FBI for the dissemination of law enforcement information to the Intelligence community. I have suggested that this report also be required to be submitted to the Judiciary Committees. As the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, I would have expected that Senator Kyl would support this suggested change.  Fifth, the bill would require reports, with recommendations for appropriate legislative or regulation changes, by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on safeguarding biological pathogens at research labs and other facilities in the United States. No definition of ``biological pathogen'' is included in the bill and the scope could therefore cover a vast array of biological materials. I have suggested that the focus of these requested reports could be better directed by more carefully defining this term.  Finally, the bill would require reimbursement for professional liability insurance for law enforcement officers performing official counterterrorism duties and for intelligence officials performing such duties outside the United States. I have asked for an explanation for this provision. I have scoured the record in vain for explanatory statements by the sponsors of this bill for this provision. It is unclear to me why law enforcement officers conducting investigations here in the United States need such insurance, let alone intelligence officers acting overseas. There may be a good reason why these officers need this special protection, beyond the limited immunity they already have and beyond what other law enforcement and intelligence officers are granted. I need to know the reason for this special protection before any of us are able to evaluate the merits of this proposal.  I stand ready, as I always have, to work with the sponsors of S. 3205 to improve their bill.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the two letters to which I referred.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 25, 2000.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart          Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC,     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,     Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Hart          Senate Office Bldg, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: We are writing to      express our opposition to the ``Counterterrorism Act of      2000,'' which we understand Senators Kyl and Feinstein are      seeking to add to the intelligence authorization bill. At      least three provisions of the Act pose grave threats to      constitutional rights, and others raise serious questions as      well.                               Section 10       Section 10 of the Counterterrorism Act would amend the      federal wiretap statute (``Title III'') to allow law      enforcement agencies conducting wiretaps within the United      States to share information obtained from such surveillance      with the intelligence agencies. The provision breaches the      well-established and constitutionally vital line between law      enforcement and intelligence activities. The provision has no      meaningful limitations. It allows the CIA and other      intelligence agencies to acquire, index, use and disseminate      information collected within the US about American citizens.      It is not subject to any meaningful judicial controls.       Efforts have been underway for a number of years to improve      the sharing of information between law enforcement and      intelligence agencies, particularly in areas concerning      terrorism and trans-national criminal activity. Significant      improvements have been achieved. However, it has been      recognized consistently in all these efforts that the      fundamental distinction between intelligence and law      enforcement serves important values and must be maintained.       Paramount among the reasons why we distinguish between law      enforcement and intelligence agencies, and confine them to      their separate spheres, is to protect civil and      constitutional rights. The intelligence agencies operate in      secret without many of the checks and balances, the judicial      review and the public accountability that our Constitution      demands for most exercises of government power. The      secretive data gathering, storage and retention practices      of the intelligence agencies are appropriate only when      conducted overseas for national defense and foreign policy      purposes and only when directed against people who are not      US citizens or permanent residents.       Therefore, we have always maintained strict rules against      intelligence agency activities in the US or directed against      US citizens and residents. From the outset, the National      Security Act of 1947 has specifically provided that the      Central Intelligence Agency shall ``have no police, subpoena      or law enforcement powers or internal security functions.''      This was intended to prevent the CIA from collecting      information on Americans. Likewise, the National Security      Agency has very strict rules about the collection or      dissemination of information concerning Americans.       This prohibition against intelligence agencies collecting      and disseminating information about people in the US would be      rendered meaningless if the FBI could give personally      identifiable information about US citizens to the CIA or NSA,      which then could retain the information in files retrievable      by name. Yet that is what the proposed amendment does. The      proposed amendment contains no meaningful limitations. It      does not say that the information to be shared can relate      only to non-US persons. It does not say that the information      could be kept by the receiving intelligence agencies only in      non-personally retrievable form (a restriction that      increasingly loses meaning anyhow as agencies develop the      capability to search the full next of their files).       Moreover, this breach would involve one of the most      intrusive of law enforcement techniques--electronic      interception of telephone conversations, e-mail and other      electronic communications. In recognition of the especially      intrusive nature of wiretapping, section 2.4 of E.O. 12333      expressly states that the CIA is not authorized to conduct      electronic surveillance within the United States. All Title      III interceptions take place in the US. The overwhelming      majority of targets of law enforcement wiretapping are US      persons. In this information age, when so much sensitive      personal information is exchanged electronically, the      American public is increasingly concerned about the breadth      and intrusiveness of government wiretapping.       The problems posed by the proposed Section 10 are      compounded by the secrecy with which the intelligence      agencies operate. There is little likelihood that a person      who was the subject of a file at the CIA would ever learn      about it, and even less likelihood that they would ever learn      that information in the file was obtained by a law      enforcement wiretap. So there would be little opportunity for      uncovering abuses and little recourse to the judiciary for      misuse of the information.       The provision stands in fundamental contradiction to the      specificity and minimization requirements of Title III, which      are central to the privacy protection scheme of that law. The      minimization rule requires every wiretap to be ``conducted in      such a way as to minimize the interception of communications      not otherwise subject to interception'' under Title III.      18 U.S.C. 2518(5). Every order under Title III must      include ``a particular description of the type of      communication sought to be intercepted and a statement of      the particular offense to which it relates,'' 18 U.S.C.      2518(4)(c). Together, these provisions make it illegal to      intercept under Title III communications that do not      relate to a criminal offense. Yet the proposed amendment      would seem to mean either that officials conducting Title      III wiretaps would be intercepting communications      involving foreign intelligence that is not relevant to      crimes in the U.S. or the CIA would be compiling      information about crimes, including crimes inside the      U.S., in violation of the National Security Act.                               section 9       Section 9 of the Counterterrorism Act of 2000 also      threatens to erase the dividing line between law enforcement      and intelligence agencies that protects individuals in the      U.S. against secret domestic intelligence activity. Section 9      would require the Director of the FBI to submit to Congress a      report on the feasibility of establishing within the Bureau a      comprehensive intelligence reporting function having the      responsibility for disseminating to the intelligence agencies      information collected and assembled by the FBI on      international terrorism and other national security matters.       But Section 9 calls for far more than an objective study.      It requires the FBI to submit a proposal for such an      information sharing function, including a budget, an      implementation proposal and a discussion of the legal      restrictions associated with disseminating law enforcement      information to the intelligence agencies. This is putting the      cart before the horse. With the emphasis in recent years on      cooperation between the FBI and the CIA, the factual      predicate has not been established for even concluding that      the FBI is not already properly sharing intelligence      information. Further, only recently the FBI adopted a      strategy that stresses intelligence collection and analysis--     it would be prudent first to examine the effectiveness and      civil liberties implications of that strategy before      directing the FBI to design a new intelligence sharing      mechanism. Then it would be prudent to draw distinctions      among the various types of information that the FBI is      collecting, to ensure that information sharing does not      infringe on the rights of Americans and does not involve the      intelligence agencies in domestic law enforcement matters.      All of these nuances are missing from Section 9. All of them      could be accomplished by the relevant Congressional      committees in a neutral and objective fashion without the      need for this amendment.       The provision does not draw a distinction between      information collected by the FBI under its      counterintelligence authority and information collected by      the Bureau in criminal matters. While there are overlaps      between foreign intelligence and criminal investigations,      especially in international terrorism matters, there are      nonetheless important and long-standing rules intended to      enforce the distinction. Since the period of COINTELPRO and      the Church Committee, it has been recognized that the      rights of American are better protected (and the FBI may      be more effective) when international terrorism and      national security investigations are conducted under the      rules for criminal investigations. Section 9 is flawed for      failing to recognize this distinction and seeming to      encourage its obliteration.                               Section 11       Section 11 of the bill is essentially a direction to the      Executive Branch to be more aggressive in investigating      ``terrorist fundraising'' of an undefined nature. Fundraising      to support violent activities is properly a crime. But in the      1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Congress      also made it a crime to support the legal, peaceful political      activities of groups that the Executive Branch designates as      terrorist organizations. The 1996 Act was supposed to allow      the government to respond to fundraising in the US on behalf      of terrorist groups. At the time, opponents of the law argued      that there was no evidence that extensive fundraising of this      nature occurred and worried that the law would be used as an      excuse to launch intimidating investigations into the      political activities of Arab immigrants and other ethnic      communities. We opposed the 1996 Act on the ground that it      unconstitutionally criminalized support activities that were      protected under the First Amendment. The proposed amendment      to the intelligence authorization bill reaches even more      broadly than the 1996 Act.       Section 11 of the bill essentially tells the Executive      Branch to go out and punish fundraising conduct where little      or none has been found. The recent case of Wen Ho Lee      highlights the dangers of Congress telling the Executive      Branch to be more aggressive in investigating and prosecuting      a particular crime. The last time something like this      happened was in the 1980s, when some in Congress urged the      FBI to be more aggressive in investigating what they believed      to be a Communist-supported conspiracy in the US to support      terrorism in El Salvador. The resulting ``CISPES''      investigation intruded on the First Amendment rights of      thousands of Americans peacefully opposed to US policy in      Central America, turned up no evidence of wrongdoing, and      proved a major embarrassment for the FBI. This danger is      exacerbated by the proposed amendment, which encourages the      Executive Branch to use Civil and administrative remedies,      including the tax laws, that are not subject to the      protections of criminal due process. It is further      exacerbated since the amendment encourages the commingling of      criminal information and intelligence information collected      with the most intrusive of techniques and such secrecy that      the targets of any adverse action may have a hard time      defending themselves.       We also have concerns with other sections of the proposed      amendment: (1) Section 6, concerning the guidelines on      recruitment of CIA informants, implicitly questions the      historical lessons and value judgments reflected in the      guidelines and is clearly intended to be seen as a signal      from Congress that the CIA should be freer in recruiting      informants who are human rights abusers. This practice has      embarrassed our country in the past and would embarrass us      again if the practice were renewed, undercutting American      foreign policy support for the rule of law and our efforts      to discourage and resolve violence in emerging democracies      and other transitional societies. (2) Section 12 would      require IHIS to take ``actions'' to make standards for the      physical protection and security of biological pathogens      ``as rigorous as the current standards'' for critical      nuclear materials.'' The questions posed by the threat of      biological weapons require a far more carefully designed      policy than a blanket direction to establish for      ``biological pathogens'' the same protections that apply      to critical nuclear materials. Take the case of West Nile      virus, or the AIDS virus. Are these ``biological      pathogens?'' Does section 12 mean that all medical      research and all medical facilities handling research and      treatment of the West Nile or AIDS viruses must institute      the security clearance checks, polygraphs, and pre-     publication review requirements (all of which raise      serious constitutional due process, privacy and civil      liberties concerns) that apply to workers at nuclear      weapons facilities?       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose the addition of      the Counterterrorism Act to the intelligence authorization      bill.           Respectfully,                                              Laura W. Murphy,                                                         Director,       American Civil Liberties Union, Washington National Office.                                             James X. Dempsey,                                             Senior Staff Counsel,                              Center for Democracy and Technology.                                                  Kate Martin,                                               Executive Director,     Center for National Security Studies.                                  ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2000.     Hon. Richard Shelby,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter expresses the views of the      Justice Department on the proposed counterterrorism amendment      (the ``Counterterrorism Act of 2000'') to S. 2507, the      ``Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.'' The      Department opposes the amendment.       Section 10 would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517 to permit the      sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence      information, collected by investigative or law enforcement      officers under title III, with the intelligence community. We      oppose this provision, Although we recognize the arguments      for allowing title III information to be shared as a      permissive matter, this would be a major change to existing      law and could have significant implications for prosecutions      and the discovery process in litigation. Any consideration of      the sharing of law enforcement information with the      intelligence community must accommodate legal constraints      such as Criminal Rule 6(e) and the need to protect equities      relating to ongoing criminal investigations. While we      understand the concerns of the Commission on Terrorism, we      believe that law enforcement agencies have authority under      current law to share title III information regarding      terrorism with intelligence agencies when the information is      of overriding importance to the national security.       Section 10 also raises significant issues regarding the      sharing with intelligence agencies of information collected      about United States persons. Such a change to title III      should not be made lightly, without full discussion of the      issues and implications.       Section 9 of the amendment presumptively would give the FBI      60 days to resolve these and other concerns in a report to      Congress on the feasibility of establishing a dissemination      center within the FBI for information collected and assembled      by the FBI on international terrorism and other national      security matters. In our view, the issues involved     in the dissemination of this information do not avail      themselves of resolution in this very short time frame. In      addition, we note that law enforcement officials      conducting operations that result in the collection or      assembly of this kind of information often will not be in      a position to discern whether the information they have      gathered actually qualifies as pertinent to foreign      intelligence or counterintelligence. Accordingly, to the      extent that disclosure becomes mandatory, we anticipate      that a substantial and costly effort would be necessary to      create the necessary screening process.       Section 11 of the amendment would require the creation of a      joint task force to disrupt the fundraising activities of      international terrorist organizations. We believe that this      type of rigid, statutory mandate would interfere with the      need for flexibility in tailoring enforcement strategies and      mechanisms to fit the enforcement needs of the particular      moment.       Section 12 of the amendment would require the Attorney      General to submit a report on the means of improving controls      of biological pathogens and the equipment necessary to      produce biological weapons. Subsection 12(a)(2)(A) would      require that the report include a list of equipment critical      to the development, production, and delivery of biological      weapons. We question the utility of such a list because it is      our understanding that much of this equipment is dual-use and      widely used for peaceful purposes. Section 12(b) directs the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to undertake certain      actions relating to protection and security of biological      pathogens described in subsection (a). In keeping with the      concerns regarding Executive branch authority, as discussed      above, and the complexity and scope of this matter, the      Administration believes that any authority should be vested      in the President.       Moreover, section 12(a)(2)(B) would purport to require that      the Attorney General submit a report to Congress on      biological weapons that ``shall include'' the following:       (B) Recommendations for legislative language to make      illegal the possession of the biological pathogens;       (C) Recommendations for legislative language to control the      domestic sale and transfer of the equipment so identified      under subparagraph A;       (D) Recommendations for legislative language to require the      tagging or other means of marking of the equipment identified      under subsection A.       We believe that these provisions are invalid under the      Recommendations Clause, which provides that the President      ``shall from time to time . . . recommend to [Congress] . . .      such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.''      U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 3. Legislation requiring the      President to provide the Congress with policy recommendations      or draft legislation infringes on powers reserved to the      President by the Recommendations Clause, including the power      to decline to offer any recommendation if, in the President's      judgment, no recommendation is necessary or expedient.      Legislation that requires the President's subordinates to      provide Congress with policy recommendations or draft      legislation interferes with the President's efforts to      formulate and present his own recommendations and proposals      and to control the policy agenda of his Administration.       The constitutional concerns raised by the proposed      amendment would be addressed by revising these provisions in      either of the following ways: (1) provide that the reports      the Attorney General submits may, instead of shall, include      recommendations or (2) provide that ``the Attorney General      shall, to the extent that she deems it appropriate,'' submit      such recommendations to Congress.       More generally, we understand that this amendment may      bypass the hearing and referral process and be appended      immediately to S. 2507, the Intelligence Authorization bill,      now headed for consideration on the floor of the Senate.      Given the complexity of the issues, we would welcome a more      considered dialogue between the branches of Government.       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. The      Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the      perspective of the Administration's program, there is no      objection to submission of this letter.           Sincerely,                                                     Robert Raben,     Assistant Attorney General.                          ____________________
