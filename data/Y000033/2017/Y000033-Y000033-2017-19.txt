Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that Mr. Simpson just mentioned it was eliminated by the administration, and he did restore some of the money. I am just requesting that, if he gets any more money, we would look for it in the Denali Commission so that the work it has done is well rewarded.  Mr. Chairman, I thank both the chairmen for the work they have done establishing the Denali Commission in past years, and let's go forth.
