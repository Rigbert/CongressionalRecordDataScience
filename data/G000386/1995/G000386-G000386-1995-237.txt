 President, I want to state, where he says that ``the crux of the matter is not phantom payments but outmoded accounting procedures,'' I will agree with him on the outmoded accounting procedures, but I will not believe that that is an excuse for getting off the hook. It is designed to put us at ease, Mr. President. I think it is a neat distraction. Outmoded accounting procedures are seemingly harmless, are they not? They pose no threat, seemingly, to the security and the control of money. But that is a long way from the truth.  To assure us that no money has been lost, Mr. Hamre makes one bold assertion, and he makes it from this article. It says:       For every disbursement he characterizes as lost, we have a      validated receipt with an independent confirmation that the      Government received goods and services.  I think I know what Mr. Hamre is trying to say. He is trying to say for every Defense Department payment, he has a receipt to prove that the goods and services were actually received. This was brought up in some recent testimony of Mr. Hamre on the Hill. He used form DD250 as an example of ``validated receipts''--his words. Those are his words, ``validated receipts for goods handled.''  The DOD form DD250 is called the Materials Inspection and Receiving Report. I have a copy of that here.  This particular one that I have in my hand is for the purchase of a high-powered amplifier for the Air Force Milstar satellite.  I ask unanimous consent to print this in the Record.  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Material Inspection and Receiving Report       Proc. Instrument Iden.
