Speaker, this week, a beloved former Colleague of our House, Representative ``Lindy'' Marie Corinne Morrison Claiborne Boggs, of New Orleans, Louisiana, celebrates her 97th birthday. In describing her life and career, one does not use single syllable words.  Trailblazer, gracious, erudite, compassionate, witty, diplomatic, visionary, indefatigable, inspirational, enduring. These words capture her. When I think of words she utters, certain come to mind: ``darlin','' ``precious,'' and the manner in which she forms the words ``New Orleans,'' held a lilt and tone hard for others to emulate.  Wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, Congresswoman, Ambassador, author, woman of faith. When she retired from Congress in 1991 at age seventy-five, she was the only Caucasian woman serving in Congress from the Deep south (excluding Florida). Part magnolia, part Tabasco sauce, part French Quarter grande dame, she represented the maturation of a modern political miracle--a Roman Catholic, Caucasian woman elected for nine consecutive terms to the U.S. Congress from Louisiana.  ``Lindy'' was born in Pointe Coupee Roads, Louisiana on March 13, 1916. Her father Roland Claiborne, a prominent lawyer, died when she was only two years old. After her father's death, her mother remarried and Lindy spent her formative years on a plantation. Her grandmother Morrison had a great influence on her life and lived to be ninety-seven. The Morrison family's roots can be traced back to the Mayflower. Her grandmother Morrison had a fondness for artichokes. Solari's a fancy, southern grocer, did not have them at certain times of the year which prompted Boggs' grandmother to experiment growing them herself. Soon, she was shipping her artichokes to Solari's. Lindy says she was introduced to politics as she listened to the conversations between sugar planters and cotton planters. ``The sugar planters were very isolationist, protectionist, and they kept talking about high tariff walls. And in the country, we had constructions called ``stiles,'' which were really steps over fences. And I kept wondering if Uncle Joe could build me a stile tall enough so I could see what was on the other side of that high tariff wall. But then on the cotton plantation, of course, the cotton people were free traders, to get rid of all that surplus cotton they had, so the conversation was entirely different. So I learned early on that families can be divided over political situations.''  Lindy matriculated at Newcomb College in New Orleans, the first women's college in Louisiana and the sister school to Tulane University, where she majored in history and education. At Newcomb, she was editor of the student newspaper and it was in that capacity she met her future husband Congressman Hale Boggs, who was then the paper's general editor. Upon graduating, Lindy taught high school history and English, served as school librarian and coached the girls' basketball team. In January 1938, at 21, she married Hale and through university connections, Hale and Lindy embarked on a political career, becoming a part of the grass-roots reform movement that took place in Louisiana in the late 1930's. With Lindy's support, Hale was elected to Congress in 1941. Lindy orchestrated his re-election campaigns as well as set up his district offices in New Orleans, canvassed voters, arranged her husband's many social gatherings and acted as his political surrogate as he climbed in House leadership. When Hale's plane tragically crashed in 1972, Lindy emerged as a top choice to take over his seat. ``When the various people were trying to persuade me to run . . . Lady Bird Johnson . . . called and talked to me for a long time about how I had an obligation and all of these things. Then when she thought maybe she had convinced me, she said, ``But darling, do you think you can do it without a wife?'' I've told her many times, it was very hard without a wife.''  In March 1973, Lindy Boggs was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election. Her victory made her the first woman to represent Louisiana in the House and the first Catholic elected from a state that had never elected a Catholic to any major state office. She won her election by 75 percent in the Democratic primary and by 80 percent in the general election. ``I had a Republican running against me by the name of Robert E. Lee,'' she has said, ``I knew he was an imposter!'' Lindy was at first appointed to the Banking and Currency Committee, where she played a key role during the mark up of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974. She cites her experience as a newly widowed woman seekingcredit as her motivation to add ``sex or marital status'' to the provision barring discrimination on the basis of ``race and age, and their status as veterans.'' Without informing the other committee members, Lindy inserted those words and made copies of the revision for her colleagues saying, ``Knowing the Members composing this committee as well as I do, I'm sure it was just an oversight that we didn't have ``sex'' or ``marital status'' included. I've taken care of that and I trust it meets with the committee's approval.'' The bill passed unanimously, 47-0.  In 1976, she became the first woman to preside over a national political convention. In 1977, Lindy was elected to the House Committee on Appropriations at her retirement, she remained the longest serving member of that committee, serving for 12 years. That same year, she helped cofound the Congressional Women's Caucus and later served as its secretary. Throughout her career, Lindy maintained that the most important women's issues were economic, backing those causes. ``The major issues of importance that I have worked on are economic ones; equal rights for women in business, banking and homeownership, the promotion of women in the workplace, better jobs in government and contracts, and equal opportunities for higher education, especially in science and medicine. Women vote with their pocketbooks . . . it boils down to that.'' Lindy was also a champion for civil rights in her diverse district. A political observer once noted, ``She is the only white Congress Member representing a black voter majority in the United States.''  In the early 1980's, Lindy was instrumental in the creation of the House Historian's Office. She helped create and served as a member of the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. From 1985 to 1989, she served as the chair of the Bicentenary of the United States House of Representatives. In July 1991, shortly after her retirement from Congress, the House named a room off the Rotunda in her honor, the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women's Reading Room, of which she says, ``I was always so proud that room was named for me because I felt that Abigail Adams had finally succeeded. She had asked her husband, John, to `remember the ladies' when the Constitution was drafted or they would foment a revolution. He had not done so, and so their son's final resting place is now occupied by women and named for a woman.''  Retirement did not slow Lindy down. She remained politically active and in 1994 authored her autobiography, Washington Through a Purple Veil. In 1997, President Clinton appointed the 81 year old as U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, a position in which she served until 2001. In 2002, Congress honored Lindy for her ``extraordinary service'' to Louisiana and the country. The occasion marked the 25th anniversary of the Congressional Women's Caucus.  Of the accomplishments she is most proud of, she cites bills cosponsored on behalf minorities, women, and children; her efforts to improve education from the elementary to the college level; her work on the children's task force on crisis intervention; efforts to open the National Museum of African American Art in Washington, D.C.; establishing the Office of Historian of the House of Representatives; and achieving Margaret Chase Smith's dream of making the rose the national flower.  On a personal level, Mrs. Boggs mentored me in the ways of this institution, introduced me and so many others to the Appropriations Committee, and hosted me as our nation's Ambassador to the Vatican. She has served our nation with a grit and grace that demonstrates to us all what service can be. Lindy Boggs has become a legend in her own time. How privileged I am to be able to honor her 97th year anniversary of life and pay tribute to her honorable service to America and the world.                          ____________________
