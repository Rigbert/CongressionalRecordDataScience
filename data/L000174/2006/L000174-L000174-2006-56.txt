President, I thank the senior Senator from California for addressing concerns I had with an earlier version of this bill. I was particularly concerned about the apparent disconnect between the substantive offense created by the bill and the misdemeanor penalty for its violation. The offense requires proof that a defendant, for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise, ``intentionally damages, or causes the loss of any property (including animals or records)'' used by an animal enterprise. By contrast, the misdemeanor penalty provision applied to offenses involving ``exclusively non-violent physical obstruction'' of an animal enterprise facility, resulting in no bodily injury, no property damage, and no loss of profits.  It is difficult to imagine how a person can intentionally damage property, or intentionally cause the loss of property, while at the same time be engaged exclusively in nonviolent physical obstruction that causes no real harm. The only way these provisions could be reconciled would be by watering down the criminal prohibition to extend to peaceful conduct that the bill was never intended to cover.  The current version of the bill clears up the confusion. It strikes the misdemeanor provision in its entirety and clarifies that the substantive offense created by the bill requires proof of intentional damage to real or personal property, not simply a loss of profits. These changes will ensure that legitimate, peaceful conduct is not chilled by the threat of Federal prosecution, and that prosecution is reserved for the worst offenders.
