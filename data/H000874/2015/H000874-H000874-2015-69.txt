Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act, sponsored by Representative French Hill of Arkansas. This bipartisan bill will provide relief to everyone who is doing their best to comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's mortgage loan disclosure rule.  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 538, the Native American Energy Act, sponsored by Representative Don Young of Alaska, which is necessary to expedite energy production on tribal lands.  And, finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 702, sponsored by Representative Joe Barton of Texas. Oil exports are key to creating American jobs and furthering America's energy renaissance.  Given the increased security threats facing the United States and its allies, the presence of more American oil in the global marketplace will offer more secure supply options. This will provide America with greater foreign policy influence as well as strengthening our economic and national security.  I thank the gentleman.
