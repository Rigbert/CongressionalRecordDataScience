Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to bring to the Members' attention a title that is a part of this Defense supplemental bill, title IV, entitled ``The Mexican Debt Disclosure Act of 1995,'' a measure that was attached in the Senate and then agreed to by the conferees.  Let me mention also, Mr. Speaker, that as the ranking member on our side has indicated, it has been very difficult to get the $3.1 billion identified in the overall defense supplemental bill to take care of costs for Haiti, for Bosnia, for Somalia. I might mention $3.1 billion.  Title IV, which deals with Mexico, talks about $20 billion. Of course, that is money that has not been voted on by the Members of this body, because we have not been permitted a vote by our own leadership. We have been thwarted at every turn.  Now we are faced with a vote on a defense supplemental that has a title that pushes us a little bit further toward getting some additional information from the Clinton administration. I have to say that it is a step in the right direction, but it is certainly not what we have been asking for in this body.                              {time}  1130  A little recent history here. Members will remember that we were ruled against, those of us who wanted a clean vote on the question of whether we should be appropriating dollars to support the bailout in Mexico. The Speaker ruled against us. We were not allowed an open debate a few weeks ago. Then there was a vote in the Republican conference about a week ago, 2 to 1 against getting a vote here, a clean vote on the floor on the question of these credits and loan guarantees being extended to Mexico. Now the only item we were able to get passed was a resolution that had broad bipartisan support here, House Resolution 80, which we had to use a special procedure to disgorge it from committee and it essentially only asked the administration for information which was supposed to be here by March 15 and which is not here. Only parts of it are here.  Now the cleanest measure that we could get on this floor is not this title [[Page H4353]] IV of this bill but rather Discharge Petition 2 which sits at the desk there that would allow us a clean vote on the issue of how many dollars if any should be extended further to Mexico to help bail out that tragic situation down there.  I want to point out to the Members, this title does exist in this bill. It is a serious title. Essentially what it says is that no money, loan credit guarantee or arrangement through the Exchange Stabilization Fund at the Treasury or the Federal Reserve can be extended unless the President of the United States has provided us with every single document that we have asked for in our resolution of inquiry.  I can say based on the research we have done in our office, again this information was to have been here by March 15. There are big holes in what the administration has failed to tell us, including the conditions that were placed on the bailout by members of the investment community, the relationships to the Bank for International Settlement and the other international funds involved in this bailout, and private phone conversation notes between the Government of the United States and Mexico.  I just have to say that this is another weak attempt to try to get some vote here in the Congress on a massive amount of money that is being extended by the people of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I have to say that it is not comfortable to be a Member of this body and not be allowed a full debate on a matter that is 7 times as large as the base dollar funding in this defense supplemental. This has been an insiders' deal from the beginning. I think that the Members should read the language of title IV carefully. We have a right to debate this amount of money going to another country. We are tied in knots over $3.1 billion of money that needs to be paid to restore the amount in our readiness accounts. Why is it so difficult to get a full debate in the Congress of the United States when we have a new form of back-door foreign assistance that has been allowed to Mexico setting an incredible precedent that we will have to account for later?  I just have to say that this amendment that was added to this bill gets us to maybe second base but it does not get us the full and open debate and the kind of oversight that we need in this body on the amount of money that is now being extended to not just back up the Government of Mexico but the Mexican banking system. This is extremely serious. Title IV, an important step perhaps, gets us to second base, not the home run that we really need in order to gain proper oversight over this massive expenditure of our tax dollars.
