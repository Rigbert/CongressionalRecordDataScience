Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee, my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), and all who have done so much on this important piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for our veterans. This legislation is comprehensive. Its name certainly is indicative of what it is, a very forward-thinking bill, the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act. This legislation positions us for the challenges ahead.  I just want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump) for including two provisions that I have been working on, one for over 10 years.  One of the widows of a former serviceman, a Navy officer in my state, for years had been denied, denied compensation for his very, very untimely death. He suffered from a very rare disease, a lung cancer that usually is the result of plutonium exposure.  He was one of those who was on the U.S.S. McKinley during an atomic test--code named operation wigwam. The Record shows that Tom McCarthy was bathed in an atomic aerosol that more than likely contained plutonium, and then suffered the onset of cancer and a premature death. Bronchiolo alveolar carcinoma, the malady Tom was infected with is a nonsmoking disease that is usually induced by exposure to plutonium.  Unfortunately, his widow, Joan McCarthy, was denied year after year after year when she would put in claims to the VA. That is a profound injustice that my provision sets right. This legislation finally, belatedly recognizes that her claim is legitimate, authentic, and ought to be paid. It seems to me, this is the very least our action can do. As a matter of fact, we owe Joan an apology for our collective indifference for her loss.  Again, I want to thank the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump) throughout two decades, and Mr. Montgomery when he was here was always very supportive of this legislation when he was chairman. We have finally succeeded in righting, to some extent, a terrible wrong which will now help this widow and other widows who have suffered.  I also want to thank the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) for their support of the respite care provisions.                              {time}  1745  Respite care is one of those very often unrecognized needs. The caregivers who spend on average about 10\1/2\ hours a day helping disabled loved ones, usually their family members. And in this case we are talking about veterans, many of whom are World War II veterans. My legislation, which is now a provision and tax bill, will provide contract care, the ability, the authority for the VA to contract so that that respite care can be given. Under current law, in order to receive respite care benefits, the caregiver has to put the loved one into a VA or State nursing home. That is so onerous and unworkable that in 1998, only 232 cases of respite care was provided by the VA; and we know that the need exceeds that. This new VA authority vests the VA with the ability to contract out for respite care.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank all of those who were involved in writing this legislation. Our staff has been extraordinarily effective. We had a very challenging conference with the Senate. But, thankfully, there was a meeting of the minds. Prudent compromises were agreed to. So I salute the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) for their extraordinary leadership. They are great friends of the veteran. This is an outstanding bill. I urge support for it.
