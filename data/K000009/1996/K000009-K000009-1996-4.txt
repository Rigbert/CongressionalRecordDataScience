Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, albeit very briefly. I did want to follow up on one of the gentleman's comments regarding the gentlewoman from Illinois [Mrs. Collins] and her long service here in this institution and the tremendous contributions that she has made, not just on this legislation, but on important areas of airline safety, of sports equity, workers' rights, and humanitarian causes that have benefited people in our country and across the globe.  As the gentlewoman finishes her service here in the Congress, it is important for the record and for the history books to note that she is the longest serving woman of African-American descent to have served in this body, and done so in such a distinguished manner for so many years. I wanted to call our colleagues' special attention to her and to thank her on behalf of the people of this institution and our country. I thank you, Mrs. Collins. It has been an honor to serve with you.
