 Speaker, the U.S. taxpayer is the single largest supporter of biomedical research in the world, spending $33 billion--in 1994 alone--for biomedical and related health research. Yet the taxpayer is not getting a fair return on their investment--paying twice for health care inventions, first as taxpayers and second as consumers.  It is incumbent upon the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require a reasonable relationship between the pricing of drugs, the public investment in those drugs, and the health and safety needs of the public. Unfortunately, taxpayer accountability was tossed aside when the Nation's reasonable pricing policy on drugs--which was put in place by the bush administration--was dropped in April 1995.  The reasonable pricing clause was dropped after extensive review of the policy, even though the review resulted in no certain recommendations. The rationale for this decision was that ``the pricing clause had driven industry away from potentially beneficial scientific collaborations with the Public Health Service.'' Yet, there was no hard evidence given during the review to show that this was the case--only anecdotal stories by the drug industry.  When 42 percent of all U.S. health care research and development expenditures is paid for by the taxpayer, and 92 percent of the cancer drugs developed since 1955 were developed with Federal funding, we owe it to the taxpayer to give them a fair return on their investment with a reasonable price on the drugs they paid to develop. The Health Care Research and Development and Consumer Protection Act reinstates the reasonable pricing clause and gives the Secretary of HHS the authority to waive the clause when it is determined to be in the public interest to do so.  In determining a reasonable price for a drug, the Secretary shall consider--  The public interest in continued health care research and development;  The contribution of the person marketing such drug to the drug research and development expenses, including the amount, timing, and risk of investment in such research development;  The contribution of the Federal Government to the research and development of such drug, including the amount, timing, and risk of investment in such research and development;  The therapeutic value of such drugs;  The number patients who are expected to purchase drug;  The cost of producing and marketing of such drug;  The cost of therapies which are similar to the therapy using such drug; and  Other relevant factors.  In addition to restoring the reasonable pricing clause, this legislation will promote the research and development of new drugs by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt rules which set out minimum levels of reinvestment in research and development for persons engaged in the manufacture of drugs sold in the United States.  I urge my colleagues to restore accountability to the U.S. taxpayer and support The Health Care Research and Development and Consumer Protection Act.                          ____________________
