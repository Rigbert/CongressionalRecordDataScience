Speaker, it is with both gratitude and sadness that I rise to honor the Parliamentarian of the House, Charles W. Johnson, on his upcoming retirement. Charlie has long served the House, and he has done so with distinction, integrity, and honor. He has embodied the nonpartisan traditions that make the Parliamentarian's Office one of the most respected institutions in this House.  Through our constant debating of matters large and small, Charlie has remained a calm head guiding us through our differences with a quiet grace. His abiding love for the institution and his knowledge of the rules are unparalleled. He will be greatly missed. I deeply appreciate his service and wish him well. As he passes into retirement, we all bid a fond farewell to an unsung hero who kept the great wheels of this democracy turning.
