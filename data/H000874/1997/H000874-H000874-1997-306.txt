Speaker, after 39 years of outstanding service the military career of Gen. John Shalikashvili will come to a close today. In my role as a cochairman of the bipartisan National Security Caucus [NSC] I had the honor and pleasure of presiding at a retirement ceremony for the General last week. I was joined by my fellow NSC cochairman, Senator Charles Robb (D-VA), as well as Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and Representative Jane Harman (D-CA).  Rather than saying ``farewell,'' the caucus organized this event to say ``well done'' to General Shalikashvili. He is truly deserving of this recognition because of his tremendous contributions to America's national security interests, and his life is a classic American success story.  General Shalikashvili was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1936. He was the first foreign-born Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the first draftee to become Chairman and the first Chairman who was a graduate of Officer Candidate School.  During his military career, General Shalikashvili held a number of prestigious commands. He served as commander of the 9th Infantry Division and was the commander of Operation Provide Comfort, the relief operation that returned hundreds of Kurdish refugees to Northern Iraq. His last position before being named Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe and Commander in Chief, European Command.  During the tenure of General Shalikashvili as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there was an explosion in the number of military operations conducted by the Armed Forces of the United States, in such diverse areas of the world as Haiti, Bosnia, the Taiwan Straits, Kuwait, the Korean Peninsula and in and around the Arabian Peninsula. While most of these operations were peacekeeping or humanitarian in nature, a significant number of them were strike or deterrent operations.  Among the General's many accomplishments as Chairman have included NATO enlargement, the Partnership for Peace, the North Korean Nuclear Framework Agreement, new defense arrangements with Japan including revision of the status of Okinawa, as well as many projects concerning the Gulf States and Israel.  One of the last accomplishments of the General's tenure was the production of the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR]. The QDR began the serious solution of the biggest hole in our defense program: the $20 billion modernization shortfall. With personnel reduction and cuts in aircraft and other programs, the Chairman has reduced roughly half of the shortfall and has laid the groundwork for the reduction of the remainder.  In short, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili confronted historic change, responded to nontraditional military missions and prepared America's Armed Forces for the challenge of the 21st century. General Shalikashvili's extraordinary service has brought great credit upon himself, the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense, and the Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record the remarks of Senator Max Cleland (D-GA) regarding the General's retirement. The Senator is also a cochairman of the National Security Caucus and is well known as a hero of the Vietnam war.                    Statement of Senator Max Cleland       I am honored to be here to pay tribute to an outstanding      American who exemplifies the highest of American ideals. Many      Americans admire him for overcoming the tragedy of World War      II by coming to the United States and fulfilling the American      dream. Others praise him for the outstanding leadership he      has shown over the past four years.       Indeed, the military has faced many challenges over the      past several years. General Shalikashvili's efforts, however,      have insured that the military has not only met each of these      challenges but has excelled.       While I share these sentiments, as a Vietnam veteran, I am      particularly proud of the fact that one of my comrades has      led the Department. Those American soldiers who lived through      the Vietnam era and its aftermath understand what soldiering      is really about. They understand the meaning of sacrifice.       They understand what a national defense really means. That      without one cold, hungry, scared 19-year-old soldier being      willing to leave his foxhole and advance we have no national      defense.       General Shalikashvili understands these principles. He      learned them when he was a young child, a child who witnessed      the horrors of war in Europe and returned there as an adult      to lead the military of the world's foremost defender of      freedom and democracy. General Shalikashvili did just that      when he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the United      States' European Command, a leader of all NATO forces.       I am extremely proud of the service he has rendered to the      United States. We owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for      a job well done.       General, God bless you and your family on your retirement.                                 ____________________
