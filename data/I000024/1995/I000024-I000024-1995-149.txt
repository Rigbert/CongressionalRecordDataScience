DORGAN. The point I make is this: We developed the triad, ground missiles, sea-based missiles and air-launched nuclear capability, which has for decades persuaded countries far better armed than the potential terrorists you suggest from not even thinking about attacking this country. And I am just saying this: When we start taking the potential of the North Koreans developing a missile and deciding the result is America ought to consign itself to a $40 billion new program, at the time we say to the American elderly that we have got to cut $270 billion in Medicare because we do not have the money, or at the time we say to American kids that we are sorry about student aid, we do not have quite enough money, and quite enough money for nutrition programs, I am saying the priorities are out of whack.  Am I saying defense does not matter? No. I am saying that the Secretary of Defense, the folks that know this program, the folks that have spent a long, long while concerned about and evaluating the need for a ballistic missile defense system are saying it is wrong. It is wrong what is being proposed. The extra money should not be spent. This program should not be deployed. And it is not in this country's national interest.
