Oberstar for his leadership and for what he is trying to do today.  What I would like to do with my time is first of all to respond to a couple of the observations made by my good friend from Pennsylvania on this legislation.  I would agree, I believe the chairman would agree, that the industry has to continue to evolve. It has to continue to grow. But today, the industry is here and the people of the United States are here. What Mr. Oberstar, what the chairman is trying to do is to make sure as the industry evolves and becomes more efficient and more profitable, which we all want, that people are considered equally.  Secondly, he mentions that this is simply a fight about one transaction and one community, the City of Chicago. He is incorrect in his assertion. The fact is there is a transaction pending. It highlights the need for this legislation. While he suggests the congestion of Chicago, I would point out that every one of those trains in Chicago happens to go through Lake and Porter counties, Indiana, which I represent.  The gentleman also suggested that there might be some costs attached to the industry if this act passed, $25 million here, $40 million here. The fact is we voted in this Chamber to the auto industry $25 billion. We voted within the week to give the battery industry a couple of billion dollars. People are tripping over themselves in this place, tripping over themselves in this place, to give millions of brokers and bankers $700 billion. What about people? What about the people of this country? That's what Mr. Oberstar is trying to say, instead of the railroads and the people, let's have some equity as far as these future considerations.  I would simply point out this is somewhat personal to me. In 1977, my mother was hit by a train. She survived the experience. But more pertinent to this debate, the Surface Transportation Board indicated that railroads historically have not paid more than a small share for grade separation.
