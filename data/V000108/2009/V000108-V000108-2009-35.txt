Geneva will be celebrating this milestone with family and friends on Saturday, April 18, 2009, at her home in Gary, Indiana. One of Gary's proudest and most adored residents for over 63 years, Geneva Williamson Poole is an inspiration to countless members of her community as well as her beloved family.  Geneva Williamson Poole was born on April 16, 1909, in Augusta, Georgia, to John and Mary Williamson. Geneva was raised with three sisters and two brothers and was brought up on strong Southern values and profound love. In 1936, she moved to Gary, Indiana, making her home with her four children: Justine, Virginia, Jerome, and Berniece, and her husband, Charlie Poole. Through the years, Geneva worked at many local businesses in Northwest Indiana, including: Barnette's Clothing Store, Dave's Fur Store, Westville Hospital, and Kingsbury Ordnance Plant. While she enjoyed the positions she held, Geneva devoted her life to her family and her community. Geneva's belief in strong family values has taught her children and grandchildren the meaning of a strong work ethic, the value of education, and how important it is for family and communities to stick together. Always leading by example, in 1982, Geneva planted a community garden at the end of her block, and she would give the fruits and vegetables to the people of the neighborhood. An extraordinary cook, Geneva was also known for hosting elaborate dinner parties for family and members of the community. As a senior citizen, Geneva adopted two children, Kathy and Vanetta, and helped raise her thirteen grandchildren. In the summers, Geneva has enjoyed opening her home to her grandchildren and teaching them how to sew, cook, garden, and fish. Geneva's passion for family has touched not only those related to her but also many members of the community. For passing along such essential family values, Geneva is worthy of our deepest admiration.  In addition to her remarkable dedication to her family, Geneva continues to serve her community as an active member at Israel Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Gary, where she participates in many of the church's programs. Geneva has many friends and loved ones within the church who look to her for advice. They share a common respect for her commendable qualities, including her intelligence, wittiness, strength and perseverance. She is truly an inspiration and a role model for us all.  Madam Speaker, Geneva Williamson Poole has always generously given her time and efforts to preserving family values and strengthening the community in Gary, Indiana. She has taught her family, friends, and members of her community the true meaning of selfless devotion. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in wishing Geneva a very Happy 100th Birthday!                          ____________________
