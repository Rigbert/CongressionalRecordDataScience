 President, I rise today--along with my good friend, Senator Hatch--to offer our bill, the White-Collar Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002 as a second-degree amendment to amendment No. 4174, Senator Leahy's amendment to S. 2637.  Let me begin by applauding Senator Sarbanes for his leadership in sponsoring S. 2637, and guiding it through his Banking Committee with a 17-4 vote. It is my hope and expectation that it will win the same overwhelming support on the floor of the Senate. I also commend Senators Leahy and Daschle for offering the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, of which I am a cosponsor.  Let me briefly recount the events which bring me to the floor today to offer this amendment to increase penalties on white collar criminals. In recent months, dramatic events have shaken our country out of complacency. A decade of peace and prosperitycame to an end, first with a shattering reminder of our vulnerability to external threats, and then with a series of spectacular corporate collapses that revealed cracks in the very foundation of our economic system.  Our response to terrorism was to come together as a nation, reminded of all we have in common, all we have to be proud of.  The shock of those high-flying corporations falling spectacularly to earth presents us with different problems. We have to examine our own system--the capitalist system that has brought us so much material success, the envy of the rest of the world.  As the stock market continues to lose value, as the dollar has dropped to a 2-year low, we know that investors, here at home and abroad, have lost some of their faith in the American economy.  That loss of faith has a material impact of the wealth of this country, as our currency and our securities lose value. Some observers worry aloud that a full-blown loss of faith in our economy could drain even more value from our markets.  The task before us is nothing less than restoring confidence in our market economy. There are many facets to this problem.  One is reforming the auditing process. On the Senate floor right now is the Sarbanes bill that is essential to any effort to restore investor's faith in our markets. Audit firms are supposed to be independent voices, providing disinterested information that investors need to assess risk and to allocate funds to those companies that will have the best chance of raising our standard of living.  We need more transparency, more accountability in the conduct of accounting firms, and more confidence that they have access to, and are willing to tell us, the truth about the businesses they audit. Senator Sarbanes has done us all a service by bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor.  Yesterday, I was hoping to hear the President support this bipartisan approach to reform, reform that is supported by the business community in the form of the Business Roundtable, when he spoke yesterday. I still hope he will soon add his voice in support of this landmark reform.  Just as important is the amendment to the Sarbanes bill that I am cosponsoring with Senator Leahy. It will put real teeth in securities fraud enforcement, providing substantial criminal penalties for those who defraud investors of publically traded securities or who destroy evidence to obstruct justice.  Yesterday, the President announced his support for tougher criminal penalties for fraud offenses. I applaud the President's call for increase penalties for wire and mail fraud, and my amendment contains identical provisions. But I am concerned that the President's proposals do not go far enough.  For example, in the wake of the publicly reported problems at Enron, WorldCom, and other companies, we need to restore people's faith in their pension plans. They need to know that the companies they work for will treat them fairly, handle their funds wisely, and that the investments made by pension funds are sound. Yet, I believe that the criminal penalties for violations under the Employment Retirement Investment Security Act of 1974, ERISA, limited to 1 year in jail, are woefully inadequate to protect defrauded pensioners.  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I held a hearing several weeks ago--and am holding a second hearing this afternoon--on the adequacy of criminal penalties to deter this type of corporate wrongdoing. Corporate executives who defraud investors by whatever means should go to jail--period--and we need to give investigators and prosecutors the tools they need to send them there.  One thing most of our hearing witnesses agreed on was that there is a ``penalty gap'' between white collar crimes and other crimes. For example, if a kid steals your car and drives it over the 14th Street Bridge into Northern Virginia, he could get up to 10 years in jail under the Federal interstate auto theft law. Yet, if a corporate CEO steals your pension and commits a criminal violation under ERISA, he is only subject to 1 year in jail.  At my hearing, we heard from Charlie Prestwood, a 63-year-old Enron retiree, who lives in Conroe, TX. Charlie worked proudly for some 33 years for that company, saved and invested in his pension, and retired with about $1.3 million in his plan. Within a few tragic months, that was nearly wiped out--only $8,000 remained. Charlie is not a lawyer, but he had the good sense to know that its just not fair that a car thief who steals a jalopy can get 10 years in prison and a Gucci-clad corporate crook can steal a person's life savings and might only end up with 1 year in prison.  Accordingly, the amendment that Senator Hatch and I offer today is carefully crafted to hold corporate officer responsible and to reduce the ``penalty gap'' between a number of white collar crimes and other serious crimes. It does 3 basic things.  First, it goes beyond President Bush's proposal by raising penalties for those white collar crimes that are most often violated but which have insufficient penalties to deter corporate crooks. For example, it raises the maximum penalties from 1 to 10 years for ERISA criminal violations. It double penalties for wire and mail fraud from 5 to 10 years, and it treats white collar who conspire with others like drug king pins, by mandating that they receive the same maximum penalty for the offense underlying the charged conspiracy, rather than their sentence being capped at a 5-year penalty as exists under current law.  When these penalty enhancements are taken in combination with the new 10-year felony for securities fraud contained in the amendment I have co-sponsored with Senator Leahy, the Government will have the full range of prosecutorial arrows in its quiver to fight pension crooks and corporate wrong doers. Respectfully, the President's penalty proposal is only one small piece of the white collar crime-fighting puzzle.  Second, our amendment tells corporate big wigs that they are no longer off the hook for their companies misdeeds. My amendment requires top corporate officials to certify to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the periodic financial reports filed by their companies with the Commission accurately reflect the financial health of these corporations. Reckless failure by a corporate official to do so will result in up to 5 years in prison, while willful failure to do so will trigger a jail term of up to 10 years.  Third, our amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend the federal sentencing guidelines to lengthen sentences for white collar criminals to reflect these new, more serious penalties. It also directs the Commission to impose sentencing enhancement where corporate officials defraud victims. I applaud President Bush for announcing a similar proposal.  Make no mistake--this amendment will not stamp out white collar crime. We live in a fallen world where bad people do bad things--whether its stealing cars or stealing pensions. But, its time to ``level the playing field'' between white collar and blue collar criminals.  I believe the amendment that Senator Hatch and I are offering will move us substantially in the direction of deterring corporate wrongdoers by holding them responsible for the criminal acts. It will also begin the restoration of confidence in our financial markets. We must do both. The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I yield the floor.                           amendment no. 4188
