President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to Carolyn Meub, Executive Director of Pure Water for the World, a Vermont-based nonprofit organization that brings clean water to thousands of families in Honduras and Haiti.  Last week, the White House honored Carolyn as one of 10 Rotary Club members from across the country who are improving the lives of others through volunteer work. Carolyn has transformed Pure Water for the World from a small Rotary club project into an effective international NGO. Under her leadership, the organization is implementing a sustainable model for clean water programs by building clean water filtration systems, providing hygiene education, and installing latrines to improve sanitation. Twenty-thousand Honduran families now have access to clean drinking water, and 1,200 schools in Haiti have clean water systems and hygiene education curriculums, because of Pure Water for the World. That is no small feat.  As Carolyn points out, clean water is a tap away for most Americans, but for more than three-quarters of a billion of the world's people accessing safe water is a daily struggle. The United Nations reports that 3.5 million people die each year from diseases related to drinking contaminated water.  In February, my wife Marcelle visited Port-au-Prince as part of a delegation I led with five other Members of Congress, where she saw firsthand the simple, inexpensive household water filtration systems being built and donated by Pure Water for the World. Each unit, the size of an office water cooler and made of concrete or plastic, is filled with layers of sand and gravel that trap microorganisms as the water passes through. This process of slow sand filtration is inexpensive and produced from local materials, making it ideally suited for developing countries.  Pure Water for the World is doing important and inspiring work, providing sustainable sources of safe drinking water and promoting habits to improve health and sanitation in poor communities in Honduras and Haiti. I am very proud that Carolyn received this well-deserved recognition at the White House on behalf of her organization. We all appreciate the work they are doing.  I ask unanimous consent that the Rutland Herald article entitled ``Hope flows: Vt. nonprofit pours `Pure Water for the World' '' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Mar. 18, 2012]      Hope Flows: Vt. Nonprofit Pours ``Pure Water for the World''                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       Rutland resident Carolyn Crowley Meub didn't fret when her      hometown turned on its faucets two weeks ago to find, due to      a water main break, the usually clean stream down to a dirty      trickle. She was flying off to the Caribbean--specifically,      to Haiti, where the situation is even worse.       Meub is one of several prominent Vermonters who've recently      witnessed the problems of the earthquake ravaged island--and      the solutions of the Green Mountains-based nonprofit Pure      Water for the World, which is aiming to pour hope across      hemispheres to mark United Nations World Water Day on      Thursday.       For most Americans, clean water is a tap away. But 1      billion people worldwide drink from contaminated springs and      streams, the United Nations reports, while 3.5 million people      die each year from related diseases.       State Rep. Margaret Cheney, D Norwich, joined her husband,      U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D Vt., in a February tour of the      Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, where, between a      congressional delegation's visits with the country's      president and actor Sean Penn's relief organization, she saw      the water challenge firsthand.       ``It's the poorest, most chaotic scene in the world,''      Cheney says of crowded slums equipped with little more than      rain barrels. ``The water can be the unknown bearer of      terrible diseases. Catch them and you can't work, you can't      go to school, you can't really function.''       Organizations like the U.S. Agency for International      Development are working to help densely populated areas of      the globe that report 75 percent of the problem. But that      leaves more than 250 million people without potable water in      remote rural settings. Enter Vermont's Pure Water, which is      installing simple, inexpensive household filters in      developing countries in the Caribbean and Central America.       Dr. Noelle Thabault, a Burlington native, graduated from      the University of Vermont College of Medicine before      practicing in Rutland. After a magnitude 7.0 earthquake      decimated Haiti in 2010, she flew to Port-au-Prince as a Pure      Water volunteer and now serves as its deputy regional      director.       ``I recognized the role that lack of clean water plays in      illness,'' Thabault recalls of her knowledge before arriving,      ``but I had no understanding of the scope of the problem.''       Two years in the trenches, Thabault recently hosted Cheney      and Marcelle Leahy, wife of U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D Vt.      The doctor told them that more than 40 percent of Haitians      live without clean water, leading to diseases that are the      country's second leading cause of death and fill more than      half of all hospital beds with patients suffering from      bacteria or parasites.       ``Clean water is so necessary,'' says Marcelle Leahy,      herself a nurse. ``But Haiti unfortunately was lacking a lot      of the necessities of everyday life even prior to the      earthquake.''       Most U.S. municipalities filter water at central reservoirs      and then distribute it through pipes. But that doesn't work      in Caribbean and Central American villages with more poverty      than plumbing. Cheney and Leahy visited a Pure Water plant      that manufactures the kind of ``slow sand'' household filters      used in New England for its first 150 years.       Pure Water taps the sand system because it costs as little      as $150 to produce, install and monitor; requires no moving      parts or electricity; and can be built with locally available      materials. Each unit, shaped of concrete or plastic and sized      like an office water cooler, is filled with several layers of      sand and gravel. Pour in water, and the mixture traps      microorganisms that, in turn, decompose other organic      material.       Water that passes through the filter is clear in color,      taste and smell. More importantly, it's rid of up to 90      percent of toxins, 97 percent of fecal coliform bacteria and      100 percent of worms and parasites.       ``It's such a clever, simple concept, and it works,'' Leahy      says. ``You're employing people, they're earning a living and      improving their health.''       Cheney, for her part, was equally impressed by Pure Water      posters written in Creole that explain the importance of      proper hand-washing, hygiene and waste disposal.       ``They're providing really simple tools and educational      efforts--the common-sense Vermont way--to help make this      sustainable,'' Cheney says. ``They have a great banner that      says, `Clean water is medicine.' We take it so for granted,      but that's the basic key to recovery.''       Pure Water bubbled up two decades ago after Brattleboro      dentist Peter Abell traveled to El Salvador and saw people      drinking dirty water that caused diarrhea, cholera and      dysentery. Abell's local Rotary club went on to raise money      to provide clean water in El Salvador and later Honduras,      then incorporated its volunteer efforts into the Pure Water      nonprofit, which Meub has headed from Rutland for the past 10      years.       Pure Water so far has spent at least $5 million on projects      to provide safe drinking water--a comparatively small sum      compared with the $20 billion a year the United Nations      estimates it would cost to provide clean water to everyone on      the planet. But as Meub notes, helping one family, one      school, one community at a time, ``many drops of water      eventually fill a bucket.''       Americans, for their part, annually spend billions on      store-bought bottled water. Consider what Rutlanders were      willing to pay after the city's recent main break. As Meub      was packing for her trip, husband William Meub fielded calls      from fellow residents wondering how many hours they'd lack      water. He recalled his own travels to Haiti after the      earthquake.       ``They let me take a shower with a yogurt container full of      water,'' the lawyer says. ``It's a whole different experience      than anyone here has any familiarity with.       That's why Pure Water is streaming its message (the latest:      Gov. Peter Shumlin will promote World Water Day this week      with a proclamation) through Facebook, Twitter and the      website purewaterfortheworld.org.       Says Carolyn Meub: ``Safe drinking water should be a basic      human right.''       And Thabault: ``All other interventions--the rebuilding of      roads and schools and hospitals and communities--will not      result in a long-term sustainable improvement if people don't      have clean water. People need to support organizations that      are bringing clean water, hygiene education and sanitation to      homes and schools. That's how they can help.''                          ____________________
