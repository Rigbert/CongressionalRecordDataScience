Speaker, this bill makes all those folks pawns in Republicans' single-focused quest to undo health care reform at the expense of every other pressing challenge we face as a Nation.  It's shameful, Mr. Speaker, that this House continues to waste the American people's times on health care repeal votes that won't go anywhere, and they know it. The Senate will not pass this bill and the President will not sign it.  We have pressing business before us that needs immediate attention: finishing appropriations bills, completing our work on the budget that provides a balanced alternative to the sequester, ensuring America can pay its bills, and taking action to create jobs. That's what we ought to be doing, not this continued foolishness.                              {time}  1115
