President, the Republican leadership's actions this week were an attempt to create the impression that Senate Democrats are stalling judicial nominations. Rather than work with us to confirm the five consensus judicial nominations that have been before the Senate and available for action all week, the Republican leadership has chosen to schedule cloture vote after cloture vote on the most divisive, controversial and extreme of this President's judicial nominees.  Senators have spoken to the contentious nominations Republicans have tried to force through the Senate confirmation process this week. This is a striking difference from the days in which more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were stalled and defeated by anonymous holds and secret objections. Just as I made Judiciary Committee blue slips and the process by which the committee consults with home-state Senators public when I chaired the committee in 2001, Democratic Senators have not opposed nominees without coming before the Senate and making known their concerns.  During the 17 months a Democratic Senate majority reviewed this President's judicial nominees we were able to confirm 100 judges. This year, we have cooperated in the confirmation of 45 additional judges. The total confirmations already number 145. We have worked in good faith to reduce judicial vacancies to the lowest level in the last 13 years and to increase the full-time judge on the Federal bench across the country to the highest number in our history. We continue to work in good faith and the Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee have joined in reporting at least a dozen additional judicial nominations favorably to the Senate. Working together the Republican and Democratic leadership will be able to schedule debate and votes on those judges.  There are other nominees I frankly do not support and that large numbers of Senators do not support. And yet, as chairman, I did something our Republican predecessor never did, I proceeded on judicial nominations I opposed. Some were confirmed; a few have been so extreme and controversial that they have not been confirmed. Ours is a good record and a fair record.  It is a record that shows we have sought, as Senator Baucus explained recently, to protect the essential independence of the judiciary, to support fair-minded impartial judges, and to protect the essential rights of all Americans.  This week we have witnessed a number of unsuccessful cloture petitions. When the Republicans filed these petitions they knew they would be unsuccessful. The Republican leadership was nonetheless insistent on diverting hours from debate on the Energy bill in order to create partisan talking points. This is another example of how this administration and its aides here in the Senate are seeking to use judicial nominations for partisan purposes. That is most unfortunate.  Republican partisans have changed the practices and rules of the Senate that have helped over time to encourage the White House to work with home-State Senators and to consult with both sides of the aisle in the Senate. When judicial nominations were being made by a Democratic President, the objection of a single home-State Senator would have prevented any action on a judicial nomination. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee acknowledged in 1999, under the practices of the committee, no nomination opposed by both home-State Senators would proceed. Yet now that the President is a Republican and the home-State Senators are Democrats, the rules are changed and traditional practices are conveniently abandoned.  The big picture is that we have the most confrontational President in recent history. His administration is committed to a plan to pack the Federal courts with nominees of a narrow judicial ideology. Compounding the situation, the Republican leadership in the Senate has decided to assist the administration in this effort at all costs. Longstanding Senate practices and rules have been broken. Home-State Senators are being ignored or overridden if they are Democratic Senators, committee rules are being breached, committee practices of the last 25 years are being ignored in a rush to steamroll the Senate.  Sadly, the most partisans have made detestable arguments and injected religion into the debate. Regrettably, the Senate under its current leadership has abandoned its constitutional role as a check on the Executive.  So we have the most aggressive Administration in recent history and its efforts to pack the courts are being facilitated by efforts of the Republican Senate majority and its willingness to remove all the processes and practices that had been available to the Senate to provide a check and balance. As they remove the mechanisms that had traditionally provided incentives for the Executive to consult with the Senate, the administration has refused to moderate its actions. Instead, Republican partisans have ratcheted up the points of contention and conflict. Rather than work in a bipartisan way to unite the country and maintain a balanced and independent federal judiciary, Republicans insist on the expedited confirmation of every nomination no matter how extreme. With all of the other, traditional screening mechanisms removed, only one Senate procedure is left--the filibuster. All their talk about supposed obstructionism is just that, partisan talkingpoints. The factors that have led to more filibusters than usual this week have been the actions of the administration and Senate Republicans.  These matters need not be contentious. The process starts with the President. If this administration would work with us, we could avoid these situations. We have and will continue to work with the administration. We would like to be more helpful in the President's identification of nominees and advising him on the selection of consensus nominees so that we can join together in adding those confirmations to the 145 so far achieved.                          ____________________
