 This bill is targeted at creating jobs by providing targeted relief to our Nation's job engine, and that happens to be small businesses.  Our Nation is currently facing challenging economic times, as we have now for about 20 months. While there have been some signs of improvement, such as the recent growth of our gross domestic product, job losses continue to mount and many hard-working Americans are struggling to make ends meet. According to our Bureau of Labor Statistics, around 8 million jobs have been lost since our economy officially slipped into recession in December of 2007.
