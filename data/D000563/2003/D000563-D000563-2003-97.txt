Since President Bush was elected to be President, he has had 168 of his judicial nominees approved by this Senate, and 4 have not been approved--the 4 the Senator from Nevada mentioned earlier.  I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada, am I mistaken that in this Constitution which we are all sworn to uphold, article II, section 2, it says that the President shall have the power to make his appointments with the advice and consent of the Senate? I wouldlike to ask the Senator what that phrase could possibly mean--advice and consent--if it is the position of the Republicans that every nominee has to be approved. If they believe that approving 98 percent is not adequate, that we have to approve 100 percent, I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada what the phrase ``advice and consent'' means. Shouldn't it just be ``consent''?
