  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, to follow on the comments of the person preceding me in the well, there will be much fanfare this September about the looming budget surplus, no end of ideas on how to spend these monies. That side of the aisle is going to promote tax cuts, with the exception of the gentleman who spoke before me.  Let us get some facts: 73 percent of the American people pay more in Social Security taxes than income taxes. We all pay this tax, knowing it goes to support our parents, our grandparents, the disabled, and, hopefully, ourselves, when we retire. This year Social Security will have a $90 billion surplus.  Guess what? The so-called Federal budget surplus is the future Social Security trust fund. If we spend it today on tax cuts, it will not be there tomorrow for America's retirees.  We better step back and think about that before we jam this bill through in an attempt to get reelected and be popular in an election year at the cost of the future of Social Security.                          ____________________
