 President, William has many friends in the Senate, both Senate staffers and Members of the Senate. I was listening to my friend from Alabama discuss William's distinguished career on my television monitor, and I decided to come over and make an observation, if it is appropriate.  I remember running into William one time. I said:       What is your principal duty with Senator Sessions?  He said:       Well, it's to keep him from drifting off to the left.  I say to our friend William: You have done a good job of keeping Senator Sessions from drifting off to the left. You have had a distinguished run here in the U.S. Senate, and I am sure I am not the only Member of the Senate who hopes we will see you again in public service some day. I wish you well in your new endeavor.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
