Speaker, late last month the Office of Compliance reported on its comprehensive fire-safety inspections of the three Library of Congress buildings.  After previous dire warnings over the last two years from the House Inspector General and the Compliance Office about the state of fire protection in the Capitol and congressional office buildings, I had hoped for a better report on conditions at the Library. Unfortunately, the Compliance Office found that the Library buildings suffer from many of the same deficiencies as the Capitol and congressional buildings.  I strongly believe that Congress must take every reasonable step to maximize the physical safety of the thousands who work in the Capitol complex every day and of the millions who visit every year. Congress also has a responsibility to safeguard the numerous valuable artifacts, many of them irreplaceable, which are housed in the Capitol and among the Library's collections.  In view of the Compliance Office's findings at the Library, the new Chairman of the House Administration Committee [Mr. Ney] and I have written jointly to the Architect of the Capitol, who has responsibility for maintaining the Library's buildings, asking for a detailed report on the status of his efforts to correct the deficiencies there. Specifically, we have requested detailed plans, timelines, and an identification of any additional resources needed to complete the task. We have also written to the House Inspector General, who has demonstrated substantial expertise in fire-protection matters, asking his office to participate in regular meetings with Architect and Library staff, offer whatever guidance he deems appropriate, and monitor progress, as he does in connection with ongoing fire-safety work in the House.  Last September the Architect unveiled before the House Administration Committee a staff reorganization plan that places all AOC fire-safety work under the supervision of a single senior-level subordinate, as proposed in a bill (H.R. 4366) that I introduced in the last Congress. The AOC is clearly moving in the right direction and I appreciate the progress he has made. The Chairman and I look forward to working with the Architect to ensure the deficiencies previously noted, and those just identified at the Library, are remedied as soon as practicable. I include for the Record the texts of our letters to the Architect and the Inspector General of the House:                                         House of Representatives,                            Committee on House Administration,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2001.     Hon. Alan M. Hantman, AIA,     The Architect of the Capitol,     The Capitol.       Dear Mr. Hantman: We have received the recent Office of      Compliance report on its fire-safety inspections of the      Library of Congress buildings. As you know, the Office found      numerous fire-safety deficiencies in the three Library      buildings, the same types of deficiencies found last year      during thorough inspections of the Capitol and congressional      office buildings. We are greatly concerned about the report      and the grave danger posed to Library employees, visitors,      and to the Library's enormous collection of books and      artifacts, many irreplaceable, by decades of inadequate      attention to fire-safety matters. We know you share our      concern, and trust that you also share our determination to      see these additional deficiencies corrected at the earliest      possible date.       Toward that goal, we ask that you provide us immediately      with a comprehensive report on the status of AOC efforts to      correct deficiencies found in the Library buildings. Please      provide detailed plans for the correction of deficiencies      that remain uncorrected, including an identification of any      additional resources that you may need to complete the work      and timelines for its completion. We also ask that you assess      the level of fire protection now afforded to the Library's      most valuable artifacts, and indicate how you will prioritize      the correction of deficiencies related to their protection.       We appreciate the progress that AOC has made in addressing      fire-safety deficiencies in the House office buildings since      the Inspector General's and Compliance Office's previous      reports. We hope the Library can benefit from the AOC's      experience in addressing those deficiencies. In that vein, we      encourage you to incorporate into your approach for the      Library the use of frequent, regular meetings among AOC,      Library, and House Inspector General staff, to coordinate      efforts and facilitate communication . A similar approach has      worked well in the House.       Thanking you for your prompt attention to this request,      with kindest regards, we remain           Sincerely yours,     Bob Ney,       Chairman.     Steny H. Hoyer,       Ranking Minority Member.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                            Committee on House Administration,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2001.     Hon. Steven A. McNamara,     Inspector General, House of Representatives, Ford House          Office Building.       Dear Mr. McNamara: As you know, the Office of Compliance      just reported on the results of its fire-safety inspections      of the Library of Congress buildings. The Compliance Office      found numerous fire-safety deficiencies in the three Library      buildings, the same types of deficiencies that it and your      office found during prior inspections of the Capitol and      House office buildings. We are greatly concerned about the      danger posed to Library employees, visitors, and to the      Library's valuable collection of books and artifacts, many      irreplaceable, by the effects of decades of inadequate      attention to fire safety. We are eager to help the Architect      of the Capitol reverse these effects.       Your office has considerable expertise in such matters, and      you continue to oversee the Architect's efforts to correct      fire-safety deficiencies in the Capitol and House buildings.      We write to ask that you similarly monitor the AOC's work to      correct the fire-safety deficiencies at the Library, offer      the AOC and the Library whatever guidance you may deem      appropriate, and keep the Committee apprised of progress. As      work progresses, should you have any concerns, please bring      them to the Committee's attention immediately. To coordinate      efforts and facilitate communications, we have urged the      Architect to incorporate into his approach at the Library a      plan to conduct regular, frequent meetings among AOC staff,      Library staff and your staff, as he has done in the House.       Thanking you for your attention to this matter, with      kindest regards, we remain           Sincerely yours,     Bob Ney,       Chairman.     Steny H. Hoyer,       Ranking Minority Member.                          ____________________
