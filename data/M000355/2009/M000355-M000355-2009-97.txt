 McCAIN. Gladly.  Mr. McCONNELL. I recall our good friend, the majority leader, telling us on November 30 that we would be here the next two weekends. Then I recall our friend, the majority leader, saying Monday of this week we would be here this weekend.  My assumption was we were here to deal with this important issue that the majority has been indicating to everyone is so important, that we must stay here and do it. We are prepared to be here.  Mr. McCAIN. And vote.  Mr. McCONNELL. And vote. In fact, we have been trying to vote for a couple of days now, and it has been difficult to vote.  Mr. McCAIN. If we are not going to have a vote, maybe we ought to have a vote to table the pending amendments, at least to have the Senate on record.  Could I finally say, I know New Orleans is very nice this time of year, but perhaps we ought to stay here and get this job done?
