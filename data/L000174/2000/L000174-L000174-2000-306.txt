President, before we go to the Senator from Alabama, as I understand it, anything we may do tonight would be simply in the form of discussing amendments and then laid aside.  I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama on the floor.  I don't want to delay that any further.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
