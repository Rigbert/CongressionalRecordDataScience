Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief since I think we have come to the conclusion, but just to remind the body and I think it is important that this House on May 9th did pass the comprehensive legislation that would impose very, very tough new criminal penalties, up to life in imprisonment on those who traffic people into the United States or any part of that process and also to prevent automatic deportation, a protection for the women so that they can be helped while they are here. Eventually many of these women will get back to their country or at least some of them, I will not say many, and they will need protection when they get back, and that is what I think the gentleman's amendment and my amendment seeks to do.  We had authorized in that legislation $10 million for victims, and this is a modest down payment on that authorization. So I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Chairman Callahan) and I think his word is his bond and I think we are off to a good start here.
