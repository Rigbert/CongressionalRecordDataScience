Speaker, today I am introducing by request legislation that reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through the year 2000 at unspecified annual appropriations. I am joined by Messrs. de la Garza, Ewing, and Rose.  The CFTC is the independent agency charged with regulating the Nation's 10 active commodity futures exchanges, the professional brokerage community of futures commission merchants and introducing brokers, commodity trading advisers and pool operators. Futures exchanges for years have met the vital economic needs of price discovery and risk management to U.S. agriculture. And, during the last 20 years, we have seen an explosion of trading in exchange derivative products on industrial and precious metals and energy commodities as well as financial instruments. Interest rate and stock index contracts continue to show phenomenal growth trends as more and more commercial and industrial enterprises understand the benefits of hedging economic risks in the futures and options markets.  Within the past decade, useful off-exchange markets have developed in individually negotiated instruments with characteristics of traditional futures and option contracts.  The CFTC is there to make sure the designated exchanges continue to promote fair and orderly trading, to police legitimate over-the-counter markets and to prosecute with State law enforcement authorities illegal boiler room activities that have operated for years in the gray areas of the Commodity Exchange Act.  My colleagues and I believe a simple, 5-year authorization is appropriate at this time, since the Commission's regulatory activities were thoroughly debated during the last reauthorization, which was concluded in October, 1992. The Commission operated without authorization during fiscal years 1990 through 1992 while the Congress debated several issues of crucial importance to our financial markets. The CFTC has been without an authorization so far in this current fiscal year, and this committee must assume its legislative responsibilities. There still are outstanding issues and questions about competitiveness and regulatory intrusions, but I would hope that we could deal with them, if necessary, in separate legislation.  In that regard, the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 required the precise, independent and unalterable recordation of all trade executions to be an industry standard by October 1995. The Congress rightly understood the technological problems involved in attaining this mark and provided some flexibility. I might add here that the House committee report making appropriations for fiscal year 1995 concluded that the exchanges had made good faith efforts to meet the audit trail requirements. The Appropriations Committee said it expected the Commission to grant an extension to the exchanges beyond the 1995 deadline. Although I, as one Member, have not concluded whether or not the Commission should grant the extension, it is up to the Committee on Agriculture to deal with this matter.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, off-exchange derivatives trading has been making headlines recently. Procter & Gamble, Gibson Greeting Cards, and other private companies as well as several public funds, including the now famous fund controlled by Orange County, CA, have lost large sums of money through derivatives investments. Many of these transactions may have been made without adequate understanding of the risks involved in highly leveraged instruments. There may have been breaches of fiduciary responsibilities in some of these cases. At any rate, so far the regulators have held their fire in requesting new authorities. I understand the SEC is asking for some voluntary restrictions of certain unregulated subsidiaries of SEC registrants, but, beyond that and other administrative actions taken recently by banking regulators, I would hope the Congress moves cautiously in this area of financial regulation.  Derivatives are not new even though a casual reading of the business press would lead you to a different conclusion. There is little the Congress can do to legislate against poor judgement. In those instances where fraud is found, then there are appropriate laws to deal with the problem. To restrict the legitimate uses of derivatives--and few doubt their legitimacy whether they are exchange-traded futures and options or over-the-counter hedging and investment instruments--would be a profound error.                          ____________________
