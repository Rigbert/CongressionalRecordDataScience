President, the Senate and House will soon vote on the President's finding that withholding disbursement of USAID family planning funds until July 1, 1997, will cause serious damage to the proper functioning of the program.  It is no surprise that the President reached this conclusion. It is beyond dispute that family planning services, including the provision of modern contraceptives, are the most effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. The examples that the President cites to support his finding should be read by every Member of Congress. They illustrate the harm these restrictions have already done to the program, and the further harm, measured in the numbers of women who will die from unsafe abortions that could be prevented, and children who will die from disease or starvation because their families could not care for them, as well as in added administrative costs, that a further delay in disbursement will cause. They also refute the flagrantly erroneous claim of the right-to-life lobby, that this vote is about whether or not to provide $123 million to organizations that fund abortion. Not one dime of these funds can be used for abortion, and the vote is only about when, not whether, these funds will be disbursed.  I will have more to say about this at the time of the vote, but I want to be sure that all Senators saw the editorial from this Saturday's Washington Post, and this Sunday's Post op-ed piece by David Broder, which make compelling arguments for upholding the President's finding. Perhaps most noteworthy is the quote from former Senator Hatfield, who was staunchly pro-life but an equally strong supporter of family planning. He said ``it is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates increase.''  Mr. President, that should be the beginning and end of this debate. I ask unanimous consent that the two articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1997]                       A Key Family Planning Vote       In the familiar and frazzling congressional argument over      U.S. foreign aid for family planning, the side whose explicit      purpose is to oppose abortion has been marking up notable      gains. In the past two years, these funds have been cut by a      full third, kept from being spent until nine months of the      fiscal year have passed and then allowed to be spent      (``metered'') only in small monthly sums. Now an important      vote is coming up that the family planning side hopes will      halt and reverse this legislative harassment of a valuable      program. The vote this month is not about funding abortions--     something prohibited by law and policy anyway. It will simply      determine whether funds already appropriated for family      planning in fiscal 1997 will be held up until July or      released in March.       Not a great issue, it could be said: a battle over crumbs      in Congress. But it is a great issue if you believe as we do      that American voluntary family planning programs--carefully      drawn, executed and monitored to ensure that they will not be      diverted to abortions--have made a central, proven, 30-year      contribution to reducing poverty and enhancing human dignity      around the world. The effectiveness of well-run programs, in      fact, is no longer at issue. They work. It is demonstrable      that when programs and funds are reduced--by cuts, delays and      policy encumbrances--unintended pregnancies and abortions      follow.       We now come to the large and continuing mystery of these      programs. A strange belief that abortions can be made to end      if family planning is restricted in what apparently has led      antiabortion advocates to work for the denial and diminution      of family planning services. ``Chris,'' Sen. Mark Hatfield      wrote not long ago to one of those advocates, Rep. Chris      Smith (R-N.J.), ``you are contributing to an increase of      abortions worldwide because of the funding restrictions on      which you insisted in last year's funding bill. It is a      proven fact that when contraceptive services are not      available to women throughout the world, abortion rates      increase. . . . This is unacceptable to me as someone who is      strongly opposed to abortion.''       The global generation now coming of child-bearing age is      the largest single generation ever to reach reproductive      maturity, the Rockefeller Foundation reports. This is a      sobering reminder of the need for the United States to resume      its leadership in an important field.                                                                    ____                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1997]                     A Vote for Poor Women Overseas                          (By David S. Broder)       For 30 years, the United States has led an international      effort to reduce the toll of maternal deaths and unwanted      pregnancies by providing money and technical assistance for      family planning programs in underdeveloped countries. Despite      its dramatic successes and despite universal agreement that      federal funds would not be used to pay for abortions, the      program was severely cut and then temporarily suspended last      year by antiabortion forces in the House of Representatives.       Now that issue is about to be revisited in a February      congressional vote that will directly affect the life      prospects of countless women and children--and provide an      important test of the shellshocked House Republican      leadership's ability to maintain a degree of cohesion in its      fragile majority.       The background is this: Since the mid-1960s, the United      States, through aid to foreign countries and to private,      nonprofit organizations, has helped make contraceptive advice      and supplies available to couples in poor lands so they can      plan the size of their families. Its success is undeniable. A      report released last week by the Rockefeller Foundation, a      longtime supporter of family planning, noted that in the past      three decades, the percentage of women in these countries      using contraception has grown from 10 percent to 50 percent      and the average number of children they have borne has been      reduced from six to three.       The reduction in family size has helped millions escape      from poverty and, for many women, enhanced the prospects for      education and a richer life--to say nothing of better health.      Fewer risky pregnancies and many fewer abortions are among      the benefits.       No one seriously questions the efficacy of the program and,      equally, no one has sought to upset the longstanding ban on      U.S. government money paying for abortions. But when the      Republicans won control of the House in 1995, they sought to      write into law a policy that Presidents Reagan and Bush had      imposed by executive order banning U.S. aid to organizations      that used their own funds to pay for abortions. President      Clinton ended that policy two days after he took office, and      the House Republicans sought to overrule him.       Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), whose opposition to abortion is      as fervent as it is sincere, argued that since money is      fungible, grants to groups such as the International Planned      Parenthood Federation, which offers privately financed      abortion counseling and services, were indirectly subsidizing      the procedure he despised. But before he retired last month,      Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), as staunch an opponent of      abortion as can be found, rejected Smith's logic.       In a letter to Smith last September, Hatfield wrote: ``I      have reviewed the materials you recently sent to my office in      response to my request that you provide proof that U.S. funds      are being spent on abortion through AID's [the Agency for      International Development] voluntary international family      planning program. Unfortunately, I do not see anything in      these materials to back up your assertion.'' Hatfield said,      ``AID has a rigorous process,'' enforced by outside monitors,      to carry out the abortion ban. ``In the meantime, Chris,'' he      added, ``you are contributing to an increase of abortions      worldwide because of the funding restrictions on which you      insisted. . . . It is a proven fact that when contraceptive      services are not available to women throughout the world,      abortion rates increase.''       In 1995 and 1996, the House majority followed Smith, the      Senate Hatfield. To break the impasse and keep the program      alive, Clinton agreed last year that if the House Republicans      would not insist on reinstating the Reagan-Bush restrictions,      he would accept a 35 percent cut in family planning funds and      agree to the financing being suspended entirely for six to      nine months.       That agreement guaranteed Clinton an up-or-down floor vote      in the House and Senate this month on resuming the program      without the Reagan-Bush restrictions. But Smith is pressing      House Majority Leader Dick Armey to break the deal      Republicans made with the White House last September and      allow Smith to bring up his restrictive amendment again,      sweetened with a partial rollback of the funding cut. Armey's      spokeswoman told me, ``We're leaning toward'' giving Smith      what he wants.       That prospect has impelled many of the three dozen House      Republicans who support the international family planning      program to write Armey that, rather than yield to Smith and      his allies, they are prepared to fight their own leadership      and, if necessary, hand them an embarrassing defeat on the      first major legislative test since Speaker Newt Gingrich was      disciplined for ethics violations. The issue goes before the      House Republican Conference later this week. But the women      and children who have most at stake around the world will not      have a vote.                          ____________________
