Mr. Speaker, today I held a hearing on advancing human rights to counter extremism. Today's hearing explored ways to combat violent extremism by advancing fundamental human rights--in particular, freedom of religion.  Advancing freedom of religion, both as an end in of itself and as means to achieve peace, stability and human flourishing, should be a core objective of U.S. foreign policy.  Religious liberty is opposed, however, by extremists who seek to impose their vision of an ideal society upon all. Oftentimes, the ``choice'' they give to those who seek to adhere to the beliefs they were raised in boils down to convert or die.  This clash manifests itself in numerous parts of the world, in varying degrees of intensity, but is particularly acute in certain Muslim-dominated regions, where groups such as ISIS, al-Nusra, Boko Haram and al-Shabaab seek to bring all under their sway.  To personalize this, let me tell you about a victim of Boko Haram that I have gotten to know.  On a trip to Nigeria, at an IDP camp in Jos, I met Habila Adamu.  Dragged from his home by Boko Haram terrorists, he was ordered to renounce his faith.  With an AK-47 pressed to his face, he was asked ``are you ready to die as a Christian.''  With amazing courage Habila answered, ``yes, I am ready to die as a Christian.''  He was asked a second time and he repeated his answer--``yes I am ready to die as a Christian.''  This time, the terrorist pulled the trigger. A bullet ripped through Habila's face. He crumpled to the ground, left for dead.  By some miracle, he survived.  I asked Habila to come to Washington, D.C. to tell his story. At a Congressional hearing I chaired, Habila told my committee--``I am alive because God wants you to have this message--knowing Christ'' is so much ``deeper'' than merely knowing Boko Haram's story of hate and intolerance.  He closed his testimony with this--``do everything you can to end this ruthless religious persecution. . . but know Christ first''  It should be stressed that extremist groups such as Boko Haram coerce and oppress not only members of other faiths, but also and in particular members of the Muslim faith whose interpretation of Islam differs from that of the extremists. They also target converts, whose consciences lead them to choose a different path.  To combat these extremists, the ideological battlefield is just as important as the territorial one. By emphasizing human rights principles, we counter extremist messaging, support moderate voices and promote the popular aspirations of people around the world who simply want to live in peace and freedom.  Last year, an important weapon in the fight against extremism was passed by Congress and signed into law: The Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act. This law provides tools and resources to our State Department to integrate religious freedom into our diplomacy the world over in order to counter violent extremism abroad.  In building upon the landmark International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, this law addresses the changed circumstances in the world since 1998 by designating non-state extremist groups such as Boko Haram and ISIS as ``violent non-state actors,'' making it easier to ostracize and apply financial sanctions against their members, thereby helping starve extremists of resources.  The law strengthens the ability to investigate and monitor religious persecution, creating a ``Designated Persons List'' of violators while also setting up a database of those detained, imprisoned and tortured for their faith, so that the victims are not forgotten, but rather can be more readily advocated for. Indeed, the Frank Wolf Act elevates the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, thereby enhancing the ability to advocate on behalf of victims of religious persecution.  Finally, the Act requires that our Foreign Service Officers undergo training in religious liberty, so that they are able to integrate this important tool into their daily work.  Before we move on to my colleagues' remarks, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Francis Rooney, the former United States ambassador to the Holy See, for his interest in this subject Today's hearing was brought about in large part due to his persistent interest in these themes, and I want to thank him for joining our subcommittee for this hearing today.                          ____________________
