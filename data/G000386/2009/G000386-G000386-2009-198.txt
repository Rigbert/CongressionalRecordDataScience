 President, today I wish to honor the life of Major General Roger W. Gilbert who passed away on June 13, 2009 in Lenexa, KS. I would like to express my condolences to Major General Gilbert's family, in particular his wife of 58 years, Ruthie, his two daughters Carol and Marilee, his three granddaughters Brooke, Britni, and Allison, and his sister Beverly. They are in my thoughts and prayers.  Major General Gilbert led an honorable and extensive career which began upon his enlistment in the Army Air Corps in 1943 while he was a student at Drake University. After his pilot training, he courageously took two combat tours in Europe during World War II. He flew 50 missions in B-17s and Mosquitoes and upon his accomplishment he was awarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with five clusters and five battle stars.  In 1946, he joined the Air National Guard and flew another 50 combat missions in B-26 bombers during the Korean war. He then became squadron and later on wing commander of the Air Guard units and accumulated 7,200 hours of pilot time, 4,000 of which were served as a jet pilot. Major General Gilbert amassed a large amount of medals throughout his service career, including the Legion of Merit with one oak leaf cluster and another 38 awards.  Major General Gilbert retired from his career of 42 years of service in the Air Force and Air Guard. He previously was the adjutant general of the Iowa National Guard, as well as the former commander of the 132nd Fighter Wing of the Iowa National Guard, which was given three national recognitions as being an outstanding unit of the Air Force. After retirement, he spent his time hunting, skeet shooting, and taking his golden retriever, Major, out to the field.  The career of Major General Gilbert was a distinguished one and his 42-year commitment to serving the people of the United States and the State of Iowa is worthy of much admiration and honor. I am grateful for his service and pay tribute to his patriotism.                          ____________________
