 President, we are about to vote on an amendment that will simply allow a woman who serves us overseas in the military to go to a military facility, if she so chooses, to have an abortion that is safe and legal.  Current law requires that a woman who serves us overseas go to her commanding officer and ask for permission to fly home on a military transport, at taxpayer expense--as I say, at taxpayer expense--to fly home on a military jet to have access to what is legally given to every woman in this country today.  I heard our opponents say that this is an issue of taxpayer-funded abortions. I disagree.
