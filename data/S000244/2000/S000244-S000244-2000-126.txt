Chairman, I am happy to support this amendment. It is identical to a bill which he introduced and which I cosponsored earlier. We are talking about how to make information technology available in the cheapest possible way, particularly to our public schools and libraries. This is something that is timely and needed, and to make sure that the money we are authorizing under this bill is spent in the most efficient manner possible.
