I share the Speaker's view on that. Very frankly, I think the gentleman is correct; it was a protest which gave rise to this rule which I think is ill-advised, but I understand the difference.  The protest was because--and as Rules chairman, the gentleman probably knows this better than anybody else--we asked for an amendment that we thought 85 to 90 percent of the American people were for. We didn't get transparency, we didn't get openness, and we did not get an opportunity to express our views. That is why we are so concerned because we think, frankly, this is analogous to a gag rule: to shut us down, to shut us out, and to shut us up. But I appreciate the gentleman's view.
