Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Mr. Vernon Cunningham and Mr. James Shepard of Portage, Indiana. On Saturday, September 11, 2004, they will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to the community.  Mr. Vernon Cunningham will be awarded the Portage Township Citizen of the year. Vernon's qualities include a dedication to community causes. Vernon has been a resident of Portage, Indiana for over fifty years. Those who know him best describe Vernon as a kind, fun-loving person, who always wants to help others. His outstanding service and donation of time and money to Gabriel Horn's homeless shelter represents the epitome of what a dedicated public servant should be. South Haven American Legion Post 502 will be filled Saturday night with friends and family who have been blessed with the opportunity to know and work with Vernon and who wish to celebrate with him as he receives his award. Vernon's work, which has earned him Portage Township Citizen of the Year, has been improving his community and the lives of Porter County residents for many years. Although Vernon has dedicated his time serving the community, he has never neglected to provide support and love to his family. Vernon and his late wife Peggy have three children Scott, Gail, and James.  Mr. James Shepard is being honored as the Portage Township Fireman of the Year. Mr. Shepard was voted by peers as Fireman of the Year for his outstanding service and dedication to the South Haven Volunteer Fire Department. James is a third generation fireman; his father was a volunteer fireman for South Haven and his grandfather was also a fireman. James graduated from the Georgia Fire Academy, the National Fire Academy, and he is also a Certified Fire Instructor. His career as a firefighter began in 1988 when he worked as a firefighter near Savanna, Georgia. In 1993, James became a Certified Emergency Medical Technician. He then moved to Porter County Indiana and has been a full-time fire fighter for the City of Valparaiso for the last eleven years. For the past ten years, he has also served as a volunteer fireman for the South Haven Fire Department. While James has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work and protecting the lives of others, he has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife Stacy have two children, James and Samantha.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Vernon Cunningham and James Shepard for their outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. Their commitment to improving the quality of life of the people of Northwest Indiana is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
