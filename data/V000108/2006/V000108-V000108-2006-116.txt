Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I congratulate one of the most dedicated, hardworking citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Nenad Radoja. After working for the U.S. Steel, Gary Works Plant for over seven years, Nenad recently accepted the position of Director of Steel Shop at U.S. Steel in Smederevo, in the country of Serbia and Montenegro. Nenad began his new position on March 20, 2006.  Nenad Radoja was born on June 15, 1971, in East Chicago, Indiana. Nenad is one of two children born to Ray and Sandi Radoja. He is the great-grandson of turn-of-the-century Yugoslavian immigrants who came to United States in search of the American Dream. Nenad's grandparents, Risto and Marija Radoja, also immigrated to the United States in 1951 in search of what America had to offer. Upon his arrival, Risto began working at the steel mills in Northwest Indiana. Nenad, surely inspired by his grandfather's work ethic, chose to pursue a similar career in the steel mills.  A lifetime native of Lake County, Indiana, Nenad graduated from Merrillville High School in 1989. Furthering his education, Nenad went on to complete his Baccalaureate Degree in History at Purdue University-Calumet in Hammond, Indiana. He later earned his Master's Degree in Management from Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana.  Prior to transferring to the U.S. Steel Plant in Serbia and Montenegro, Nenad worked at the U.S. Steel, Gary Works Plant for seven years, where he worked in several capacities. Over the years, he worked his way up from Melter to General Foreman to Desulfurization Coordinator, and finally, to Area Coordinator of Operation, a position he held until accepting his new position in Serbia and Montenegro. His exceptional knowledge and expertise in these areas will surely be missed in Northwest Indiana, but his acquisition in Serbia and Montenegro will be a definite improvement to their organization.  Though extremely dedicated to his work, Nenad selflessly gives much of his free time and energy to his community, his friends, and most importantly, his family. Nenad now resides in the capital city of Belgrade, Serbia and Montenegro, with his loving wife, Branka, his daughters, Katarina and Sanja, and his son, Stefan.  Also important to note, Nenad is an avid sports fan. In his spare time, Nenad enjoys playing basketball and watching football games.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending and congratulating Nenad Radoja on beginning his new position as Director of Steel Shop at U.S. Steel in Smederevo, Serbia and Montenegro. Nenad has improved the lives of many residents in Indiana's First Congressional District. Northwest Indiana will surely miss Nenad's loyal service and uncompromising dedication.                          ____________________
