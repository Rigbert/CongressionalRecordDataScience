President, I have agreed to strike section 578 of the bill which contains a reporting requirement relating to arms sales. I have done so in response to a request by the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.  However, both Senator Helms and Senator Biden have agreed that they will include a modified version of this reporting provision which has been negotiated and agreed upon by myself, Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and Senator McConnell in legislation that has been reported by the Foreign Relations Committee and which is expected to be acted on by the Senate later this month. If that legislation is not adopted by the Senate or the reporting provision is not included in whatever version of that legislation becomes law, Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and Senator McConnell have agreed to support its inclusion in the FY 1999 Foreign Operations Conference Report, a Continuing Resolution, or whatever other legislative vehicle is appropriate. My purpose in striking section 578 is to give the Foreign Relations Committee an opportunity to include the modified reporting provision in its legislation, but to ensure that if that fails it is included in a legislative vehicle that becomes law.
