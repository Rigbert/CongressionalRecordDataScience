Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Lake Elsinore, California are exceptional. On Saturday, January 23, 2016, Tom Thomas received the Citizen of the Year award from the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.  Tom was born and raised just over the Cleveland National Forest in Orange County, where he graduated from Newport Harbor High School. After high school, Tom earned his Associate Degree from Orange Coast College and then attended Cal-State Fullerton before he became interested in working at the TV studios of Newport Cablevision. That job was the start of a lifelong attraction to the cable television business and a career that would take Tom to Alaska, New York and all around the country. Tom eventually planted his roots in Lake Elsinore and ended up living at the ``ranch'' on the Ortega's along with his wife, Dee. Tom and Dee have been married for 33 years and their adult son, Matt, currently resides in Sacramento.  In Lake Elsinore, Tom dedicated himself to the community by serving multiple years on the Lake Elsinore Valley Chamber of Commerce Board, including two terms as President, as well as almost 15 years with the Lake Elsinore Rotary Club, where he also served twice as President. Tom has served on the Lake Elsinore Unified School District Board of Trustees since 2004 and as Executive Director of Cops for Kids at the Lake Elsinore Sheriff's station. In recognition of his selfless service to his community, Tom has been recognized withmany awards, including the Lake Elsinore Valley Chamber of Commerce John Packman Memorial Award Winner in 1988, and being named the Boy Scouts Distinguished Citizen in 2007.  In light of all that Tom Thomas has done for the community of Lake Elsinore, Riverside County and the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce, it is only fitting to name him as Citizen of the Year. Through his involvement and dedication, Tom has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. On behalf of the 42nd Congressional District, I want to express my appreciation and pride in Tom on this special occasion. I add my voice to the many who paid tribute to Tom for receiving the Citizen of the Year award from the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce.                          ____________________
