President, let me speak a little bit about Margaret McKeown. She was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on a vote of 16 to 2. She has the support of Chairman Hatch, a number of Republican Senators, is supported by both Senators from her State. Why this was held up for 2 years, I cannot understand. And then she is confirmed 80 to 11. How many of us have ever won an election with those kinds of percentages? Yet, apparently somebody held her up for 2 years because she was supposed to be controversial. How controversial is 80 to 11? Those are pretty good numbers. Perhaps her secret critics will explain their views, the reason she has been held up for 2 years.  I have been urging action on judicial nominees for many months. This week, faced with 5 continuing vacancies on a 13-member court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified a ``judicial emergency'' and took the unprecedented step of authorizing panels including only one Second Circuit judge and two visiting judges. In addition he has had to cancel hearings.  The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but that nomination continues to sit on the Senate calendar. This is another woman who has sat here and had to wait and wait and wait, while the Senate holds her up. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She was finally favorably reported by a committee vote of 16 to 2--pretty good odds. She is strongly supported by both New York Senators, one Republican, one Democrat. But the nomination continues to languish without consideration. And three more Second Circuit nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee, and await their confirmation hearings.  I mention the Second Circuit because that is my Circuit. It is the Circuit to which my State resides. I have been urging action on the nominees for this Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its obligations to the people of the Second Circuit--to the people of New York, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and take action. We should consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor. We should do it today. We should hold hearings on the three other Second Circuit nominees next week and confirm them before the upcoming recess. Our delay is inflicting harm and giving proof to the warning that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court gave in his 1997 Year End Report that continuing vacancies would harm the administration of justice. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed now.  Earlier this week, the distinguished majority leader indicated that he feels he has proceeded too quickly with respect to judicial nominations. I strongly disagree. No reference to the number of judges the Senate has begrudgingly confirmed over the past 2 years excuses the delay on any of the nominees pending on the Senate Calendar. There is no excuse or justification for the judicial emergency the Senate is inflicting on the Second Circuit.  The distinguished majority leader says there is no clamor for Federal judges. I recognize that there are no vacancies on the Federal bench in Mississippi, but there are numerous, longstanding vacancies in other places, vacancies that are harming the Federal administration of justice.  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit and other circuits and districts need additional Federal judges. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that in addition to the almost 80 vacancies that need to be filled, the Congress authorize an additional 55 judgeships throughout the country, as set forth in S.678, the Federal Judgeship Act that I introduced last year.  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate further before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on the judicial nominees pending before us? I hope not.  We are sworn to uphold the Constitution, we are sworn to uphold the laws,and we are paid pretty well to do that. We are failing our oath and we are failing the job the taxpayers of this country pay us to do.                          ____________________
