President, I rise today today with my colleagues, Senators DeWine, Fitzgerald, Kerry, Bingaman, Schumer and Abraham to offer this critical amendment to increase funding for childhood asthma programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma.  ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is getting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW environmental Health Commission in its most recent report on asthma.  The prevalence of asthma continues to rise at astounding rates--every region of the country and across all demographic groups, whether measured by age, race or sex. In America today, no chronic disease is increasing faster than asthma. And asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem plaguing this nation's children. Among those four years old, it has mushroomed by 160 percent over the last 2 decades.  Asthma affects nearly 15 million Americans. That figure includes more than 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are children under the age of 18. Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of childhood asthma in the country. According to a study published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, of inner-city school children in Chicago, researchers found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was 10.8 percent, or twice the 5.8 percent the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in that age group nationally. The study also found that most of the children with diagnosed asthma were receiving medical care, but it may not be consistent with what asthma care guidelines recommend.  If rates continue unchecked, a child born a generation from now will be twice as likely to develop asthma as a child born today. By the end of this decade, if no action is taken to reverse this trend and it continues at its current pace, the PEW Commission calculates that 22 million Americans will suffer from asthma--eight million more than at present. That's one in 14 Americans and one in every five families forced to live with the disease. By 2020, the Commission estimates that the number could increase to 29 million--more than twice the current number.  These figures are staggering. At the current rate of growth, that means that the number of asthma cases in 2020 will exceed the projected population of New York and New Jersey combined. If by chance all asthma suffers lived in one state, it would be the second most populous in the country. Put another way, if all those with asthma stood side by side, they would stretch the distance between LA, California and Washington DC, over four times.  If general rates of asthma are high and getting higher, the rates are even worse for society's most vulnerable. Asthma disproportionately attacks them. A recent New York Times article described a study in the Brooklyn area where it was found that an astounding 38 percent of homeless children suffer from asthma. Some of the factors known to contribute to asthma such as poor living circumstances, exposure to cockroach feces, stress, exposure to dampness and mold are all experienced by homeless children. They are also experienced by children living in poor housing or exposed to urban violence. There are other factors such as exposure to second hand smoke and smog that also exacerbate or trigger asthma attacks.  Not only is asthma itself on the rise but it is becoming more deadly. For minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The asthma death rate for African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other segments of the population. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related death rate in 1993, was 3 to 4 times higher for African-Americans compared to Caucasian Americans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is almost three times as high among African-American children under the age of 5 compared to their white counterparts. Illinois has the highest asthma related deaths in the country for African-American men. The increased disparity between death rates compared to prevalence rates has been partially explained by decreased access to health care services for minority children.  However, even though asthma rates are particularly high for children in poverty, they are also rising substantially for suburban children. Overall the rates are increasing for all groups. Everyone of us knows a child whether our own, a relatives' or a friends' who suffers from asthma.  In an effort to stem the tide of this epidemic, Senator DeWine and I along with 23 other Senators submitted a request to the Labor HHS appropriators to ask for $50 million for childhood asthma programs at CDC. One fifth of the money would be available for improved tracking and surveillance efforts for asthma, as suggested by the PEW commission for environmental health. Currently, the bill does mention a specific allocation for asthma.  The amendment, which has been agreed to, provides $20 million for state and community-based organizations to support asthma screening, treatment, education and prevention programs and for a new surveillance and tracking system as called for recently by the PEW Environmental Health Commission in their report ``Attack Asthma.'' Again, one fifth of the amount, in this case $4 million would be available for new surveillance and tracking.  The amendment also states that these community funds may be used by both health and school-based services. Many school districts, including the Chicago Public Schools are involved in screening children for asthma and for seeing to it that they get treatment and management to deal with their asthma. CDC should see to it that these new funds are used to coordinate local efforts and to link both school based and health facility based asthma programs. With additional resources, CDC should diversify the types of programs that they fund, so that evaluations can be done to measure the effectiveness of these different programs. Furthermore, programs need to be tailored to the individual needs of localities with coordination of local services and local efforts to combat childhood asthma.  The amendment also includes a restriction on the amount that CDC may use for administration or reprogramming including the 1 percent Public Health Service evaluation. Both Senator DeWine and I believe that asthmashould be a high priority for CDC and that CDC should not seek to reprogram this money or use it for other purposes. Last year, CDC chose to disproportionately allocate rescissions to the asthma program. We strongly object to that decision. At a time of an asthma epidemic, we believe that this program should be protected from such cuts. Therefore, this year we have included language that states that only 5 percent of the total amount allocated for childhood asthma programs may be used for administration, evaluations, or other activities.  Let me tell you why we need this money. Despite the best efforts of the health community, childhood asthma is becoming more common, more deadly and more expensive and the effects of asthma on society are widespread.  Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it often goes undiagnosed. Many of you may be surprised to learn that asthma is the single most common reason for school absenteeism. Parents miss work while caring for children with asthma. Beyond those missed days at school and parents missing work, there is the huge emotional stress suffered by asthmatic children. It is a very frightening event for a small child to be unable to breathe. A recent US News article quoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, Madison Benner who described her experience with asthma. She said ``It feels like something was standing on my chest when I have an asthma attack.'' This little girl had drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big footed elephant crushing a frowning girl into her bed.  In many urban centers, over 60 percent of childhood admissions to the emergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room visits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place where a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their asthma.  During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I met a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. He told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his friends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the medical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of children, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and untreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the grocery store.  However, we do have treatments that work for most people. Early diagnosis, treatment and management are key to preventing serious illness and death. The National Institutes of Health is home to the National Asthma Education and Prevention board. This is a large group of experts from all across the fields involved in health care and asthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating asthma and educating children and their parents in prevention. It is very important that when we spend money on developing such guidelines that they actually get out of communities so that they can take advantage of this research.  CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that health professionals and others get the most up to date information. My amendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with this information.  One interesting new model that appears to work is the ``breathmobile' program in Los Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program provides a van that is equipped with medical personnel, asthma education materials, and asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to areas that are known to have a high incidence of childhood asthma and screens children in those areas. Children are also enrolled in the Children's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all heard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been and anything that we can do to speed enrollment up, I think it vitally important. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the emergency room by 17 percent in the first year of operation. I hope that we can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the country.  In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in Chicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American Association of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form the Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma screening and treatment. Efforts like these need our amendment.  In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which seeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the very best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced trips to the emergency room by 30 percent.  This Childhood Asthma Amendment would expand these programs to help ensure that no child goes undiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets the treatment he or she needs.  Last year, an additional $10 million was dedicated to start this program for a total of $11.3 million. CDC will be putting out a request for proposals this summer. The $20 million agreed to here today is a good start and I hope that we will be able to do better by increasing it to $50 million in conference. This $50 million level of funding is supported by the American Lung Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation, Mothers of Asthmatics, the National Association for Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and others who support children's health.  No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people understand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have access to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to things that trigger asthma attacks. Funding for this program is critical.  I am delighted that my colleague Senator Specter has agreed to accept this amendment to nearly double the funding level for this important public health effort. I hope that he will work with me in conference to increase this level of funding to as close as possible to the $50 million originally requested by myself and 23 of my Senate colleagues. Again I thank my colleagues Specter and Harkin for recognizing the importance of this issue to the nation's children.                           AMENDMENT NO. 3709 (Purpose: To increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and    Prevention to provide for the adequate funding of State and local          immunization infrastructure and operations activities)       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:       Sec. ___.
