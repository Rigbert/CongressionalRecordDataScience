 You and I have worked hard over the last couple of years to improve Medicaid waiver transparency, and I think we have made some progress. But, I understand your desire to do more. I want to continue working with you to ensure that the Senate Finance Committee fulfills its oversight obligation in this area. I also think that the Medicaid waiver amendment that Senator Rockefeller is offering has merit, and I would like to continue working with him to improve the waiver information available on CMS' website.
