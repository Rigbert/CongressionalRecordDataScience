I think it is important for the audience to know this is a bipartisan effort. In fact, conservative Republicans, conservative Democrats and moderate Democrats, mainline Democrats are all supporting this particular effort.  Today in the Washington Post on page A-13 there is a story that talks about what is happening in the Mexican stock market as a result of the rippling effects of this devaluation of the peso, and one of the Mexican bankers said, ``This is really a meltdown of catastrophic proportions. So we have the United States offering us loans. Eventually you get yourself another $20 billion in debt, and how are you going to pay for it?'' And that is really the reason we are very concerned and why we have asked for NAFTA to be revoked because we would like to know, and we have asked this question in letters we are sending to the Treasury, if Mexico defaults, as nations have had trouble paying their debts in the past, is it the intention of our Treasury Department to enlarge the assistance? And what about the Federal Reserve? We are very concerned that the commercial banks that are involved in these lines of credit, that in the peso bailout their lines of credit are uncollateralized. That is how we got into trouble back during the last Latin American debt bailout, they were uncollateralized loans. Why are our commercial banks, from what we have read in the paper, since the Fed will not talk to us directly on this, why are they being allowed to have uncollateralized loans?  I know the gentleman from Vermont, who has been such a leader on this, is on the floor, and it is a pleasure to welcome him on our side.
