GRAHAM. Yes, I am, because it is my understanding, if I could reclaim my time--and I am sorry to run over, I say to my good friend from Ohio--here is what I think is happening. I think everybody was OK with him being a district court judge, except maybe somebody on our side, and if the problem with this man is he has associated himself in a way that disqualifies him because of a racial problem, why should he be a district judge? If his problem is that he is against people because of sexual orientation unfairly, why would he ever be a district judge? So the point is that if he was good enough for a district judge based on his qualifications, why shouldn't we give him an up-or-down vote in a fair way in terms of the court of appeals?  So I think what is going on here is that we are trying to replace the discretion of the President and the twoSenators from Mississippi to play with a court of appeals nomination of Mississippi in a way that will come back to haunt all of us, and I just wish we wouldn't do it. Give this man an up-or-down vote on the floor.
