 Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the $40 billion Mexican bailout which is supported by President Clinton, Speaker Gingrich, and other congressional leaders.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when Members of Congress are proposing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' needs, nutrition programs for hungry children, grants and loans for middle-class college students, and the elimination of public broadcasting, I regard it as insane to put $40 billion of taxpayer money at risk through this loan guarantee project with Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, we have enough problems taking care of the needs of America without trying to run Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, if large banks and Wall Street investment houses want to purchase Mexican bonds at 19 percent interest rates, they have every right in the world to do so. But these great proponents of the free enterprise system who lecture us every day on the value of risk should not go running to Congress for a guarantee on their investments.                          ____________________
