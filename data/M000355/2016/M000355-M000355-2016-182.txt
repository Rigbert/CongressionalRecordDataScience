 President, this morning our conference came together to select a Republican leadership team for the 115th Congress. It is an honor to be chosen once again by my colleagues to continue serving as leader. I know I speak for every Republican Senator in expressing gratitude to the American people for entrusting us with this new majority. It is a great responsibility and one that we do not take lightly.  I want to recognize Senator Schumer and the new Members of his team as well. Leading a party--any party--in the Senate is no easy task. Our colleague from New York has a tough job ahead of him, but he is pretty tough as well, and I send him my congratulations. Regardless of party, though, one thing is clear. We have work to do. I know each of us is eager to get started.  That includes Senator-Elect Todd Young from Indiana. I have had the opportunity to spend time with him this week and to congratulate him on his truly impressive victory. It was a hard-fought race, and he should be proud of the outstanding campaign he ran. Of course, our friend Senator Dan Coats leaves behind some pretty big shoes to fill. I will have more to say about that later, but I am confident that Senator-Elect Young is up to the task. So we are all looking forward to his joining us on this side of the Capitol come next January.                          ____________________
