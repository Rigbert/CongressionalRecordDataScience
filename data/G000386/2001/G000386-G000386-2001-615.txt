 President, today I am introducing legislation to expand the tax deduction for student loan interest. I am proud to have as my original cosponsor Senator Max Baucus of Montana.  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax deduction for student loan interest was eliminated. This action, done in the name of fiscal responsibility, disregarded the duty we have to the education of our nation's students. This struck me and many of my colleagues as wrong. Since 1987, I have spearheaded the bipartisan effort to reinstate the tax deduction for student loan interest. In 1992, we succeeded in passing the legislation only to have it vetoed as part of a larger bill with tax increases. Finally, after ten long years our determination and perseverance paid off. Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 we reinstated the deduction. In our success, we sent a message to the students and their families of this nation that the Congress of the United States understands the financial hardships they face, and that we are willing to assist them in easing those hardships so they can continue to receive the education they need to become productive members of society and of their place of work.  In 1997, our steps were in the right direction. We did what needed to be done. Regrettably, due to fiscal constraints, we were not able to go as far as we wanted. The nation was still struggling to eliminate the deficit. In order to control costs, we were forced to limit the deductibility of student loan interest to only sixty payments, which is five years' worth plus the time spent in forbearance or deferment.  This restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. Many of these borrowers are students who, due to limited means, have borrowed most heavily. The restriction discriminates against those who have the highest debt loads and the lowest incomes. It makes the American dream of self-improvement harder to achieve for those struggling to pull themselves up--but who started with less. It is simply unjust.  Today, our situation is vastly different. In these times of economic surplus, we have a responsibility to do what we were unable to do before. Student debt is rising to alarming levels and additional relief is needed. We must eliminate the sixty month restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest and adjust the income limits to show that the United States Congress stands behind our nation's students in their endeavors to better themselves.  In addition, the removal of the sixty-month limit on deductibility of student loan interest will bring most needed relief to some of the most deserving borrowers. The restriction weighs most heavily on those who, despite lower pay have decided to dedicate themselves to public service. Thus this change will have the added benefit of rewarding civic virtue of these admirable citizens.  Additionally, eliminating this restriction will remove difficult and costly reporting requirements that are currently required for both the borrower and lender. By supporting our nation's students, we will also be reducing costly and unnecessary regulatory requirements.  Currently, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must have an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or less or $60,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction is gradually phased out for those with incomes between $40,000 and $55,000, or $60,000 and $75,000 for married couples. The deduction was phased in at $1,000 and will cap out at $2,500 in 2002. This bill will adjust those limits.  Many students in our country are suffering from heavy education-related debt. More can and must be done to help them. In these times of relative budget surplus, it is our duty to invest in our students' education. Doing so is an investment in America's future. To maintain our competitive edge in the global marketplace, America must have a well-educated workforce. By making it easier for students to take out the loans they need to obtain the highest level of education they can, we recommit ourselves to education and maintaining our competitive advantage in technology and in world trade.  I urge members to join me and Senator Baucus in our effort to relieve these excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their futures through education, by expanding the tax deduction for student loan interest payments. I now ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 152       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
