 Speaker, last year the 104th Congress marked up and passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. I was pleased to support that legislation in committee and on the House floor. In fact, I was successful in including an amendment to this new law which makes it a top priority for the Office of Management and Budget [OMB], when collecting information and applying new information technology, to make certain that small businesses selling goods and services to the Federal Government get paid on time.  But this new statute still does not assign nearly enough priority to cutting the redtape and paperwork on the smallest of the small businesses that are most in need of relief. This is because the executive branch generally defines a small business to mean any employer of 500 or fewer employees.  Most businesses in Vermont have 10 or fewer employees. Furthermore, I venture to say that most Americans don't think of a company that employs 499 employees as having the same needs and problems as a company that employs 25 or fewer employees.  We need to focus the attention and limited resources of OMB and other Federal agencies on reducing burdensome paperwork on those it is hurting the most--the smallest businesses that can least afford the time, personnel, and additional costs associated with meeting all of the Federal Government's regulatory and reporting requirements.  This bill does just that. It defines microenterprises to be small businesses in America that employ 25 or fewer employees. In addition, it calls upon the Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB to make it a priority to first consider the adverse effects on the smallest of small businesses, when directing and overseeing efforts to cut Federal paperwork and information reporting.  It also makes helping the smallest of small businesses a priority for voluntary pilot projects when OMB, other Federal agencies, and non-Federal entities test alternative policies, practices, regulations, and procedures to reduce the Federal paperwork burden.  We live in a time when the Federal Government must learn to do more with less. Therefore, in setting out to cut Federal regulatory costs and paperwork for American businesses, we should first strive to help the truly vulnerable small enterprises who operate much closer to the margin and whose survival is always in greater jeopardy.                          ____________________
