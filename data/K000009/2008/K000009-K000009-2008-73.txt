You had a person who would make a judgment about you. What was your character? What was the ability of that institution to collect the loan? What was your collateral? Character. Collateral. Collectibility.  Then back in the 1980s, we had this big savings and loan crisis, and the cost of keeping our financial system whole was dumped on the taxpayers of the United States. We have now paid a quarter of $1 trillion, $250 billion, going back to the 1980s.  What has happened in this crisis after the savings and loans were demolished--really, gotten rid of--is that in the 1990s, I can remember their saying, well, you know, we won't have that problem anymore because now we're going to create something new. It's called a mortgage-backed security, and Wall Street will solve our problem. We will never have a banking crisis again in the United States of America. We're going to create this cute, little paper instrument, and we're going to let Wall Street break up your mortgage into parts, and all these mortgage banks will have it, and then there won't be any one bank that will get in trouble, right?  So, during the 1990s, there was complete financial deregulation. We got rid of something called the Glass-Steagall Act, that goes back to President Roosevelt, where we separated banking from commerce, and they got rid of the appraisal standards of HUD in 1993 and 1994, and Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Office of Thrift Supervision at the Treasury Department didn't do their jobs.  What happened was these new securities moved from the local communities. Our local thrifts were gotten rid of--the agencies that created the mortgage instrument and helped people have savings accounts with real passbooks that earned interest. Then we started working with Wall Street, and your loan would go from your local communities--this is Countrywide right here. If we look at Angelo Mozilo, he didn't live in Cleveland or in Toledo. He made over $2.8 million.
