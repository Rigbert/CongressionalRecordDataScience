 President, I rise today to issue a birthday wish to one of the most remarkable people I have had the pleasure to work with in these first 4 years of my term: my almost-92-year-old friend and mentor, Sam Volpentest.  For more than three decades, Sam has been working to ensure the economic stability of the communities surrounding the Department of Energy's Hanford Site in southeast Washington. As a representative of the Tri-City Industrial Development Council, he worked closely with Senators Magnuson and Jackson to secure funding and projects for Hanford as the site has transitioned through various incarnations, from helping to win the cold war to cleaning up a nuclear mess to moving onto a healthy, stable future. And although these two illustrious leaders have passed on, Sam has not let up. He has advised and educated a whole new generation of elected leaders about priorities and the importance of the Tri-Cities.  Sam is tireless. He has more energy and enthusiasm than almost anybody. People who are half his age would be happy with his energy level--I know I would. He puts that energy to good work for Hanford and for the numerous charities and organizations he supports. I can think of no person who has contributed more time or energy to Hanford's workers and communities than Sam Volpentest.  Mr. President, I want to tell one story to illustrate Sam's dogged determination to do the right thing. Early in my Senate tenure, Sam shared with me an exciting new venture for Hanford, dubbed HAMMER--the Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response facility. HAMMER was an excellent idea, but a costly one--especially in this budget-cutting climate. However, with Sam at the helm of the project, this important inter-agency, cooperative emergency response program had a chance to make the transition from dream to reality.  In 1994, Sam got word that HAMMER funding was threatened. He called my office late one evening and explained how important it was to contact Senator Exon, who would be instrumental in saving HAMMER. Sam arrived at 7 a.m. and camped on my doorstep, and believe me, anyone who has had Sam camp out on their doorstep knows this man can camp. He helped me develop a strategy for winning and we worked every hour of the day to implement that strategy. In the end, we saved HAMMER.  Just last year, we broke ground for the extensive HAMMER training course. Today, HAMMER--Sam's mission and one of his many dreams--is almost constructed. The people not only in his community but across the Nation will benefit for years to come for Sam's tenacity and devotion to ``camping'' on doorsteps.  Today, on September 30, Sam Volpentest celebrates his 92d birthday. On that day, The Tri-City Herald will publish a list of contributors who have given to ``Sam's 92d Birthday Celebration for Charity.'' Contributors can give $9.20, $92, $920 or more to the organizing committee who will then pass the money on to the Blue Mountain Council of the Boy Scouts of America, the Tri-Cities Cancer Center, and Washington State University Tri-Cities. This is an excellent way to celebrate Sam's continuing charity to his friends and community, and will certainly demonstrate the love and affection so many people have for this remarkable man.  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues are blessed with people so tirelessly devoted to their communities as the people of the Tri-Cities and I have in Sam Volpentest. I hope those of you who have the privilege of knowing Sam will join me in wishing him a very happy 92d birthday, with many more to follow.                          ____________________
