 I expect the manager's amendment to be available on Monday, and I expect there to be 72 hours for the body to have notice of that as well as the general public. I would expect, therefore, the earliest votes to be no earlier than Thursday, 72 hours after the manager's amendment is put online. So that may be Thursday at some point in time, but we will meet that 72-hour pledge that we have made.
