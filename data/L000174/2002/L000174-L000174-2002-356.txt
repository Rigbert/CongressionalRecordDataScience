President, today, the Senate is voting on the 41st judicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate Judiciary Committee reorganized after the Democrats became the majority party in the Senate. With the confirmation of David C.Bury to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the Senate will have resolved 6 judicial emergencies since we returned to session just a few short weeks ago and 11 since I became chairman this past summer. As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more judges in the last 9 months than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 years under Republican leadership.
