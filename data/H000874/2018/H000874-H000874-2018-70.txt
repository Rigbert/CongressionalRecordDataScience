Speaker, reclaiming my time, the gentleman knows damn well that is not the case, and I am tired of hearing him demagogue about that. I expect him to do it between now and the election, but the gentleman is not honest when he does it, and he knows that, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. McCARTHY. May I ask the gentleman what am I not saying correctly? Were there ``present'' votes in that Chamber?
