President, the minority leader brings up a very good point. I know the Republican leader is familiar with the analysis that was done by Medicare's own Actuary that says that one out of five hospitals--and these are likely to be the small rural hospitals that are so important in our States--would be so jeopardized by these cuts that they may not survive. Another thing that will happen is that physicians are going to start turning away Medicare patients.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Maine, isn't that beginning to happen in some States already before we even take this additional step?
