Speaker, this week, Sidney Harman--a good friend to me and to so many--died at the age of 92. Sidney was the husband of my friend, Congresswoman Jane Harman; he lived a full, rich life, and he will be deeply missed. Sidney was a pioneering entrepreneur in the field of hi-fi stereo systems--but after his business success, he went on to make outstanding contributions to our country's civic life for decades. He was a strong advocate of civil rights who pitched in as a public school teacher; he was Under Secretary of Commerce under President Carter; he was a dynamic philanthropist who made his mark as a patron of education, the arts, and journalism. His many accomplishments, and the admiration of so many who knew him, are certain to long outlive him. But in the wake of his loss, my sincere condolences are with his wife, Congresswoman Harman, his children; and all those who mourn his passing.                          ____________________
