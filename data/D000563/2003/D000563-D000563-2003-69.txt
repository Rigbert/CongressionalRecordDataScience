 I ask the Senator through the Chair the following question: Is the Senator aware in the early hours this morning Republican Senators from Kansas and Pennsylvania came before the Senate and raised the question of whether the Constitution includes the right to privacy? According to the Senator from Kansas, he referred to it as the discovered right of privacy in the Constitution.  I would like to ask through the Chair if the Senator from California could reflect on the right to privacy, particularly as it relates to one anomaly from her State, Carolyn Kuhl.
