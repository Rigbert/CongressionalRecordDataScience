Chairman, coming from Iowa, I am sure that the gentleman has noted the greater and greater concentration in the agriculture industry, and it is much harder for producers to be company-equal partners in any kind of negotiation related to farm product and to actually bring that product to market. So I wanted to emphasize what the gentleman has been saying about how farms have had to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and even to try to meet market of today, it is almost impossible for many of these producers to do that.  So I was interested in the gentleman's co-op experience and why that is relevant as we try to finance.                              {time}  1445
