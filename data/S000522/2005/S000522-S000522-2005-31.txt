Mr. Speaker. I am attaching an exchange of letters between Chairman Hyde and Chairman Thomas concerning H. Con. Res. 294 ``Calling on the international community to condemn the Laogai, the system of forced labor prison camps in the People's Republic of China, as a tool for suppression maintained by the Chinese Government'' for insertion into the Congressional Record.                                      Committee on Ways and Means,                                     House of Representatives,                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2005.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, Rayburn House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hyde: I am writing in regard to H. Con. Res.      294, which is scheduled for floor consideration on Wednesday,      December 14, 2005. The second clause of the resolution      relates to the use of prison labor in China.       As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means has      jurisdiction over matters concerning imports. The second      resolved clause calls on the Government of the United States      to fully implement its laws prohibiting the importation of      products made in Chinese forced labor camps, and thus falls      within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.      However, in order to expedite this resolution for floor      consideration, the Committee will forgo action on this      resolution. This is being done with the understanding that it      does not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to      the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional      prerogatives on this or similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding with respect to H. Con. Res. 294, and      would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this      matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration.           Best regards,                                                      Bill Thomas,     Chairman.                                  ____         Committee on International Relations, House of            Representatives,                                Washington, DC, December 13, 2005.     Hon. William M. Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning H.      Con. Res. 294, calling on the international community to      condemn the Laogai, the system of forced labor prison camps      in the People's Republic of China, as a tool for suppression      maintained by the Chinese Government. The bill has been      referred to the Committee on International Relations.       I concur with your statement concerning the jurisdiction of      the Ways and Means Committee over the second resolved clause      of the resolution, which refers to United States laws      prohibiting the importation of products made in Chinese      forced labor camps. I appreciate your willingness to forgo      consideration of the bill.       I also understand that this action on your part does not in      any way prejudice your Committee with respect to the      appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives      on this or similar legislation. I will insert this exchange      of letters into the Congressional Record during the debate of      this bill.       With best wishes,           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,                                                         Chairman.
