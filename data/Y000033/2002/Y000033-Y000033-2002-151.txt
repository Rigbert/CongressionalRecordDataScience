Mr. Chairman, our Nation is stronger and better prepared today than on September 11. We have enacted numerous reforms which will make a repeat of last year's terrorist attack highly unlikely.  However, no system is perfect. We must remain vigilant in the face of the constantly evolving threat of terrorism. We are fighting an often invisible enemy, an enemy that appears to be preparing and training for additional terrorist attacks, and an enemy that seeks to obtain the most dangerous and deadly weapons to use against America.  This bill, H.R. 4635, will provide one last line of defense against terrorist hijackings. It will allow qualified pilots to volunteer to carry guns to use deadly force to defend the cockpit against terrorist hijackings. The pilots are already entrusted with the lives of every passenger on the airplane. Many of them have a law enforcement or military background and have experience with firearms.  The administration has been unwilling to act on this important matter, so I believe Congress must do so. The bill as it stands is the result of a bipartisan compromise. I believe it is one of the most important security issues we face today. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and send a message with a strong bipartisan vote today.  There will be amendments, and the agreement has been put forth, so I will oppose all of the amendments. Although my original bill had many of those parts of the amendments to be offered, this is a bipartisan effort to try to get a bill to the Senate, the other body, and on to the President's desk.  Mr. Chairman, I heard in the debate on the rule that someone said the President probably will not sign this. I say he will sign it, because when people look at the logic of what we are trying to do today of arming the pilot, the captain of that ship, to defend that ship and his passengers against the terrorists, I think he will say that this has great wisdom.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
