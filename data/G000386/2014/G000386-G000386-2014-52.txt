 LCpl Adam Wolff was killed while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He was 25 years old. Adam was a native of Eldon, IA, and lived in Cedar Rapids. Eldon is home to the house depicted in Grant Wood's famous painting ``American Gothic,'' which has come to symbolize a certain indomitable American spirit. Certainly there can be no greater representation of the spirit of self-sacrifice that has preserved American liberty through the generations than patriots like Lance Corporal Wolff. We can never repay him for his sacrifice, but we as a country must remember him and all those who have given their lives in defense of freedom. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends who are feeling his loss very deeply, particularly his father Nicholas, his mother Deborah, and his siblings. We cannot begin to comprehend their loss, but they should know that Adam's service and sacrifice have earned the gratitude of an entire nation.              Chief Warrant Officer Two Randy L.
