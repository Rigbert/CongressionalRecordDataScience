President, I am pleased to be introducing America's National Maritime Museum Designation Act of 2003. This legislation would designate an additional 19 maritime museums as ``America's National Maritime Museums'' nationwide. Maritime Museums are dedicated to advancing maritime and nautical science by fostering the exchange of maritime information and experience and by promoting advances in nautical education.  The America's National Maritime Museum designation would include acommitment on the part of each institution toward accomplishing a coordinated education initiative, resources management program, awareness campaign, and heritage grants program. Maritime museums in America are dedicated to illuminating humankind's experience with the sea and the events that shaped the course and progress of civilization.  Museum collections are composed of hundreds of thousands of maritime items, including ship models, scrimshaw, maritime paintings, decorative arts, intricately carved figureheads, working steam engines, and much more. Maritime museums offer a variety of learning experiences for children and adults through hands-on workshops and programs that focus on maritime history.  Maritime lecture series offer an opportunity to learn about the history and lore of the sea from some of the Nation's leading maritime experts. Visitors learn the broad concept of sea power--the historic and modern importance of the sea in matters commercial, military, economic, political, artistic, and social.  The legislation that I am proposing would help museums better interpret maritime and social history to the public using their extensive collections of artifacts, exhibits and expertise. These programs and facilities are used by schools, civic organizations, genealogists, maritime scholars, and the visiting public, thus, serving students of all ages.  I urge all members of the Senate to join me in support of The America's National Maritime Museum Designation Act of 2003.                                 ______                                       By
