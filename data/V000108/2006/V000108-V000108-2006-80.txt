Speaker, it is with great respect and deep sadness that I wish to commend United States Army Staff Sergeant Jonathan Rojas for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Staff Sergeant Rojas was killed in action when his vehicle came under attack by small arms fire near Baghdad, Iraq on October 3, 2006. His sacrifice will be remembered by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  Born in Mexico City, Mexico, Jonathan Rojas moved to Hammond, Indiana in 1990 to be with his family. Following his graduation from Hammond High School in 1997, he attended college for a year and eventually went on to work for several years at a local glass company, prior to joining the Army in 1999.  Jonathan's friends and family recall him as always being playful, the type to never refrain from cracking a joke. They also remember him as a good kid who was never in trouble and loved to spend time with his family. Jonathan was an avid sports enthusiast who participated in soccer and baseball while in school, and as with so many of his generation, he was a true video game aficionado.  Staff Sergeant Rojas leaves behind a loving family that misses him very much. He is survived by his devoted wife, Tasha (Sullivan) Rojas. The couple would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary on October 25, 2006, and planned to start a family upon Jonathan's return to civilian life. Jonathan also leaves to cherish his memory his adoring parents, Jose and Catalina Rojas, his brother, William (Norma) Rojas, his sister, Isaura Rojas, and his nephew, William Rojas, Jr., as well as his treasured companions, Diamond, Tyson, and Joker. Staff Sergeant Jonathan Rojas also will be greatly missed by a saddened but proud community and a grateful nation.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Staff Sergeant Jonathan Rojas. Staff Sergeant Rojas is the sixteenth service member from northwest Indiana to sacrifice his life during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his passing comes as a setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Staff Sergeant Rojas will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1999]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT JONATHAN ROJAS                                 ______                                                         HON.
