I told the distinguished Senator from Virginia I consider him my Senator when I am away from home. Of course, I consider Senator Jeffords my Senator when I am at home. But down here I have a home in northern Virginia where I live during the Senate session and I have seen exactly what the Senator from Virginia has said. People working hard, people come by asking elderly neighbors do they need something from the store? They were going to ski to the store, whatever.  When he talks about the hospitals and the 4-wheel drives, I know about that from firsthand experience. My wife is a nurse on a medical surgical floor in this area. She was on the shift that ended Saturday and Sunday and Monday night around midnight. As you know, the snow was coming down pretty hard at that time. Complete strangers were coming into the hospital with 4-wheel drives, people who were working at other jobs, to take nurses and doctors back and forth, pick up medical supplies, to take critically people back and forth. Total strangers were bringing her home. We could not get out at first, out of our street, to go ourselves. But they were doing that. There was that sense of cooperation that, frankly--and I mean this as a great compliment to the Senator from Virginia--it is the kind of cooperation we see in our State where we do get hit with heavy snowfalls like this, I know, whether it is in the little town of Middlesex, VT, where my farm is, or Shrewsbury, VT, the beautiful area where Senator Jeffords is from.  I yield to the distinguished colleague from Vermont.
