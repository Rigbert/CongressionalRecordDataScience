I share his frustration about short-term extensions. Similarly, I have been trying to work in good faith to extend the EB-5 Regional Center Program, which is as important to Alabama as it is to Vermont.  Much to the detriment of the economic benefits created by the EB-5 program, such as capital investments and new jobs in American communities, the Senator from Alabama and others have refused to pass an EB-5 extension without simultaneously extending the E-Verify Program. I believe they should both be extended.While I have no objection to reauthorizing the E-Verify Program for a longer term, so long as it remains voluntary and free of mandates, I cannot vote for one that leaves the EB-5 program behind.  Besides, in the context of this bill which has to be passed and enacted to keep the Federal Government running, this amendment is inappropriate. It is the wrong action at this time and would jeopardize the swift passage of this legislation.  I support the efforts of Chairman Inouye, Senator Byrd, and others to oppose it.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
