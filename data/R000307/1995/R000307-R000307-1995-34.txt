Chairman, I share the concern in reference to the food stamp program. This appropriations bill actually increases that. It was this gentleman on the Committee on Agriculture that made a very determined effort simply not to block grant the food stamp program.  I would say what has already been said by my colleague from New Mexico and the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, this bill allows us to privatize. We are going to do that. The OMB wanted to do it immediately. We would end up here with a situation where many rural telephone companies would not have access to the money to borrow from. It would cause utter chaos in the communications system out in our rural areas. It is really not commensurate with the food stamp program.  We will privatize. We will get there from here. I would just urge the gentleman to allow us to do this work under the bill that we would like to do, and I will be happy to work with the gentleman in regard to food stamps.
