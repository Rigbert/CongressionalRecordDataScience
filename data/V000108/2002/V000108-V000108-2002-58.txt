Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, reminds us that we must continually work and, if necessary, fight to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District will be recognized during the 23rd Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast on Monday, January 21, 2002, at the Genesis Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Frontiers Service Club that was founded in 1952 sponsors this annual memorial breakfast.  This year the Gary Frontiers Club will pay tribute to nine local individuals who have for decades unselfishly contributed to improving the human condition of others in the City of Gary. Those individuals who will be recognized as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast include: Thomas V. Barnes, Former Mayor of Gary; James W. Holland, deceased Former Deputy Mayor of Gary; Rudolph Clay, Lake Country 1st District Commissioner; Frank Perry, Former Lake County Councilman; Reverend Dr. Floyd E. Dumas, Sr., Founder and former Pastor of the Metropolitan Baptist Church; Nancy M. Kelly, Vice President of L.C.E.O.C., Inc.; Earline Rogers, Indiana State Senator; Dr. Vernon G. Smith, Indiana State Representative; and David E. Ross, Jr. M.D., an active and honorable community member. Additionally, one of these nine individuals will be honored with the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award.Also in attendance at this year's memorial breakfast will be students from the Gary Community School Corporation.  Though very different in nature, the achievement of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and rose to the occasion. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love''. They set goals and worked to achieve them.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Gary Frontiers Service Club president, Mr. Floyd Donaldson, and all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination and dedication to making Northwest Indiana a better place for all who live and work there.                          ____________________
