Speaker, I rise today to recognize the centennial celebration of the Kiwanis Club of Toledo. Members will gather in downtown Toledo on Friday, September 23 to celebrate this milestone.  Only the ninth club in the United States, the Toledo club was chartered on May 8, 1916. Originally thought of as a ``businessmen's club'' to promote local business, World War 1 changed the focus to that of community service with the members raising funds for the American Red Cross' wartime services. Club membership grew as community service became firmly established. Its focus was on children, with many activities for the youth of Toledo, orphans and Boy Scouts.  According to the club's history, ``The name `Kiwanis' comes from a Native American term `Nun Keewanis' which means `I make noise.' The Kiwanis International motto is `We build.' The Kiwanis Club of Toledo has taken these two expressions to heart . . . As a thriving organization of men, women and youth; we are dedicated to serving the children of Toledo and improving the quality of life worldwide.''  The Kiwanis Club's commitment to Toledo and its young people runs deep. The Club sponsors scholarships for high school seniors, adopted central city schools and provides fun and opportunities for the children in those schools, financed the facility housing Assistance Dogs of America, provides for after school tutoring at the Boys and Girls Club and an annual fishing derby and Punt, Pass & Kick program, donated an elephant and the Living Stream at the Toledo Zoo, and supported various activities at Woodward High School in Toledo, the University of Toledo, the YMCA, Easter Seals Summer Camp, Toledo Hearing & Speech Center, and Bethany House shelter for women and their children. By no means complete, this list illustrates the many contributions made by members of the Kiwanis Club and their passion for service to our youth. In keeping with the spirit of giving to Toledo's children, the Kiwanis Club of Toledo has initiated a Centennial Project, partnering with the Toledo Mud Hens baseball club in ventures which will enhance the ballpark experience for families.  The members of Toledo Kiwanis have led by example for a century of service. Members have passed on a strong sense of community through the decades, demonstrating by word and deed the high ideals of Kiwanis and the dedication of its members. To the men, women and families of the Toledo Kiwanis Club, we take the opportunity of this centennial celebration to say ``Thank you.'' Let us express our gratitude as we reflect on the past century of Kiwanis' constancy of service and leadership for community betterment. May this new century yield committed citizens of equal measure who rise above self to promote the common good.                          ____________________
