 Mr. Chairman, I think this whole thing depends on whether the lawyer down at the Department of Agriculture believes that the regulations that are now being promulgated in regards to the wool and mohair program fall in the classification of routine. You can talk to John Golden down there; he is the attorney. He expressed some concerns not only in this regard but the whole laundry list of things that was listed here. In talking to Secretary Rominger last night, I know what the situation is here. We have many agencies under marching orders from the administration who express concern about this. We share that concern. I think it does fall under the category of routine.  We have made our best effort in this colloquy to make it very clear to the Department that it is routine and that this bill will not interfere with any regulations in regard to the self-help and promotion program for the hard-pressed wool grower.  So my answer to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Volkmer] is, with all due respect, I think it is exempted. He has a different view. I think we can make sure. We have oversight responsibility to take care of it.

Rule: Doc. No. 93-165-3, National Environmental Policy Act      Implementing Procedures. Sets forth procedures APHIS will      follow to comply with NEPA.       Beneficiaries: Consumers; environmental groups.       Impact: Many environmental groups have been lobbying APHIS      for years to redesign and publish these procedures. They will      see their withdrawal as backing away from commitment to      environmental quality.       Date: Final rule published 2/1/95; effective 3/3/95.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-026-2, Introduction of Nonindigenous      Organisms That May Be Plant Pests. Would establish      comprehensive regulations governing the introduction      (importation, interstate movement, and release into the      environment) of certain nonindigenous organisms that may be      plant pests. Responds to an Office of Technology Assessment      report stating that harmful introductions cost an estimated      $97 billion between 1906 and 1991, and that controls are      urgently needed. The rule would clarify the current      ``permit'' process, which can take a long time and which      importers do not like.       Beneficiaries: American public; university and corporate      researchers.       Impact: Failure to proceed would endanger agricultural      production and the environment, alarm environmental groups,      and frustrate researchers seeking permits under the outmoded      current system.       Date: Proposal published 1/26/95.                       issue: international trade       States affected: All.       Rule: There are several important regulations pending. Some      of these regulations directly affect our implementation of      GATT. These regulations relate to requests from foreign      countries or importers to remove or ease restrictions on      importations of various commodities. One such regulation      under development (Doc. No. 94-106-1) would revise      [[Page H2131]]  our animal import regulations to allow for      importations from regions, rather than countries only, and to      recognize levels of risk, rather than just diseased/disease-     free areas. Another regulation that has generated      considerable interest concerns the importation of logs,      lumber and other unmanufactured wood (Doc. No. 91-074-1).      Other examples include importation of animals and germ plasma      from countries where scrapie exists (Doc. No. 94-085-1),      importation of additional species of embryos from countries      where foot-and-mouth disease exists (Doc. No. 94-006-1),      removal of a staining requirement for imported seed (95-004-     1), and a number of regulations allowing the importation of      additional types of fruits and vegetables from various      countries, including Mexico, Korea, and Chile. In addition,      we routinely publish regulations to change the disease status      of a country or area, based on changes in those conditions.      Pending regulations include ones to declare Spain free of      African horse sickness and swine vesicular disease, and to      declare Switzerland free of foot-and-mouth disease and      viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease. These changes      would relieve certain restrictions on imports from those      countries. Conversely, we sometimes need to publish a      regulation to restrict imports when there is an outbreak of a      pest or disease in a country or area.       Beneficiaries: The ability to improve the variety and      supply of animals, plants, and their products benefits      producers, importers, brokers, food distributors and      processors, and consumers. Northwest lumber mills would      benefit from the rule concerning wood imports.       Impact: When the scientific/biological data provides no      indication of substantial pest or disease risk from the      importation, failure to revise our regulations puts us in      violation of GATT. There is considerable pressure on the      United States to implement these many of the regulations      listed above in response to GATT. Failure to finalize Doc.      No. 94-106-1 could result in other countries putting      additional restrictions on U.S. exports. While there is often      opposition to regulations of this type, there is always some      interest, usually for the purpose of improving bloodlines or      stock, or establishing a supply to meet a new or growing      market. Northwest lumber mills are eager for wood rule      because they believe it will give them additional logs to      cut, and some environmentalists prefer using imported to      domestic logs. A number of mills have stated they will go out      of business without a reliable source of imported logs.            specific rules with international trade impacts       States affected: Cattle and swine producing States.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-106-1, Regionalization for Animal      Imports. Would revise      our animal import regulations to allow for importations from      regions, rather than countries only, and to recognize      levels of risk, rather than just diseased/disease-free      areas.       Beneficiaries: Producers, importers, brokers, food      distributors and processors, and consumers benefit from the      ability to improve the variety and supply of animals, plants,      and their products.       Impact: Failure to proceed would produce opposition from      animal breeding industries and GATT partners.       Date: Proposal under development.       States affected: New Hampshire, New England States.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-080-2, Specifically Approved States      Authorized to Receive Mares and Stallions Imported From CEM-     Affected Countries. Allows horses imported from countries      where contagious equine metritis exists to be treated and      quarantined in NH.       States affected: NH and other New England States.       Beneficiaries: Horse industry in NH and elsewhere in New      England. This rule gives New Hampshire an economic advantage      for valuable import.       Impact: Withdrawal would cause objection from      beneficiaries.       Date: Direct final rule effective 12/16/94.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-096-3, Horses From Mexico; Quarantine      Requirements. Removes restrictions that are no longer      necessary on the importation of horses from Mexico.      Restrictions were to prevent the introduction into the U.S.      of Venezuelan equine enteritidis, which is no longer present      in Mexico.       Beneficiaries: Importers of horses from Mexico.       Impact: Would negatively affect relations with Mexico and      could cause repercussions in other animal or plant health      areas if Mexico retaliates. Would be contrary to NAFTA and      GATT.       Date: Final rule published 1/26/95; effective 2/16/95.       States affected: California.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-157-3, Mexican Fruit Fly Regulations;      Removal of Regulated Area. Removes restrictions on movement      of citrus and other regulated articles.       Beneficiaries: Growers, wholesalers, exporters.       Impact: California production would be negatively impacted      by the failure to lift the quarantine. Fruit and vegetable      producers and associations would be likely to complain about      this action.       Date: Published 1/26/95; effective 2/27/95.       States affected: California.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-117-1, Oriental Fruit Fly; Quarantine      Part of LA County, CA. Quarantines an area to prevent OFF      spread and protect export markets.       Beneficiaries: Growers, wholesalers, exporters.       Impact: Withdrawal would allow OFF spread. If spread      occurs, it would likely lead Japan and U.S. citrus States to      reject CA citrus.       Date: Published 11/14/95; effective 11/7/95.       States Affected: Primarily CA, FL, and HI.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-147-2, Imported Palms. Allows certain      palms to be imported from New Zealand and Australia.      Beneficiaries: Supported by comercial ornamental plant      growers. Hawaiian Representatives Patsy Mink and Neil      Abercrombie supported this rule.       Impact: Withdrawing this rule would reduce the number of      sources for Howea palms to one. Opposition from nurserymen in      CA, FL, and HI.       Date: Final rule published and effective 1/24/95.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-031-2, Inspection of Animals Exported to      Canada and Mexico. Requires a final inspection before export      of livestock, including horses, shipped by air to Canada or      Mexico.       Beneficiaries: The American Horse Council supports this      rule.       Impact: Failure to take this action could result in sick      animals being exported to Canada and Mexico, and having to be      returned to the U.S.       Date: Final rule published 1/24/95; effective 2/23/95.       States affected: CA, FL, all.       Rule: Doc. No. 89-154-2, Importation of Plants Established      in Growing Media. Allows additional genera of plants in      growing media (potted plants) to be imported into the United      States.       Beneficiaries: Importers and brokers of imported products.       Impact: From the standpoint of GATT, there is no sound      biological reason to continue to prohibit these imports,      which would be the effect of a moratorium. California and      Florida representatives are most likely to hear from their      constituents, although other areas may be affected as well.       Date: Final rule published 1/13/95; effective 2/13/95.       States affected: All (GATT/NAFTA issue).       Rule: Doc. No. 89-117-4, Honeybees and Honeybee Semen From      New Zealand. Allows imports.       Beneficiaries: Apiary industries.       Impact: If we withdraw the rule, we may be challenged under      GATT conflict resolution procedures.       Date: Final rule published 2/1/95, effective 3/3/95.       States affected: California.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-042-2, True Potato Seed From Chile.      Allows imports.       Beneficiaries: Plant breeders, potato producers.       Impact: California Department of Food and Agriculture      supports this, and several California companies (especially      Esca Genetics/TPS Products) have invested heavily in      expectation of it. CA Rep. Anna G. Eshoo wrote in support of      it.       Date: Final published 2/16/95, effective 3/20/95.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-069-1, Tangerines From Cheju Island      (Korea). Would allow imports.       Beneficiaries: Consumers; exporters seeking reciprocal      arrangements.       Impact: GATT issue, we could be challenged if we withdraw      it.       Date: Under development.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-114-1, Imported Fruits & Vegetables; 6th      Periodic Amendment. We do this kind of rule regularly to      allow newly-requested frutis and vegetables to be imported.       Beneficiaries: Importers, wholesalers, consumers.       Impact: Delaying this rule would affect importers and      distributors in most States, and reduce the variety of      produce available to consumers.       Date: Proposal nearly ready to publish.       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-116-3, Fresh Hass Avocados From Mexico.      Would allow imports of Hass avocados.       Beneficiaries: Importers, consumers.       Impact: Mexico has been seeking this change for years and      will accuse the U.S. of violating NAFTA if we do not pursue      the proposal. Domestic avocado producers would support the      delay in this proposal.       Date: Under development.                     issue: animal and plant health       States affected: All.       Rule: There are several important regulations pending. Some      of these are necessary to prevent the spread of pests and      diseases within the United States. These include additions to      lists of noxious weeds (Doc. Nos. 93-126-3 and 94-050-1).      Others are needed to protect U.S. livestock and poultry from      additional sources of disease and to further the eradication      of bovine tuberculosis. Examples include payment of indemnity      for cervids destroyed because of tuberculosis (Doc. No. 94-     133-1), payment of indemnity for cattle and bison destroyed      following exposure to tuberculous cervids (Doc. No. 93-125-     1), discontinuance of the in-bond program for cattle from      Mexico (Doc. No. 94--87-1), and a revision of domestic      regulations pertaining to viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle      disease (VVND) in birds and poultry (Doc. No. 87-090-2). In      addition, APHIS routinely publishes rules related to changes      in the disease or pest conditions in a State or area. When      an      [[Page H2132]]  outbreak occurs, the Agency must move quickly      to contain the outbreak, and keep the pest or disease from      spreading. Examples include regulations quarantining areas      because of fruit flies, pink bollworm, and pine shoot beetle,      and regulations that change the disease status of a State or      area because of new outbreaks of brucellosis or tuberculosis.       Beneficiaries: U.S. livestock and poultry producers, as      well as fruit, vegetable, and grain producers, exporters,      food distributors and processors, and consumers.       Impact: The spread of noxious weeds would result in a      reduction in usable agricultural acreage, harming the cattle      industry and other agricultural entities. Failure to finalize      the tuberculosis regulations would impede efforts to      eradicate the disease in the U.S., hurting the livestock      industry and creating human health concerns. The revisions to      the VVND regulations would, among other things, reduce the      number of birds that would have to be destroyed if there is      an outbreak of that disease in U.S. poultry flocks. Failure      to take emergency actions could cause severe economic losses      to U.S. agriculture.           specific rules with animal or plant health impacts       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 92-098-3, Viruses, Serums, Toxins, and      Analogous Products; Packaging and Labeling. Prohibits certain      repackaging of, and removal of labels on, veterinary      biological products.       Beneficiaries: Consumers (primarily animal hobbyists and      breeders).       Impact: Consumers (primarily animal hobbyists and      breeders), will continue to suffer from the lack of dose      instructions available to them when they purchase single      doses of vaccines, etc. This has resulted in illness and      death among animals. Failure to implement the regulations      will allow this situation to continue. Biologics      manufacturers will be happy because they do not want to      comply with labeling requirements.       Date: Published 1/12/95; effective 8/19/95.       States affected: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota,      Ohio, and Pennsylvania.       Rule: Doc. No. 92-139-8, Pine Shoot Beetle Quarantine      Areas. Quarantines areas in States because of the pine shoot      beetle.       Beneficiaries: The Christmas tree industry is most directly      affected by the failure to quarantine to prevent the spread      of the pest. This industry exists in Indiana and surrounding      States.       Impact: States with PSB that lack a Federal quarantine will      likely have to comply with commerce restrictions imposed by      surrounding States. This is a routine action that could apply      to other States as well in the next 6 months.       Date: Interim rule published 1/9/95; effective 12/29/94;      more rules pending.                         issue: animal welfare       States affected: All.       Rule: Several are pending, including one concerning ``Swim      With The Dolphins'' programs (Doc. No. 93-076-3), one that      would remove a requirement for hot-iron face-branding of      certain cattle (Doc. No. 95-006-2), and one that would allow      certain diseased horses to be moved to slaughter without      being permanently marked with a hot iron, chemical, or freeze      brand or lip tatoo (Doc. No. 94-061-2).       Beneficiaries: Animal welfare issues have generated intense      and widespread interest among animal rights organizations and      the American public in general. The ``Swim With The      Dolphins'' regulation is supported by the Humane Society of      the United States, the Animal Welfare Institute, the American      Zoo and Aquarium Assn., and the Alliance of Marine Mammal      Parks and Aquariums. Animal Rights International and People      for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have been lobbying hard      for changes to our face-branding requirements.       Impact: The ``Swim With The Dolphins'' regulation is      necessary to ensure facilities with these programs adhere to      certain standards for care of the dolphins. Animal welfare      activists, especially in Florida, would weigh in heavily if      we do not take this action. An earlier (1994) rulemaking that      removed face-branding requirements for certain imported      cattle generated tremendous interest and support, including      full-page ads in the Washington newspapers and New York      Times.               specific rules with animal welfare impacts       States affected: All.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-006-3, Identification of Certain Cattle      Imported From Mexico. Allows cattle from Mexico to be      permanently identified with a mark located high on the hip      rather than be face-branded with a hot iron.       Beneficiaries: Generated tremendous interest and support,      including full page ads placed in Washington newspapers and      New York Times by Animal Rights International. PETA and other      animal welfare groups also lobbied hard for this change.       Impact: Serious opposition from animal rights      organizations. After many years and considerable effort, the      United States is nearing eradication of tuberculosis. While      we are moving to eradicate the last areas of infection in the      United States, we must improve our level of protection      against new introductions of the disease, which not only      affects cattle, but can be transmitted to humans. In addition      to being an animal health issue, this became an animal      welfare issue. This issue was so important to the animal      welfare community that it generated thousands of letters and      resulted in full-page advertisements in national newspapers.       Date: Final rule published 12/22/94; effective 1/23/95.                         issue: domestic trade       States affected: All.       Rule: Several are pending, including one that would give      accredited veterinarians additional time between inspection      of animals and the issuance of a certificate for their      movement (Doc. No. 94-027-1) and one that would provide an      additional official test for pseudorabies in swine (Doc. No.      94-064-2). In addition, APHIS routinely publishes rules      related to changes in improvements in disease or pest      conditions in a State or area. When a pest or disease is      eradicated, the Agency should relieve unnecessary      restrictions on producers and others as rapidly as is      practical. An example of this would be removing an area from      quarantine for Mediterranean fruit fly, or raising the      brucellosis status of a State to Class Free. These actions      relieve restrictions on interstate movements and improve the      marketability of previously restricted articles.       Beneficiaries: The rule concerning accredited veterinarians      would primarily affect large swine producers in Iowa,      Illinois, North Carolina, Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana,      Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and South Dakota.      The swine industry, especially in Illinois and Iowa, is very      interested in the pseudorabies test docket because making the      test available would allow thousands of herd owners to      qualify their animals for interstate movement to new markets.      Supporters of the pseudorabies test include vaccine producers      Kline Beecham and IDEXX, State animal health officials, the      American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians      (AAVLD), and the United States Animal Health Association      (USAHA). Other types of domestic trade actions pending would      benefit the U.S. livestock in general, as well as fruit and      vegetable producers, exporters, food distributors and      processors, and consumers.       Impact: A moratorium would keep unnecessary restrictions on      producers and others. Lack of the pseudorabies test rule, in      addition to keeping many markets closed to many swine      producers, would hinder Federal and State efforts to      eradicate pseudorabies because swine producers are reluctant      to vaccinate their animals if their markets for those swine      would be restricted.               specific rules with domestic trade impacts       States affected: Colorado.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-134-1, Brucellosis; CO From Class A to      Class Free. This interim rule raised the brucellosis status      of Colorado.       Beneficiaries: Livestock producers in CO.       Impact: Invalidating would place unnecessary restrictions      on livestock moving from the State, and would hurt their      marketability. This is a routine action that could apply to      other States as well over the next 6 months.       Date: Published and effective 1/23/95.       States affected: all cattle producing States.       Rule: Doc. No. 94-093-2, Brucellosis in Cattle and Bison;      Payment of Indemnity. Authorizes payment of indemnity for      additional cases.       Beneficiaries: Herd owners affected by brucellosis.       Impact: Failure to finalize would hinder brucellosis      eradication efforts. Members likely to hear from NCA, USAHA      and other farm groups.       Date: Proposal published 1/31/95.       States affected: Hawaii primarily; also Alaska.       Rule: Doc. No. 93-088-2, Avocados From Hawaii. Allows      avocados to move from Hawaii into Alaska without treatment.       Beneficiaries: Hawaiian avocado growers and related      industries; consumers in Alaska.       Impact: HI has a strong interest in this rule. Hawaiian      avocado growers would be negatively affected.       Date: Final rule published and effective 12/28/94.       States affected: All--national issue. Northeast, CA heavily      affected.       Rule: Doc. No. 92-151-3, National Poultry Improvement Plan      and Auxiliary Provisions. Revises Plan standards.       Beneficiaries: poultry producers, food safety interests.       Impact: This rule will implement recommendations made by      industry groups; failure to finalize will negatively affect      efforts to control disease and improve the health of poultry      flocks.       Date: Final rule published and effective 11/18/94.   organizations and associations that routinely express interest in                        accomplishing aphis rules       American Association of Nurserymen, Animal Rights      International/Coalition for Non-Violent Food, Humane Society      of the U.S., American Veterinary Medical Association,      National Cattlemens Association, U.S. Animal Health      Association, California Department of Food and Agriculture,      FDACS, PETA, American Horse Council, National Pork Producers,      Doris Day Animal League, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Society      for Animal Protective Legislation, Fund for Animals, National      Milk Producers Federation, Texas & Southwestern Cattle      Raiser's Assoc., State Agriculture Departments, State Cattle      Feeder Associations, American      [[Page H2133]]  Farm Bureau Federation, Eastern Milk      Producers, State Cattlemens Assocs, and State Animal Health      Commissions.          issue: nutrition labeling of meat and poultry (usda)       States affected: All       Rule: This rule amends current regulations to provide      condified language for provisions that previously cross-     referenced RDA regulations, make corrections to existing      regulations, and minor technical changes. This rule      streamlines and makes consistent an existing regulation.       Beneficiary of the Rule: Industry, consumers, health      professionals, nutrition interests, laboratories, libraries--     anyone who uses the Code of Federal Regulations.       Impact of H.R. 450: Would leave existing, more cumbersome      regulation in force.       Date: Published January 3, 1995.     issue: nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger (usda)       States affected: All       Rule: This rule would permit the nutrition labeling of      ground beef and hamburger to include ``____% lean'' ``____%      fat.''       Beneficiary of the Rule: Consumers; truth-in-labeling      issue, dieticians, nutritionists, industry; marketing      advantage.       Impact of H.R. 450: Suspension of the rule will deny      consumers information to help them make healthy dietary      choices.       Date: Expected to publish in second quarter of FY 1995.issue: poultry products produced by mechanical separation and products              in which such poultry products are used (usda)       States affected: All, primarily poultry producing states       Rule: Rule would require that mechanically separated      poultry be identified in ingredients statements of hot dogs,      bologna and other processed products as ``mechanically      separated chicken or turkey'' instead of simply ``chicken''      or ``turkey.'' Because bones and carcass parts are ground and      crushed to extract adhering meat fragments, mechanically      separated product has a physical form and texture that differ      from ordinary chicken or turkey meat.       Beneficiary of the Rule: Consumers; truth-in-labeling. The      meat industry, whose mechanically separated and deboned      products do not differ in texture from ordinary meat      products, supports this rule because it would make a labeling      distinction between the content of mechanically separated      poultry and meat products.       Impact of H.R. 450: The suspension of this rule would leave      current regulations in force, which allow mechanically      separated poultry to be labeled ``chicken'' or ``turkey,''      but require mechanically separated or deboned meat to be      labeled as such.       Date: Published December 6, 1994. Comment period closes      March 6, 1995. issue: opportunity to promote and strategically market sheep products                    through producer self-help (usda)       States affected: California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana,      Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South      Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming.       Rule: USDA must publish rules to implement the newly      enacted Sheep Research and Promotion Act passed by Congress.      U.S. sheep producers have collectively voted to assess      themselves and importers, to use the funds collected to      conduct research and promotion activities to strategically      market sheep and products.       Beneficiaries: U.S. sheep producers, and consumers of lamb      and wool products.       Impact of H.R. 450: The Nation's sheep and wool producers      will be unable to collectively come together, across a dozen      states, to develop marketing strategies to expand markets for      their products if H.R. 450 is implemented. In the meanwhile,      foreign producers will be strategically targeting U.S.      consumers as a growing niche market, and promoting their      foreign-origin lamb at the expense of domestic producers.                   issue: cotton classing fees (usda)       States affected: California, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas,      Louisiana, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri       Rule: Annual determination of fees to be charged cotton      producers who voluntarily request and obtain grading services      to determine the quality of their cotton.       Beneficiaries: U.S. cotton producers, and wholesale and      retail buyers of cotton and products made from cotton.       Impact of H.R. 450: USDA can reduce the fees charged to the      Nation's cotton producers, saving them millions of dollars.      Each year, based on expected crop size, USDA determines by      formula the fee needed to cover cotton quality grading      services (classing). The past season's cotton crop was record      large, and since fees are partly determined by expected      volumes, the large crop generated more revenue than needed.      This year, USDA can reduce the fee charged to producers, and      save U.S. cotton growers $3-4 million. In turn, such savings      reduce costs to growers, which are passed on to consumers,      both domestic and foreign. U.S. cotton exports are a fast-     growing market, and U.S. cotton has become one of the most      competitive fibers worldwide. Any opportunities to keep costs      low, while maintaining the availability of quality assurance,      would be lost if H.R. 450 is enacted.issue: pathogen reduction in meat and poultry products; hazard analysis            and critical control point (haccp) systems (usda)       States affected: All       Rule: The proposed rule is designed to eliminate a critical      gap in the meat and poultry inspection program and reduce the      incidence of foodborne illness caused by pathogenically      contaminated meat and poultry products. Through mandatory      HACCP, we will (1) target pathogens that cause foodborne      illness; (2) strengthen industry responsibility to produce      safe food; and (3) focus inspection and plant activities on      prevention objectives.       Beneficiary of the Rule: Consumer interests, persons at      greatest risk for foodborne illness: elderly, children,      persons with compromised immune systems.       Impact of H.R. 450: According to the Centers for Disease      Control, foodborne illness from all food sources range from      6.5 million to 81 million cases each year, and up to 9,000      deaths. Suspension of this rule would forego yearly public      health benefits ranging from $990 million to $3.7 billion.      These estimates include the cost of medical care and lost      work time.       Date: Published February 3, 1995. Comment period ends June      5, 1995. USDA's goal is to publish a final rule by the end of      the year. issue: use of term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products                                  (usda)       States affected: Poultry producing states, particularly      California, Arkansas, Georgia, and Minnesota       Rule: The proposed rule would amend the Poultry Products      Inspection Act (PPIA) to prohibit the use of the term      ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products whose      internal temperature has ever been below 26 deg.F. Raw      poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been      below 26 deg.F, but above 0 deg.F, may not be labeled as      ``fresh'' and must be labeled as ``previously frozen.'' Raw      poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been at      or below O deg.F may not be labeled as ``fresh'' and must be      labeled as ``frozen'' or ``previously frozen.''       Beneficiary of the Rule: Truth-in-labeling issue benefiting      consumers, as well as regional poultry producers whose      products compete in local markets with nationally      distributed, previously frozen birds that can be thawed and      labeled ``fresh'' under current regulations.       Impact of H.R. 450: Existing regulations allowing      previously frozen poultry to be labeled as ``fresh'' would      remain in force, causing continued confusion in the      marketplace.       Date: Published January 17, 1995. Comment period closes      March 20, 1995.  issue: meat produced by advanced meat/bone separation machinery and                       meat recovery systems (usda)       States affected: All, primarily states with large meat      processing industries       Rule: Rule amends the federal regulations to allow meat      produced by advanced meat and bone separation machinery to be      labeled as ``beef'' or ``pork'' instead of ``mechanically      separated beef or pork.'' This action was taken to update the      definition of ``meat'' to acknowledge advances in meat      separating technology that enable meat to be separated from      the bones of livestock without grinding, crushing, or      pulverizing bones to remove adhering skeletal tissue.       Beneficiary of the Rule: Truth-in-labeling issue that      benefits consumers. Also, the meat industry benefits from a      redefinition of meat that includes mechanically separated      product.       Impact of H.R. 450: Suspending this regulation would meet      with opposition from the meat industry which, for years, has      claimed that poultry producers have a market advantage in      that product they produce using mechanical separation can be      labeled simply as ``chicken'' or ``turkey,'' while beef or      pork produced through mechanical separation must be labeled      as ``mechanically separated.'' The meat industry could be      expected to point to this as another illustration of how      unequal meat and poultry regulations result in preferential      treatment of the poultry industry.       Date: Published December 6, 1994. Comment period closes      March 6, 1995.     Impact of a Regulatory Moratorium on Industries Served by the                   Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)       Marketing Orders and Agreements: Under a moratorium, these      self-help programs will be useless as a viable tool for      producers to use to help strategically market perishable      commodities.       Regulations Affected by a Moratorium: Operating rules for      marketing strategies, committee budgets and expenses, and      industry assessments. For producers in 38 fruit and vegetable      self-help programs, annual rules are needed to determine      seasonal marketing strategies, set budgets and assessments,      and notify industry members. For dairy producers in 37 milk      order regions, periodic rules are used to invoke, suspend, or      amend marketing order provisions to keep orders current with      market conditions, and enable dairy producers to      strategically market milk and dairy products.       There are approximately 75,000 small fruit and vegetable      producers, and 92,000 small dairy producers, as well as U.S.      consumers of higher quality, stable supplies of fruits,      vegetables, milk and dairy products, that benefit from these      self-help programs.       These small businesses have few opportunities to come      together to collectively solve their marketing problems, earn      fair and stable returns for their products, and compete in a      tough global marketplace by promoting      [[Page H2134]]  quality, wholesome U.S. products. A      moratorium will effectively render these programs useless as      a viable marketing tool by producers.        dairy milk marketing orders--actions since november 1994       Approximately 92,000 dairy farmers (about three-quarters of      all dairy farmers) participate in 38 federal milk marketing      orders. Their average herd size is 75 cows, and before      expenses, dairymen average less than $150,000 in annual      sales.       Federal marketing orders are initiated by producers; if a      majority believes that the order no longer serves their      interests, they are free to terminate the program. Moreover,      in the case of any changes that would be considered      substantive, the affected producers must vote to approve      those changes. In other words, milk marketing orders, and the      rules under which they operate, are truly in the hands of the      producers, not a federal agency.       Since November 1994, revisions in 11 milk marketing orders      have been initiated; these 11 orders represent over 34,500      milk producers. These actions are not regulatory burdens      imposed on industry. Rather, the actions taken or proposed to      be taken, by industry, help to keep marketing orders dynamic,      so they reflect current market conditions facing dairy      producers, with respect to adequate supplies of milk needed      in a market, milk prices received by producers, and      recordkeeping or other ``housekeeping'' or administrative      procedures. Actions taken since November include the      following:       Central Arizona Milk Order (135 producers covered)--Action      to correct marketing inequities within the order. Rescinding      the action means recalculating dairy farmers' milk checks,      and some producers might have to refund income they have      already received and used to cover expenses.       Central Arizona Milk Order--Action taken to propose,      beginning March 1, 1995 and extending indefinitely,      suspension of certain pooling provisions applied to      producers' milk. Inability to suspend the pooling      requirements could result in an imbalance of supplies to meet      demand in fluid, soft, and hard products markets, with      adverse consequences for producer prices and incomes.       Carolina and Tennessee Valley Orders (covering 3,100      producers)--Action to provide notice of a hearing, whose      purpose is to correct pricing problems that exist in the      orders. Failure to hold the hearing and correct the pricing      problems will lead to imbalances in milk supplies relative to      local demand, with negative consequences for incomes of some      producers in the order areas.       Carolina Milk Order (1,550 producers covered in the      Carolina Order alone)--action initiated to propose relaxing      certain order provisions for the period January-February      1995, to correct pricing problems. Rescinding the action      would result in loss of money for some handlers.       Georgia, et al. (covering 1,355 producers)--Initiation of a      formal rulemaking process to consider proposals to merge a      number of marketing areas in the Southeast under one order.      Additional actions have been taken to accommodate the      industry by providing time extensions to file exceptions to      proposed amendments.       Additional actions have been taken to accommodate the      industry by providing time extensions to file exceptions to      proposed amendments.       Chicago Milk Order (covering approximately 18,000      producers)--Action taken to accommodate all interests in the      order, by providing an extension of time for filing      exceptions on proposed amendments to rule.       Southern Illinois-E. Missouri Milk (covers over 2,250      producers)--Action to relax certain provisions of the order,      to enable better balancing of supplies. Without the action,      excessive milk would be shipped for fluid use, unnecessarily      depressing prices and resulting in inefficient allocations of      supplies to meet local demand.       Southern Illinois Milk Order--Action to relax pooling      regulation for producer milk that is supplied by 2,257      producers. Cooperatives will lose money without the      suspension, because members' milk will be ineligible for      pooling.       Central Illinois Milk Order--Action proposed to relax      pooling requirements. Rescinding this action means that dairy      farmers covered under this order would not be able to have      their milk priced and pooled, and would lose income.       Southern Michigan Milk Order--Action taken at the request      of the industry, to update the method of paying the 3,600      dairy farmers covered under this order for their milk.       Iowa Milk Order--Action taken to withdraw an earlier      proceeding initiated to increase the pool supply of milk;      supplies now appear to be adequate for meeting local needs.      Over 3,400 producers are covered by this order.       Tennessee Valley Milk Order--Action taken to prevent the      uneconomical shipment of milk and ensure that milk produced      under the order during the fall will continue to be pooled.       Texas Milk Marketing Area--Action proposed to suspend      certain provisions of the order from March 1, 1995 through      July 31, 1995. Requested by a cooperative association      representing a substantial number of the 2,400 producers      covered by the order. Failure to suspend the provisions could      result in uneconomical and inefficient movements of milk.       Other actions that would affect all dairy milk marketing      orders, and must be approved by a majority of the affected      producers:       Class II Milk Pricing: This decision changes the Class II      pricing formula for soft dairy products (yogurt, cottage      cheese, etc.) under Federal orders, and will mean more income      for dairy farmers.       M-W Price Series: Decision to replace current outdated      pricing series, will improve the accuracy of milk payments to      dairy farmers in reflecting actual market conditions.  Fruits and Vegetables--Marketing Orders--Actions since November 1994       Over 75,000 fruit and vegetable producers, farming an      average of 54 acres, participate in 38 federal marketing      orders that generate an average of $70,000 in gross sales to      producers. Marketing orders are self-help programs that      enable producers to develop marketing strategies to compete      in a market where buyers have a much greater natural market      advantage. Buyers tend to have a greater market advantage not      just because there are fewer buyers than sellers, but because      the products are highly perishable--producers have limited      ability to use time to their advantage and hold commodities      off the market until more favorable terms appear.       Federal marketing orders are initiated by producers; if a      majority believes that the order no longer serves their      interests, they are free to terminate the program. Moreover,      in the case of any changes that would be considered      substantive, the affected producers must vote to approve      those changes. Fruit and vegetable marketing orders are truly      in the hands of the producers, not a federal agency.       Actions initiated by industry, since November 1994, cover      more than 63,000 fruit and vegetable producers operating      under some 22 marketing orders. Actions since November      include announcements of seasonal marketing strategies to      improve or maintain returns, in the face of unexpected large      crops, or measurable changes in crop quality, announcements      of budgets, expenses, and assessments, for committees to      administer the marketing orders locally.       Domestic Peanuts (covering 25,000 growers, with average      sales of $36,000 per grower)--Actions taken to update      marketing agreement provisions for the recent marketing      season, and to assess non-signatory peanut handlers, which is      mandated by law.       Far West Spearmint Oil (256 producers, with average annual      sales of $100,000)--Action to announce salable quantities and      allotment shares for ``Class 1'' and ``Class 3'' spearmint      oil, to avoid extreme fluctuations in supplies and prices and      thus help maintain stability in the Far West spearmint oil      market.       Far West Spearmint Oil--Action to announce salable      quantities and allotment shares for the 1995-96 marketing      season. This rule needs to be effective during the June 1,      1995-May 31, 1996 marketing year. Without it, handlers will      be unable to purchase or handle spearmint oil from the      marketing order area, resulting in immediate farmer income      loss.       Cranberries (1,046 growers in 10 states)--Action to impose      financial responsibility on handlers by setting late payment      charges. Late payments of assessments hinder the ability of      the committee to carry out its financial obligations      responsibility, such as prompt payment for services,      salaries, and other current expenses.       California Almonds (7,000 producers, with average annual      sales of $130,000)--Action to establish marketing strategy      for the 1994/95 crop season, by announcing salable, reserve,      and      export market share recommendations for handler compliance.      Inability to pursue the marketing strategy will lead to      fluctuations in supplies in various markets and attendant      price variability.       Kiwifruit (600 producers, with average annual sales of      $27,000)--Action to change district boundaries, to accurately      reflect distribution of growers in membership on      administrative committee.       California Olives (covering 1,200 producers, with an      average of $47,000 in sales per producer)--Action to      establish and announce a marketing strategy for olive growers      for the 1994-95 season.       California Olives--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally.       California Peaches and Nectarines (1,800 producers, with      average annual sales of $57,000)--Producers voted in a      referendum to terminate this order. This action would carry      out that termination request by industry.       California Raisins (4,500 producers, with average annual      sales of $80,000)--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally.       California Table Grapes--Action to pursue marketing      strategy, by relaxing minimum quality requirements currently      in effect for table grapes grown in southeastern California,      and imported table grapes, to increase the marketing of      grapes that would not otherwise meet the grade requirement.      This action conforms to industry practice of allowing the      marketing of good quality, but smaller bunches, of grapes.      Rescinding or preventing the action would result in loss of      income to some producers and handlers for these smaller size      grapes.       California Walnuts (5,000 producers, with average annual      sales of $73,000)--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally.       [[Page H2135]] Colorado Irish potatoes (390 producers)--     Action to announce expenses for administrative committee to      run marketing order locally.       Colorado Irish Potatoes--Action to realign the      representation of the administrative committee to more      accurately represent the distribution of growers in the      industry.       Florida Avocados (200 producers, with average annual sales      of $18,000)--Action to increase expenses to provide funding      for a research project to improve marketability of Florida      avocados; without funding, the research project will be      terminated.       Florida Celery--Action to notify the industry that the      marketing order will be suspended after 60 days notification      to Congress. The industry wants the order suspended at this      time. Nullification of the Final Rule would delay suspension.       Florida Citrus (11,965 growers, with average sales of      $22,546 each)--Marketing strategy based on a larger citrus      crop, to raise minimum quality grade characteristics, to      improve consumer appeal and keep producer returns from      declining with excess supplies.       Florida Citrus--Action by the Florida citrus industry      requesting that quality standards for grapefruit, oranges,      tangelos, and tangerines be revised to more clearly reflect      current cultural and marketing practices.       Florida and Imported Citrus--Action to relax the minimum      size requirement for red seedless grapefruit, to expand the      length of marketing season for Florida handlers and importers      of red seedless grapefruit to permit them to continue to ship      for the entire 1994-95 season.       Florida Limes (150 producers, with average sales of      $39,000) and Avocados--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally.       Florida Tomatoes (250 producers)--Action to clarify      ambiguities in certain rules and regulations of the marketing      order, to improve compliance.       Florida Tomatoes--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally.       Florida Tomatoes--Action to assure that producer      representation on the committee more closely reflects the      distribution of growers in the industry.       Idaho Potatoes (1,846 producers, with average annual sales      of $119,000)--This action is the second of a four-step formal      rulemaking process to amend existing marketing order      provisions to more appropriately reflect marketing conditions      and strategies needed for Idaho potato growers.       Oregon and Washington filberts and hazelnuts (851      producers, with average annual sales of $28,000)--Action to      establish a marketing strategy for the 1994-95 season, by      setting recommended shares for domestic, export and other      outlets. The percentages stabilize the supply of domestic      inshell filberts/hazelnuts in order to meet the limited      domestic demand and provide a reasonable return to producers.       Texas Grapefruit (1,000 producers, with average annual      sales of $15,607)--Marketing strategy to raise quality and      relax size requirements for the 1994-95 marketing season.       Texas Citrus--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally;      otherwise, marketing order cannot continue.       Texas Citrus--Action to revise container and container pack      requirements, to facilitate marketing and business      operations.       Texas Melons--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally;      otherwise, marketing order cannot continue.       South Texas Melons--Action to increase expenses for the      Administrative Committee to fund an additional research      project. Without these funds, the research project would have      to be terminated.       Texas Onions--Action to announce expenses for      administrative committee to run marketing order locally;      otherwise, marketing order cannot continue, and the committee      will be unable to implement needed compliance activities and      a planned market development program.       Walla Walla (Washington) Sweet Onions--Action is the second      of a four-step formal rulemaking process to establish a new      marketing order for Walla Walla onions in Washington, as      requested by growers.       Research and Promotion Programs--Under a moratorium, sheep      producers will not be able to implement the promotion program      authorized by Congress to help promote sheep, wool, and lamb      products.       An important upcoming issue is the opportunity for the      Nation's sheep ranchers to promote and strategically market      sheep products through this self-help mechanism. Producers in      California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, New      Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,      Vermont, and Wyoming recently received authorizing      legislation to initiate this program through self-     assessments. USDA must publish rules in order to implement      the program. Producers collectively will vote on whether to      assess themselves and importers, to use the funds collected      to conduct research and promotion activities.       With a moratorium, sheep and wool producers will be unable      to collectively come together, across a dozen states, to      develop marketing strategies to expand markets for their      products. In the meanwhile, foreign producers will be      strategically targeting U.S. consumers as a growing niche      market, and promoting their foreign-origin lamb at the      expense of domestic producers.       Other R&P issues expected to surface in coming months      include:       Soybeans--The Department is required to conduct a producer      poll in a timely manner to determine if a refund referendum      should be held. That poll is tentatively set for early      summer, and procedures for its conduct must be finalized so      that producers can receive adequate notice.       Watermelons--The industry will be unable to revise its      program, for which it has already received authority to      eliminate refunds and revise assessments.           industry-financed research and promotion programs       Various industry groups have petitioned for and received      authorization to collectively assess themselves and use the      funds to conduct research and fund promotional activities for      their commodities. All of the 16 active R&P programs are      totally self-supported. No taxpayer dollars are used. The      cost of the Washington staff is reimbursed by the industries.      As with other self-help marketing order and agreement      programs, R&Ps are initiated by producers, and can be      terminated by producers when the programs are no longer      considered to be effective. The following actions have been      initiated by industries since November:       Egg Research and Promotion Act--Producer Vote to Increase      the Assessment Rate: The American Egg Board (AEB) would be      unable to collect the 10 cents per 30-dozen case assessment      beginning February 1, 1995, and the assessment would revert      to 5 cents. AEB would have to develop a new budget and submit      it to the Department for approval. Projects as outlined in      AEB's 1995 budget are already in progress and would have to      be scrapped. The 10 cent assessment was approved by the      producers in a referendum held September-October 1994, and      the increase was heavily publicized.       Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and      Information Order: This rule implemented the program.      Termination of the program would result in a substantial      widespread revenue loss to producers and shippers.       Honey Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order:      Interim Final Rule was published May 2, 1994. This action      clarifies and corrects the Order and rules and regulations      which were amended in August 1991.       Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Order:      This Final Rule implemented the changes to the Order which      reflect amendments made by Congress in December 1993 to the      authorizing legislation. Before the 1993 amendments the      program was inactive. A moratorium would nullify this      industry program.       Pork Research and Promotion; Increase in Assessment Rate:      The increase in the overall assessment rate is needed to      provide additional funding to enable the pork industry to      better assist the movement of record supplies of pork to      consumers at improved producer price levels. A portion of all      funds collected are redistributed to states to facilitate      state promotional activities for pork.       Potato Research and Promotion--Change in Size of      Administrative Committee: This Final Rule adopts without      change an Interim Final Rule published September 26, 1994.      Not implementing this rule would prevent the committee from      selecting members on a representative basis. The Final Rule      does not change the Interim Final Rule which would remain the      active regulation.                   industry financed grading programs       Under a moratorium, cotton growers will pay $3-4 million in      higher grading fees that are not necessary, if USDA is      prevented from reducing the fees through the regulatory      process.       USDA can reduce the fees charges to the Nation's cotton      producers, saving them millions of dollars. Each year, based      on expected crop size, USDA determines by formula the fee      needed to cover cotton quality grading services (classing).      The past season's cotton crop was record large, and since      fees are partly determined by expected volumes, the large      crop generated more revenue than needed. This year, USDA can      reduce the fee charged to producers, and save U.S. cotton      growers $3-4 million. In turn, such savings reduce costs to      growers, which are passed on to consumers, both domestic and      foreign. U.S. cotton exports are a fast-growing market, and      U.S. cotton has become one of the most competitive fibers      worldwide.       Any opportunities to keep costs low, while maintaining the      availability of quality assurance for growers that is      recognized as the universal standard of quality, would be      lost with a moratorium. Cotton producers in California,      Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Arizona, Tennessee,      Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri would pay more than needed for      a service they value.     industry-financed quality grading and grade standards programs       Quality grade standards, and the grading services provided      by AMS, are wholly voluntary programs, financed through fees      paid by industry for services on demand. These customers are      the ``cash and carry'' customers who must be satisfied with      AMS service, and believe in the value of the grading service,      because they are under no obligation whatsoever to use the      grading service. The application of grade standards      facilitates trade, and the use of contracts in trade, over      long distances where commodities cannot be inspected      visually. Grading also increases buyer confidence, by      providing up front assurances about the quality of the      product before purchase. All of the actions below are      [[Page H2136]]  examples of actions initiated by industry,      and AMS makes sure that there is industry consensus before      the action becomes final:       Beef Grades: Proposal would revise the beef grade standards      to assure that older cattle are not included in the U.S.      Choice and U.S. Select grades, thereby improving the overall      quality of beef in these grades. The action will improve both      the consistency of and consumer satisfaction with beef      grades.       Dairy Grading Standards: Changes in Anhydrous Milkfat and      Butteroil Requirements: Changes were made in the USDA grade      standards for anhydrous milkfat and butteroil, that more      closely aligned U.S. requirements with international      standards. Without the changes, domestic manufacturers of      anhydrous milk and butteroil would not be able to compete on      equal terms in international markets. As a result, Dairy      Export Incentive Program contracts could not be filled, and      the dairy industry could lose $1.3 million in annual sales.       Frozen Bean Standards: Proposal would revise quality      standards for grades of frozen green and frozen wax beans.      The proposed action will improve trade contracts between      processors and buyers and improve the marketing of frozen      green beans.       Onion Standards: A broad spectrum of growers and shippers      of onions requested that the U.S. grade standards be revised      to provide clear, objective interpretation and to bring the      standards into conformity with current harvesting, handling      and marketing practices.       Poulty Grade Standards: These changes update the voluntary      poultry grade standards in response to advancement within the      poultry industry and changes in consumer preferences.       Tobacco Standards: Action requested by the industry to      improve the integrity of American burley tobacco. Industry      has been trying for 2 years to get rule in place and it would      have strong reaction to any more delay.                     agricultural marketing serviceImplications for AMS Programs Should a Regulatory Moratorium Be Imposed                               User fees       The Agricultural Marketing Service administers 50 laws      which translates into an equal number of programs for the      marketing sector of Agriculture. AMS is unique in that 76% of      funding required to provide its services to the agriculture      community is paid by numerous players throughout the      agricultural marketing chain. Should a regulatory moratorium      be imposed, AMS would be unable to promulgate adjustments of      annual fees for the numerous inspection and grading      activities offered by AMS as well as numerous self-help      programs initiated by the various industries. For example:                            Cotton classing       In the area of cotton, AMS classes 98% of the cotton crop.      Annual fees, which are based on the size of the crop, are      announced via Federal Register publication in early spring in      order for AMS to assess a uniform fee to the industry when      the classing season starts up on June 1. Given the size of      the crop this year, AMS will actually be able to consider      adjusting the annual fee downward. Without the ability to      announce a fee that is in compliance with the formula      prescribed in Sec. 3A of the Cotton Statistics and Estimates      Act, the Department could actually be in a situation of      charging a fee higher than is needed to provide the service      to the industry. Although such savings may be a few cents per      bale, that savings translates into the big dollar savings for      America's producers when they are looking at a record crop      which needs classing.                            Marketing orders       Federal marketing orders for milk, fruits, vegetables and      specialty crops are unique programs that are recommended by      industry and approved by the Secretary. Unlike most      regulations, these are requested by the industries that are      being regulated. Growers and producers voluntarily initiate      all marketing orders. A formal rulemaking process, including      a hearing on grower/producer approval by a two-thirds or      larger majority in referendum, is required before any program      may be implemented.       Once operational, industry committees recommend changes in      regulations that will assist the industry in addressing      unique marketing challenges. The perishability of most of the      commodities regulated under these programs makes rapid      responses to changes in crop and market conditions essential.      Under a regulatory moratorium, timely responses to changes in      crop and market conditions will not be possible. Such delays      are not only disconcerting to the industries, but result in      loss of revenue without the necessary objectives being met.       Under the Federal Milk Order Program, it should be noted      that regulatory actions sometimes occur during the course of      the year that will in fact suspend certain provisions of that      particular federal milk marketing order. For example,      regulations are often utilized to suspend the requirements to      pool plant qualification of a milk manufacturing plant      operated by a cooperative. Milk orders utilize the      opportunity to suspend regulations to avoid unnecessary milk      movements. A regulatory moratorium would preclude suspending      such requirements, thereby requiring unnecessary and      uneconomic shipment of milk.                           Organic standards       The Department received authority in the 1990 Farm Bill to      establish an organic standards program. Over the period of      the past five years, the Department has worked closely with      the National Organic Standards Board and all segments of the      organic community in developing standards by which the      organic community can market its products in the mainstream      of American Agriculture. The Department is proceeding to      publish rulemaking that will provide the necessary standards      for implementation of this program. A regulatory moratorium      would further delay this effort to the disadvantage of      organic producers.                  Sheep Research and Promotion Program       The Department expects to promulgate regulations and      implement this new program this year. The Department would be      unable to implement this Act this year in event of the      moratorium.               Watermelon Research and Promotion Program       The watermelon industry under a moratorium would be unable      to revise its program for which it has already received      statutory authority to eliminate refunds and revise its      assessments. The industry is asking for a promulgation of a      final rule by March 1 of this year.                 Soybean Research and Promotion Program       The soybean legislation approved by Congress in the 1990      Farm Bill requires the Department to conduct a producer poll      in a timely manner to determine if a refund referendum should      be held. The poll is tentatively set for early summer.      Procedures for its conduct must be finalized in time to      adequately inform producers. A regulatory moratorium would      obviate the Department's ability to meet the statutory      requirement.                  Pork Research and Promotion Program       The pork industry wishes to increase the rate of assessment      from .35% to .45% of the market value of porcine animals. The      overall assessment increase is needed by the pork industry to      better assist their program efforts for the marketing of      record supplies of pork to consumers at improved price      levels. A regulatory moratorium would preclude this      rulemaking from taking place. issue: strategic marketing of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products                through producer self-help programs (usda)       States Affected: For fruit/veg--mainly Southern and Western      States; for dairy--nearly every State.       Rules: Self-Help Marketing Programs--Operating Rules for      Marketing Strategies, Committee Budgets and Expenses, and      Industry Assessments. For producers in 38 fruit/vegetable      self-help programs, annual rules are needed to determine      seasonal marketing strategies, set budgets and assessments,      and notify industry members. For dairy producers in 37 milk      order regions, periodic rules are used to invoke, suspend, or      amend marketing order provisions to keep orders current with      market conditions, and enable dairy producers to      strategically market milk and dairy products.       Beneficiary: 75,000 small fruit and vegetable producers,      and 92,000 small dairy producers, as well as U.S. consumers      of higher quality, stable supplies of fruits, vegetables,      milk, and dairy products.       Impact of H.R. 450: The average fruit and vegetable      producer who participates in a self-help marketing order      farms just 54 acres, and earns about $70,000 in annual sales,      before expenses. The average dairy producer who participates      in a marketing order has just 75 cows, with a total value of      milk sales before operating expenses, of less than $150,000.       These small businesses have few opportunities to come      together to collectively solve their marketing problems, earn      fair and stable returns for their products, and compete in a      tough global marketplace by promoting quality, wholesome U.S.      products. H.R. 450 will effectively render these programs      useless as a marketing tool.       H.R. 450 would also prevent the initiation of new self-help      programs that have recently been enacted by Congress, to help      producers promote horticultural products, sheep, wool, and      lamb.
