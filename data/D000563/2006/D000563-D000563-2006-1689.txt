In response, unless and until we put this information out to be reviewed in a comprehensive and honest way, I don't believe we can stand before the American people and say this is a good replacement for the courts of America.  Let me tell the Senator what happened. A member of my staff was invited to the Senator's office to view the secret list. He was warned ahead of time not to take any notes, not to make any copies, and not to disclose the nature and substance of the secret list because they were treated as committee confidential. My staffer went to view the list and reported to me the information wasn't very helpful in answering the most basic questions about the companies, their liability, and, of course, the impact on each company and whether they can survive the contributions to the trust fund.  Under the committee confidential rule the chairman has imposed on all staff members reviewing this list, I am not sure I can say much more about this secret list on the floor, but I will say this is a highly unusual process to have secret lists, secret information, and confidentiality, when we are literally talking about people's lives and health. I don't think the Senator can come forward and meet his burden of proof, to go back to the language of trial lawyers, that we should replace the court system in America based on secret lists kept in his office. That strikes me as a far cry from the kind of public debate which we should invite for this bill.
