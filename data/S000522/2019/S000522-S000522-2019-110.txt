Madam Chair, I want to make it absolutely clear, in all the scenarios that the gentleman on the other side just pointed out, the President has the absolute right of self-defense.  As Mr. Khanna made clear in his opening remarks, the right of self-defense--if we were attacked in the waythat Congressman McCaul described, the President has the absolute right to defend the United States.  What this amendment says, basically it is counter to the gentleman's argument. The gentleman's argument basically is that Congress should get out of the way. Under no circumstances should Congress have any say in the use of the United States military.  I think that is wrong. I think we have a role to play. The President should not be allowed to start a war anytime, anywhere, but he can absolutely defend the United States in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.  All this says, that if it isn't a matter of self-defense, if the President has decided, as we decided in Iraq, that we are going to launch a war for preemptive reasons or because of many of the things the gentleman pointed out that Iran does, if we are going to start a war because of that, then we in the United States Congress should uphold our constitutional duty and have the right to vote on it. I think that is appropriate.  Unless Members are in favor of Congress getting totally out of having any say in this, Members need to support this amendment.
