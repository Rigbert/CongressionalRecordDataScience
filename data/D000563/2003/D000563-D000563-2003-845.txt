President, I rise today to introduce the Conserve by Bike Act to promote energy conservation and improve public health. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, in introducing this measure. This legislation addresses one part of our Nation's energy challenges. Although there is no single solution, every possible approach must be considered in order to solve our energy problems.  Our Nation would realize several benefits from the increased use of bicycle transportation, including lessened dependence on foreign oil and prevention of harmful air emissions. Currently, less than one trip in one hundred, .88 percent, is by bicycle. If we can raise our level of cycling to one and a half trips per hundred, which is less than one bike trip every two weeks for the average person, we will save more than 462 million gallons of gasoline in a year, worth more than $721 million. That is the equivalent of one day a year we will not need to import any foreign oil.  In addition to fostering greater independence from foreign oil supplies, this bill will help mitigate air quality challenges, which can be harmful to public health and the environment. Unlike automotive transportation, bicycling is emissions-free.  The Conserve by Bike Act encourages bicycling through two key components: a pilot program and a research project. The Conserve by Bike Pilot Program established by this legislation would be implemented by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Department would fund up to ten pilots throughout the country that would utilize education and marketing tools to encourage people to convert some of their car trips to bike trips. Each of these pilot projects must: 1. document project results and energy conserved; 2. facilitate partnerships among stakeholders in two or more of the following fields: transportation, law enforcement, education, public health, and the environment; 3. maximize current bicycle facility investments; 4. demonstrate methods that can be replicated in other locations; and 5. produce ongoing programs that are sustained by local resources.  This legislation also directs the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a research project on converting car trips to bike trips. The study will consider: 1. what car trips Americans can reasonably be expected to make by bike, given such factors as weather, land use, and traffic patterns, carrying capacity of bicycles, and bicycle infrastructure; 2. what energy savings would result, or how much energy could be conserved, if these trips were converted from car to bike; 3. the cost-benefit analysis of bicycle infrastructure investments; and 4. what factors could encourage more car trips to be replaced with bike trips. The study also will identify lessons we can learn from the documented results of the pilot programs.  The Conserve by Bike Program is a small investment that has the potential to produce significant returns: greater independence from foreign oil and a healthier environment and population. The Conserve by Bike Act authorizes a total of $6.2 million to carry out the pilot programs and research. A total of $5,150,000 will be used to implement the pilot projects; $300,000 will be used by the Department of Transportation to coordinate, publicize, and disseminate the results of the program; and $750,000 will be utilized for the research study.  The provisions in this bill enjoy strong, bipartisan support and passed as an amendment to last year's Senate energy bill. The measure is endorsed by the League of American Bicyclists, which has over 300,000 affiliates, as well as the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals, Rails to Trails Conservancy, Thunderhead Alliance, Bikes Belong Coalition, Adventure Cycling, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, and the League of Illinois Bicyclists.  By enacting the Conserve by Bike Act, we can reduce our energy dependence, reduce harmful air emissions, and improve public health. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Conserve by Bike Act and join me in making a responsible investment in cleaner, healthier and more energy efficient future.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 547       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CONSERVE BY BICYCLING PROGRAM.       (a) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Program.--The term ``program'' means the Conserve by      Bicycling Program established by subsection (b).       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of Transportation.       (b) Establishment.--There is established within the      Department of Transportation a program to be known as the      ``Conserve by Bicycling Program''.       (c) Projects.--       (1) In general.--In carrying out the program, the Secretary      shall establish not more than 10 pilot projects that are--       (A) dispersed geographically throughout the United States;      and       (B) designed to conserve energy resources by encouraging      the use of bicycles in place of motor vehicles.       (2) Requirements.--A pilot project described in paragraph      (1) shall--       (A) use education and marketing to convert motor vehicle      trips to bicycle trips;       (B) document project results and energy savings (in      estimated units of energy conserved);       (C) facilitate partnerships among interested parties in at      least 2 of the fields of--       (i) transportation;       (ii) law enforcement;       (iii) education;       (iv) public health;       (v) environment; and       (vi) energy;       (D) maximize bicycle facility investments;       (E) demonstrate methods that may be used in other regions      of the United States; and       (F) facilitate the continuation of ongoing programs that      are sustained by local resources.       (3) Cost sharing.--At least 20 percent of the cost of each      pilot project described in paragraph (1) shall be provided      from State or local sources.       (d) Energy and Bicycling Research Study.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into a      contract with the National Academy of Sciences for, and the      National Academy of Sciences shall conduct and submit to      Congress a report on, a study on the feasibility of      converting motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips.       (2) Components.--The study shall--       (A) document the results or progress of the pilot projects      under subsection (b);       (B) determine the type and duration of motor vehicle trips      that people in the United States may feasibly make by      bicycle, taking into consideration factors such as--       (i) weather;       (ii) land use and traffic patterns;       (iii) the carrying capacity of bicycles; and       (iv) bicycle infrastructure;       (C) determine any energy savings that would result from the      conversion of motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips;       (D) include a cost-benefit analysis of bicycle      infrastructure investments; and       (E) include a description of any factors that would      encourage more motor vehicle trips to be replaced with      bicycle trips.
