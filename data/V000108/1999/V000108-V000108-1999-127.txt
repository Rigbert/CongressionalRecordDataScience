Speaker, today I introduced the Corporate Responsibility Act of 1999 which will save an estimated $33 billion in corporate welfare over the next five years. This bill eliminates or reforms twelve federal programs that currently use billions of taxpayer dollars to subsidize corporate America. Three years ago, Congress reduced welfare for individuals and families. Now it is time to do the same for corporations.  This legislation is necessary to eliminate the system of tax breaks, subsidies and other policies given to wealthy special interests by the federal government. Time magazine estimates that corporate welfare costs American taxpayer $625 billion every five years. Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs), which give tax breaks to corporations who transport American jobs overseas, alone account for $1.7 billion each year.  My bill, similar to one introduced in the 105th Congress, takes aim at the worst examples of corporate welfare in the federal budget, including FSCs, special tax treatment of alcohol fuels, the Market Access Program, the Export Enhancement Program, and federal funding of forest roads for logging. The bill also includes a lock-box mechanism to ensure that all savings and revenue go directly toward reducing the public debt.  This bill would save more than $33 billion over five years by ending corporate welfare programs and reforming others. Because this legislation is limited to the most egregious examples, my bill is a litmus test for anyone who is serious about ending corporate welfare. In short, this bill puts the best interest of our citizens--a balanced budget, jobs, education, and a clean environment--ahead of handouts to huge corporations and wealthy special interests.  Consequently, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the Corporate Responsibility Act of 1999.                          ____________________
