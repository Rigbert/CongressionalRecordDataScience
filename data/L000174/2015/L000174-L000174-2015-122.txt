President, the United States has long been a safe and welcoming home for those fleeing persecution around the world. The refugees and asylum seekers who join our communities help to create new businesses, build more vibrant neighborhoods, and enrich us all. They are also a reminder of our history as a nation of immigrants and our American values of generosity and compassion. Saturday marks World Refugee Day, and to honor it we must renew our commitment to the ideal of America as a beacon of hope for so many who face human rights abuses abroad.  Millions of refugees remain displaced and warehoused in refugee camps in Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. Ongoing political struggles and military conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa are dislocating large populations. Too many are without their families or safe places to find refuge. Some, though far too few, have been able to flee and rebuild their lives.  Peter Keny, one of the ``Lost Boys'' of South Sudan, is one of those inspiring refugees who escaped a civil war in his home country and has rebuilt his life in my home State of Vermont. He is just one of thousands of refugees Vermonters have welcomed over the years. Peter was 19 when he came to Burlington in 2001, and in the years since he has learned English, completed high school, and is earning a college degree. In describing his voyage to the United States and ultimately to Vermont, Peter told ``The Burlington Free Press'' that arriving here ``was like a dream come true.'' I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article, ``A Found Man Returns to South Sudan.''  I am proud of Vermont's long history of supporting refugees by opening its communities, schools, and homes to those in need. It is not always easy, but it is a powerful example of our belief in the most basic ideals of human dignity and hope, and our commitment to responding to the suffering of others. We are fortunate to have remarkable organizations like the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program leading the effort with its decades of experience and award-winning volunteer program, and the tremendous legal advocacy provided by the Vermont Immigration and Asylum Advocates. The hard work of these and other organizations and the daily welcoming gestures of Vermonters all over the State have made Vermont a role model for the rest of the country.  On this year's World Refugee Day, it is also important to acknowledge that there is more that we as a country can and must do. I remain deeply concerned about the administration's expanded family detention policy. The women and children it is placing in prolonged detention have fled extreme violence and persecution in Central America. They come seeking refuge from three of the most dangerous countries in the world, countries where women and girls face shocking rates of domestic and sexual violence and murder. Here in the United States, we recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, a law we hold out as an example of our commitment to take these crimes seriously and to protect all victims. The ongoing detention of asylum-seeking mothers and children who have made credible claims that they have been victims of these very same crimes is unacceptable. I again urge the administration to end the misguided policy of family detention.  We must also do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Almost 4 million Syrians are officially recognized as refugees by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The vast majority of these are women and children, including hundreds of thousands of children under the age of 5. The United States traditionally accepts at least 50 percent of resettlement cases from UNHCR. However, wehave accepted only approximately 700 refugees since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, an unacceptably low number.  Congress also plays an important role. Soon I will reintroduce the Refugee Protection Act to improve protections for refugees and asylum seekers and provide additional support and improvement to the national resettlement program and groups such as the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program. This bill, which I have long championed with Representative Zoe Lofgren, reaffirms the commitments made in ratifying the 1951 Refugee Convention, and will help to restore the United States to its rightful role as a safe and welcoming home for those suffering from persecution around the world.  As we pause to take stock on World Refugee Day, let each of us reflect on what this great country means to those escaping persecution. Let us now and always live by and burnish the light of Lady Liberty's torch, our eternal beacon of hope to those struggling to breathe free.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, June 7, 2015]                   A Found Man Returns to South Sudan                           (By Zach Despart)       Peter Keny sat on the side of the road in late December as      the sun disappeared behind the acacia trees. He had traveled      more than 7,000 miles from Burlington, only to be stranded      just north of the South Sudanese capital of Juba.       The taxi he hired an hour earlier had broken down, and he      was still 50 miles south of his destination, his native      village of Kalthok. The driver walked back to Juba five hours      earlier and had yet to return.       Keny took another delay in stride, as he had waited to      return home since fleeing his country's civil war 25 years      earlier. That decade-long journey, forged in tragedy and      perseverance, took Keny on a dangerous trek through the      Sudanese bush to a series of refugee camps and, finally, to a      new start in America.       For most of his life, Keny has straddled two worlds. Each      day he reconciles his life of opportunity in the United      States with a longing for his war-torn homeland. For years,      Keny balanced work to put himself through school and to save      for a trip to Kalthok, the village of his brief childhood and      keeper of the only memories of his parents.       Exhausted from two flights and a 12-hour bus ride from      Uganda, Keny tried to imagine what the reunion would be like.      As he peered through darkness toward Kalthok, he wondered if      anyone would remember him.                             A child of war       Keny was born in Kalthok in 1982, the youngest of four      sons. He lived with his mother and father, who like many in      the village were sorghum farmers. The Kenys belonged to the      Dinka tribe, the largest ethnic group in southern Sudan.       In November 1989, farmers had finished the annual harvest      as the wet season came to a close. One afternoon, 6-year-old      Keny and a group of boys played on the banks of the White      Nile north of Kalthok, as they often did when little else      occupied their time. Around five o'clock, the boys heard      gunfire and saw smoke in the village's direction. They rushed      toward home but were intercepted by a villager who told them      returning was unsafe. The boys, some of whom were Keny's      cousins, hid along a riverbank that night. Keny would never      again see his parents.       For most of the past 60 years, Sudan has been engulfed in      civil war. By 1989, the Second Sudanese Civil War already had      raged for six years. When war ended in 2005, 1 million to 2      million people were dead and another 2 million were      displaced. Many of those killed or displaced were from the      Dinka tribe.       As a child Keny knew about the war, but until that day in      1989, fighting had never come to Kalthok.       ``We were all the way to the south of the country, and the      government militia did not have a problem with the local      people,'' Keny recalled in a recent interview in Burlington.      ``There was no tension.''       Unable to return to their village, Keny and his friends      faced a harrowing journey. The morning after the attack on      Kalthok, the boys crossed the river and joined a larger group      of refugees who were walking east, away from the fighting.      They walked each day until their legs could carry them no      farther. Each time the boys stopped to rest, they feared lion      attacks and roaming militias, which abducted children to use      as soldiers. Keny was shoeless and without a change of      clothing. He thought only of how to survive another day.       ``The worry was, `Are you going to make it to the next      town?' '' he recalled. ``You focused on living to the next      day, and that's all. There was nothing else you could do.''       The Sudanese government was able to distribute grain to      fleeing refugees. Keny and others received two cups each,      which they made last as long as they could. Keny had nowhere      to put the grain, so he wrapped it carefully in his shirt.      When the grain ran out, the boys foraged for wild fruit and      berries whenever they stopped to rest.       Keny said he was among an estimated 20,000 ``Lost Boys of      Sudan''--children separated from their parents during the      war. As many as half died of disease and starvation during      the journey to refugee camps.       After traveling several hundred miles over three months,      Keny crossed from Sudan into Ethiopia and settled with others      at Dimma, a refugee camp established by the Ethiopian      government in 1986 to handle an enormous influx of Sudanese      refugees.       Keny remained at Dimma for about a year, until spring 1991,      when rebels overthrew Ethiopia's government in a coup. The      boys fled back across the border and camped near the Sudanese      community of Pakok until 1992, when the United Nations moved      thousands of refugees to the newly opened Kakuma refugee camp      in Kenya. Keny would live there for nine years.       At the Kakuma camp, Keny learned English and went to school      daily. He said U.N. staff members encouraged the boys to      settle into a routine. But he could not stop thinking about      his family. Keny said some of the Lost Boys tried to find      their way back to their villages, but he judged the trip back      to Kalthok too dangerous. Refugees at Kakuma relied on new      arrivals and wounded soldiers seeking care at the U.N.      hospital for news about the war.       ``The hope was that I would see someone from my village, so      I might ask the situation of my family,'' Keny said. ``But no      one ever showed up. It was very difficult for me. I never      knew whether someone was still there or not.''       Keny received a surprise in 1998, when his oldest brother,      Riak, found him at the Kakuma camp. Riak had joined the      Sudanese army and had been granted a one-month leave. The      brothers had not seen each other in nine years.       ``It was one of the best days of my life, after going all      that time without seeing my family,'' Keny said.       But the reunion was bittersweet. Riak brought news Keny had      long feared: Their parents and brother were killed in the      war, and remaining brother had died of disease. Keny was      devastated, but relieved finally to know the fate of his      family. Riak tried to lift his spirits.       ``He was like, `Look, this is what it is. Someone has to      die for someone to live. If we all had to die, and you lived,      that's the best we can do,' '' Keny recalled his brother      saying.       Riak and Peter spent several weeks together, until the      soldier's leave expired and he returned to war. Keny never      again saw his brother. Riak died in 2006 after he succumbed      to injuries received years earlier.                         A new life in America       In 2001, when he was 19, Keny moved to the U.S. through the      federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. He had several cities      to choose among, but he picked Burlington because his cousin      Abraham Awolich already had settled there. Five others from      the Kakuma camp came with him.       For the first time in his life, Keny thought about his      future.       ``It was like a dream that had come true,'' he said. ``I      felt like this is the moment, if I don't have my parents,      maybe in the future I'll be able to meet my extended family.      Maybe I would be able to do something that my family would      remember me.''       In the U.S., Keny became proficient in English, earned a      high school degree and dreamed of attending college.       Now 32, Keny lives in a small apartment on Front Street in      Burlington with three other Lost Boys who immigrated to the      U.S. He works as a janitor for the University of Vermont,      where he cleans the athletic complex from 10 p.m. to 6:30      a.m., five days a week. When school is in session, he attends      classes during the day, where he is a decade older than his      peers. In the next year and a half, he hopes to complete a      degree in community development and applied economics.       Keny is able to cram in only a few hours of sleep before      walking uphill to class, but he said he must work to afford      tuition if he ever hopes to find a better-paying job.       ``It's about being willing,'' he said, sitting on the front      porch of his home. ``If I don't do it, I will be stuck here.      I just tell myself I have to do it. Otherwise I don't have      options.''       Ever since moving to the U.S., Keny always hoped return to      visit Kalthok. He was able to contact several uncles by      telephone in 2002 and remained in touch with relatives      regularly. He secured a travel visa in 2006 but was unable to      use it, because a trip would have interrupted his studies at      community college.       ``The biggest fact was that I was struggling with my      education,'' Keny said. ``Every time I'd say, `If I go home      while I'm trying to complete this process, I might fall      behind.' ''       While studying, Keny kept abreast of news back home.       In 2005, civil war ended with a peace agreement that many      Sudanese hoped finally would put an end to violence that had      torn apart the country for half a century. In 2011, southern      Sudanese voted overwhelmingly to break off from the north to      form a new nation, South Sudan. The fragile peace collapsed      two years later, when South Sudan plunged into civil war.      Keny said Kalthok has so far been spared heavy violence, but      the community is inundated with refugees again fleeing to the      east.       Finally, in 2014, Keny acquired a new visa and was able to      raise enough money for the costly trip, which required a      stopover in Europe.                         Return to South Sudan       Even after dusk in December, the air was still humid.      Keny's driver returned around 7 p.m. with tools, but couldn't      fix the car. Keny planned to spend the night on the side of      the road and at dawn walk back to Juba. He lay down in the      brush, careful not to wrinkle the dress shirt and slacks he      had put on for the reunion.       Keny was comforted that he at least had company: Some of      his cousins, who met him at the bus station in Juba, agreed      to wait until another ride could be arranged.       Around midnight, Keny's fortunes turned. A Somali trader      came upon him and agreed to drive him to Kalthok. As he      braced himself for potholes that shook the vehicle, Keny      tried to piece together fragmented memories of his youth.       ``Will I remember anyone in the village? Will I remember      the places I used to know? Is life still the same as when I      left? All those questions were on my mind,'' Keny said.       Although the trip was only 55 miles, the roads were in such      poor condition that Keny arrived in Kalthok at 5 a.m. It was      Christmas morning. He was exhausted and hoped to find      somewhere to sleep, but he found the entire village had      stayed up waiting for him in the church.       ``They were singing and dancing and praying for us, because      they heard we had car trouble,'' Keny said.       At 8 a.m., Kalthok's villagers held a welcome ceremony.      Keny said he recognized only a few faces, his maternal and      paternal uncles. But all the village elders remembered him.       ``They said, `You look just like you did when you left,' ''      he recalled. ``There was a lot of emotional reaction. They      talked about my family, my mom and my dad.''       Keny stood at the front of the sanctuary to greet the      hundreds of villagers who came to see him. After daybreak      they took him around Kalthok, but Keny couldn't pick out any      landmarks.       He asked his cousins to take him to a lake with a waterfall      he remembered from childhood. From there he looked back      toward the village, and memories came back to him. He was      able to point out his uncles' houses.       ``They said, `Yes, you now know. You recognize this place,'      '' Keny said.       Instead of having Keny stay in one of his uncles' homes,      villagers arranged for him to sleep in the church. Each      evening for the three weeks he was in Kalthok, villagers set      up tents and slept outside the church to be closer to their      returned son. Keny said many were surprised he came back      after settling into a prosperous life in the U.S.       ``They thought I would never go back, because I don't have      a living parent anymore,'' Keny said. ``But they still      believe I belong to the village.''       Keny had another reason to return to Kalthok, beside      visiting relatives. He wanted to ensure success of the local      clinic the Sudan Development Foundation, a Burlington      nonprofit, helped fund. The clinic is vital to Kalthok, Keny      said. In South Sudan, some villages are more than 100 miles      from a hospital. South Sudan's infrastructure is so poor this      can mean several days of traveling on foot.       Keny returned to Vermont in mid-January. He said leaving      his uncles and cousins was difficult, but his visa expired      after 30 days.                         Straddling two worlds       The son of Kalthok said he is unsure if he will ever move      back to South Sudan. Keny wants to help Kalthok and keep the      clinic operational. He worries war will come again to the      village.       ``I see myself living in two worlds, here and South      Sudan,'' he said. ``I want to help my people in any form they      need. If I ever get married, maybe I would bring my wife      over.''       Keny talks to his uncles regularly. A consequence of war,      inflation has made staple goods too expensive for many      villagers. A drought has raised the prospect of crop failure.       ``This month they are supposed to cultivate, but there is      no rain,'' he said, referring to May.       Keny wants to help his countrymen and -women in Vermont.      More than 150 Sudanese have resettled in Burlington since the      late 1990s, and many have started families here. Keny said      the small community rents out local halls and churches to      meet and celebrate holidays such as South Sudan's      Independence Day.       Keny hopes to help lease or purchase a permanent home to      aid local Sudanese in preserving their culture. He said      parents are concerned children will forget tribal languages      when they speak English outside the home.       Keny reflects on what his life would have been like if he      never had the opportunity to immigrate to the United States.      If he stayed in South Sudan, Keny believes he likely would      have been killed in the war or conscripted into the army. He      said he feels blessed to have been given the chance to start      a new life here, because so many Sudanese never had that      option.       ``It gave me the chance to look at the world differently,''      he said. ``I have people who support me, and even though I do      not yet have a college degree, I feel I've learned enough to      help myself and help my people.''       Keny often thinks of his brothers and parents. In their      memory, he wants to make the most of opportunities he now      has.       ``You have this feeling that for the rest of your life,      you're going to be living knowing that you don't have someone      you'd be taking care of,'' he said. ``I just want to make      sure I live a better life, and live it in a peaceful way.''                          ____________________
