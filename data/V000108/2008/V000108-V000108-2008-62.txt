I have known the Honorable Richard Hatcher for many years, and he is one of the most influential citizens I have ever known, especially when it comes to the progress he made for residents of northwest Indiana and the entire United States. Forty years ago, Richard was elected mayor of Gary, Indiana, and in doing so, he, along with the late Carl Stokes of Cleveland, Ohio, became the first African American individuals elected to serve as mayors of major metropolitan areas. Since this time, Richard has been a constant fixture in not only Gary, but throughout northwest Indiana. Today, as we celebrate this significant event in our Nation's history, we reflect on the magnitude of his election and the progress that has been achieved since that time. In Mayor Hatcher's honor, as well as in honor of Carl Stokes, a celebration will be taking place on Saturday, February 23, 2008, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana.  Richard Gordon Hatcher was born on July 10, 1933, in Michigan City, Indiana. Following his graduation from high school, Richard went on to complete his bachelor of science degree in business and government at Indiana University. Subsequently, he also earned his bachelor of law and juris doctorate degrees from Valparaiso University. After completing law school, Richard relocated to Gary and began practicing law in East Chicago, Indiana. This was the beginning of his remarkable legal career, which included service as a deputy prosecutor for Lake County, Indiana. From there, his political career began when he was elected to the Gary City Council. Then, in 1967, he was elected mayor of Gary, the office he would hold for an astonishing 20 years.  Throughout his political career, Richard was always involved with various commissions and councils, including: the United States Conference of Mayors, for which he served as a member of the executive board and as vice president and president of the conference, the National League of Cities, the National Conference of Black Mayors, for which he was elected its first president, the National Urban Coalition, and the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, for which he served 4 years as president. He also received Presidential appointments to serve on two commissions: the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and the United States Commission on Education. Richard has also had a great impact on American society through his involvement with several civil rights organizations, both locally and nationally, including: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League of Northwest Indiana, TransAfrica, the National Civil Rights Hall of Fame, the Martin Luther King Center for Non-Violent Social Change, and the Operation PUSH/Rainbow Coalition.  Throughout his illustrious career, Richard has been honored time and time again for his dedication and steadfast efforts in improving the quality of life for all people. To name a few of his accolades, Richard was honored in 1974, by Time magazine as one of the ``200 Outstanding Young Leaders in the United States,'' as well as one of the ``100 Most Influential Black Americans'' by Ebony magazine. He was also awarded the ``President's Award'' by the National League of Cities in 1987, the ``Adam Clayton Powell Award'' by the Congressional Black Caucus in 1977, the Operation PUSH ``Award of Excellence'' in 1980, and the Roy Wilkens Award from the NAACP in 1989. In addition, he has been honored with the ``Urban Leadership Award'' by the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, the ``Distinguished Mayor Award'' by the National Urban Coalition, and the ``Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom Award'' from the National Conference of Black Mayors.  Madam Speaker, through his election as mayor of Gary in 1967, Richard Hatcher has been a cornerstone in the building of a better America. He has continued his efforts toward progress through the many ways he has selflessly given his time and efforts to the people of Gary, northwest Indiana, and beyond. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him, as well as the late Carl Stokes, on their 40th anniversary of this significant event in our Nation's history, as well as for his lifetime of service and dedication to his community.                           SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate on February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place, and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled, and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur.  As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.  Meetings scheduled for Thursday, February 14, 2008 may be found in the Daily Digest of today's Record.
