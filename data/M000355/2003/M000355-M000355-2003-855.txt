 President, as the Senator from Nevada has indicated, it is our hope that we can finish the Energy bill in the next couple of weeks. We intend to pursue that as vigorously as possible. The cooperation of all Members toward that end would be greatly appreciated.  The assistant Democratic leader is correct; it would be wonderful to have amendments laid down and debated. We are open for business.                          ____________________
