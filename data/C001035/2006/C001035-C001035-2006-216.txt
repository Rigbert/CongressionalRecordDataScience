President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes action on the bill on Wednesday, the time until 12:15 be equally divided in the usual form and that at 12:15 the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Reid amendment No. 4936, with no second degrees in order prior to the vote.  Before the Chair rules, we anticipate a budget point of order against this amendment, and therefore this vote is likely to be on the motion to waive.
