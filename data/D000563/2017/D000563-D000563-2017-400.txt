    He wasn't there again today.     I wish that man would go away.  I thought about that poem when I listened to the majority leader's speech about how cooperative he has been when it comes to Supreme Court nominations. The name he forgot to mention was Merrick Garland--Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy of Justice Antonin Scalia; Merrick Garland, the only Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in the history of the U.S. Senate to be denied a hearing and a vote; Merrick Garland, about whom Senator McConnell said: I will not only refuse to give him a hearing and a vote, I refuse to even see him; Merrick Garland, who was found unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association; Merrick Garland, the person who received bipartisan support for appointment to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land.  So when the majority leader comes to the floor to talk about how cooperative he has been with previous Presidents when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, he conveniently omits the most obvious reason for our problems this week: the unilateral decision by the majority leader to preclude any vote on Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia.  I know Judge Garland. I have met with him several times. He is a balanced, moderate, experienced jurist who should be on the U.S. Supreme Court. We should not be entertaining Neil Gorsuch this week; we ought to be celebrating the first anniversary of Merrick Garland's service on the U.S. Supreme Court. The reason we are not is that Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans refused us that opportunity. They said: No, you cannot vote on that.  Remember their logic? The logic was: Wait a minute. This is the last year of President Obama's Presidency. Why should he be able to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court when we have an election coming soon?  That is an interesting argument. There are two things I am troubled with.  I do believe President Obama was elected for 4 years in his second term, not for 3, which meant he had authority in the fourth year, as he did in the third year.  Secondly, the Republican argument ignores history. It ignores the obvious history when we had a situation with President Ronald Reagan, in his last year in office, with regard to a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. There were Democrats in charge of the Senate and Democrats in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and President Ronald Reagan, a lameduck President in his last year, nominated Anthony Kennedy to serve on the Court. He sent the name to the Democratic Senate, and there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vote that sent him to the Court.  You never hear that story from Senator McConnell. It is because it does not fit into his playbook as to why he would wait for a year and refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. The reasoning is obvious: Clearly he was banking on the possibility that the electorate would choose a Republican President--and that is what happened--so that a Republican President--in this case, Donald Trump--could fill the vacancy, not Barack Obama.  So when I hear the speeches on the floor by Senator McConnell about his bipartisan cooperation, he leaves out an important chapter--the last chapter, the one that brought us to this moment in the Senate.  I look at the situation before us today, and it is a sad situation for the Senate--sad in that we have reached the point in which a Supreme Court nomination has become so political, more so than at any time in history.  Where did the name ``Neil Gorsuch'' come from for the Supreme Court? It came from a list that was prepared by two organizations: the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. These are both Republican advocacy groups who represent special interests and are funded by special interests. They came up with the names and gave them to Presidential candidate Donald Trump. It was a list of 21 names. He issued them twice--in March and in September of the last campaign year--and Neil Gorsuch's name was on the list.  The Federalist Society was created in 1982. Nominally, it is an organization that is committed to originalism.In other words, it looks to the clear meaning of the Constitution, what the Founding Fathers meant. They say that over and over again: Just look to the Constitution and read it, and then we will know what we should do. That was in a speech that was given by Edwin Meese, the then-Attorney General in 1985, who explained the Federalist Society's credo.  On its face, it sounds at least arguably defensible that there would be an organization that is so committed to the Constitution that it wants Supreme Court nominees who will follow it as literally as possible. Yet, as Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court said, if they think they can find in those musty volumes from back in the 18th century all of the answers to all of the questions on the issues we face today--here is what he called it--that is arrogance posing as humility.  Yet that is what they said the Federalist Society was all about. If that were all the Federalist Society were about, then I guess one could argue that they ought to have their day in court, their day in choosing someone for the Supreme Court, but it is more than that. When you look at those who finance the Federalist Society--and it is a short list because they refuse to disclose all their donors--you see the classic names of Republican support: the Koch brothers, the Mercer family, the Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, the ones who pop up over and over again. Why would these organizations be so determined to pick the next nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court? It is because there is so much at stake.  In a Judiciary Committee hearing, my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse went through the box score when it came to the Supreme Court and how they ruled when given a choice between special interests and corporate elites versus average workers and consumers and families. As Senator Whitehouse pointed out graphically, in detail, overwhelmingly, this Court has ruled for the special interests. Sixty-nine percent of the Roberts' Court's rulings are in favor of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's position on issues, according to one study.  Why would a special interest organization like the Federalist Society care? It wants to keep a good thing going, from its point of view. That is why this is a different Supreme Court nominee.
