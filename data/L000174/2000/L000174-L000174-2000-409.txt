President, I do not like the marriage penalty. I think it is poor public policy. However, I am forced to vote against cloture today because the majority has refused to allow the minority to offer amendments to improve this seriously flawed legislation.  The majority has presented us with a bill that not only fails to completely remedy the marriage penalty, but also provides large tax cuts to individuals and married couples who currently experience a marriage bonus. Less than 40% of the benefits of this bill would actually go to couples earning under $100,000. This is not a marriage penalty bill; this is a fiscally irresponsible tax cut bill for the wealthy. Hard working married couples in Vermont deserve an honest, targeted measure to eliminate the marriage penalty, not the proposal that is before us today.  I had looked forward to debating amendments to strengthen this bill and I am disappointed that the majority is cutting off the debate with a motion to invoke cloture. The integrity of the Senate is threatened when the majority refuses to permit the minority to debate amendments. The Senate should be the conscience of the nation because of the distinguishing feature of this body for any Senator to offer amendments and thoroughly debate the merits of legislation.  I support an end to the marriage penalty. I will continue to work with other Senators to pass legislation that is targeted at eliminating all of the marriage penalties that are embedded in our tax code. Vermonters deserve nothing less.
