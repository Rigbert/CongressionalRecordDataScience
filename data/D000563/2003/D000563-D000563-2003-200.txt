President, I recognize and honor the Federation of Independent Illinois Colleges and Universities as it celebrates its 100th anniversary.  Founded in Chicago, the oldest private college association in the Nation has evolved from a social organization for college presidents to a dynamic advocacy organization representing 55 Illinois private colleges and universities, enrolling over 160,000 students and employing over 60,000 professional and support staff.  Headquartered in Springfield, IL, the mission of the Federation is to safeguard the interests of the member institutions and their students and to promote standards for excellence in higher education. The Federation will formally celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on November 11, 2003.  Under the leadership of Chairman Curtis L. McCray and President Donald E. Fouts, the Federation has taken a leading role in working to address higher education issues throughout Illinois.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Federation of Independent Illinois Colleges and Universities on their 100th anniversary. It is my hope and expectation that in the next 100 years the Federation will continue to create and expand college opportunities for students from Illinois and across the country.                          ____________________
