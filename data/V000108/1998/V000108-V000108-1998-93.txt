Speaker, I am pleased to commend the Order of American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (Ahepa), Chapter Number 78, who in conjunction with the Daughters of Penelope, Mentor Chapter Number 81, will be hosting the 68th Hoosier District Number 12 Annual Convention in Merrillville, Indiana this weekend, June 19-21, 1998. On Saturday, June 20, as part of the convention's festivities, the following six outstanding members of the Order of Ahepa, and the Northwest Indiana community will be receiving their prestigious Fifty Year Member Pins: Mr. Spiro Cappony, of Griffith; Mr. James Kallimani, of Gary; Mr. Deno Manolopoulos, of Valparaiso; Mr. Nick Pangere, of Merrillville; Mr. John Trakas, of Crown Point; and Mr. Tony Zerites, of Crown Point.  Each of these six men has dedicated fifty years of service to all facets of the Order of Ahepa, his community, and the noteworthy humanitarian charities and activities to which the Order or Ahepa donates effort, time, and money. These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with approximately fifty-seven additional Chapter 78 members who have already attained Fifty Year Member status.  The Order of Ahepa is an international fraternal order with chapters in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Bahama Islands. It was founded in 1922 in Atlanta, Georgia, to help immigrants from Europe, especially Greece, assimilate into the American way of life. It taught the new arrivals the customs and language, and helped them to become good, productive citizens in their new, adopted country. Today, the Order of Ahepa is still concerned with aiding immigrants, as well as monitoring the current events in Greece, becoming involved with the region's community, and supporting the aging members of the Northwest Indiana Greek community. Nationally, the Order of Ahepa works with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to build and maintain senior citizen apartments. Chapter 78 of the Order of Ahepa, based in Merrillville, is quite proud of the three 50-unit buildings that it maintains in conjunction with HUD and the Town Board of Merrillville. Indeed, I commend the Order of Ahepa for providing a safe, clean living environment for area seniors.  Besides the outstanding senior housing program, Chapter 78 of the Order of Ahepa supports many other charitable organizations, including food pantries at the St. Constantine Cathedral in Merrillville and another one in Hobart, and St. Basil's Academy in Boston, Massachusetts. Besides helping other charitable organizations, the local Order of Ahepa Chapter directly helps such groups as Hearing Impaired Children in the Catholic Diocese of Gary; the Merrillville and Hobart Police Departments; the Hobart Fire Department's school fire safety awareness programs; the Greek Orthodox Cathedral; Our Lady of Perpetual Help's Ministry to the Physically and Mentally Challenged; and Holy Cross College in Boston.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me saluting Spiro Cappony, James Kallimani, Deno Manolopoulos, Nick Pangere, John Trakas, and Tony Zerites, of the Chapter 78 Order of Ahepa, for their distinguished service, dedication, and leadership. Through their hard work and commitment, they have furthered the goals of the Order of Ahepa in bringing together the members of the Greek community for the betterment of everyone in Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
