 President, today, along with Senators Conrad and Grams of Minnesota, I am introducing a bill to exempt certain farm rental income from the self-employment tax.  The self-employment tax has been applied equally to farmers and other business people for the last 40 years. Our bill would ensure equality in the future. It states that farm landlords should be treated the same as small business people and other commercial landlords, and they should not have to pay self-employment tax on cash rent income.  The current law is drafted to ensure that self-employment tax applies to income from labor or employment. Farm landlords were only taxed when they participated in the operation of the farm. Income from cash rent represents the value of ownership or equity in land, not labor or employment. Therefore, the self-employment tax should not apply to income from cash rent. Yet, this is not they way that the Internal Revenue Service drafted its technical advice memorandum on this matter. This has resulted in farmers and retired farmers now paying a 15.3 percent self-employment tax on cash rent.  The IRS has gone too far. The law should be what people have counted on for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, history should be respected. The test of time will prove that the taxpayer was right and that the IRS was wrong, particularly now that there is a difference between the farm and city sector. Therefore, we are introducing this bill so that farmers and retired farmers will not be singled out unfairly by the IRS.  Specifically, this legislation would remove the code's ambiguity and recapture its original intent. The legislation would clarify that when the IRS is applying the self-employment tax to cash rent farm leases, it would limit its applicability to the lease agreement. This is not an expansion of the law of taxpayers. Rather, it would limit the anti taxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax law does not require cash rent landlords in cities to pay the self-employment tax. Indeed cash rent farm landlords are the only ones required to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-year-old exception that allowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's to become vested in the Social Security system.  The law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only when their lease agreements with the renters required them to participate in the operation of the farm and in the farming of the land.  Forty years later, the IRS has expanded the application of self-employment tax for farmland owners. The tax court told the IRS that in one particular instant they could look beyond the lease agreement. On this very limited authority, the IRS has expanded one tax court case into national tax policy.  Our legislation will bring fairness between farmer landlords and urban landlords. It will clarify that the IRS should examine only the lease agreement. It would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. It would preserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental agreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and commercial properties. The 1957 tax law was designed to benefit retired farmers of that generation so they would qualify for Social Security.  Congress does not intend that farm owners be treated differently from other real estate owners, other than they have been historically. We need clarity provided in our legislation in order to turn back an improper, unilateral, and targeted IRS expansion of settled tax law.  I urge my colleagues to join us in addressing this unfair position taken by the Internal Revenue Service.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 569       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1, SHORT TITLE.
