  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator. I first would like to commend my friend and colleague from Alabama for the fine leadership he has shown in crafting the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations bill. He has done a wonderful job in allocating scarce federal resources equitably for New York and the entire nation for highway, transit, rail and other infrastructure needs.  I ask my colleague if he is familiar with an intermodal transportation simulation and technology project on Long Island called the Center for Advanced Simulation and Technology (CAST)?
