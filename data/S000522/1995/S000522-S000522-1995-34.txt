Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2070 as introduced by our colleague, Mr. Moran. This legislation authorizes the distribution within the United States of a specific film, ``The Fragile Ring of Life'' produced by the U.S. Information Agency.  This legislation is necessary because section 501 of the Smith Mundt Act of 1948 prevents the release within the United States of products commissioned by the U.S. Information Agency for 12 years.  The intent of the Smith Mundt Act is to prevent the executive branch from using the U.S. Information Agency as a political tool within the United States. While this is a reasonable objective, over the years Congress has approved the early release of several films and videotape programs through legislative action. The decision to waive the Smith Mundt Act restriction on domestic dissemination is usually based on finding the material offers worthwhile educational or cultural information of interest or value to American citizens.  The ``Fragile Ring of Life'' does meet these standards. The film discusses programs operating around the world that are focused on protecting sea life and coral reefs. In addition, it provides a useful summary of various efforts to establish environmentally sound practices within countries that rely upon the sea for food, commerce, or tourism.  I urge support for H.R. 2070 so that this film may be made available to domestic viewers.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
