 Davis for his many years of dedicated and outstanding service to CBO, the Congress, and the American people. We wish him all the best.  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Mr. Davis--and really all of the hard-working employees at the Congressional Budget Office--for his and their service.                          ____________________
