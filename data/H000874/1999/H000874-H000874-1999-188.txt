Speaker, I want to say to the gentleman from Texas that I think he raises the question that is a good question; and it should be raised, should be looked at.  It will not come as a surprise to him that we do not agree on all the aspects of what he has said, but he certainly raises an issue that ought to be focused on. I know in talking to the gentleman from Arizona (Chairman Kolbe) that he shares that concern. I want to assure the gentleman that both the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) and myself will be looking at this.  Furthermore, as the gentleman may know, the Postal Department has made very substantial changes to its initially sponsored resolution through the efforts of the organizations that the gentleman from Texas talked to and himself and others who raised these issues with the department, so that they are moving to ensure greater privacy and protection to the individuals of which the gentleman spoke.  The gentleman from Texas raises a legitimate issue. I certainly intend to, along with the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), look at that further. I thank the gentleman for his comments.
