I know that the choices are difficult. I guess I would put my marbles on getting the Department to be more efficient in its administrative operations on its nuclear side and on its civil side, and put more of those dollars into research and development for the future of new energy systems, including solar.  I regret the gentleman's objection, but I have the highest respect for him. Maybe we can work this out down the road.
