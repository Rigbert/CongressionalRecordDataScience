 President, I would be happy to modify my unanimous consent request to say that following the Senator from Georgia, Senator Conrad be recognized for 7 minutes, that Senator Allard then be recognized, Senator Levin for 2 minutes, Senator Cornyn for whatever time he asks for, Senator Schumer for 5 minutes, and then Senator Byrd.
