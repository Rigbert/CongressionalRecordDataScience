Nationally, our unemployment rate is nearing 10 percent. In California, the unemployment rate has soared to 11 percent and in some of the hardest hit portions of my congressional district it has reached almost 18 percent.  Like many Americans, I am dismayed by the decision of the Democratic leadership to bring such an economically damaging bill to the House floor in the midst of these historically difficult times.  Economic organizations and think tanks from around the country have studied the economic impacts of the bill before us . . . and the results are not good. A study conducted by the National Black Chamber of Commerce determined that by 2030 the Waxman-Markey bill will cut net employment by 2.5 million jobs--even after accounting for new ``green'' jobs. Similar studies by the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation also project huge job losses.  Ironically the Democratic leadership in Congress and the Democratic Administration have made job creation one of their biggest priorities this year. During the consideration of the stimulus bill we repeatedly heard claims that the bill would ``save or create more than 3.5 million jobs.'' As most Americans know, the bill has yet to deliver as promised. I think it is notable that as we consider another major piece of legislation both the Administration and Democratic leadership are eerily silent on their job creation predictions.  The reality is the bill before us will kill jobs, weaken our economic security, and enacts punitive measures that will only make matters worse for families struggling to get by. I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this poorly conceived bill that is being pushed through with little to no time for debate or discussion.
