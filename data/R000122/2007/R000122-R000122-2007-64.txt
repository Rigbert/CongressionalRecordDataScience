President, Senator McConnell is proposing additional resources for the Bluegrass chemical demilitarization facility. It is a very important project. It is one we funded already in the bill. I can assure the Senator from Texas that I will work with my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee to allow additional resources going forward, perhaps through reprogramming, so that we can achieve Senator McConnell's goal, which is to as quickly as possible put this facility into operation to begin to eliminate some of these chemical weapons we have had in our inventory for many years.
