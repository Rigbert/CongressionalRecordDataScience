President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is vital to improving health care in America--specifically, whether the States are actually going to use a portion of the billions of dollars they received in tobacco settlement funds to keep America's youngsters from starting to smoke. The Senate has discussed this issue over the last few weeks, but I think it may be appropriate to have a new context as we go forward with these discussions.  To get an indication of how the tobacco industry believes it is doing and why the Senate ought to be concerned about this issue, you can take a look at how the tobacco industry assesses its executives' job performance. Recently, the public got a look at information concerning the 1998 compensation packages for several of the CEOs of the major tobacco companies. The combined compensation package for the CEO of Philip Morris and the CEO of RJR equals $36 million.  Last week, Mr. President, you and I marked up the Federal budget in the Budget Committee with our colleagues, but even when you spend a week dealing with the Federal budget, $36 million certainly sounds like a lot of money.  I am not against CEOs being compensated for their work. My guess is that the CEOs, in this case, earn their salaries. I don't think they would be pulling down $36 million a year unless they were doing a pretty good job of keeping the ashtrays filled in America.  Now, the combined compensation packages for just these two CEOs is more than 39 of our States and the District of Columbia would have received under the legislation Congress voted on last week. Let me be clear. Two of the tobacco CEOs were making more money in 1998 than the vast majority of our States would have received for programs to keep young people from getting started with tobacco.  For example, my home State of Oregon would receive just over $15 million under the legislation which was considered last week. That is less than half of the CEOs' compensation. The State of Wyoming would have received $3.61 million, 10 percent of the combined compensation packages. I believe that the traditional targets of tobacco in harvesting new smokers--women, children, and minorities--are certainly worth 10 percent of the combined compensation for 1 year of these two executives.  Let us also remember that it is not just the money the tobacco industry is spending on high-priced executives that the Congress should be concerned about. There is another threat to our children, and that comes from the $5 billion the tobacco industry spent last year on advertising and marketing. That is $96.2 million every week, or $13.7 million every day. Again, that is far more than many of our States would have received to protect young people from smoking.  Last year, in the Senate Commerce Committee, I wanted to make sure that the individuals who had historically been targeted by the tobacco companies would have been eligible to receive funds for tobacco control and prevention programs. I wanted to make sure that just as the tobacco companies have poured billions of dollars into advertising in the inner cities and for ads targeted to children, the Federal Government would make a special effort to prevent smoking in those communities.  I continue to believe the Federal Government needs to play an activist role in assuring that populations which historically have been targeted by the tobacco industry would be armed with good information and good preventive kinds of services, so that the tobacco companies would know that our communities are fighting back.  Let me give you an example of some of the steps that the tobacco companies may be pursuing in the days ahead to circumvent efforts by the Federal Government such as those we discussed last week.  We know the tobacco companies are now test marketing cigarettes which produce less smoke so that individuals around the smoker will not be bothered in the same way as they were so often in the past. Yet, one of the cigarettes, the Eclipse, made by RJR, is showing even more signs of being dangerous to the smoker. With the Eclipse, the evidence shows that smokers may actually be breathing in glass fibers in addition to other carcinogens.  I think it is important that the Senate understand this as we go forward with further discussions about how the tobacco settlement funds are going to be used. If the Federal Government wishes to waive its portion of the billions of dollars involved in the tobacco settlement, let's make sure that at least a portion of this money--at least a modest portion--is used to protect future generations of Americans against the tobacco industry.  I hope the Congress won't pass up another opportunity to protect America's youngsters. I urge my colleagues to continue to try to assure that some portion of the dollars secured in the tobacco settlement are actually used for health services for American's children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart prepared by the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids which compares the compensation package of just two of the tobacco CEOs with the money that would have been received by the States under the Senate legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:COMPARISON OF AMOUNT STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SPEND ON TOBACCO  PREVENTION UNDER THE SPECTER-HARKIN AMENDMENT WITH CEOS' COMPENSATION                       FROM RJR AND PHILIP MORRIS------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     15% of       20% of                                    tobacco      tobacco      Combined                                   settlement   settlement   total CEO's             States                 payments     payments   compensation                                   (millions    (millions     for 1998                                   per year)    per year)    (millions)------------------------------------------------------------------------Wyoming.........................        $2.71        $3.61           $36Alaska..........................         3.72         4.96            36South Dakota....................         3.80         5.07            36Idaho...........................         3.96         5.27            36North Dakota....................         3.98         5.31            36Delaware........................         4.31         5.74            36Vermont.........................         4.48         5.97            36Montana.........................         4.62         6.16            36Utah............................         4.84         6.46            36Nebraska........................         6.48         8.64            36New Mexico......................         6.49         8.65            36Hawaii..........................         6.55         8.73            36Washington, DC..................         6.61         8.81            36Nevada..........................         6.64         8.85            36New Hampshire...................         7.25         9.67            36Rhode Island....................         7.82        10.43            36Maine...........................         8.37        11.16            36Arkansas........................         9.01        12.01            36Kansas..........................         9.07        12.10            36Iowa............................         9.47        12.62            36West Virginia...................         9.65        12.87            36Oklahoma........................        11.28        15.04            36Oregon..........................        12.49        16.65            36South Carolina..................        12.81        17.07            36Colorado........................        14.92        19.90            36Arizona.........................        16.04        21.39            36Alabama.........................        17.59        23.45            36Kentucky........................        19.17        25.56            36Connecticut.....................        20.21        26.94            36Indiana.........................        22.20        29.60            36Virginia........................        22.26        29.67            36Washington......................        22.35        29.80            36Wisconsin.......................        22.56        30.07            36Louisiana.......................        24.55        32.73            36Maryland........................        24.61        32.81            36Missouri........................        24.76        33.01            36Mississippi.....................        25.20        33.60            36North Carolina..................        25.38        33.84            36Tennessee.......................        26.57        35.42            36Georgia.........................        26.72        35.62            36Minnesota.......................        37.02        49.36            36New Jersey......................        42.09        56.12            36Massachusetts...................        43.96        58.61            36Michigan........................        47.37        63.16            36Illinois........................        50.66        67.55            36Ohio............................        54.83        73.10            36Pennsylvania....................        62.55        83.40            36Florida.........................        80.40       107.20            36Texas...........................        94.20       125.60            36New York........................       138.91       185.21            36California......................       138.93       185.24            36------------------------------------------------------------------------In 39 states and the District of Columbia the use 20% of their total  settlement dollars is less than the combined compensation of the top  two Tobacco industry CEOs Geoffrey Bible, of Philip Morris Inc. and  Stephen F.
