 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My friends, of course, are right. We do take money from the fossil fuel energy research and development program in order to fund weatherization, in order to fund energy conservation, in order to fund the long overdue efforts to bring PILT payments to where they should be.  Mr. Chairman, regarding the fossil fuel energy research and development program, let me quote from the report of the fiscal year 1997 Republican budget resolution:  ``The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars on research and development since the oil crisis in 1973 triggered this activity. Returns on this investment have not been cost effective, particularly for applied research and development which industry has ample incentive to undertake. Some of this activity is simply corporate welfare for the oil, gas and utility industries. Much of it duplicates what industry is already doing. Some has gone to fund technology in which the market has no interest.''  That is the Republican budget resolution of 1997, not Bernie Sanders.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).  (
