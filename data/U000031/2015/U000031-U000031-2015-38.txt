Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes a number of provisions, some of which have already been enacted into law, and makes technical and conforming changes to the reported text of H.R. 8, H.R. 2295, and H.R. 2358. So the overall bill, I would say, H.R. 8, is a broad, bipartisan bill. It seeks to maximize America's energy potential, and it seeks to update and modernize outdated policies rooted in an era of energy scarcity to reflect today's era of energy abundance. I think that this is a good amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
