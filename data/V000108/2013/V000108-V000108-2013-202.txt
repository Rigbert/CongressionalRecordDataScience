Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate several of Northwest Indiana's most devoted and proficient workers.

These individuals, in addition to the other Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are the epitome of the ideal American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hardworking.  At this year's event, several individuals and organizations received special recognition. Thomas Conway Sr., United Steelworkers International Vice President, Administration, received the Service to Labor Award for assisting organized labor to improve the quality of life of workers throughout Northwest Indiana.  The Union Label Award was presented posthumously to William Cantrell and Steven Skvara, retired members of United Steelworkers and Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR), for their unselfish devotion to the Labor Movement through its promotion in all areas of endeavor: social, civic, education, and political.

For the exceptional service he has provided to the people of Northwest Indiana, he is worthy of our admiration and respect.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These individuals are all outstanding examples of these qualities. They have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and self-sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and exemplary citizens, as well as all of the hardworking union men and women throughout America.
