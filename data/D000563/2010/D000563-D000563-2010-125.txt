President, I join my colleagues in honoring the service of Senator Byron Dorgan. Over his nearly 30 years in Congress, Senator Dorgan has been a strong and dedicated advocate for the people of the State of North Dakota.  Senator Dorgan's long career in public service began in 1969 when he was appointed North Dakota State Tax Commissioner. Assuming this position at the age of only 26, Senator Dorgan became the youngest constitutional officer in North Dakota's history.  Since 1980, Senator Dorgan has been a voice for the people of North Dakota in Washington, DC. After serving six terms in the House of Representatives, he was first elected to the Senate in 1992.  It is clear that Senator Dorgan's upbringing in the small town of Regent, ND, has shaped his tenure in Congress. Throughout his years in Congress, Senator Dorgan has been a formidable advocate for rural America and the family farmers of his state. He led the effort to make permanent the disaster aid program, which provides an essential safety-net for farmers and ranchers affected by severe weather, in the 2008 farm bill.  Senator Dorgan also has been a great advocate for North Dakota's energy sector. As the country moves toward renewable and domestic energy sources, he has worked to put his state at the forefront of the industry.  After so many years of public service for the people of North Dakota, Senator Dorgan's time in the Senate is coming to a close. I am proud to have served with him, and I thank him for his service in the Senate. I wish Senator Dorgan and his family the best in the next chapters in their lives.                           Robert F. Bennett  Mr. President, I also join my colleagues in recognizing Senator Robert Bennett of Utah.  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Bennett since I entered the Senate in 1997, four years after Senator Bennett began his Senate service. I have admired his enthusiasm and dedication to serving the people of Utah ever since.  It was clear that public service was in his blood. From his election as student body president at the University of Utah, to his time in the Utah Army National Guard, Senator Bennett's priority for his entire adult life has been serving the people of his home State.  His first taste of real politics came in the 1960s when he helped his father Wallace Bennett win re-election to this very Chamber. And while he did not seek office himself until almost 20 years following his father's retirement, he worked in the private sector in Utah, deepening his ties to the State and his devotion to the people of Utah.  I have had the privilege of working side-by-side with Senator Bennett on the Appropriations Committee for many years. I have seen his passion for service, his respect for the Senate, and above all else, his love of Utah.  He has managed to stay true to the fiscal principles that he gained as a businessman and CEO, while understanding the need for compromise when it was required of him for the sake of his State and the rest of America.  During his tenure here, Utah has become a premiere destination of the West--he has worked for quality education for Utah's children, fought to preserve its natural landscapes, and paved the way for the development of 21st century infrastructure back home.  Senator Bennett also made America proud in 2002 when he helped the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics become one of the most successful and safe Olympic games in recent memory.  Of course, Senator Bennett and I have not always seen eye-to-eye on many issues. But my respect for his beliefs has always been deep. And in 2008, when America was on the brink of financial collapse, I was moved by his eagerness to reach across the aisle to do what was right for Utah and Illinois, alike. This has always been his character, and the Senate will miss him for it.  Senator Bennett leaves us this month in the same way that he has served here for almost 20 years: with dignity and conviction. I am proud to call him a friend, and wish him and his family all the best in the future.                          ____________________
