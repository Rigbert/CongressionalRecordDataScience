President, I will close with this, as I have many other times. In the use of any weapons, there always will be questions as to who is right and who is wrong. But I have to think the use of landmines raises beyond a strategic question, raises the real moral question, and because the victims of landmines are so disproportionately civilian, we do get into moral questions. As the most powerful Nation on earth, and also the Nation most blessed with resources and advantages of any nation in history, I think we fail a moral duty if we don't do more to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines.  It is a child walking to school. It is a mother going to a stream to get water. It is a parent tilling what little fields they have. It is somebody trying to help out with medical care. It is a missionary. It is so many others--all on peaceful, proper pursuits of their lives. They are the ones who step on these landmines and are killed or maimed. The child who sees a shiny toy in the field and loses his arm and his face. It is the person who tries to save the child who steps on the mine itself. It is the refugee family trying to go back to the country that they were expelled from who are dying from them. We have to do more.  I wish there would be a day when there would never be another war. There will not be. We can't stop that. But we can take steps to stop the day that landmines will ever be used again.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
