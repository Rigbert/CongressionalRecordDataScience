I especially want to thank my friends and colleagues, Senators Gordon Smith, Boxer, and Feinstein, for their initial help in getting Klamath language and money accepted into the farm bill. And I want to recognize the hard work and dedication of the chairman, Senator Daschle, and their staffs for sticking by the Klamath Basin until the bitter end. I also want to thank my friend on the other side of the Capitol, Representative Walden, for his dedication to the Klamath Basin. Thanks to his collective bi-partisan effort, today I can come to the floor to discuss the future for the Klamath Basin with some hope.
