 President, it is required by paragraph 4 of rule 35 that I place in the Congressional Record notices of Senate employees who participate in programs, the principal objective of which is educational, sponsored by a foreign government or a foreign educational or charitable organization involving travel to a foreign country paid for by that foreign government or organization.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for Kari Austin, a member of the staff of Senator Kassebaum, to participate in a program in Germany sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation from November 11-18, 1995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Ms. Austin in this program.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for Kevin Wilson, a member of the staff of Senator Pell, to participate in a program in Germany sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation from November 11-18, 1995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Mr. Wilson in this program.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for Eric Burgeson, a member of the staff of Senator Dole, to participate in a program in Korea sponsored by the Korean Economic Institute from November 18-26, 1995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Mr. Burgeson in this program.                          ____________________
