Yes, the gentleman asked for regular order. I lament the fact that we are not pursuing regular order. We could act in a responsible, bipartisan fashion to accomplish the three objectives I set forth and the appropriations bills; but, no, we're playing politics. We're pandering to a base. We're having a pretense that this bill can pass. It cannot.  Let us defeat this bill and then let us come together in a responsible fashion as the American public wants us to do and act on their behalf, not on the behalf of our politics.
