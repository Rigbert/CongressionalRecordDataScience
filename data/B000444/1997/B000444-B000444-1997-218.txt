 President, let me just take the minute to say the following: If you do not like this treaty and you are not for it, vote against it. If you think this treaty makes sense, vote for my amendment, because if this treaty contains this provision, it is dead. This is a so-called killer amendment.  So those of you who have concluded you are not going to vote in the final analysis for this treaty, vote no. Those of you who have decided you want to vote for this treaty--to cut through it all--vote yes. I mean, it really is that basic, because if my motion fails to strike, this treaty is dead.  I yield back the remainder of my time, if my colleague from North Carolina is prepared to yield back his time. I am prepared to vote.
