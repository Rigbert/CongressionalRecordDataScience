President, I thank Senator Specter for joining me in introducing this bill last December, as the first session of this Congress drew to a close. The Judiciary Committee took up and unanimously approved the bill during our first business meeting after returning from the holiday recess. I urge all Senators to join Senator Specter and me to pass this proposal and take a positive step toward modernizing and improving the Federal Rules of Evidence.
