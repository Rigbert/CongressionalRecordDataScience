Mr. Speaker, we should be standing here debating the future of Social Security. We should be standing here debating health care. We should be standing here debating education for our children and how we can protect the environment.  Instead, we are participating in a political charade. Republicans want to do what they could not do in an election, defeat Bill Clinton. I have news for my colleagues, the American people are watching. Beware the wrath of the American people, Mr. Speaker, beware.
