 President, for the benefit of my Democratic colleagues, I believe that we will be able to accept--and we are clearing this now--the Brown amendment No. 1229, as amended, and the McCain-Leahy amendment No. 1240 that relates to special assessments, and the Shelby amendment No. 1230.  It is my hope and expectation that the Republican manager of the bill may be able to accept, with some possible modification, Senator Nunn's amendment No. 1213 on posse comitatus, and Senator Leahy's amendment No. 1247 on foreign policy.  But while we are trying to work that out, I suggest that maybe it is appropriate for the Senator from Connecticut to proceed. Mr. President, if I have not already, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a primary cosponsor to the Senator's amendment.
