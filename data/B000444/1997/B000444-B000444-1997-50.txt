 President, since I released my first annual drug strategy in1990, I have argued that it was imperative that we needed to act, instead of just talk, in order to confront the problem of drug abuse and drug related crime. This means focusing quickly on the risks confronting our youth, identifying practical steps our communities can take to reduce these risks, and committing ourselves to the hard work and resources needed to steer young people to productive lives instead of wasted lives.  The administration's 1998 national drug strategy provides significant steps toward these goals. Under the leadership of General McCaffrey, the administration's 1998 drug strategy calls for a 10-year antidrug plan and a 1998 budget request that includes full funding for drug control efforts that have proven to work.  The administration's budget request includes: $8.4 billion for domestic drug enforcement; $3.3 billion for drug treatment; $2.2 billion for drug education and prevention--including $680 million for Safe and Drug-Free Schools; and $2.1 billion for interdiction and international antidrug efforts--including broad, across-the-board increases for law enforcement agencies like the FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. Attorneys.  In addition to funding these existing programs, the budget request establishes a national media campaign of prime-time antidrug television advertisements to stop kids from trying drugs in the first place--funded by $175 million from Federal Government and $175 million from private industry.  These are all positive steps which I urge my colleagues to pass into law.  What is more, these positive steps illustrate just how vital the office of the Drug Director truly is. Because, if we did not have an office--a single, responsible office charged with overseeing the Federal antidrug policy we could not even debate whether General McCaffrey's drug strategy makes sense. I believe it does. But, there may be others who do not. My key point is that without a Drug Director, we would have lost even the chance to have an informed debate over a specific proposal.  I remind my colleagues what we faced on the drug policy front when I first began calling for a drug office in 1980: it was pretty simple, there was no drug office, there were more than 50 Federal departments, agencies, and offices putting together a hodge-podge of antidrug efforts with no coherant plan.  Contrast this to what we have today, General McCaffrey has submitted a strategy and a budget--and we can now all debate what a majority of us favor and what a majority of us oppose.  This is the fundamental reason why I am today introducing legislation to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I know that the administration, led by General McCaffrey, has worked hard to craft this legislation, and I believe that it deserves speedy consideration--and the votes--of my colleagues.  One of the important refinements offered in this legislation is to build in some long-term planning while at the same time adding some greater accountability for the drug strategy and all its component parts.  This legislation does so by calling on the Drug Director to develop a 10-year plan, a 5-year budget coupled with a detailed annual status report assessing the progress on the strategy, as well as a detailed, program-by-program, annual budget.  In other words, this legislation would keep the Drug Director's key power to develop, define, and submit to Congress a detailed annual drug budget. A process which holds unique powers to focus congressional debate on the topic of drug policy, and which is the strongest institutional power of the Office of National Drug Control Policy within the executive branch.  In addition, this legislation will enhance a function which too often is ignored--that function: accountability. Here, the Drug Director has called for long- and short-term measureable objectives. In fact, as part of General McCaffrey's on-going efforts at the Drug Office, the General has already identified more than 54 performance targets and another nearly 80 measures of program effectiveness.  The legislation I am introducing today will help formalize this process. Let me also add, that calling on the Drug Director to provide a 10-year plan will not prevent any future administration--nor even this administration--from changing or refining that plan. It is simply to recognize that we are at a stage in our effort against drugs where we must focus on implementation and results. And, this is exactly what the legislation I offer today is all about.  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I offer today.                          ____________________
