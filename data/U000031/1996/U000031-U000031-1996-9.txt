Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the following committees and their subcommittees be permitted to sit today while the House is meeting in the Committee of the Whole House under the 5-minute rule: The Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Resources, and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.  It is my understanding that the minority has been consulted and that there is no objection to these requests.
