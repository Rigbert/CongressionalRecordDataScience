 President, I rise today to introduce the College Affordability and Creating Chances for Educational Success for Students Act of 2007, or College ACCESS Act. It will make a 2-year or 4-year college degree affordable for every student.  The United States is the largest economy in the world, and our skills, our brains, are the foundation of our economic strength. However, if we do not substantially expand access to higher education, we will not be able to count on continued dominance. Consider the facts: China and India both produce twice as many engineers a year as we produce. One out of five U.S. scientists and engineers are foreign-born. An Indian engineer costs only 20 percent of an American engineer. By 2010, the U.S. will produce about 15 percent of the world's science and engineering doctorate degrees. This is down from 50 percent, half the world total, in 1970. High-speed access to information has leveled the playing field, radiologists in India are reading x-rays from American hospitals.  This is a global economy. In a world where America's competitive advantage gap is closing fast, we should be ensuring guaranteeing that every student can pursue higher education. The importance of a college degree has never been greater, but over the next decade 2 million students will forgo college because of cost. The price tag of a degree at a four year public college has risen 35 percent in the last 5 years, the largest increase in tuition and fees in any 5-year period in the last 30 years. We can not approach college as if it is a luxury, rather than a necessity. And we should be worried about the rising costs that are putting college out of reach for more and more Americans. We aren't giving students and their families enough financial support to obtain their educational goals, it is that simple.  We need to act, and we need to act now, and that is why I am introducing the College ACCESS Act. This legislation addresses some of the disparities in our current system with innovative new ways to help Americans pay for college.  First, my College ACCESS Plan fully covers the average cost of tuition and fees at a 2-year public college and covers more than half of the average cost of tuition and fees at a public 4-year college.  Right now, students and their families can take advantage of either the Hope Credit or the tuition and fees deduction, obtaining a maximum benefit of $1,120 or $1,650, respectively. Although these incentives help to make college more affordable, they fall far short of providing the level of relief needed to ensure that all students can afford college.  By replacing the Hope Credit and the tuition and fees deduction with a single $3,000 credit, the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction, and making it refundable, middle class and low income families will get real help with college costs. My College ACCESS tax credit simplifies this process and is indexed annually for inflation. So, when the cost of college goes up, the amount of assistance goes up as well.  Second, my College ACCESS proposal increases Pell Grants. When this program was established, it covered most of the cost of tuition at a 4-year public college. This is no longer the case. Currently, the maximum annual Pell Grant award is $4,310, and the average annual cost of tuition and fees at a 4-year public college is $5,800. Students are seeing their tuition costs rise every year while the levels of Federal funding fail to keep up. This reality is one that more and more students are facing every day, a reality that says, you can go to college, but only if you can afford it, and you won't get much help from us.  My College ACCESS Act seeks to remedy this by raising the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,100 for 2007-2008, followed by increases of $300 per year for the next 5 years, for a maximum Pell Grant in 2011-2012 of $6,300.  Finally, the College ACCESS Plan would provide funding for a demonstration program in four states that would commit a maximum Federal Pell Grant award to eligible 8 grade students so they know they're going to get this assistance when they graduate. By using the same eligibility criteria as the National School Lunch Program, students would be identified based on need, and then provided with information on the Pell Grant program, the costs of college, and what Federal and State financial assistance is available to them.  Right now, students don't find out if they are eligible for Federal aid until their senior year, much less how much they will receive. If you've ever put kids through college, like I have, you know that this time frame doesn't allow much leeway for planning ahead. An earlier promise of Federal aid will begin the conversation about college early and continue it through high school. That way, students and their families can visualize college in their future, and this goal can sustain them through the moment they open that acceptance letter.  My mother has an expression that I think rings true in the larger scope of America: ``Children tend to become that which you expect of them.'' I want a country where we expect much from America's children. Our future, and our economic security, depend on it.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     The College ACCESS Act of 2007                   Title I--College ACCESS Tax Credit       Consolidate two existing tax incentives--the Hope      Scholarship Credit and the tuition and fees deduction--and      replaces them with a single $3,000 refundable tax credit that      is the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction. The College ACCESS      Tax Credit would fully cover the average cost of tuition and      fees at a public two-year college, $2,300, and would cover      more than half of the average cost of tuition and fees at a      public four-year college, $5,800. Currently, the tuition and      fees deduction has a maximum value of $1,120, about 20      percent of the average cost of tuition and fees at a public      four-year college. The Hope Scholarship Credit is more      valuable, with a maximum value of $1,650, about 28 percent of      the average cost of tuition and fees at a public four-year      college.       Expand eligibility for the tax credit to ease the burden of      paying for college for more families. Currently, the Hope      Scholarship Credit is phased out for married couples earning      $90,000 to $110,000, $45,000 to $55,000 for individuals.      Married couples earning $130,000 to $160,000, $65,000-$80,000      for individuals, are eligible only for a reduced tuition and      fees deduction. The College ACCESS Tax Credit expands      eligibility, providing the full credit to married couples      whose adjusted gross income is less than $130,000, $65,000      for individuals and phasing out the credit for married      couples with incomes between $130,000 and $166,000, $65,000      and $83,000 for individuals. Broadening the income limits for      this credit would result in approximately 4 million more hard      working American families being eligible for this assistance      than under the current tax incentives and limits. Recognizing      that the cost of college rises each year, both the income      limits and phase-out range for the credit would be adjusted      annually for inflation. Furthermore, families could claim a      credit for more than one eligible dependent in a school year.      In pursuing their education, individuals will be eligible for      credits totaling up to $12,000 toward an undergraduate      degree, associate's degree, certificate, or continuing      education as well as credits totaling up to $6,000 toward a      graduate degree; as long as they are enrolled at least half-     time.       Make the tuition tax credit refundable. Making the College      ACCESS Tax Credit refundable would expand this incentive to      the very students and families that need it the most, low      income families. This credit would allow low income families      to qualify for up to $3,000 to cover tuition payments that      aren't covered by Pell Grants. Low income students who do      attend college often face prohibitive costs even after      receiving aid from the government and their institution.  Title II--Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program       Fund a demonstration program that would commit Pell Grants      to students in 8 grade. Currently, most students find out      whether or not they will receive a Pell Grant during their      senior year of high school. Starting the financial aid      process earlier would allow     families and students to plan ahead for college and develop      an expectation that the future includes higher education. The      proposal provides funding for an Early Pell Grant Commitment      Demonstration Program in four States, each of which would      commit Pell Grants to two cohorts of up to 10,000 8 grade      students, one in school year 2007-2008, and one in school      year 2008-2009. Participation would be contingent on      students' 8 grade eligibility for free or reduced price meals      under the National School Lunch Program. Participants would      qualify for the Automatic Zero Expected Family Contribution      on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA,      guaranteeing them a maximum Pell Grant, $4,310 for 2007-08.      Additionally, the act requires an independent evaluation to      be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the      program.       Provide students with essential information regarding the      costs of college as well as available State and Federal      assistance. The Early Pell Grant Demonstration Project would      provide funding for States, in conjunction with the      participating local education agencies, to conduct targeted      information campaigns beginning in the 8 grade and continuing      through students' senior year. These campaigns would inform      students and their families of the program and provide      information about the cost of a college education, State and      Federal financial assistance, and the average amount of aid      awards. A targeted information campaign, along with a      guarantee of a maximum Pell Grant, would provide information      essential to the college-planning process and would help      break down the barriers that cost and information often form.          Title III--Increase Federal Pell Grant Maximum Award       Expand the maximum Pell Grant from $4,310 to $5,100. In      1975, the maximum Pell Grant covered 84 percent of the cost      of tuition, fees, room, and board at a four-year public      college (Pell Grants, unlike tax incentives, can be used to      pay for the cost of room and board). The maximum Pell Grant      this year covered 33 percent of the average cost of tuition,      fees, room, and board at a public four-year college, $12,115.      While Congress increased the maximum Pell Grant for 2007-2008      to $4,310, a more substantial increase is long overdue, as      the cost of tuition has outpaced the growth in family income      for the last two decades. The College ACCESS Act would      increase the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 for 2007-2008,      followed by increases of $300 per year for the next five      years, for a maximum Pell Grant in 2011-12 of $6,300.                       Estimated Five-Year Costs       Title I--$24.1 Billion       Title II--$35 billion       Title III--$36.5 million                                 ______                                       By
