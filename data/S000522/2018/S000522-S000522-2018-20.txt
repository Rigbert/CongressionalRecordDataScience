Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kelly so much for his comments and his leadership for many, many years. I deeply appreciate it.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), a good friend and colleague, who is a distinguished member of the Education and the Workforce Committee and also serves on Homeland Security.
