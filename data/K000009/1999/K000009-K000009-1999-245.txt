Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and underlying legislation H.R. 975 which has been brought to us by our diligent colleagues, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula). I wanted to thank our good friend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moakley) also for helping move this through the Committee on Rules. It is time to put steel back into the spine of America. 10,000 American steelworkers losing their jobs is beyond belief. The administration's delay to enforce dumping laws in this country, unforgivable. Since 1997, a glut of dumped imports on our shores, Indonesia up 612 percent, Japan 157 percent, Australia 156 percent, South Africa, 107 percent and Korea 105 percent; most of those countries are not covered by the administration's agreement.  If we in this Congress cannot stand up for our own when they are being unfairly dumped on, it is fair to ask, when do we stand up for anyone? Support the rule. Support H.R. 975.
