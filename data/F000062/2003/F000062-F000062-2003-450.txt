 President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to another American--and another Californian--killed in the line of duty. His name: LT Thomas Mullen Adams, of La Mesa. He was only 27.  Yesterday, I spoke of LCpl Jose Gutierrez, a young immigrant from Guatemala who was struck down trying to liberate the Iraqi port city of Umm al Qasar. Corporal Gutierrez was an orphan who first settled in a homeless shelter in Hollywood, before being taken in by foster parents.  Lieutenant Adams, on the other hand, grew up in comfort, in the suburbs, as a member of a family that traces its roots directly to John Adams, one of America's most important Founding Fathers.  On the surface, there seems little in common with Corporal Gutierrez and Lieutenant Adams. But together, they embody the depth and breadth of America's Armed Forces--men and women from all walks of life, willing to give their lives to defend our freedoms.  Lieutenant Adams graduated from Grossmont High School in 1993 and the United States Naval Academy in 1997.  He received flight training in Pensacola, FL, and inherited his love of flying from his father, John, an architect who helped design the Aerospace Museum in San Diego.  Promoted to lieutenant in the year 2000, Adams won two National Defense Service Medals, three Sea Service Deployment Ribbons and other awards.  ``He's one of these amazingly clean-cut, all-American kids,'' his aunt, Elizabeth Hansen, told the San Diego Union Tribune newspaper. ``He's the kind of kid that if you had a very special daughter, you would hope that she would snag him. He was just amazingly bright, funny and kind.''  In October of 2002, Lieutenant Adams was assigned as an exchange officer with the British Royal Navy's 849 Squadron, now on the aircraft carrier Ark Royal.  An avid soccer fan who had volunteered to go to Japan with the carrier Kitty Hawk in time for the World Cup finals last summer, he joined a local team near his base in Helston, England. Lieutenant Adams' family said that he particularly enjoyed his time with the Royal Navy for two reasons: every ship had a pub on board, and he was allowed a weekly 20-minute phone call home.  ``This is an extremely close family, and none of us will ever be the same,'' said his aunt, Elizabeth Hansen. ``All of us just remember him as a fun-loving guy with a wry sense of humor and we can't imagine going forward without him.''  I can only hope that they do go forward. And it is to his family--to his parents, John and Marilyn, and his younger sister, Cari--that I extend my deepest sympathies.  All Americans owe an enormous--an almost incalculable--debt to LT Thomas Mullen Adams, who accepted great risk and was willing to sacrifice his future for the future of the country he so clearly loved, so that we, as a people, might be safe and free. His sacrifice will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
