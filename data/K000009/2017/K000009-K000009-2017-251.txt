Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th birthday of beautiful and legendary Camp Miakonda. Camp Miakonda is located in Toledo, Ohio, and is a bedrock for many Boy Scouts. I would like to include in the Record the words of its executive, Ed Caldwell:       On Saturday, the Erie Shores Council of the Boy Scouts of      America will begin a yearlong celebration of the 100th      birthday of Camp Miakonda, an important community asset that      deserves a grand celebration.       The festivities will commence with a hallmark event for the      entire community to enjoy time at camp. Please join us to      learn about the many Scouts who have camped at Miakonda over      the decades and how our practices and equipment have changed.       Special ceremonies include the ribbon-cutting and grand      opening of our new Wildlife Nature Center. Parking will be      available at nearby schools with shuttle service from 9 a.m.      to 5 p.m. This event is free and open to the public.       I am proud to serve as the Scout executive and chief      executive officer of the Erie Shores Council. Like many other      people in our community, I am a product of the Boy Scout      leadership program. I am, and always will be, an Eagle Scout.       I was taught the Boy Scout salute, and Scout handshake, the      Scout motto (``Be prepared''), and the Scout slogan (``Do a      good turn daily''). I memorized the Boy Scout Law (``A Scout      is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,      obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent'')      and the Boy Scout Oath (with its pledge to ``keep myself      physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight'').       Camp Miakonda, known as the ``land of the crescent moon,''      is more than America's sixth-oldest Boy Scout camp and the      oldest in the state of Ohio. It is a community asset.       From the first Scouts who camped at the 160-acre De Vilbiss      Scout Reservation in 1917, to the many Scouts who travel from      across the country each year to enjoy the camp's nationally      recognized programs and facilities, Camp Miakonda has      inspired tens of thousands of young men in its first 100      years. We are excited to serve the youth, and create a      lifetime of memories for the next 100 years.       Today, Camp Miakonda is a multiuse facility, serving both      the Boy Scouts and the community at large. For Scouts, the      adventure starts at Camp Miakonda with Club Scout Day Camp      during the summer months and many weekend Scouting programs      throughout the spring, fall, and winter. For the general      public, camp facilities are available for day, evening, or      weekend use for special events, dinners, or training      seminars.       In addition to our Saturday open house, we will be hosting      other Camp Miakonda celebrations over the next few months. On      Tuesday, the actual 100th birthday of Camp Miakonda, we will      feature an all-day open house. On Oct. 5, we will host a      ``Special Evening under the Crescent Moon,'' a gala dinner to      benefit Camp Miakonda's long-term operations.       I hope you will bring a friend and join us in our      celebrations this year. This is your camp. The Camp Miakonda      adventure starts here.                                                       Ed Caldwell     (Scout Executive, Erie Shores Council).                          ____________________
