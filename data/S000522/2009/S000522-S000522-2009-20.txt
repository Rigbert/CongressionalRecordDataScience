Mr. Speaker, each year, Planned Parenthood kills more than 300,000 children by abortion, yet yesterday another Planned Parenthood director resigned over abortion. Abby Johnson, director of a clinic in College Station, Texas, said she had a change of heart while watching an ultrasound of an actual abortion in real-time.  Self-described as ``extremely pro-choice'' but now pro-life, she said she knew it was time to quit in September when she watched an unborn child ``crumble'' as the baby was vacuumed, dismembered, and destroyed.  Many, including and especially self-described extremely pro-choice Americans like Abby Johnson, are beginning to recognize the ultra-ugly truth about abortion--it kills babies and wounds their mothers. Thus, we must protect both victims of abortion by enacting the Stupak-Pitts amendment to the health care bill.  I appeal to the Democrat leadership, make the Stupak amendment in order, and, please, no phony compromises, because there is nothing benign or compassionate about abortion.                          ____________________
