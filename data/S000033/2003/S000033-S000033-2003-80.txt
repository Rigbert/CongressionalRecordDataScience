 Speaker, I am pro-choice. I am proud of it. I have always been, and I will always be. But for the pharmaceutical industry to lie about the pro-life people just shows the desperateness as to where they are. What they are nervous about and what this Special Order is about is people from different political parties coming together on behalf of the American people and saying, enough is enough, pharmaceutical industry, you cannot rip the American people off. I think we have them on the run, and if we keep our fiber and keep working together, we will win this effort.  I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) for his leadership efforts on this issue.
