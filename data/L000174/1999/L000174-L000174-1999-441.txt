President, on Friday May 14th, MATHCOUNTS held its national competition in Washington, D.C.--the culmination of local and State competitions involving 350,000 students. It gives me great pleasure to inform my colleagues that Alex Xue, a resident of Essex Junction, VT finished second in this competition and received a $6,000 college scholarship.  In a day and age where we are bombarded by reports of failing school systems and apathetic young people, I believe it is extremely important to recognize Alex's tremendous accomplishment. His success is a tribute not only to his own intelligence and hard work, but also to his family, his teachers and his school community.  In addition to meeting with Alex and his MATHCOUNTS teammates on the Senate steps prior to the competition, by coincidence, I was on Alex's flight back to Vermont on the Sunday following his competition. I had a chance to talk with Alex and compliment him on his tremendous achievement. He was holding the trophy he had received and when I admired it, although it was clear that he was happy with it, he was especially pleased with the college scholarship. I praised him as any Vermonter would, but I was impressed with his modesty and his pride in his family and school. This is a young man who will do remarkably well in life and we Vermonters should be proud that he is one of us.  I ask that the editorial detailing Alex's achievement, which appeared in the Burlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.  The article follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 19, 1999]                            What Alex Knows       Imagine a 13-year-old boy who finished second in the nation      in an athletic event.       Vermont would know exactly how to celebrate: His parents      and coaches would be praised, he would be held up as a role      model for other kids, his community would be proud.       Alex Xue of Essex Junction deserves the same response, for      scoring second in a nationwide math contest last week.       This remarkable performance is a tribute to his school,      though schools are rarely praised these days. This success      requires effective instruction year upon year.       His award is an accolade that also belongs to his parents,      who support his studies. Would that more parents lavished as      much time on their children's academics as they do on their      sports.       The high finish is also a sign that he is a smart kid, very      smart, and that is worth a great deal in the life Alex and      his classmates have ahead of them.       Of course, schools cannot fix their attention solely on top      students, because they must serve everyone who enters their      doors. But they can recognize talent and reward performance,      because it motivates other students, and because it serves as      a reminder of what school is for: to learn, to strive, to      fail at times and gain by the experience, and to achieve.       For his knowledge of math, statistics, geometry and more,      Alex receives a $6,000 college scholarship--a fitting prize.      Learning offers rewards for every student, though, not just      the smartest, and education level is the clearest indicator      of a person's later wages.       Won't it be fun to see what becomes of Alex and his      abilities? Wouldn't it be something if society thought of      every child's potential that way?                          ____________________
