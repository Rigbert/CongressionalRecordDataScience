 Today, in the gallery, we have noble veterans of the OSS.  We know our Nation stands on your broad shoulders.  Through their patriotism and sacrifice, America still is a young nation but is growing and is keeping what we have learned close to our hearts. In paying Gold Medal tribute to the members of the OSS, America honors those who bequeathed precious liberty to us, and we must carry that torch forward as it was carried at such a great price by our forebears.  I would like to acknowledge Charles Pinck, whose father served as a member of the OSS, for his commitment to educate the public about this valiant group.  May God bless the members of the OSS, their families and friends. May our efforts here award them the Gold they so nobly, royally, and selflessly earned, and may God continue to bless America.
