President, Marcelle and I have been privileged to have known Judy Collins for years. We have heard her sing in New York, in Washington, DC, and in Vermont, and every time we have been thrilled. I have even been known to call her phone just to hear her sing on her answering machine.  The New York Times on April 23 of this year wrote a review of her current engagement at the Cafe Carlyle, and I talked with Judy about it. I know that she and Louis keep a very busy schedule, but I just wanted to congratulate her on another well deserved review.  I would ask unanimous consent to have the New York Times article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 2009]             Folk Goddess Descends From Her Lofty Pedestal                          (By Stephen Holden)       It wasn't always so. But nowadays a Judy Collins concert is      a seamless flow of music and storytelling. Alternating      between the guitar and the piano, Ms. Collins offers a      version of a personal musical history that is too complicated      and rich to be covered in a single evening.       On Tuesday night at the Cafe Carlyle, where she began a      six-week engagement, the emphasis was on her folk-music side,      and for more than half the show she accompanied herself on      acoustic guitar, with Russell Walden assisting on piano and      backup vocals.       Her song ``Mountain Girl,'' performed early in the evening,      set the tone. Ms. Collins grew up in Colorado, and her      silvery vibrato-free voice might be described as an Alpine      instrument. Especially when she sings a cappella, it has the      ringing purity of a voice emanating from a lofty altitude and      reverberating in an endless echo chamber of mountain passes.      Ms. Collins, who will turn 70 on May 1, has miraculously      retained her upper register. The higher she sings, most of      the time with perfect intonation, the more she projects the      ethereality of a flute played by the wind.       The influence that propelled her from a piano prodigy who      played Mozart, she recalled, wasn't the sound of the Weavers      or Woody Guthrie, but that of Jo Stafford on her 1950s folk      albums. In particular it was Ms. Stafford's recording of      ``Barbara Allen,'' first heard on the radio, that drew Ms.      Collins away from classical piano. And as she sang this      ballad of unrequited love, death and grief, her vocal      similarities with Stafford, who died last year, were      striking. Both singers expressed a demure self-containment in      unadorned phrases that imbued their performances with faraway      longing.       In recent years Ms. Collins has descended from the folk-     goddess pedestal to emerge as a funny, self-effacing Irish-     American storyteller, and the tension between her pristine      singing voice and her salty reminiscences lends her shows a      theatrical dimension. She reminisced at length about her      first meeting with Leonard Cohen, who had no confidence in      his talents until she recorded his song ``Suzanne.'' He      returned the favor by persuading her to take up songwriting.       Her wildest tale described an adventure in Chicago on a      winter night in which she caroused until 3 a.m. with two      folk-singing colleagues, one of whom gave her a handgun for      protection during the walk back to her hotel. Once safely in      her room, she tried to remove the clip, and the gun went off.       Those were the wild old days to which Ms. Collins      increasingly alludes in her shows. The more she talks about      her itinerant life as a folk musician, the more you want to      know. The high point of the show was her rendition of a      recent Jimmy Webb song, ``Paul Gauguin in the South Seas.''      The song, which describes the painter's retreat from      civilization in a search for paradise that eventually landed      him in the Marquesas Islands, evokes the quest of any artist      for sacred ground that has never been visited: an elusive      place Ms. Collins conjures when her voice soars.                          ____________________
