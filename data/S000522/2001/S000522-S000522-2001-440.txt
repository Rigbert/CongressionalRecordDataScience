Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the students and faculty of the Burlington City High School Music Department in Burlington City, New Jersey for their recognition by the national GRAMMY Foundation as a GRAMMY Signature School.  Burlington City is now one of 100 high schools from across the country to receive a certificate of recognition based on its high level of commitment to music education. The GRAMMY Signature School Program honors high school music students, teachers, principals, and school districts that promote and preserve music education--both performing and studying music--as a key part of their curriculum.  The importance of music education in the overall educational experience of students is becoming clearer every day. In fact, several studies have shown a quantifiable value of the arts in improving overall academic performance. According to the College Entrance Examination Board, students of the arts continue to outperform their non-arts peers on the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT). In 1995, for example, SAT scores for students who studied the arts for four or more years were 59 points higher on the verbal, and 44 points higher on the math portion of the exam, than students with no course work on experience in the arts.  Moreover, most teachers know that music appreciation and performance can often provide a critical mechanism to engage, and stimulate interest in, other school activities. Students who otherwise would have dropped out of school, and put their long term economic futures at risk, have been re-engaged through music and the arts.  The GRAMMY Signature School Program is developed through the GRAMMY Foundation, a non-profit arm of the Recording Academy that is dedicated to advancing music and arts-based education across the country. Through educational, cultural and professional initiatives, the Foundation aims to strengthen our educational system.  What makes Burlington City's accomplishments so special is the knowledge that it successfully competed against 18,000 public high schools nationwide. In the end, Burlington City's program was chosen by an independent screening committee comprised of university music professors, and representatives from professional music organizations to receive the Signature School Award for their exceptional job of cultivating their arts program.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the faculty and students in the music department for their commitment to furthering music education. I would like to thank the school and the local school board for their hard work and dedication to providing an outstanding music educational program that superbly serves the students of Burlington City.                          ____________________
