Far be it from me to interfere with that.  First, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and say I would very much like to work with him, to get this practice changed. I have, in fact, spent a considerable amount of time with Senator Byrd on this. He was very helpful as well.  I would finally say to the chairman that with respect to this matter of courtesy, I and Senator Grassley have no concern about that. Of course the hold, if we are talking about a few days or a few hours as a courtesy, is not what is at issue. It is when a Senator digs in to try to block a bill that there ought to be some public disclosure.  But to me the chairman has been very helpful, not just on matters from our committee like Internet and the like, but generally. I want to tell him I am very interested in working with him on it because I think this is an opportunity to keep the greatness of this institution and still make it more open and democratic. I thank him for all the time.                       central american refugees
