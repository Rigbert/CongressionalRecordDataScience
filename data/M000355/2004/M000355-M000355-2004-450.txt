 President, the assistant Democratic leader has indicated we have had some casualties this week. It is also important to point out this is the smallest number of casualties of any major war in the history of the United States by far.  We just had an opportunity this past weekend to open the World War II Memorial and remember the over 400,000 Americans who were lost in that great conflict. It is impossible to fight the war on terrorism with no casualties. We regret every single death and every single injury, but given the enormous task, we have already completed liberating over 50 million people in the last 2\1/2\ years. It has been done in an extraordinarily effective way with minimum loss of life on our side. We all agree our military forces are quite extraordinary in the task they are undertaking.  Speaking of World War II, in addition, tomorrow at 5 p.m., there will be a reception honoring Senators Akaka, Hollings, Lautenberg, Inouye, Stevens, and Warner, all of whom served in World War II. We will devote the hour prior to the reception to speeches in the Senate honoring their service.                          ____________________
