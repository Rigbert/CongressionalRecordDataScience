 As my colleague knows, this talk about job training for American workers? I support all kinds of skilling up of the American work force and our kids in school, and vocational programs, and after-school programs, and college programs. But the point is, if we have got companies taking those jobs someplace else, why care how much training we give people? When they are finished with their education, there is not going to be a good-wage job with benefits there for them, and I yield to the gentleman.
