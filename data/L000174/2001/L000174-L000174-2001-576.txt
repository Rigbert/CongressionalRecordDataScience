President, an important responsibility of the Senate Judiciary Committee is fulfilling the mandate set forth in Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution, ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' Chairman Hatch and I, and other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, have worked together successfully over the years to update and make necessary adjustments to our copyright, patent and trademark laws to carry out this responsibility. We have strived to do so in a manner that advances the rights of intellectual property owners while protecting the important interests of users of the creative works that make our culture a vibrant force in this global economy.  Several years ago, as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, we asked the Copyright Office to perform a study of the complex copyright issues involved in distance education and to make recommendations to us for any legislative changes. In conducting that study, Maybeth Peters, the Registrar of Copyrights met informally with interested Vermonters at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont, to hear their concerns on this issue. Champlain College has been offering on-line distance learning programs since 1993, with a number of online programs, including for degrees in accounting, business, and hotel-restaurant management.  The Copyright Office released its report in May, 1999, at a hearing held in this Committee, and made valuable suggestions on how modest changes in our copyright law could go a long way to foster the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. I am pleased to join Senator Hatch in introducing the Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization, or TEACH, Act, that incorporates the legislative recommendations of that report. This legislation will help clarify the law and allow educators to use the same rich material in distance learning over the Internet that they are able to use in face-to-face classroom instruction.  The growth of distance learning is exploding, largely because it is responsive to the needs of older, non-traditional students. The Copyright Office, CO, report noted two years ago that, by 2002, the number of students taking distance education courses will represent 15 percent of all higher education students. Moreover, the typical average distance learning student is 34 years old, employed full-time and has previous college credit. More than half are women. In increasing numbers, students in other countries are benefitting from educational opportunities here through U.S. distance education programs.  In high schools, distance education makes advanced college placement and college equivalency courses available,a great opportunity for residents in our more-rural states. In colleges, distance education makes lifelong learning a practical reality.  Not only does distance education make it more convenient for many students to pursue an education, for students who have full-time work commitments, who live in rural areas or in foreign countries, who have difficulty obtaining child or elder care, or who have physical disabilities, distance education may be the only means for them to pursue an education. These are the people with busy schedules who need the flexibility that on-line programs offer: virtual classrooms accessible when the student is ready, and free, to log-on.  In Vermont and many other rural states, distance learning is a critical component of any quality educational and economic development system. In fact, the most recent Vermont Telecommunications Plan, which was published in 1999 and is updated at regular intervals, identifies distance learning as being critical to Vermont's development. It also recommends that Vermont consider ``using its purchasing power to accelerate the introduction of new [distance learning] services in Vermont.'' Technology has empowered individuals in the most remote communities to have access to the knowledge and skills necessary to improve their education and ensure they are competitive for jobs in the 21st century.  Several years ago, I was proud to work with the state in establishing the Vermont Interactive Television network. This constant two-way video-conferencing system can reach communities, schools and businesses in every corner of the State. Since we first successfully secured funds to build the backbone of the system, Vermont has constructed fourteen sites. The VIT system is currently running at full capacity and has demonstrated that in Vermont, technology highways are just as important as our transportation highways.  No one single technology should be the platform for distance learning. In Vermont, creative uses of available resources have put in place a distance learning system that employees T-1 lines in some areas and traditional internet modem hook-ups in others. Several years ago, the Grand Isle Supervisory Union received a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to link all the schools within the district with fiber optic cable. There are not a lot of students in this Supervisory Union but these is a lot of land separating one school from another. The bandwidth created by the fiber optic cables has not only improved the educational opportunities in the four Grand Isle towns, but it has also provided a vital economic boost to the area's business.  While there are wonderful examples of the use of distance learning inside Vermont, the opportunities provided by these technologies are not limited to the borders of one state, or even one country. Champlain College, a small school in Burlington, Vermont has shown this is true when it adopted a strategic plan to provide distance learning for students throughout the world. Under the leadership of President Roger Perry, Champlain College now has more students enrolled than any other college in Vermont. The campus in Vermont has not been overwhelmed with the increase. Instead, Champlain now teaches a large number of students overseas through its on-line curriculum. Similarly, Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vermont, offers innovative graduate programs designed for working professionals with classes that meet not only in person but also online.  The Internet, with its interactive, multi-media capabilities, has been a significant development for distance learning. By contrast to the traditional, passive approach of distance learning where a student located remotely from a classroom was able to watch a lecture being broadcast at a fixed time over the air, distance learners today can participate in real-time class discussions, or in simultaneous multimedia projects. The Copyright Office report confirms what I have assumed for some time--that ``the computer is the most versatile of distance education instruments,'' not just in terms of flexible schedules, but also in terms of the material available.  Over twenty years ago, the Congress recognized the potential of broadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and to bring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or other special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same time, Congress also recognized the potential for unauthorized transmissions of works to harm the markets for educational uses of copyrighted materials. The present Copyright Act strikes a careful balance and includes two narrowly crafted exemptions for distance learning, in addition to the general fair use exemption.  Under current law, the performance or display of any work in the course of face-to-face instruction in a classroom is exempt from the exclusive rights of a copyright owner. In addition, the copyright law allows transmission of certain performances or displays of copyrighted works to be sent to a classroom or a similar place which is normally devoted to instruction, to persons whose disabilities or other special circumstances prevent classroom attendance, or to government employees. While this exemption is technology neutral and does not limit authorized ``transmissions'' to distance learning broadcasts, the exemption does not authorize the reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works--a limitation that has enormous implications for transmissions over computer networks. Digital transmissions over computer networks involve multiple acts of reproduction as a data packet is moved from one computer to another.  The need to update our copyright law to address new developments in online distance learning was highlighted in the December, 2000 report of the Web-Based Education Commission, headed by former Senator Bob Kerrey. This Commission noted that:       Current copyright law governing distance education . . .      was based on broadcast models of telecourses for distance      education. That law was not established with the virtual      classroom in mind, nor does it resolve emerging issues of      multimedia online, or provide a framework for permitting      digital transmissions.  This report further observed that ``This current state of affairs is confusing and frustrating for educators. . . . Concern about inadvertent copyright infringement appears, in many school districts, to limit the effective use of the Internet as an educational tool.'' In conclusion, the report concluded that our copyright laws were ``inappropriately restrictive.''  The TEACH Act makes three significant expansions in the distance learning exemption in our copyright law, while minimizing the additional risks to copyright owners that are inherent in exploiting works in a digital format. First, the bill eliminates the current eligibility requirements for the distance learning exemption that the instruction occur in a physical classroom or that special circumstances prevent the attendance of students in the classroom.  Second, the bill clarifies that the distance learning exemption covers the temporary copies necessarily made in networked servers in the course of transmitting material over the Internet.  Third, the current distance learning exemption only permits the transmission of the performance of ``non-dramatic literary or musical works,'' but does not allow the transmission of movies or videotapes, or the performance of plays. The Kerrey Commission report cited this limitation as an obstacle to distance learning in current copyright law and noted the following examples: A music instructor may play songs and other pieces of music in a classroom, but must seek permission from copyright holders in order to incorporate these works into an online version of the same class. A children's literature instructor may routinely display illustrations from childrens' books in the classroom, but must get licenses for each one for on online version of the course.  To alleviate this disparity, the TEACH Act would amend current law to allow educators to show limited portions of dramatic literary and musical works, audiovisual works, and sound recordings, in addition to the complete versions of nondramatic literary and musical works which are currently exempted.  This legislation is a balanced proposal that expands the educational useexemption in the copyright law for distance learning, but also contains a number of safeguards for copyright owners. In particular, the bill excludes from the exemption those works that are produced primarily for instructional use, because for such works, unlike entertainment products or materials of a general educational nature, the exemption could significantly cut into primary markets, impairing incentives to create. Indeed, the Web-Based Education Commission urged the development of ``high quality online educational content that meets the highest standards of educational excellence.'' Copyright protection can help provide the incentive for the development of such content.  In addition, the bill requires the use by distance educators of technological safeguards to ensure that the dissemination of material covered under the exemption is limited only to the students who are intended to receive it.  Finally, the TEACH Act directs the Copyright Office to conduct a study on the status of licensing for private and public school digital distance education programs and the use of copyrighted works in such programs, and to convene a conference to develop guidelines for the use of copyrighted works for digital distance education under the fair use doctrine and the educational use exemptions in the copyright law. Both the Copyright Office report and the Kerrey Commission noted dissatisfaction with the licensing process for digital copyrighted works. According to the Copyright Office, many educational institutions ``describe having experienced recurrent problems [that] . . . can be broken down into three categories: difficulty locating the copyright owner; inability to obtain a timely response; and unreasonable prices for other terms.'' Similarly, the Kerrey Commission report echoed the same concern. A study focusing on these licensing issues will hopefully prove fruitful and constructive for both publishers and educational institutions.  The Kerrey Commission report observed that ``[c]oncern about inadvertent copyright infringement appears, in many school districts, to limit the effective use of the Internet as an educational tool.'' For this reason, the Kerrey Commission report endorsed ``the U.S. Copyright Office proposal to convene education representatives and publisher stakeholders in order to build greater consensus and understanding of the `fair use' doctrine and its application in web-based education. The goal should be agreement on guidelines for the appropriate digital use of information and consensus on the licensing of content not covered by the fair use doctrine.'' The TEACH Act will provide the impetus for this process to begin.  I appreciate that, generally speaking, copyright owners believe that current copyright laws are adequate to enable and foster legitimate distance learning activities. As the Copyright Office report noted, copyright owners are concerned that ``broadening the exemption would result in the loss of opportunities to license works for use in digital distance education'' and would increase the ``risk of unauthorized downstream uses of their works posed by digital technology.'' Based upon its review of distance learning, however, the Copyright Office concluded that updating section 110(2) in the manner proposed in the TEACH Act is ``advisable.'' I agree. At the same time we have made efforts to address the valid concerns of both the copyright owners and the educational and library community, and look forward to working with all interested stakeholders as this legislation is considered by the Judiciary Committee and the Congress.  Distance education is an important issue to both the chairman and to me, and to the people of our States. I commend him for scheduling a hearing on this important legislation for next week.                          ____________________
