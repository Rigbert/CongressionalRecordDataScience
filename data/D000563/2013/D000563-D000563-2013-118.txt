People would call your office and say: I am at my wit's end. My health insurance company will not cover the problems my family faces. Can you make a call to an insurance executive? And we have. Almost to a person, Members of the House and Senate have done it, trying to advocate to get them to open coverage under a health insurance policy. That was the reality and, frankly, for many of these health insurance companies, any excuse would do. They would disqualify people on preexisting conditions because as an adolescent the insured had acne. Acne was deemed as a preexisting condition and subject to disqualification.  I see the Senator from Colorado is on the floor, and I want to yield time to him.  I thank my colleague from California for coming forward. I hope at some point the Republicans--who are so adamant about repealing and ending ObamaCare, as they call it, or the Affordable Care Act--would have one good idea on their own about providing affordable health insurance to the people across America. We all share that responsibility.  I yield the floor.
