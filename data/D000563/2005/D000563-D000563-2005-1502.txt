We could have approved four more judges for President Bush at the circuit level, moved forward on a bipartisan basis, and done it before lunch.  It was the decision on the Republican majority side that rather than bring this to a vote, bring it to closure, make progress, show we are working together on a bipartisan basis, instead they are going to continue to press for the so-called nuclear option so that Vice President Cheney can wipe away a 200-year tradition in the Senate with the wave of a hand. Unfortunately, that is a sad commentary on where we stand today.  I yield the floor.
