  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to hear one of my Republican colleagues precede me and talk about the impact of the debt, the growing deficit and the debt. I wish that the folks downtown were listening.  Dick Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney, has declared that deficits do not matter. In fact, he now wants to send the result of this growing mountain of debt to an undisclosed location by hiding the fact that the United States of America is about to exceed its $7.3 trillion debt limit. For the second time in Bush's brief 3\1/2\ years in office, Congress is going to have to increase the debt limit of the country, a burden that will be passed on for the next 30 to 50 years for future generations of Americans. Now they want to do it in a stealth manner, by attaching some vague language to a defense bill in the hope that they will not have to take a vote on the product of what they have created here, which is another couple of trillion dollars of debt for the American people.  They should at least have the courage and the honesty of their convictions and bring up the debt limit on the floor of the House and vote on it so people can see the product of their economic and tax policies, which is a mountain of debt for future generations.                          ____________________
