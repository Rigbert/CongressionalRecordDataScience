President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Clinton, to talk about an issue that demands our attention and action: the potential for a pandemic flu outbreak and, more importantly, what we can do about it.  Behind me I have a picture of a crowded emergency hospital at Fort Riley, KS, during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. That flu eventually took the lives of more than 600,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide. However, my colleagues may not be aware that the first human cases of the Spanish flu in the United States were discovered in my home State of Kansas at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, KS.  On the morning of March 11th, 1918, a company cook reported to the camp infirmary complaining about a bad cold. By noon, over 100 sick soldiers suffering the same bad cold also reported to the infirmary. These complaints of bad colds turned out to be the first cases of Spanish flu in America.  Within weeks, that influenza had spread to places as far away as Camps Hancock, Lewis, Sherman, and even to several hundred prisoners at San Quentin. By the summer, the flu reached around the globe, killing tens of thousands of people.  This flu was so severe and damaging that attack plans during World War I had to be altered or postponed because there were shortages of healthy men to battle. The Spanish flu continued to spread all throughout 1919. It reached its death toll of nearly 50 million people worldwide.  I yield to my distinguished colleague.
