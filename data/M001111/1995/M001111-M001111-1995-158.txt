  Let me just say that I agree with you. We need more people running for office in this country. We need the best and the brightest. It is indeed a sad note that people decide not to run, not to be here, simply because the daunting task of raising millions of dollars overwhelms them. That is not, to me, what this country is about or what democracy is about.  Until we reform the campaign finance laws and level the playing field, we are not going to get back to a point that allows everyone to be here and to speak out on the important issues of the day. I commend the Senator for the amendment, and I urge its adoption.
