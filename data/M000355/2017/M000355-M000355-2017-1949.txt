 President, at the beginning of this year, one of Louisville's foremost community servants began his much-deserved retirement. I rise today to congratulate Joseph Tolan, a man of distinction who dedicated his life to the people of Louisville and Kentucky.  Many years ago, I had the pleasure of working alongside Joe. When I served as the judge/executive of Jefferson County, Joe led the county department for human services. I particularly remember his passion for helping those around him, and that passion has been the driving force of his career. And believe me, I can tell you, from firsthand experience, that passion is contagious.  For the last 30 years, Joe has committed himself to the Metro United Way, a Louisville organization that raises and distributes funds to worthy causes around the region. Spending the last 15 years as president and CEO, Joe led the effort to raise nearly $30 million every year to support approximately 100 organizations. The community support that Joe inspired has led Metro United Way to be ranked in the top 25 markets nationwide.  However, organizations like Metro United Way are measured by so much more than just the donations they raise. True success is counted by the lives impacted and the good work done. With a focus on education, financial stability, and healthy living, Metro United Way impacts thousands of families across the region every single day.  Since joining Metro United Way, Joe has been a major player in the transformation of the city of Louisville and the entire region. Although the organization is over 100 years old, it is constantly adapting to meet today's challenges in the most effective ways possible. With this commitment to excellence and a growing network of strategic partnerships, Metro United Way proved to be a lasting force for good in the community. During his tenure as president and CEO, Joe hasn't just been a part of this innovation, he has been its leader.  Joe has surely earned his retirement, but I know many of us are very sorry to see him go. He leaves behind an impressive list of accomplishments and an organization well positioned to continue his work. I want to extend my congratulations to Joe on such a successful career of dedicated leadership always with a vision to help everyone reach their fullest potential.                          ____________________
