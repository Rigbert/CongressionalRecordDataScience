President, this is a case of Washington being Big Brother and telling each one of the States--whether it is Wyoming, Vermont, or Connecticut--what they must do. We have no idea how it will affect them. We do know it is going to cut off a lot of money to law enforcement because it is telling States, even though the State legislators have gone out for the year, they need to have a one-size-fits-all. There has not been a hearing on it. It is a feel-good amendment. It will hurt our States but, most importantly, it will hurt law enforcement.  If you wish to have a discussion on this subject, that is fine. Let's have a hearing. Let's find out what it is. To do this feel-good amendment and inform every one of our 50 States there is 2 minutes of debate, inform our 50 States we know better than they do and this is what they should do, makes no sense.  I oppose the amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
