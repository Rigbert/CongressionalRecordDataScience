Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge. Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant to construct a pilot demonstration Schoolyard Habitat site at Patuxent Research Refuge's National Wildlife Visitor Center.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refuges and other sites in five States and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateways Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge is receiving a grant of $14,457 and $14,795 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge will serve the dual purpose of improving the habitat quality surrounding the National Wildlife Visitor Center and educating the community on BayScaping techniques and Schoolyard Habitats. Volunteers and visitors will help create the project, involving themselves in a direct habitat restoration effort that can stimulate further involvement later. Watershed signs, a walking path, an outdoor classroom, and an indoor kiosk will be used to interpret the habitat site and how it and similar efforts contribute to the Chesapeake Bay's health.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Friends of the Patuxent Research Refuge on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
