 President, community development financial institutions [CDFI] play an important role in my home State, and I join my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, in expressing my strong support for the CDFI fund.  Community Development Financial Institutions are essential to serving communities that often find it difficult to cultivate financial support. CDFI's prove that private sector, locally controlled financial institutions can combine rigorous fiscal management with a commitment to improving communities by offering capital access along with related training and technical services when other institutions may not. CDFI's provide capital to distressed communities, as well as increase the number of joint venture loans between Federal, State, and private entities.  Mr. President, Cascadia Revolving Fund, of Seattle, is a prime example of how CDFI's can complement traditional financial institutions. Cascadia is a nonprofit community development loan fund which makes loans and provides technical assistance to low-income, minority- and women-owned businesses in addition to businesses in economically distressed areas. Over the past 10 years, Cascadia has lent over $3 million, and 90 percent of the businesses they have assisted are still in business today.  The Community Development Banking Act of 1994, which created the CDFI fund, received broad bipartisan support in the 103d Congress. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously, and was approved by a 410 to 12 vote in the House. Today, there are roughly 310 CDFI's operating in 45 States that manage more than $1 billion in primarily private sector money.  Mr. President, it would be a shame to terminate this program designed to revitalize economically distressed communities before even giving it a chance to succeed. If the Senate has the opportunity to revisit this bill during the appropriations process, I urge my colleagues to restore funding to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.
