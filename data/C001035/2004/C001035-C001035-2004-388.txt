I was saying the NID does not run the day-to-day, daily operations of the NSA, for example.  Mr. DeWINE. And I appreciate that. But in direct response to my question, the Senator is saying that person could, in fact, make that command decision, pick up the phone and say, ``We are moving 50 people,'' and that would be done, and that would be it. I want to make sure on the record because I think it is going to be very important 2 years from now or 18 months from now, and I would hate for the NID person to come before our committee and say: ``I can't move people around.''
