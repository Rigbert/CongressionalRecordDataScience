 President, 2\1/2\ years ago a Democratic President teamed up with a Democratically led Congress to force a piece of legislation on the American people they never asked for and that has turned out to be just as disastrous as many of us predicted. Amid economic recession, a spiraling Federal debt, and accelerated increases in government health spending, they proposed a bill that made all those problems worse.  Americans were promised lower health care costs, and they are going up. Americans were promised lower premiums, and they are going up. Most Americans were promised their taxes wouldn't change, and they are going up. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected. It was raided to pay for a new entitlement instead. Americans were promised it would create jobs.
