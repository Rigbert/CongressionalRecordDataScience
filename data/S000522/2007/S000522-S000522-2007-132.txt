Madam Speaker, this morning the Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing in anticipation of the reauthorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I concur on the importance of examining the extraordinary successes of this program, as well as the means by which we can ensure that it continues to meet the needs of those impacted by the pandemic.  In my travels abroad, particularly in Africa and Vietnam, I have seen for myself how the intervention has transformed lives and infused hope in individuals, families and communities affected by HIV/AIDS. One experience that struck me, in particular, was in Uganda when I visited there last year. I had the privilege of meeting Mr. John Robert Ongole, who is 29 years old and the first person to benefit from the first treatment program funded by PEPFAR. I was told that when he first started receiving the anti-retroviral therapy, he looked like a walking skeleton. When I met him, he was healthy and energetic, leading an active life and caring for his family. I have recently learned that he has almost completed his bachelor's degree in teaching. He and countless others have expressed their profound gratitude to President Bush and the American people for giving them a new lease on life in the face of this devastating disease.  Perhaps the most controversial aspect of PEPFAR here in Congress is the requirement that one-third of prevention funding be expended on abstinence and fidelity programs, known as the A and B aspects of the ABC (abstinence, be faithful and condoms) prevention model. Some have called for the removal of this requirement in favor of an evidence-based approach, free from legislative constraints, that takes into account the particular situation of the individual country. What these people fail to take into account is that the ABC model is evidence-based, and those countries with generalized epidemics that have experienced declines in prevalence have emphasized behaviors of abstinence, and fidelity in relationships between un-infected partners.  In a statement published in 2004 in the prestigious scientific journal, The Lancet, over 160 scientists and the President of Uganda noted that ``when targeting young people, for those who have not started sexual activity, the first priority should be to encourage abstinence or delay of sexual onset, hence emphasizing risk avoidance as the best way to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections as well as unwanted pregnancies. After sexual debut, returning to abstinence or being mutually faithful with an uninfected partner are the most effective ways of avoiding infection.''  In the past, even those considered ``experts'' on the ground have resisted implementing the ABC strategy with the proper emphasis on A and B, and so the spending requirement was necessary. I have met representatives of USAID who acknowledged that they were initially skeptical of the possibility of changing people's behavior as a key elementof HIV/AIDS prevention, but due to their experience of implementing the PEPFAR abstinence and fidelity programs they had become convinced of their efficacy.  I would strongly encourage my fellow Members to examine the growing evidence regarding the success of the ABC model in HIV/AIDS prevention. It is, fundamentally, a matter of life and death.                          ____________________
