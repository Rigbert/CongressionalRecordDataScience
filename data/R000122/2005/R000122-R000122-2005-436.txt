President, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the Energy Policy Act of 2005, H.R. 6. While I did not support the bill for several reasons, I do acknowledge that the bill is, in many respects, better than the bill the Senate rejected in 2003. I am pleased, for example, that the bill we are sending to conference does more to address the reliability of our electricity grid, contains a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard for electricity production, and does not include an unnecessary liability waiver for the MTBE industry.  We all agree that reliable, affordable energy is critical to the economic well being of our Nation. And increasingly, our Nation's energy policy is central to our national security. As I considered how to vote on the energy bill, I asked myself three questions. First, would this bill take meaningful action to reduce our dependence on foreign oil? Second, would the bill enhance homeland security? And third, is this $48 billion bill fiscally responsible and does it set the right priorities for our Nation?  As for the first question, unfortunately, I find that this bill does not do nearly enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Oil prices have recently soared to around $60 a barrel, a level that, even when adjusted for inflation, has not been seen in over 15 years. Imports of foreign oil are draining valuable economic resources out of our communities and Nation.
