Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate your ability to pronounce the name of my good friend from American Samoa.  This legislation, H.R. 3048, introduced by myself, ratifies a land settlement at Russian River on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska.  Section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act authorized ANCSA corporations to make selections of cultural sites within their region.  Cook Inlet Region, Inc., selected historical sites and cemetery sites 26 years ago. Initially, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Service, which jointly managed the land at issue, contested CIRI's selections. Not only is the area surrounding the confluence of the Russian and Kenai Rivers rich in archeological and cultural features, but it is also the site of perhaps the most heavily used public sports fishery in Alaska.  For the past 3 years, CIRI has been negotiating with Fish and Wildlife and the Forest Service for lands surrounding the confluence of the Russian and Kenai Rivers. On July 26, 2001, all three parties reached an agreement which allows the public to maintain the right to fish the waters at the confluence of the two rivers. Without Federal legislation, this agreement could not be ratified. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
