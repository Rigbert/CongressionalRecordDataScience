President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader. I thank him for his statement. I also wish to commend him for the work he has done, both he and the distinguished deputy leader, in trying to bring us to this point. I know how hard the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee, has worked to pass a bill. I have been proud to work with him.  I was encouraged this week that the majority leader and other Senate Republicans moved in our direction--a good direction--by recognizing that we need a solution to the problems posed by having millions of undocumentedimmigrants inside our borders. Many of us believe that immigration reform, to have any chance to succeed, needs to be comprehensive, with strong enforcement of border security matched with fair and effective steps to bring millions of hard-working people out of the shadows and provide them a path to citizenship and a full measure of America's promise.
