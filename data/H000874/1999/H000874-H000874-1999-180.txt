Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding and concur with the chairman.  Obviously, this is now, as the gentleman from Illinois has pointed out, the policy. What we need to ensure is that the policy is being followed so that no American or no foreign visitor is subjected to unwarranted and inappropriate processing by Customs or searches by Customs.  I appreciate the gentleman raising this issue and look forward to working with him on it.
