  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, that was an interesting speech, but it defies reality. If the government eliminated every general fund program, everything the government does except the Department of Defense, guess what? We would still have a deficit. We would still be borrowing money.  The Republicans are borrowing $1.2 billion a day to run the government, and now they are the party of fiscal responsibility, and, oh, it is those poor working people they are concerned about. Except what they do not talk about is the tax cuts they are talking about, the ones that would cost $70 billion and increase the deficit, flow predominantly to people who earn over $300,000 a year, mostly over $1 million a year, and to estates worth more than $6 million. That is the hard-working families they are worried about, one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in America.  Well, I am worried about the rest of America who are getting screwed by these kinds of priorities.                          ____________________[Page H9109]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   WORRYING ABOUT THE REST OF AMERICA  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
