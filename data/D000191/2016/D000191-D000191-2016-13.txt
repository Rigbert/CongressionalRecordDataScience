ROUZER. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I am puzzled because, again, I have been on segments of the Intracoastal Waterway, which I guess he is saying are all declared to be Federal waters where there are no-wake zones. So I don't know what the issue is. I would be happy to work with the gentleman on this, and I am not going to object to the amendment at this point.
