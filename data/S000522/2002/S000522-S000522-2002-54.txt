Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Houses of Worship Political Speech Act, introduced by my good friend, Walter Jones. For too long, the separation of church and state has been tilted too far towards one extreme and has restricted the free speech rights of religious communities in America. HR 2357 attempts to restore balance and reasonableness by amending the Internal Revenue Code to permit churches and other houses of worship to fully participate in the democratic political process.  I believe that the First Amendment's prohibition against the establishment of an official religion akin to the Church of England in the UK was never meant to mean that communities of faith were barred from a robust participation in all aspects of our nation's political life. America's system is weaker and less representative when important voices are excluded from the political dimension.  Prior to 1954, pastors and religious leaders spoke freely about candidates and political issues that directly affected the interests of their congregations. The anti-slavery and abolitionist organizations and the civil rights movement are examples of church-inspired political agents of change in our society. In fact, churches played a central role in dismantling the Jim Crow laws that so egregiously violated the civil rights of African Americans. Our society would have been much worse off if historically black churches and clergy were prohibited from sermonizing or distributing materials.  The origins of current law, which this bill seeks to correct, are very instructive. In 1954, Senator Lyndon Johnson added language to pending tax legislation to prevent two non-profit groups that opposed him in 1948 from speaking out against him in his 1954 re-election.  The vexing perception is that the IRS is empowered with sweeping powers to strip a church's tax-exempt status if clergymen express particular views on a candidate. That is clearly wrong and the framers of the Constitution would be appalled at this abuse of power. Priests, pastors, rabbis, or any religious leader should not be bullied into silence by the IRS.  LBJ's capricious and punitive tax proviso has been used in an arbitrary manner to silence political speech in America's houses of worship. The Church at Pierce Creek in Vestal, New York, for example, came under IRS' sanction when it published an ``open letter'' to then-candidate Bill Clinton in 1992. The church took issue with Mr. Clinton's stances on several compelling moral issues. Even though the church leadership cited biblical passages to buttress its argument, the IRS revoked its tax-exempt status in 1995.  The American Center for law and Justice, which represented the Church at Pierce Creek, has subsequently documented more than 500 instances where candidates had appeared before churches. Yet no enforcement action was taken in those cases perhaps suggesting a double standard. Mr. Speaker, I ask that these instances be made a part of the record.  Approximately two years ago, former President Bill Clinton stood in the pulpit of the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia--just a few miles from this building--and openly urged parishioners to vote for then-Senator Chuck Robb and Vice President Al Gore.  Mr. Speaker, why is it permissible for Bill Clinton to make partisan speeches in churches, while other church leaders are gagged if they critique Bill Clinton?  In a national poll conducted this summer by The Poling Company, 84 percent of men, and 77 percent of women agreed that the First Amendment should protect religious leaders from being penalized for political speech.  I want to remind my colleagues that the separation of church and state stemmed from Americans' desire to have church and state operate independently from one another, in order to avoid the establishment of a state church. The affairs of states however often compare with, contradict or comply with the moral imperatives found in Holy Writ.  Nothing in this legislation demands that a church get involved in the political dialogue of our nation. Issues of war and peace and other important issues shouldn't be the exclusive preserve of the political elite. The Jones bill would simply allow them that opportunity should they choose to speak about those matters, without the coercive power of government putting their tax-exempt status at risk.
