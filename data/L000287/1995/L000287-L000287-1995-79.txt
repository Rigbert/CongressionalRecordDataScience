Let me just thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from the State of Georgia, Cynthia McKinney, for participating in this special order tonight. I appreciate your help and all of your support. I think we have a moral obligation, a mandate, and a mission as Members of this body to do what we can to increase the political participation of all of our citizens. Open the process up, let everybody come in.  Ms. McKinney. The gentleman knows that I have long admired his work and his advocacy on behalf of the American people and the American democracy.  Just a word about the nature of this discourse tonight: This is not about Democrat or Republican. This is about the American people and enhancing and fine-tuning our democracy. We do have, we are blessed in this country to have the most perfect democracy on the face of the Earth. Yet it can still be a whole lot better. Motor voter is but one tool to get us there, and I appreciate the gentleman and his strong leadership and advocacy. You know you have my support every step of the way.
