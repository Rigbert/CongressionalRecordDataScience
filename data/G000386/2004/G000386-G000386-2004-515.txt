 President, I associate myself with the remarks the distinguished assistant Democratic leader just made about the highway bill. It is one of the most important jobs bills we can have before the Senate this year. It should have been done last year. We couldn't get it done. But we can do that now and the Senate is committed to that. I think the leadership in the House is committed to it. Obviously, we need to get it done.  I thank the Senator from Nevada.                          ____________________
