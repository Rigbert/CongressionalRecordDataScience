 President, the scientific community tells us very clearly that if we are going to reverse climate change and the great dangers it poses for our country and the planet, we must move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  This amendment would provide a 15-percent rebate to homeowners so that we could install 10 million new solar rooftops across the country within 10 years. This would result in enough new electrical generation to retire nearly 20 percent of our dirty coal-fired plants and create a significant number of new jobs.  So if we are interested in reversing the dangers of climate change and creating jobs, I would urge Senators to support this amendment.
