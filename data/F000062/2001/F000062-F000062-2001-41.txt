 President, as I mentioned, this bill took a good deal of good staff work. I am very proud that good staff work has occurred on both sides of the aisle. It is not easy to remedy 170 differences between a House and Senate bill, and yet this happened.  I particularly commend the appropriations staff, Christina Evans, B.G. Wright, on the Republican side; Sid Ashworth, John Kem, and also MattMiller of my staff.
