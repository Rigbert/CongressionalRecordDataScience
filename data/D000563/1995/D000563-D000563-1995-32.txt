Our Government is shut down. We are now in a governmental paralysis here in Washington.  And why? It is a politically created crisis. It is not a crisis that came because of the force of nature. It is something that was created by the force of politicians.  The Gingrich-led Congress has brought to us in the last year a record of mismanagement. They brought the Contract With America to the floor, 31 bills, and they published them in the TV Guide. Three of the thirty-one were signed into law, and we wasted 100 days that could have been spent on making certain that Congress did its work, and then, of course, the Gingrich-led Congress failed to meet its responsibilities.  They were required under law to produce 13 appropriations bills for the President's signature by October 1. How many were presented? Three. Three of thirteen. If they had done their job and presented the bills, we would not be in this crisis today.  Let me add, too, that during this year, with the Gingrich-led Congress, we have seen special interests swarming through the Halls of Capitol Hill. They have been pushing for amendments, outrageous amendments.  Let me give an example of some. First, to cut education. The banking interests came in and forced a change which will increase the costs of student loans by $10 billion. Kids from working families trying to get an education, trying to make it, will face more debt because the Gingrich-led Republicans have bowed to the banking interests.  Then, of course, there is the environmental agenda of the Gingrich Congress. Amazing. Amazing that in one bill, in 28 pages, they wanted to repeal 14 different environmental protection laws, including the right of the Federal Government to monitor arsenic in drinking water. ``Did he say arsenic in drinking water?'' Yes, that was one of the bills that they wanted to repeal.  Think about that for a second, the extremism of the Gingrich-led environmental agenda.  But one of the worst, of course, is their proposal to increase Medicare premiums on seniors by 25 percent. They want to cut Medicare to balance the budget.  We all know that changes must be made in Medicare so it will be preserved and strong for years to come. But the Gingrich Republicans have just gone too far. It has been unfortunately, under the Gingrich leadership, a time of crises and chaos.  But no surprise. Listen to the Speaker on the Sunday morning talk shows, and I quote him, ``I will cooperate, but I will never compromise.'' Those are not the words of a person who sits down at a negotiating table looking for a solution. That is the kind of growling and grousing and political rhetoric that most people are sick and tired of.  I have a proposal to change this and end this crisis immediately. It is called no budget, no pay. We are sending 800,000 Federal workers home today without pay. But guess what, Members of Congress still get their paycheck. So I introduced a bill on September 22 that said if Members of Congress do not keep Government running, default on the national debt, then, frankly, they do not get their paychecks. If we turned off the TV cameras and stopped the congressional paychecks, I predict this crisis would be over in 15 minutes.                          ____________________
