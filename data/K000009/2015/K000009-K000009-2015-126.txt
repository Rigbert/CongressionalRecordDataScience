 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  I first want to invite the gentleman from Alabama to Ohio to see part of the new energy sector in our country. It is absolutely incredible, and it does involve high-level research to produce new energy technologies. I support nuclear, and I support fossil-based research, but I also support coal and tidal energy and wind and biofuels and geothermal--all of them--because we need them.  New investment in clean energy in our country in 2013 totaled $36.7 billion. The leading company in solar in our country and, frankly, globally is a U.S.-born company--born in Ohio--called First Solar. You mentioned nonproductivity. Their stock is sold on Wall Street. They benefited early on in that company's life by photovoltaic research beginning back in the 1970s and 1980s at the U.S. Department of Energy. It is really incredible to see the future being born, and I am hoping Alabama can take advantage of that kind of technology.  What concerns me, and one of the reasons I am on my feet at this point, is that they have competition from China. The first and second companies in the world that are being subsidized by the Chinese Government are in tough competition with the U.S.-born company, and we can't ignore the fact that global venture capital and private equity in new investment in clean energy increased from $1.4 billion in 2004 to $4.4 billion in 2013. The question is: Where is that going to be invested--in our country or someplace else?                              {time}  2315  So I would just say that we have made tremendous progress in an all-of-the-above strategy. Renewable sources now account for 23 percent of all electricity generation globally. That is amazing progress. We are learning how to work in conjunction with the Earth.  Who would ever have guessed that ethanol would now consume 10 percent of what you put in your tank? People said you can't even get to 1 percent. Now they are looking to 15 percent. It is unbelievable what is happening in these fields.  I appreciate the gentleman wanting to be responsible. I think we are being responsible in providing an all-of-the-above bill, including new energy technologies that will help our country in future generations so we no longer have to be dependent on imported energy, which I view as our chief strategic vulnerability.  I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment.
