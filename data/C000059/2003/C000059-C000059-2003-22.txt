Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1284, introduced by my colleague and friend, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano), increases the authorized Federal cost ceilings for the San Gabriel Basin demonstration project by $12.5 million. Local project sponsors have expressed a desire to expand the demonstration program, which treats contaminated groundwater and then delivers the effluent to nearby localities to justify the Federal cost ceiling increase.  This bill will help lessen Southern California's dependence on foreign water and project groundwater quality. It is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
