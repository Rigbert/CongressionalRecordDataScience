 President, the Lieberman amendment, upon which we are about to vote, doubles aid to North Korea from last year's level from $13 million to $25 million. I expect a lot of Senators did not even know we were providing aid to North Korea. To provide this aid, President Clinton will have to say the fact that North Korea is a terrorist state doesn't matter.  In addition, we know under the current agreement that the North has diverted oil, and nothing in this amendment will prevent that from continuing to happen.  Finally, let me say, Mr. President, the House is strongly opposed to an increase from $13 to $25 million, which is encompassed in this amendment, and this is going to be an extraordinarily difficult position to sustain in conference, even if this amendment is approved.  I hope that my colleagues will not approve this amendment.
