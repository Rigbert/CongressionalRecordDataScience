I am pleased to be here to support this block of amendments. As the chairman noted, we are on the verge of passage of the legislation. Then we will be able to move forward and address other issues.  I thank the chairman for his cooperation and his great leadership.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.
