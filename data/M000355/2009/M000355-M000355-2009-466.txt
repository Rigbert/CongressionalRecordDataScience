 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine Louisville product that is recognizable around the world and to the wonderful company behind it that is still knocking it out of the park after 125 years. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., makers of the famous Louisville Slugger, has made over 100 million bats since 1884.  Legend has it that the company's first bat was made by 17-year-old John A. ``Bud'' Hillerich in his father, J.F. Hillerich's, woodworking shop, after local baseball star Pete Browning broke his bat. Bud invited him to the shop and handcrafted a new one on a steam-powered lathe.  The next day, after Browning got three hits in three at bats, baseball players from all over the region began to visit the Hillerich shop. From this, the Louisville Slugger was born.  The company has remained family owned for five generations, and in that time has become the most iconic brand in the game of baseball. Players from T-ball to the Major Leagues all have used Louisville Sluggers, including such greats as Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, and Babe Ruth. Ruth personally gave bat makers at the company specifications for the Louisville Slugger bats he would use to hit his record 60 home runs.  In 1996, after operating elsewhere, Louisville Slugger baseball bats came home to Louisville, as Hillerich & Bradsby Co. placed their executive offices, wood bat plant, and a museum in downtown Louisville, just 10 blocks away from where Bud Hillerich made the first Louisville Slugger in 1884. The Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is now one of the major tourist attractions of Louisville, with more than 2 million visitors since its opening.  If any of my colleagues happen to be in Louisville, my hometown, and want to visit the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, it is very easy to find. Just look for the 120-foot-long giant Louisville Slugger bat that marks the building's entrance. Every kid in town knows where to find the world's biggest bat and knows it marks the spot where you can tour the factory and actually see a Louisville Slugger being made. Today, Hillerich & Bradsby Co. manufactures more than 1 million wood bats a year, as well as aluminum bats, for professional and amateur use.  For millions of fans, the word ``Louisville'' will always evoke the satisfying crack of a bat and the celebration of a home run. This is thanks to the Louisville Slugger. The 2009 baseball season marks the Louisville Slugger's 125th anniversary, and I know all my colleagues join me in congratulating Hillerich & Bradsby Co. for 125 years of success in baseball, our national pastime.                          ____________________
