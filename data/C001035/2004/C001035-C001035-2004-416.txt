President, Senator Coleman has offered an amendment that would strike the language in our bill that merges the Homeland Security Council into the National Security Council. I note that the administration yesterday in its Statement of Administration Policy, in which it endorsed passage of our legislation, expressed considerable concern about the provisions that would reorganize the President's internal policy staff by merging the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council. The administration feels strongly that Congress should not legislate and make permanent the internal organization of the President's own executive offices or otherwise limit the flexibility needed to respond quickly to threats or attacks.  In looking further at this issue, I agree with the concerns raised by the administration. Senator Coleman's amendment striking the merger of those two councils within the Executive Office of the President is acceptable to me.  That is what his amendment would accomplish. I believe the amendment has been cleared on both sides and I urge its passage.
