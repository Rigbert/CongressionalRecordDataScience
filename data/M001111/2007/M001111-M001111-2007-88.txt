 President, Members were notified last night the vote would begin at 9:30. We have no additional debate at this time.  If the Senator from North Carolina has nothing to add, we are going to put in a quorum call until 9:30--unless he wishes to make any additional comments?  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I think I needed to ask for the yeas and nays, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
