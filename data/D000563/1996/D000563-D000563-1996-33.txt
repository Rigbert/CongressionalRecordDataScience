Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentleman that I will reserve all the rhetoric necessary in order to achieve theresults that we are talking about today.  I would just like to say in closing, and I think the gentleman has indicated that he is going to be supportive of this amendment, that we have several things that should be taken into consideration.  There are responsible businesses in this country which support community right-to-know. There are responsible businesses in this country which support the Toxic Release Inventory. When one can have the head of Dow Chemical Co. say of this law that mandatory disclosure has done more than all other legislation put together in getting companies to voluntarily reduce emissions of toxic chemicals, we know this program works. This program should be funded.  We also have comments from Monsanto, and this is an interesting comment: The law is having an incredible effect on industries to reduce emissions. There is not a chief executive officer around who wants to be the biggest polluter in his State. We know that if disclosure is out there, it works.  I hope that my colleague from California and my colleague from Ohio will not only agree to this amendment, but also do their best to preserve this when it comes to conference. This is an important program, important not only for the EPA, but more important for families and for the workers and for the communities who rely upon it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Olver].  (
