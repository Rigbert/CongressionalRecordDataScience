 I would like to read a brief quote from the California State Floral Association.       While our state decision makers have devoted most of their      attention to the supply and cost of electrical energy, it is      the high cost of natural gas that is of the greatest concern      to our grower members. They have seen their natural gas bills      increase by five to six fold. For example, one of our      nurseries reports having their monthly gas bills increase      from $26,000 in December of 1999 to $145,000 in January of      2001. This is fairly typical of the industry.  I have a letter from the H.K. Canning company which states that they are going to be forced out of business because of the high costs of energy today in California.  I ask unanimous consent that both of those letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  California State                                           Floral Association,                                 Sacramento, CA, February 5, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The California State Floral      Association represents retail florists, wholesale florists      and cut flower growers in California. We are very concerned      about the impacts the current energy crisis is having on our      members. Of particular concern is the skyrocketing natural      gas price as well as recent concern over natural gas      availability and the possibility that gas customers including      nurseries will have their gas service curtailed.       The energy crisis in California will have major economic      ramifications on the state. We know you understand the      seriousness of this situation. The unstable supply of all      energy resources and the escalating costs of natural gas,      diesel, propane and electricity have placed enormous new      economic burdens on our industry. Our product is highly      perishable and power outages can cause significant losses in      a very short period of time. We have a very real concern that      many of our members may be forced out of business. We face      economic losses from the grower through the marketing chain      to the retail florist.       While our state decision makers have devoted most of their      attention to the supply and cost of electrical energy, it is      the high cost of natural gas that is of the greatest concern      to our grower members. They have seen their natural gas bills      increase by five to six fold. For example, one of our      nurseries reports having their monthly gas bills increase      from $26,000 in December of 1999 to $145,000 in January of      2001. Other nurseries report similar increases in the cost of      natural gas. Since farmers are price takers not price makers,      these costs cannot be passed on. Some growers have reduced      production, laid off employees and had to reduce employee      benefits just to stay in business.       The flower industry is an important contributor to the      agricultural revenues of this state. Cut flowers account for      over $300 million dollars in farm gate revenues and all      ornamentals total over $700 million statewide. California is      also the number one flower producing state in the country.      Yet the future of the cut flower industry is not bright.       We know that many in our nation's Capitol believe our      energy crisis to be a ``California Problem'' and that it      should be remedied through state action. While there may be      some validity to this view with regard to the shortage of      electrical energy, we believe this to be a grossly inaccurate      perspective relative to the natural gas crisis in our state.      The problem of natural gas availability and manipulative      pricing needs to be dealt with at the federal level.       In light of the above, we urge you to do everything in your      power to get the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC)      to act immediately to stop the predatory gas pricing      practices being perpetrated against California consumers.      FERC has the ability to mitigate the anti-competitive      conditions that exist in the marketing and delivery of      natural gas. As we understand it, they have the opportunity      to do this through two cases pending before them brought by      two of our utilities. They have the responsibility to take      such action under their charge as an oversight commission and      the statutory authority under which they operate. And they      need to take such action soon or many flower growers will not      survive this crisis.       We desperately need your assistance in this time of great      need. Please make this issue your highest priority. We thank      you in     advance for any help you can provide and are awaiting your      response. Please do not hesitate to call on us for specific      information and assistance.           Very respectfully yours,                                                       Jim Relles,     President.                                  ____                                           H.K. Canning, Inc.,                                    Ventura, CA, February 1, 2001.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: My wife and I are owners of a small      food processing cannery plant in Southern California called      H. K. Canning, Inc. We have 81 employees with families that      in total represent approximately 350 people. We all need your      help desperately.       We purchase Natural Gas to power our steam boiler for      processing soups and vegetables. The attached cost summary      shows that for the last five years our volume of BTUs has      remained constant along with the cost for these BTUs.      However, until recently, our Natural Gas bill has risen seven      (7) times over previous months without using any additional      BTUs.       This is going to force us out of business! Profit margins      in the food processing business are very tight, as we are all      aware of what happened to Tri-Valley Growers in Stockton, CA.      We have also seen our Worker's Compensation costs triple      since 1999 with no cost control implementation. California is      in trouble. We are in trouble and the government is moving to      slow!!!       We, and our employees, need your help now.           Sincerely,                                                     Henry Knaust,                                                        President.       Enclosure.                                H.K.
