President, on April 14, the Government of France will present the National Order of the Legion of Honor to Edgar Peara one of Oregon's more modest heroes.  The Ordre national de la Legion d'honneur was established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a way of recognizing exceptional merit regardless of rank, class, or privilege. The Order remains the highest decoration in France and is being bestowed upon Edgar for his service in that country during World War II.  Already highly decorated by the United States for bravery and valor, Edgar's story is indeed remarkable and worthy of high praise. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Edgar immediately volunteered for the military. At first he was told he would be more valuable to the Nation if he returned to his engineer studies, but the call to action was too strong. By June 1942 he received a commission in the U.S. Army and was assigned as an officer in the 531 Amphibious Combat Regiment of the 1st Engineer Amphibious Combat Brigade.  His unit specialized in supporting large amphibious invasions, clearing the way for the infantry and keeping the Army on the move. By November 1942, Edgar's outfit landed in Arzew, Algeria, where Edgar, determined to keep the situation as calm as possible, went from house to house telling anxious Algerians unfamiliar with war or Americans that ``we come in peace. We are not here to harm anyone. We simply want you to surrender any weapons so that all armed resistance ceases.'' He said later that ``No one gave us any trouble and we collected so many arms we could hardly carry them all.''  This action set the tone for Edgar's entire war experience and his later life. As he prepared for the invasion of Italy, Edgar made a conscious effort to look for, and be grateful for, whatever there was to be appreciated that day, whether it was food, a dry place to sleep, reasonable weather, the friendships of comrades, and being well and safe. As Edgar put it, ``That change in attitude helped make me a happier person, for I stopped thinking that my contentment had to lie in the future when the war was over.''  After participating in the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy, Edgar was moved to the southwest coast of England in order to help ready allied forces for D-day. He landed at Utah Beach on the upper French coast on June 6, 1944. Early that morning he noticed a battalion medical aid station was under intense fire. Recognizing the danger to those helpless soldiers, he scrambled to find a more protected area. He came across an abandoned German concrete underground command post. Dodging bullets and shells, he ran back to help move the wounded to safety.  Edgar would later be part of the invasion of Okinawa, Japan, making him one of the few veterans to serve in Africa, Europe, and the Pacific.  Taking what he learned from his experiences in war, Edgar dedicated himself to a life of internal peace and became a staunch advocate of greater peace for all humanity. He used his GI Bill to train for ordination as a Christian Science practitioner. During the Korean war, Edgar served as a Christian Science chaplain at the U.S. Naval Training Center, Great Lakes, IL. After this duty he went on to become a Unitarian Universalist minister. Edgar has worked diligently to help others find the same peace he discovered in his own heart and to help all mankind achieve greater peace between neighbors and nations.  As an Oregonian, I could not be more proud of Edgar, his wonderful story, and his life's work. He truly is a hero and embodies the best of our State. As our Nation continues to struggle in conflicts overseas, Edgar serves as a testament to the belief that sometime restraint is as powerful as force in times of war. I am very appreciative of Edgar's selfless service.The people of France are thanking him today with this award. Oregon thanks him for continuing to make us proud.                          ____________________
