Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 6847, the Preventing Child Exploitation Act, which includes a reauthorization of key provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. As the original sponsor of the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, I have made a point to seek remedies to prevent the sexual exploitation of our nation's children. This law strengthened sex offender registry requirements and enforcement across the country, extended registry requirements to Indian tribes, increased penalties for child predators, and authorized funding for a number of programs to strengthen our defenses against child exploitation.  A primary component of the law is the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (``SORNA''), which set minimum guidelines for state sex offender registries. SORNA also established the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public of sex offenders. Currently, this registry contains information on more than 600,000 convicted sex offenders in the United States.  But, as several widely-publicized scandals have shown, the fight against child exploitation is not over. The Justice Department reports that only 16 states, three territories, and 36 tribes have substantially implemented SORNA, despite a July 27, 2011 deadline for reaching substantial compliance. There are also an estimated 100,000 fugitive sex offenders across the United States who are unregistered or otherwise noncompliant with their registry requirements.  H.R. 6847 includes a five year reauthorization of the two primary programs of the Adam Walsh Act. These include the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program, which provides funding to the states, tribes and other jurisdictions to offset the costs of implementing and enhancing SORNA, and funding for the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies to assist jurisdictions in locating and apprehending sex offenders who violate registration requirements. The bill also reauthorizes grants for the treatment of juvenile sex offenders, as well as funding for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (``NCMEC''), a Congressionally-authorized not-for-profit corporation that provides resources for families and law enforcement officials to assist in the recovery of missing children and prevent the victimization of children.  By incorporating feedback from the states, the bill makes targeted changes to the SORNA requirements in order to facilitate the states' compliance with the Act. These changes include giving the States more flexibility in classifying sex offenders on their registry, lowering the period that certain juveniles must register to 25 years, and limiting public access to juvenile sex offender information.                          ____________________
