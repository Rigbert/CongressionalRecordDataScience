 The Indian Health Service and the University of Washington have been conducting research into Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with funds provided in the Interior Appropriations bill. I want to thank the Chairman and Senator Dorgan for the Subcommittee's continued support for these research efforts. I hope to work with the Senators in conference related to this on-going research.
