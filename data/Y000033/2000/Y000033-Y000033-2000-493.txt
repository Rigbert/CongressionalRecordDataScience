Mr. Speaker, we hope that we will have a vehicle that the gentleman can do it, in fact the bill itself in the near future. I can assure the gentleman that we are well aware of this issue. I will suggest one other thing. It will be taken ahead of the next dove season. I can assure the gentleman from Alabama of that.
