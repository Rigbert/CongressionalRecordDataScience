Speaker, as we celebrate the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, reminds us that we must continually work to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District were recognized during the 33rd Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast on Saturday, January 14, 2012, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Frontiers Service Club, which was founded in 1952, sponsors this annual breakfast.  This year, the Gary Frontiers Service Club paid tribute to several local individuals who have for decades unselfishly contributed to improving the quality of life for the people of Gary. Mayor Rudolph Clay was honored with the prestigious Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award for 2012. The individuals recognized as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast included: Attorney Arlene D. Colvin, Mr. Richard (Chappy) Woods, Pastor Dwight A. Gardner, Ms. Sandra Jean Irons, Colonel (Retired) Richard D. Ligon, and Bishop E. Bobby Warren. Yolkfellow James Piggee was selected as the 2011 Frontier of the Year. In addition, the club also inducted its first Honorary Member, Reverend Pharis D. Evans, Pastor of Clark Road Baptist Church in Gary, for his many years of service to the Gary Frontiers Service Club. Though very different in nature, the achievement of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and faced them with unwavering strength and determination. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' They set goals and work selflessly to make them a reality.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast Chairman Clorius L. Lay and the Gary Frontiers Service Club officers: President Oliver J. Gilliam, Vice President Sean Jones, 1st Vice President James Piggee, Recording Secretary Melvin Ward, Financial Secretary Sam Frazier, Corresponding Secretary Ferba Hines and Treasurer/Seventh District Director Floyd Donaldson, as well as the honorees and all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination, and dedication to serving the people of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
