President, no matter how each of us viewed the evidence in this case and no matter how each of us voted, we all share common relief that the impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton is concluding. In many respects, this was uncharted territory for us. We all felt the weight of history and precedent as we made our decisions on how to proceed.  With this in mind, the procedures developed and followed for the three depositions taken during the course of this trial should be made a part of the record of this impeachment trial. Unfortunately, the complete depositions were not introduced into evidence and made a part of the Senate trial record until after the vote on the Articles themselves. Instead, at the request of the House Managers, the only parts introduced into evidence before then were those ``from the point that each witness is sworn to testify under oath to the end of any direct response to the last question posed by a party.'' (Cong. Rec., Jan. 4, 1999, p. S1209).  I served as one of the six Presiding Officers at the depositions and attended all of them. In particular, I wish to thank Senators Dodd and Edwards for serving with me, and Senator DeWine with whom I jointly presided.  The decisions made during those depositions may provide guidance in the future should any other Senate be confronted with challenges similar to those that we have confronted. For that reason, I have described below the manner in which we reached our decisions and summarize the issues we resolved both before and during the depositions of Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal.  I thank Thomas Griffith, Morgan Frankel and Chris Bryant in the Senate Legal Counsel's office for their assistance during the depositions and in preparing this summary of the rules and procedures.  I ask unanimous consent that this summary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Summary of Rulings and Procedures of the Presiding Officers During                 Depositions in Senate Impeachment Trial                           A. THE PROCEDURES       Selection. An equal number of Presiding Officers from each      party were selected by the Minority and Majority Leaders.       Presiding. One Presiding Officer from each party presided      jointly over each deposition at all times. The Presiding      Officers rotated from deposition to deposition and the      Democratic Presiding Officers chose to rotate during the      deposition of Ms. Lewinsky, with Senator Leahy presiding over      the first part and Senator Edwards presiding over the latter      part of that deposition.       Attendance. All Presiding Officers were permitted to attend      each deposition in order to provide continuity in the      proceedings and ensure familiarity with both substantive and      procedural decisions made in each deposition.       Consultation. All Presiding Officers present, whether or      not actually presiding over a specific deposition, were      invited to and did participate in discussions among Presiding      Officers about certain rulings.       Opening Script. The first Presiding Officer to speak was      from the majority party. He used an opening script that      summarized Senate Resolution 30 authorizing the depositions      and set forth the ground rules for the timing of lunch and      other breaks, the overall time allotted for the deposition,      the scope of the examination, basic guidelines for      objections, an explanation of the confidentiality      requirements, and the oath required to be administered to the      witness. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., pp. 5-8). Senator DeWine      reiterated the confidentiality requirement at the close of      the Lewinsky deposition. (Id., p. 174, ln. 10--p. 175, ln.      7).       Senator Leahy made an opening statement at the Lewinsky      deposition to advise the witness of her rights, including      that she could correct the transcript, was free to consult      with her attorneys, and notified her of the criminal      liability she risked if she failed to tell the truth.      (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., pp. 9-11).       Senator Dodd stressed the confidentiality requirement      before the Jordan deposition (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 9, lns. 6-     13).       Senator Edwards stressed the confidentiality requirement      again before the Blumenthal deposition (Blumenthal Depo. Tr.,      p. 8, lns. 8-10).       Oath. The Presiding Officer from the majority party      administered the oath to the witness.       Advise of Rights. Senator Leahy in his opening remarks at      the Lewinsky deposition informed the witness that should she      fail to tell the truth, she would risk violating a federal      law (18 U.S.C.  Section 1001), prohibiting a person from      making any materially false statement in any investigation      or review by Congress (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 9, Ins. 4-     13).       Breaks. Senator DeWine called for 5-minute breaks on the      hour, and Senator Leahy made clear that the witness should      just ask should she want a break. At the conclusion of each      break, Senator DeWine informed counsel of the time remaining      for questioning. (See, e.g., 145 Cong. Rec. S1218, S1222      (Lewinsky)). Senator Thompson did likewise. (Id. at S1233,      S1238 (Jordan)). Senator Specter also called for 5-minute      breaks on the hour. (Id. at S1249, S1253; Blumenthal Depo.      Tr., p. 86, Ins. 6-7, 15). Senators Thompson and Dodd called      for a lunch break, even though Mr. Jordan asked to proceed      through lunch. (145 Cong. Rec. S1243). Brief breaks were also      taken when required to change the tapes, see, e.g., id. at      S1227, and during a power outage in the Jordan deposition.      (Id. at S1234).       Reserving Time for Re-direct and Re-Cross Examinations. The      parties were allowed to reserve time out of their four hours      for re-direct and re-cross examination, with the      understanding, however, that should the President's counsel      fail to cross-examine, the Managers would have no opportunity      to re-direct. Likewise, should the Managers fail to re-direct      following cross-examination, the President's counsel would      have no opportunity to re-cross.       During the Lewinsky deposition, the President's counsel      chose to ask no questions, which meant that the Managers      could ask no further questions. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 173,      Ins. 16-17). The President's counsel made a short apology to      the witness on behalf of the President, to which no objection      was made. (Id., p. 173, Ins. 18-20).       During the Jordan deposition, the President's counsel asked      very few questions on cross-examination, and the Managers      asked no questions on re-direct examination. (145 Cong. Rec.      S1245).       During the Blumethal deposition, the President's counsel      asked no questions on cross-examination, but the House      Managers were allowed to ask questions on a limited scope of      inquiry that had been the subject of an earlier objection      raised by the President's counsel. (Id. at S1253). Senators      Specter and Edwards had ruled that the Managers could develop      this line of inquiry at the conclusion of the deposition so      that should the objection be sustained, that portion of the      deposition could be easily excised (145 Cong. Rec. S1253).      Following the Managers' last line of inquiry, the President's      counsel was given the opportunity to ask, but had no      questions for Mr. Blumenthal. (Blumenthal Depo. Tr., p. 86,      Ins. 15-18).       Recalling the Witness. At the completion of the Managers'      direct examination of Ms. Lewinsky, Senator Edwards asked      Manager Bryant whether he had concluded his direct      examination. Manager Bryant said he had. When the President's      counsel determined not to ask any questions, Senators DeWine      and Edwards ruled that the deposition was completed, meaning      that the deponent could not be compelled to testify again      unless the Senate voted to issue another subpoena. (Lewinsky      Depo. Tr., p. 173, In. 24). In so doing, they expressly      rejected a request from Managers Bryant and Rogan to retain      jurisdiction over the witness should she be called as      a witness before the Senate. (Id., p. 176, lns. 4-8).       Off the Record. The Presiding Officers determined when to      go off the record. For example, Senator DeWine asked to go      off the record when conferring on a ruling with Senator      Leahy. (145 Cong. Rec. S1219 (Lewinsky)). Senator Edwards      also asked to go off the record to confer with Senator      Specter on a ruling. (Id. at S1250 (Blumenthal)). The parties      were also permitted to request that discussion take place off      the record. For example, upon Manager Bryant's request,      Senators DeWine and Leahy allowed discussion to take place      off the record. (Id. at S1229 (Lewinsky)). Similarly, upon      President's Counsel's request, Senators Specter and Edwards      allowed discussion to take place off the record. (Id. at      S1253 (Blumenthal)).       Videotape. Senator Leahy advised Ms. Lewinsky at the outset      for her deposition of how the videotape of the deposition      might be used, including admitted into evidence in the      impeachment trial and used in a way that it becomes public.      (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 10, lns. 10-12). Her attorney noted      for the record that the witness objected to the videotaping      of the deposition, and to any subsequent public release of      the videotape of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony (Id. p. 12; lns.      19-22).                             b. the witness       Counsel May Not Coach the Witness. Senator DeWine      instructed Ms. Lewinsky's counsel not to coach or prompt the      witness in her answers. He stated that she was free to ask      for a break to confer with her counsel, but they should not      whisper responses to her while a question was pending. (145      Cong. Rec. S1215).       Relying on Prior Grand Jury Testimony. Ms. Lewinsky      objected to certain questions, answers to which were already      in the record. After conferring, Senators DeWine and Leahy      instructed Ms. Lewinsky to answer a Manager's question even      though the question might have been covered in her grand jury      testimony, though she ``certainly can reference previous      testimony if she wishes to do that.'' Senator Leahy      particularly noted that there may be ``some nuances      different,'' and that she could ``correct her testimony.''      (145 Cong. Rec. S1213).       Transcript Corrections. Senator Leahy made clear when he      presided at the Lewinsky deposition that the witness would be      given an opportunity to examine the transcript to make any      necessary corrections. By letter dated February 2, 1999, her      attorney provided a list of corrections to the deposition      (145 Cong. Res. S1229).               c. objections to questions and statements       Procedures for Resolving Scope Objections. Section 204 of      S. Res. 30 limited the examination of the witness to ``the      subject matters reflected in the Senate record.'' Prior to      the Lewinsky deposition, Senators DeWine and Leahy determined      that if objection was made to a question on the ground that      it exceeded the scope of the Senate record, the proponent of      the question would be allowed to identify where in the Senate      record the subject matter of the question was reflected. If      the proponent could satisfy the Presiding Officers that      the subject matter of the question was reflected in the      Senate record, the witness would be instructed to answer      the question.       In the Blumenthal deposition, a scope objection arose about      questions regarding White House strategy discussions of      Kathleen Willey. (145 Cong. Rec. S1249). Senators Specter and      Edwards decided to reserve that line of questioning until the      end of the deposition. When the issue arose again, after      consultation off the record, Senators Specter and Edwards      decided that questions regarding Kathleen Willey were within      the scope, but not questions regarding strategy sessions on      any other women. (Id. at S1253). Senators Specter and Edwards      also overruled Mr. Blumenthal's attorney's scope objection to      another area of questions after Manager Graham had offered      proof to support the scope of the question, and the attorney      had withdrawn his objection. (Id. at S1251).       Limitation on Scope. While S. Res. 30 broadly defined the      permissible scope of the deposition to cover subject matter      reflected in the Senate record, the Managers were reminded of      their representations to the Senate limiting the areas about      which they would examine the witnesses. For example, Senator      Leahy reminded Manager Bryant of his promise to the Senate      that he would not ask Ms. Lewinsky about her explicit sexual      relationship with the President. (145 Cong. Rec. 1213).       Objections by Counsel for the Witness. Senators DeWine and      Leahy ruled that counsel for the witness were allowed to      interpose objections to a question. (Id. at S1219      (Lewinsky)).       Answering the Question Subject to an Objection. Section 203      of S. Res. 30 required that ``the witness shall answer'' all      questions unless asserting a ``legally-recognized privilege,      or constitutional right.'' Senators DeWine and Leahy noted      all non-privilege objections and instructed the witness to      answer questions subject to the objection. (See, e.g., 145      Cong. Rec. S1221 (Lewinsky)). The attorney-client privilege      was asserted by Ms. Lewinsky's counsel in response to one      line of questioning. Senators DeWine and Leahy instructed      Manager Bryant to postpone that line of questioning until      after Ms. Lewinsky's counsel could determine whether prior      grand jury testimony had waived the privilege for that      subject matter. (Id. at S1223). Her counsel later withdrew      the objection, and Manager Bryant resumed his line of      questioning. (Id. at S1224).       When Manager Graham asked about Mr. Blumenthal's prior use      of executive privilege, his attorney, Mr. McDaniel, objected      that the question was misleading because Mr. Blumenthal had      not raised the privilege, but the White House had. Senators      Specter and Edwards overruled the objection, and asked Mr.      Blumenthal to answer the question, which was rephrased. (Id.      at S1249).       Compound or Ambiguous Questions. During the depositions,      there were numerous objections that the questions were      compound and/or ambiguous. In each instance, the Presiding      Officers invited the manager to rephrase the question and      allowed the questioning to proceed. (See, e.g., id. at S1214-     15 (Lewinsky), S1228 (Lewinsky), S1252 (Blumenthal)). At      one point in the Blumenthal deposition, Senators Specter      and Edwards ruled that Mr. Blumenthal could answer a      question to which Mr. McDaniel objected as confusing, if      the witness understood it. (Id. at S1250).       Open-ended Question. On cross-examination, Mr. Kendall      asked Mr. Jordan if he had anything to add to the testimony      he had given during his direct examination. That question      drew an objection from Manager Hutchinson that it was too      broad. Senator Thompson asked Mr. Kendall to rephrase the      question, which he did. (Id. at S1245).       Witness Statement. At the conclusion of his examination,      Mr. Jordan asked the Presiding Officers if he could make a      statement. (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 157, lnc. 6-7). Manager      Hutchinson reserved the right to object if the statement      exceeded the scope of the inquiry. (Id. at ln. 18). Mr.      Jordan then offered a statement defending his integrity,      which the Presiding Officers allowed. (Id. at ln. 24--p. 158,      ln. 23). Manager Hutchinson did not assert an objection      following the statement.       Leading Questions. Senator Thompson allowed Manager      Hutchinson to ask a leading question of Mr. Jordan, since      according to S. Res. 30 these witnesses were to be treated as      adverse to the Managers. (145 Cong. Rec. S1238).       Questions Assuming Facts Not in Evidence. Senator Edwards,      with Senator Specter's concurrence, sustained an objection to      a Manager's question that contained premises and      characterized events not in the record, and Manager Graham      rephrased the question. (Id. S1252).       Speculation. Senators DeWine and Leahy asked Manager Bryant      to rephrase questions after objection was made that the      questions called for speculation about another person's state      of mind. (Id. at S1219, S1221 (Lewinsky)). Senators Specter      and Edwards asked Manager Graham to rephrase questions      calling for Mr. Blumenthal's speculation about other's      thoughts. (Id. at S1250, S1254).                           d. use of exhibits       Prior Production of Exhibits. Section 204 of S. Res. 30      requires ``[t]he party taking a deposition . . . [to] present      to the other party, at least 18 hours in advance of the      deposition, copies of all exhibits which the deposing party      intends to enter into the deposition.'' Following objection      from the President's counsel that the Managers had failed to      comply with this requirement and had largely supplied only      general descriptions of exhibits without copies of specific      documents, Senators DeWine and Leahy ruled that this      provision required production to the witness, the other      party, and the Presiding Officers of a copy of any document      that would be used during the deposition. A general      description of the exhibit document did not comply with the      resolution. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 14, ln. 16--p. 19, ln.      5).  The President's counsel lodged an objection to the tardy      production of deposition exhibits by the Managers prior to      the Lewinsky deposition and again prior to the Jordan      deposition, but agreed to proceed after the Presiding      Officers assured them they would have an adequate      opportunity to review any documents used in the      deposition. (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 13, lns. 22-25).      Senators Thompson and Dodd put the Managers on notice that      failure to comply with the Presiding Officers' ruling      would preclude the use of documents not provided in a      timely fashion at the Blumenthal deposition scheduled for      the next day. (Id. at p. 13, ln. 22-p. 14, lns. 6, 16-23).       Referring to Exhibits. Senators DeWine and Leahy ruled that      exhibits should be referred to according to their location in      the Senate record. (145 Cong. Rec. S1214, S1226 (Lewinsky)).      Senator Thompson reiterated that ruling in the Jordan      deposition. (Id. at S1236). Senator Thompson also ruled that      grand jury exhibits in the Senate record used as deposition      exhibits should not be referred to by their grand jury      exhibit number, but rather by an exhibit number for this      impeachment trial deposition. (Id.) Senators Thompson and      Dodd numbered the exhibits as they were presented, rather      than as they were admitted into evidence. (Id. at S1245).       Admitting Exhibits into Evidence. S. Res. 16, the agreement      which emerged from the Senate's January 8, 1999 bipartisan      caucus in the Old Senate Chamber, provides that the material      the House filed with the Senate on January 13, 1999 ``will be      admitted into evidence.'' Those materials were printed,      bound, and distributed to Senators. (See S. Doc. No. 106-3,      vols. I-XXIV (1999)). Thus, any documents in that Senate      record were already admitted into evidence by the time the      depositions were taken. S. Res. 30, which governs the conduct      of these depositions, provides that ``[n]o exhibits outside      of the Senate record shall be employed, except for articles      and materials in the press, including electronic media.''      When a party used a document during a deposition that was in      the Senate record, there was no need to seek admission of      that document into evidence. The only non-record documents      that could be used in these depositions were ``articles and      materials in the press, including electronic media.'' A party      needed to seek the admission of those documents into evidence      before they could become part of the record.       During the Jordan deposition, Manager Hutchinson attempted      to use as an exhibit a summary of telephone records, a      redacted form of which was in the Senate record. Mr. Kendall      objected to the use of the exhibit because it had not been      properly authenticated. Senators Thompson and Dodd sustained      the objection. (145 Cong. Rec. S1241).       After the Manager's examination of Mr. Blumenthal, the      President's counsel, Lanny Breuer, presented various news      articles that were admitted into evidence. (Blumenthal Depo.      Tr., p. 81, ln. 8-p. 82, ln. 2). Manager Graham also      submitted articles into evidence, including those not      referred to by Mr. Blumenthal, and they were admitted after      Mr. Breuer withdrew his objection that no reference had been      made to the articles during the examination. (Id. at p. 82,      lns. 16-25, p. 83, ln. 15-p. 85, ln. 25).                          ____________________
