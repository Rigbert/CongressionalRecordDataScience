They wanted to move quickly to pass any appropriations bill to make certain there was no question in the minds of our men and women in uniform that we were standing with them, and we did. I don't believe even those of us who voted against the invasion of Iraq tried to stop the proceedings from funding the troops, regardless of what our votes might be.  So I think it would be consistent now for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us, in a bipartisan fashion, to say whatever differences on other issues, such as health care, let's let the troops know this holiday season we stand behind them--Republicans and Democrats--and let's do it in an efficient and effective way.  Since this unanimous consent request has been granted, I am going toyield the floor and any of my colleagues who wish to speak, it will be equally divided time for the next 2 hours.  At this time, I yield the floor. Mr. President, if no one seeks time, I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous consent that during the time of the quorum the time be equally divided between both sides.
