The horrific terrorist attacks in London and Madrid demonstrate that terrorists are willing and able to attack transit systems. Our systems in the United States remain vulnerable.  Just today, the Homeland Security Committee held a hearing looking at the next 5 years and what challenges face us. The witness, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism from New York City, specifically pointed out the vulnerabilities of our transit systems and also the inequities in funding. I believe the statistics he gave us were that there was a ratio of 9:1 in the amount of money that had been spent on aviation security versus other forms of transportation security. So I think there is an imbalance. I believe this is a vulnerability and that this amendment would allow for the authorization of significant transportation security improvements. I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Is there further debate? The Senator from Hawaii.
