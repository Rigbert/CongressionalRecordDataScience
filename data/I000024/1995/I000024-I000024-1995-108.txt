President, a day does not go by that there is not a newspaper article or news story on the destructive effects drugs have on our youth. Millions of dollars are spent each year on education and prevention programs. Despite this attention, we are having incremental success in discouraging our young people from choosing this injurious lifestyle. It has been my observation that the most effective programs are those at the local level. During my tenure as the mayor of Tulsa, I strongly supported and worked with D.A.R.E. because I believe it was a program that produced tangible results.  Since my election to the Senate, I have been made aware of an organization in Oklahoma called Young-Line ``Drug Free'' Associations, Inc. which focuses on teaching youth the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. Chief Bonnie O. Ezechukwu, who heads the Young-Line organization, has been recognized throughout the State of Oklahoma for his outstanding work. Originally from Nigeria, Chief Ezechukwu has lived in the United States for 13 years during which time he steadfastly worked to teach respect for human life, importance of self-esteem and community involvement in the lives of young people.  I want to commend Chief Ezechukwu and Young-Line ``Drug Free'' Associations, Inc. for helping young people combat potential drug and alcohol abuse by emphasizing prevention and at the same time aiding them to become worthwhile members of society. Their prevention methods go beyond teaching and focus on leadership and character development. Their work in Oklahoma has made a difference.                          ____________________
