 President, I have spent a little time going through a sample of the many items that Members weighed in with at the conference. This is a small sample of those items raised. Many others were brought to the attention of Senator Baucus and this Senator through letters or oral communications. It is safe to say, Senator Baucus and I can relate to what Senator Byrd and Chairman Stevens go through on the appropriations bills.  My point is, those who want to distort this bill by describing it as a special interest bill are ignoring a couple things. One, they are ignoring--perhaps conveniently, perhaps deliberately--their own efforts to advance their interests. Secondly, as I have said before, this bill is paid for by raising revenue, largely by closing abusive corporate tax loopholes.  Let the record be clear that this bill is fair, this bill is balanced. It is a balanced effort at resolving four objectives. One objective is ending the European tax on our exports going to Europe that are legal and legitimate, even though I disagree that it should have been done. I disagree with that decision. The United States lost aWorld Trade Organization decision that our previous tax laws were violating the agreements that Congress had made with Europe, Congress made, because we passed these trade agreements as law.  If anybody thinks, well, it is wrong for Europe to levy a tax against us, we won a case against Europe on beef because they don't let our beef into Europe because we use hormones in the development of our beef, in the feed the cattle eat or that they are injected with, and Europe does not like that. But they are violating our right to send beef to Europe because they don't have a scientific basis for doing it. That is what the World Trade Organization said. But they still don't take our beef. So we put a tax on products coming from Europe to the United States to retaliate the same way they are retaliating for the reasons behind this bill.  This bill ends that European tax because we are conforming our tax laws to the international trading agreements Congress passed 10 years ago. We are also going beyond doing away with an impediment to our exports so that we lose jobs here in America because of that tax. We are putting a replacement benefit to manufacturers in the United States so jobs will be created here by lowering the corporate rate from 35 to 32.  No. 3, we are providing international tax reforms that will aid domestic manufacturers so we can compete in the global marketplace.  And lastly, we achieve these policy ends in a revenue-neutral way through the curtailment of abusive corporate tax shelters and abusive corporate loopholes by closing them.  I hope everybody agrees this bill is a well-balanced bill, accomplishing a goal we should have accomplished a year and a half ago, at least no later than March when these European taxes started on our products. I apologize to any Americans who have been laid off because our products are not competitive in Europe because of that tax and why it takes Congress so long to wake up, particularly when there are Members of Congress always complaining about outsourcing.  We started on this bill in March. It took us 15 days, over a period of 3 months, to get this bill through the Senate. And then we were a long period of time before the minority party agreed we could go to conference. But once we got to conference, thanks to the good cooperative working relationship between Senator Baucus and me for the Senate and between Mr. Baucus and me and Congressman Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, we have this bill.  But for those laid-off workers, I am embarrassed this bill couldn't have been passed a long time ago and that we ran up against all of the impediments. Why? Because certain Members of this body don't want a Republican President signing a jobs bill a few days before the election.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from California.                           CHRISTOPHER REEVE
