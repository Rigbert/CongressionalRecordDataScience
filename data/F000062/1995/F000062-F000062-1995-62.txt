 President, I rise today in deep sorrow to pay a tribute to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in Tel Aviv 10 days ago.  It is difficult to imagine the State of Israel without Yitzhak Rabin. His last years as Prime Minister were so momentous that it is easy to forget that Yitzhak Rabin was not just present, but played a central role, in virtually every major event in Israel's brief, but dramatic, history.  For many Israelis, Yitzhak Rabin was a father figure--a constant presence throughout their lives, and a source of strength. The profound love, admiration, and respect that his compatriots felt for him was made clear by the tremendous, spontaneous outpouring of grief upon his sudden death: Candlelight vigils cropped up all across the country; men and women stood crying in the streets in shock and disbelief; and 1 million Israelis--20 percent of the population--filed past his coffin in a 24-hour period to pay their last respects.  For Israelis, Yitzhak Rabin had simply always been there.  Born in 1922 in Jerusalem to recent immigrants to Palestine, the young Yitzhak Rabin was part of the generation that built the foundation of the Jewish state. He studied in an agricultural school, with the expectation of working the land with his bare hands.  But Rabin felt a sense of duty to the cause of building Israel, and he put his own ambitions aside to fight for its birth. He joined the Palmach, the forerunner of the Israel defense forces, to fight for Israel's establishment. A fine soldier, he was quickly elevated to command-level positions, and he led the battalion that secured the crucial Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road during Israel's War of Independence in 1948.  After Israel's founding, Rabin rose through the ranks of the Israel defense forces, finally being named Chief of Staff. To Israel's good fortune, he held that position in June of 1967, when he led Israel to a stunning victory in the Six-Day War over three Arab armies threatening the Jewish State. He was one of the first Israelis to walk the streets of the reunited city of Jerusalem, and the pictures of him arriving at the Western Wall of the Temple are to this day among the most moving images in Israel's history.  In the aftermath of this great victory, he retired from the military and became Israel's Ambassador to the United States. He sought this post, he explained, because he felt that Israel's future could best be secured by a strong partnership with the United States. More than any other individual in either country, Yitzhak Rabin envisioned the deep friendship that now exists between the United States and Israel, and worked to make it a reality. It is fitting that in his final years as Prime Minister, he enjoyed a relationship with an American President that surpassed perhaps what even he had imagined possible.  In 1974, in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War that brought down the government of Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister of Israel. During his tenure in office, he forged an early path in Middle East peacemaking by negotiating disengagement agreements with both Egypt and Syria. Following the Labor party's defeat to Likud in 1977, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat built on the successful disengagement negotiations to reach a full peace treaty.  In 1984, Yitzhak Rabin returned to the Cabinet as Israel's Defense Minister. In the first year, he helped to arrange the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from most of Lebanon, following a costly and painful invasion. In 1987 and 1988, he was confronted by the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, and the daily battles between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian youths.  Finally, in 1992, Yitzhak Rabin returned victorious to the Prime Ministership. He quickly recognized the opportunity to achieve a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations between Israel and its neighbors. The results included the historic agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, the peace treaty with Jordan, and many unforgettable images, such as the famous handshake with Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn, and the appearance with King Hussein of Jordan at a joint session of Congress.  The common thread through all these various experiences was an unshakable commitment to the security and well-being of the State of Israel. At every stage of his life--from young soldier fighting for his nation's survival, to confident commander of a strong army, to diplomat reaching out to broader ties with the world, and finally to statesman leading his nation to make peace with old foes--he was motivated by a desire to build a better, more secure, more peaceful life for his people.  Yitzhak Rabin was a man of great integrity. He spoke plainly and made no pretense about his overriding concern: the security of the State of Israel and its people. But, blessed with strength of character and a keen intellect, he was able to adjust his understanding of what Israel's security required according to changing conditions.  In 1948 and 1967, for example, he knew that Israel's survival required an all-out military effort. In later years he understood the need to maintain Israel's world-class military and the imperative of a strong alliance with the United States.  For many years after the Six-Day War, he had been an advocate of Israel retaining all of the West Bank and Gaza. But as the intifada went on, the destructive effects of the continuation of Israeli control over a hostile, embittered population of nearly 2 million Palestinians became clearer to him.  Over time, and not without difficulty, he came to the understanding that Israel's long-term survival as a Jewish state would be jeopardized by the continued domination of another people. He was not naive. He recognized that there were risks involved with reaching out to old enemies. But his pragmatic understanding of Israel's own needs led to the historic agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  In his final speech to the Israeli people, at the peace rally where he was cut down, Yitzhak Rabin explained how he had come to reassess Israel's situation. He said:       I was a military man for 27 years. I fought so long as      there was no chance for peace. I believe that there is now a      chance for peace, a great chance. We must take advantage of      it for the sake of those standing here and for those who are      not here--and they are many.       I say this to you as one who was a military man, someone      who is today Minister of Defense and sees the pain of the      families of the Israel Defense Forces soldiers. For them, for      our children, in my case for our grandchildren, I want this      government to exhaust every opening, every possibility to      promote and achieve a comprehensive peace.  Yitzhak Rabin was a pragmatist, not a starry-eyed idealist. But through his pragmatism, he reached a visionary conclusion. This man, who cared so deeply for every Israeli soldier who fell in battle, for every victim of terror, knew that when an opportunity for peace presented itself, he must seize it. A pragmatic conclusion to be sure, but also a morally-centered one.  I was privileged to attend Yitzhak Rabin's funeral last week in Jerusalem, the city of his birth. He is buried among Israel's fallen heroes on Mount Herzl, and there could be no more appropriate place. He was a patriot and hero for Israel as a soldier and a leader, in wars of survival and in the struggle for peace.  The funeral was a powerful testimony to his achievements. Yitzhak Rabin, the military hero, was saluted by weeping soldiers, and buried with full military honors. Yitzhak Rabin, the peacemaker, was honored by the entire world. Dozens of heads of state and foreign dignitaries, from every corner of the globe, came to pay their respects. There could be no greater evidence of the incredible progress made by Yitzhak Rabin toward peace and ending Israel's isolation.  Most inspiring of all was the presence of leaders from seven Arab countries--Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, Oman, and Mauritania--and the Palestinian Authority. Such a thing could not have happened even 3 years ago. The peace that Yitzhak Rabin was striving to build was brought to life by the presence of President Mubarak of Egypt, on his first visit to Israel, and by Jordan's King Hussein, who called Rabin ``my brother.''  It now falls to Shimon Peres, Israel's acting Prime Minister, to continue the work of his partner, Yitzhak Rabin. Israel is fortunate to have such a wise and capable leader ready to step in to the void created by this tragedy. Shimon Peres has served Israel with distinction over many years as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, and many other posts.  Shimon Peres is in many ways the architect of the Israeli-Palestinian agreements, and his commitment to achieving a comprehensive peace that protects Israel's security is unquestioned. If there is any consolation in this time of grief, it is that Yitzhak Rabin's partner, Shimon Peres, who shared Rabin's vision, will be able to carry that vision forward.  As the tributes to Yitzhak Rabin continue to flow forth from around the world, we must rededicate ourselves to supporting Israel in its pursuit of peace. It is a sad irony that at the moment of Yitzhak Rabin's death, Congress had allowed the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act--which Rabin considered essential to the success of his peace policies--to lapse.  While this problem was rectified following the funeral, we know that Congress will have many future opportunities to express support for the peace process. When we fail to do so, we undermine Israel's peace efforts and dishonor Yitzhak Rabin's legacy.  Let us commit to one another and to the memory of Yitzhak Rabin, that we will place support for Israel's peace efforts above partisan or political disputes. Bringing peace to Israel and the Middle East--which was Rabin's life's work--deserves to be such a priority. If we fail to do this, all our words and tributes in praise of Yitzhak Rabin will ring hollow.  Let us also commit ourselves to condemning violence and the incendiary rhetoric of extremists, wherever we find it. The painful lesson of Rabin's death is that violent words can indeed have violent consequences. Tragically, ``Death to Rabin'' was not just a slogan. It is up to all of us to isolate those who use such words.  Israel and the world have lived 10 days without Yitzhak Rabin, and we are far poorer for his loss. While the pain does not fade easily, his memory can be a source of comfort. This past Sunday night, at the conclusion of the 7-day mourning period, tens of thousands of Israelis returned to the site of his assassination--renamed Yitzhak Rabin Square--and sang songs of peace in his honor.  For Israel, for the Jewish people, and for all who loved and respected Yitzhak Rabin, may his memory be a blessing. In death as in life, may he give hope and strength to his people.                          ____________________
