Speaker, I am pleased to hear that.  Mr. Leader, I would hope that in the event that you, who are perceived by, I think, many of your Members as I read in the papers as being tough enough to make the hard decisions, if you conclude prior to a finalization of an agreement that in fact negotiations are being conducted in good faith; that there is a reasonable probability that they will be successful in accomplishing the objective of the balanced budget within 7 years by CBO scoring, or such scoring as the parties agree on, that you would contact my leadership to suggest that the next time we come back from recess, whether it is Saturday or next Tuesday, that we pass a unanimous-consent continuing resolution to put the Government back to work.
