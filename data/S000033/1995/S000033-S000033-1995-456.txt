 Speaker, in contrast with the GOP's Contract With America, we shall offer a positive legislative alternative during the first 100 days of the 104th Congress to extend a fair shake to all Americans on the Progressive Promise. Our plan shall be rooted in the principles of social and economic justice, nondiscrimination, and tolerance. It shall embody national priorities which reflect the interests and needs of all the American people, not just the wealthy and powerful.  Today the Progressive Caucus in bringing to the floor for a vote our 1st in 11 alternative bills to the Republican Contract--The Fiscal Fairness Act, which allows a waiver of the balanced budget requirement in any fiscal year when the national unemployment rate exceeds 4 percent, thus sustaining our long-standing national commitment to full employment.  The second bill in the Progressive Promise is The Equal Justice Before the Law Act, which is an anticrime package that retains key aspects of the anticrime legislation enacted in 1994 to prevent crime as well as punish that which happens; to crack down on white-collar [[Page E193]] crime--for example, S&L bailout, defrauding Federal Government on procurement, criminal penalties for willful violation of child labor laws by employers that result in serious bodily injury or death of minors in the workplace, eliminate deductibility of legal expenses when a company is accused of a crime--and on drug trafficking and abuse.  The third bill in the Progressive Promise is The Corporate Responsibility Act, which cuts corporate welfare in the form of special subsidies and tax loopholes of benefit to many of America's wealthiest corporations; to require companies to internalize pollution clean-up and other costs of production instead of continuing to foist them on the American taxpayer, and to reform basic labor laws to restore collective bargaining rights and balance in employer-employee relations.  The fourth bill in the Progressive Promise is Family Foundation Act, which will enable parents to get decent-paying, stable jobs in order to afford child care and health care for their families; to raise the minimum wage and index it for inflation; to strengthen child support collection; to abolish financial penalties for two-parent families; to protect the sanctity of the family and safeguard the health and well-being of all our children; and to ensure that all Americans are well fed.  The fifth bill in the Progressive Promise is The American Homemakers and Caregivers Act, which target IRA's and other savings incentives on middle- and low-income Americans; special provisions to extend generous IRA options to spouses who stay home to nurture children under 6 years of age, thus recognizing the importance of parental child-rearing; to allow penalty-free IRA withdrawals for home health care, education expenses, or to start a small business; and targeted deduction for child care expenses.  The sixth bill in the Progressive Promise is The National Economic Security Act, which cuts the Pentagon and CIA budgets and star wars spending in favor of shifting limited resources to meet domestic social needs and investments to strengthen the U.S. national economy.  The seventh bill in the Progressive Promise is The Cradle-To-Grave Health Care Act, which require a vote on sense-of-the-Congress resolution against cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; to establish a state-based, single-payer health care plan that provides cost-effective, comprehensive and affordable health care for all Americans, including long-term care and prescription drug coverage; and to stress disease prevention and health promotion in our communities.  The eighth bill in the Progressive Promise is The Job Creation and Invest in America Act, which would create at least 1 million jobs in the United States in each of the next 2 years from $127.2 billion in new investment to rebuild and upgrade America's physical infrastructure and clean up the environment; to pay for these investments by closing tax loopholes for offshore production while rewarding U.S. companies that invest, produce, and create jobs in the United States; to require the wealthiest U.S. corporations and citizens to pay their fair share of taxes; and to establish a national commission to finds ways to encourage social investment of billions in pension funds to meet domestic needs in America.  The ninth bill in the Progressive Promise is The Taking Back our Congress Act, which curbs influence-peddling and special-interest lobbying through tougher lobbying restrictions and campaign finance reform; to prohibit ex-members of Congress and executive branch officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments and companies; to improve ballot access so more Americans can run for office; and to authorize some public financing of congressional elections to make it more affordable for more candidates to run regardless of personal wealth.  The tenth bill in the Progressive Promise is The Public Interest Legislature Act, which strengthens financial disclosure requirements and to prevent financial conflicts of interest in voting decisions by Members of Congress.  The eleventh bill in The Export American Products, Not American Jobs Act, which eliminates or limits special tax and trade incentives and taxpayer-backed programs that reward U.S.-based multinational corporations for producing offshore; no new fast-track and trade agreements without enforceable worker rights, environmental, agricultural, and safety health standards; to prohibit importing child and forced labor products; and to reduce U.S. trade deficit by eliminating unfair trade barriers to U.S. exports.                          ____________________
