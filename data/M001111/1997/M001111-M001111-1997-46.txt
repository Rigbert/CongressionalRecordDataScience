 President, today the Senate has passed the Gorton amendment to the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. This amendment seeks to block-grant certain Federal education funds and send them directly to school districts across the country. I appreciate my colleague Senator Gorton's intent to pass as much responsibility as possible for making educational and funding decisions to those levels closest to the classroom. This is also a goal of mine.  However, with all due respect to my colleague, this is one issue where we fundamentally disagree. His amendment, like many ideas, sounds good in theory because it oversimplifies the practical reality in our schools and communities.  As a former school board member, I agree with my Republican colleagues that our local elected school officials and educators are fully capable of deciding what their local needs and priorities are, and directing funds to those areas.  But those local school board members and superintendents and principals and educators will tell you that the Federal Government does indeed have a role in education in this country--in setting priorities and assuring equity.  Despite the occasional difficulties of writing a grant or filling out a form, Federal programs such as School-to-Work, or Safe and Drug-Free Schools, or STAR schools or other Federal technology programs, have made very real differences in the lives of students in schools across this Nation.  They will tell you that equity protection efforts, such as providing funds for magnet schools, funds for Indian education, or funds for bilingual or migrant education, should continue to be uniquely within the purview of the Federal Government. This is because despite the best intentions, we all know that some school districts in this country have not always been able to do best by all the students all of the time. Equity funds must continue to go to the students and school districts which need them, and must not be watered down and spread across all school districts, regardless of need, as it appears the Gorton amendment would require.  My problem with the Gorton amendment is that it may cost significantly more to educate one student than another, but this amendment will send them both the same Federal allocation--and ignore the intent of the Federal education program set up to recognize the specific needs associated with the higher cost.  Every child deserves an effective, relevant education. Not all children have the same opportunity to get it. This amendment will assure that we increase the disparities between the haves and have-nots in our Nation's schools.  Federal education funds leverage State and local money, as they do in my State, in the area of technology funding. Federal programs include caps on administrative expenditures, and maintenance of effort requirements--so we do not allow States to supplant or misuse funds. Federal education efforts safeguard equity concerns important to the Nation, and set important national goals priorities.  The Gorton amendment is bad policy. It uses a meat-ax approach to educational reform when what is needed is the precision of a scalpel and a careful ear listening to what local people are really saying. No one likes bureaucracy. Everyone believes our schools can be improved. But educators and tax-payers across the country will grumble more loudly about the potential ill-effects of the Gorton amendment than they ever have over redtape.  Local control is the goal; the Gorton amendment is fundamentally the wrong way to go about reaching it.               FUNDING FOR THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS
