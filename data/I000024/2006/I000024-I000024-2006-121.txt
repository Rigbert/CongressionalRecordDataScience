The Senator from Iowa is in support of the Inhofe-Bond amendment and opposed to the Feingold-McCain amendment. I remind him that virtually every organization in Iowa, including the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, Iowa Corn Growers Association, and others, are in support of the Bond-Inhofe amendment.  I also make a request, and I am sure others will join, asking Members to come to the Senate if they want to speak on either of the two amendments that are being discussed right now.  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Burns as a cosponsor of the Inhofe-Bond amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so ordered.
