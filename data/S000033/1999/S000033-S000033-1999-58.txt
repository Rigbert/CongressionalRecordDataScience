 Chairman, I have two amendments that I will be offering today on what I consider to be one of the very, very important issues dealt with in this appropriation bill, and that is the issue of weatherization.                              {time}  1100  It is no secret that all over this country when the weather gets 20 below zero, as in my State, or when the weather gets 120 degrees, as in some of our southern States, that a lot of people, including many senior citizens, suffer terribly because they do not have the resources to adequately warm their homes or, when the weather gets too hot, adequately cool their homes.  A number of years ago, I know the chairman will remember that in the city of Chicago, for example, in a hot weather period we had a terrible disaster where hundreds of senior citizens in that city actually died from heat exhaustion. We are seeing that problem right now as the hot weather hits various parts of our country.  Certainly in the northern States there is no question that cold weather is not only a problem in terms of potentially hurting people, but what the weatherization program deals with is creating a cost-effective approach so lower-income people can have good insulation, good storm windows, good roofing.  Historically what has been shown is the weatherization program is enormously cost-effective and environmentally sound. What sense is it that we have low-income people see their energy go out their windows, go out their doors, go out their roofs, because those homes are not adequately insulated?  Similarly, what sense is it that in those States where the weather becomes very hot and seniors have air conditioners, they lose the coolness in their homes because their homes are not adequately ventilated and adequately insulated?  Unfortunately, the subcommittee has cut funding for weatherization by $13 million beyond where it was last year. The first amendment that I am offering would require that we at least level fund the program.  This amendment that I am offering, as cosponsored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. McNulty), this amendment is simple and it is straightforward. It would simply increase the highly successful and cost-effective weatherization assistance program by $13 million to its fiscal year 1999 level, and reduce the Strategic Petroleum Reserve account by the same, $13 million.  The Senate level-funded this program at $133 million. The President had requested $154 million for this important and much needed program. Unfortunately, as I just mentioned, the committee chose to cut funding for last year by $13 million, from $133 million to $120 million. This amendment level funds the program and brings it up to the level provided by the Senate. That is all we are asking to do.  Let me quote from a letter of July 13 from Bill Richardson, Secretary of Energy:       In this time of economic prosperity, it is questionable for      Congress to target a program that helps a population with the      greatest need and the least resources. We are also disturbed      that Congress would act,and now I am talking about the next amendment that I am going to offer, which we are really concerned about, as well,     That Congress would act without being provided a more      thorough analysis of the impact of the proposed action,      without public hearings, and without the opportunity to hear      from the States and the people affected.  What Mr. Richardson and the Energy Department are talking about is another amendment that came from the committee which I think has disastrous consequences which would require a 25 percent matching fund from the States.  Let me go back to the letter from the Secretary:       The administration is strongly opposed to a reduction in      weatherization assistance program funding and to the      legislative language that would change the distribution      criteria for the program by requiring about $30 million in      State cost share. Under the committee language, no State      would receive its formula share of the weatherization      assistance program's appropriation in fiscal year 2000 unless      it provided 25 percent in State matching funds.  So Mr. Chairman, the two amendments that we are dealing with are, number one, to restore funding for the very successful weatherization program to the level fund that it had last year, to be put where the Senate is.
