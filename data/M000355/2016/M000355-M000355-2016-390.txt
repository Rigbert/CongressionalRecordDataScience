 President, reserving the right to object, I previously stated on two occasions that President Obama has already gotten 13 more judges confirmed than President Bush in all of his 8 years as President. I offered a counter consent that was objected to that would have confirmed a district judge in California, two district judges in Pennsylvania, and a district judge in Utah. That was objected to, so I will spare the Senate the counter UC I offered earlier because I know it will be objected to. But with regard to the consent that has just been requested, I object.
