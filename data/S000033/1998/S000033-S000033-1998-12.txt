 Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time.  I rise in support of this legislation because it provides important benefits for dairy farmers in Vermont and farmers throughout the country. Specifically for our region, it expands the Northeast Dairy Compact for another year, which is terribly important for farmers in my State who are fighting to keep their heads above water.  This legislation provides some disaster relief for farmers all over this country, including New England, which is vitally needed. It also gives us more time to address the Federal Milk Marketing Order formula, a very, very important issue, and I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) for his leadership role in that fight.  Having said that, we still have a long way to go. Family farmers are what this country is supposed to be about. We believe in decentralized agriculture. We need to significantly improve Federal policy for dairy farmers, family farmers, or else we are going to continue to lose them, and that will be a tragedy not only for New England but for every State in this country.
