He brings great leadership to the effort. I am proud to be a member of his subcommittee.                             Death Gratuity  Later tonight I am hopeful the Senate will consider legislation, S. 704, which I introduced last week with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, the chairman, Senator John Warner, and my colleague, Senator John McCain. I recognize the contributions and cosponsorship of Senators Ben Nelson and George Allen. The legislation we have introduced will send an important message to our troops who are engaged in combat, even as we speak, that our Nation is so grateful for their service.  Our bill would raise the amount paid to the families of military personnel killed while on active duty. It would increase it from $6,000 to $12,000. This payment, which is known as the death gratuity, would be paid retroactive to September 11, 2001, so that the troops who have been killed in the battle against terrorism would also be eligible for this doubled benefit.  As are all of my colleagues, I am very saddened by the loss of American life in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The young men and women of our military represent the very best our Nation has to offer. They do not join the military for monetary gain nor to have a comfortable lifestyle. They serve our Nation out of a sense of patriotism that should make each and every American proud. The mercy they are showing even today to Iraqi prisoners of war is testament to the strength of character that is the core of our military values. In many cases, we ask our own troops to take additional risks in order to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. That they do this without question or regret speaks well not only of our military but of our Nation.  When the Commander in Chief sends our troops into harm's way, we hope and pray each and every one of them will come back home unharmed. While we know this will not be possible, that knowledge does not lessen our shock and our sadness when we learn of the loss of lives.  My State of Maine has experienced two such losses since the war began. Last Saturday, I attended a memorial mass in Windsor, ME, in honor of the life and sacrifice of CPT Jay Aubin. CPT Jay Aubin and CPL Brian Kennedy, both proud members of the United States Marine Corps, perished in a helicopter crash in the Kuwaiti desert in the very first few days of the conflict. I met with the parents of both these brave marines, both of whom were present at this memorial mass last Saturday. Hundreds of Mainers gathered to pay tribute to the sacrifice of these brave marines and their families.  As I stand on the floor of the Senate, I once again want to assure their families we honor and recognize their service and their sacrifice. When we send a young man or woman into harm's way, our Nation has in return a sacred obligation to them and to their families. We must ensure they go forth with the utter and complete confidence, should the worst happen, should they be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice, that their country will care for their families and honor their service. The death gratuity is a small token, but it assists the grieving families with their immediate financial needs. There are a variety of other programs that provide for longer term support, but in the initial hours and days after a family has endured such a terrible loss, these funds help to alleviate monetary concerns. This benefit is commonly provided within 72 hours to the family of the service member who is killed while on active duty.  The last time the death gratuity was raised was in 1991 during the period of the gulf war when it was doubled from $3,000 to $6,000. With more than a decade having passed, it is time for Congress to move forward and increase this sum in recognition of those who are today fighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in the war against terrorism. It is the least we can do to honor their sacrifice. I offer this legislation in tribute to the families of those whose loved ones are today engaged in combat in the Persian Gulf. Too often we forget the sacrifices they make so that their loved one, their husband, wife, father, mother, brother, or sister, can serve our Nation. They are asked to accept long deployments and frequent moves while at the same time providing their loved one with the support they need to do their jobs.  Truly, what these families do is heroic. Passage of this legislation will send a clear and strong message to them that this Congress and this Nation is grateful for their sacrifice. Again, it is my hope we will pass this legislation by unanimous consent later this evening. In the meantime, my thoughts are with our troops as they fight in the battles in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the war against terrorism, and I pray they will soon return home in victory.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
