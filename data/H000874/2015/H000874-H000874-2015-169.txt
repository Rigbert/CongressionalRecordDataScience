He indicates that the appropriations process has started. First I want to say, as a Member who served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, I always thought we ought to start the appropriations process early, i.e., in May, but starting it, I think, is good news. We have had trouble on both sides getting all 12 appropriations bills--it used to be 13--12 appropriations bills done. So I congratulate the committee for initiating its work in a timely fashion.  Hopefully, Mr. Leader, that will lead to, hopefully, passing 12 bills in the regular order, which, as I pointed out last week with respect to some other legislation, will require the kind of bipartisanship that we saw displayed ultimately on the DHS bill, but certainly on the SGR bill, and then this week we had two bills pass with a bipartisan--both sides--majority voting for it. Hopefully, we will be able to do that on the appropriations bill.  I ask my friend on the MILCON, Military Construction bill, VA funding bill and on the Energy and Water bill, does the gentleman expect to follow what the gentleman and his party have indicated would be the process for appropriation bills under an open rule?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The answer to your question is ``yes.'' The gentleman does know, having been a part for many years of the appropriation process, that this is actually the earliest in the history of Congress we have ever started appropriations. It is our goal--I know it is your goal as well--to get all bills done through the House in regular order. It is something that we strive towards, and I thank the gentleman for his help.
