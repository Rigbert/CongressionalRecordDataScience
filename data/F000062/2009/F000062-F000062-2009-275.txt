 President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention a new report by Human Rights Watch entitled ``Burma's Forgotten Prisoners.''  The report offers moving and compelling stories of political activists in Burma who have put their lives and careers on the line to raise awareness about the human rights situation in their country.  In the face of threats, intimidation and beatings, they have embraced nonviolence to put pressure on the ruling military junta to respect the legitimate aspirations of the people of Burma and support a new government based on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.  We all have been inspired by the story of Burma's most famous political prisoner, Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the democratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi.  After leading the National League for Democracy to an overwhelming win in the 1990 parliamentary election--a victory quickly annulled by the military junta--she has spent the better part of the past 19 years in prison or under house arrest.  Recently, a Burmese court sentenced her to an additional 3 years of confinement on trumped up charges of violating the terms of her house arrest.  Yet despite the regime's best efforts, it has failed to stifle her will and her call for free and democratic Burma.  And it has failed to stop her from inspiring thousands of her fellow citizens to take up her cause.  The report by Human Rights Watch reminds us that while Suu Kyi is the most well-known democracy activist, she is by no means alone. In fact, the report notes that there are now more than 2,100 political prisoners in Burma; there are 43 prisons holding political activists in Burma and 50 labor camps; and beginning in late 2008, closed Burmese courts sentenced more than 300 activists to prison terms of, in some cases, more than 100 years for speaking out against the government and forming organizations.  Among those profiled are Zargana, one of Burma's most famous comedians, actors, and human rights activists, who was arrested and sentenced to 59 years in prison for criticizing thegovernment's response to Cyclone Nargis; U Gambira, a young Buddhist monk who was sentenced to 68 years in prison including 12 years of hard labor for playing a key role in the 2007 demonstrations which became known as the Saffron Revolution; Ma Su Su Nway, a prominent labor rights activist who was sentenced to 12\1/2\ years in prison for criticizing the government during the 2007 demonstrations; and Min Ko Kaing, a 46-year-old activist who has spent 17 of the past 20 years in prison, most of it in solitary confinement, for his political beliefs.  At a time when the regime is intent on moving forward with new elections based on a constitution that was drafted behind closed doors and would entrench the military as the country's dominant political force, it is important for us to remember that there are those in Burma who have a different vision.  These brave activists deserve our admiration and respect. More importantly, they deserve to know that we stand in solidarity with them and we will not rest and we will not remain silent until they are free.  I urge my colleagues to read the report and to once again call on the ruling State Peace and Development Council to release all political prisoners and begin a true dialogue on national reconciliation in Burma.                          ____________________
