Speaker, Taras Shevchenko has become one of the most influential figures in Ukrainian culture. His most famous compilation of poetic works, the Kobzar, became and continues to be the voice of liberty and national pride for generations of Ukrainians. Throughout his life, in his poetry and art, Shevchenko celebrated the unique beauty of his land and called for its liberation from the Russian Empire. He fought for the restoration of the democratic Kozak state and denounced the russification of the Ukrainian people. Because of his strong and vocal anti-Russian sentiment, Shevchenko was imprisoned numerous times and denied the right tocreate his genius. His spirit, however, remained unbroken; the hardships he endured only served to fuel his devotion and determination. He exhibited his passion for freedom in his poetry and fueled the hearts of Ukrainians toward the goal of independence. During today's commemoration let us honor the memory of Taras Shevchenko, and his unparalleled contribution to a strong, stable, democratic Ukraine.  The June 1964 unveiling of the Shevchenko monument in Washington DC was a major victory for Ukrainians residing in the United States. Despite incredible resistance from the Soviet Union, a united Ukrainian community in America was able to enlist the help of prominent American politicians, academicians and artists to build this monument and establish it as a forum for truth, unveiling the injustices of the Soviet regime.  Forty years later, Ukraine faces very different, albeit equally difficult times. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the reestablishment of Ukrainian independence, Ukraine has stabilized its economy and taken great strides toward democracy, however, there is still much to be accomplished. The people of Ukraine need support and encouragement. The Ukrainian community in the U.S. has been a very vocal advocate of Ukraine and continues to promote its democratic development. As a longtime supporter of the Ukrainian American community I am pleased to see a renewed effort to unite the Ukrainians in the United States and amplify the power of their voice in Washington as well as in Kyiv. I commend the initiative of the Ukrainian community in the United States in an effort to help Ukraine reclaim its proper place among the developed democratic European states.  I congratulate the Ukrainian American community on this remarkable anniversary and wish them success in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
