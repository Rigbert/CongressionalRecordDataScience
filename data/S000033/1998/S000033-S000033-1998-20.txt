 Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/4\ minutes. This amendment is cosponsored by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez). It increases funding for the Women's Demonstration Projects, currently known as the Women's Business Centers, from $4 million to $6 million for fiscal year 1999.  The Women's Business Centers currently have more than 60 centers in over two-thirds of the States. The centers offer financial management, marketing and technical assistance to current and potential women business owners. Each center tailors its style and offerings to the particular needs of its community. The SBA with the support of the Congress and the Administration plans to expand the program adding 30 new centers so that there will be a center in every State, including the State of Vermont.  Fostering the growth of small, women-owned businesses is a smart investment. Women are starting new firms at twice the rate of all other businesses and own more than one-third of all firms in the United States. They contribute $2.3 trillion to the economy. The 8 million women-owned firms employ 18.5 million people, or one in every five U.S. worker, and 35 percent more people in the United States than the Fortune 500 companies employ worldwide.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
