Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Colonel Andrew J. Frank who retired after 36 years of faithful service in the United States Army on September 30, 2014. As a fitting finale to his long and distinguished career, on July 28, 2014, Colonel Frank was awarded the National Intelligence Medal for Valor in recognition of his extraordinary heroism while serving in Afghanistan in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. As the Intelligence Community's second highest award, the National Intelligence Medal for Valor recognizes only the most exceptional acts of courage in the pursuit of intelligence community and national security objectives.  On the occasion of Colonel Frank's retirement to my home-state of Wisconsin, I would like to take a moment to underscore his heroic actions to the House.  On March 20, 2008, while serving as the Defense Intelligence Agency's Chief of the Defense Intelligence Support Organization in Afghanistan, Colonel Frank displayed unflinching leadership and bravery leading security activities for an inter-agency intelligence task force. Caught in an ambush by a numerically superior enemy force with a marked tactical advantage, Colonel Frank courageously disregarded his own safety, maneuvering through multiple kill zones over open terrain, on no less than seven occasions, to save the lives of his teammates, coalition soldiers, and civilian bystanders. He personally led the fire and maneuver of his team, rallied the Afghan National Police (ANP) to engage enemy forces, and heroically retrieved a critical resupply of ammunition desperately needed by his team. Colonel Frank's uncommon valor and determined leadership allowed his three-member team, trapped in two ambushes for over two and one half hours, to neutralize the enemy without a single loss of U.S. or ANP life. Colonel Frank's bravery under fire is in keeping with the finest traditions of military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the United States Intelligence Community.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation and my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Andrew and his family for their many years of faithful service and a job very well done. I wish them years of good fortune as they enjoy their retirement from military service in Wisconsin.                          ____________________
