 President, many Members of this House and thousands of residents of this city are familiar with Rehoboth Beach, DE, as the Summer Capital of the United States--and there's more to that expression than merely a nickname.  The Delaware seashore resort has for decades welcomed vacationing Presidents, Cabinet Secretaries, Members of Congress, representatives of the diplomatic community, and thousands of other Washingtonians of every description. Rehoboth Beach's attractions include its sparkling Atlantic surf; broad beaches; a lively, multi-lingual boardwalk echoing languages from all over the world; a faithfully family-oriented atmosphere; and safety in the water for younger and older visitors alike.  Next Saturday, in fact, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol--the courteous and skillful young women and men who protect the resort's ocean swimmers--will hold its first lifeguards' reunion, celebrating not only 75 years of service to the community and its visitors, but a remarkable three-quarter-century record of perfect safety of the swimmers under their protection. Since 1921, when the Rehoboth Beach Patrol was established with just two lifeguards, until today, when as many as 37 guards are on duty during peak periods along the mile and a half of protected beach, the Rehoboth Beach lifeguards have never lost a swimmer.  That is a record any beach patrol would be proud of, and it was not achieved by accident. Guarding a crowded ocean beach is a constant challenge--every summer the Rehoboth Beach lifeguards pull scores of troubled swimmers from the surf, treat hundreds of injuries, and reunite more than 400 lost children with their parents. It is a task that requires ceaseless alertness, well-conditioned bodies and highly trained skills, and unflinching personal courage when the ocean attempts to claim a victim.  It is more than just a job to those who undertake it. It is a valued tradition that has sustained Rehoboth Beach as a desirable ocean resort for 7 decades and has called to its service generations of families--fathers, brothers and, since the late seventies, sisters--from Delaware, from its neighboring States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and from this very city.  These young men and women are athletes who thrive on competition, and their competitive instincts pit them every day against the sea, and often, to heighten their morale and sharpen their skills, against other beach patrols in national and international contests. They train constantly; they dedicate their days to the safety of others, often at the risk of their own; and their service is vital to the pleasure and the security of the hundreds of thousands of vacationers who visit Rehoboth Beach every summer.  Mr. President, we Delawareans are very proud of the Rehoboth Beach Patrol and its 75-year record of perfect safety. We believe these brave young women and men represent the best that Delaware and the Nation have to offer in the way of idealism, energy and a willingness to risk all in the service of others. And we invite our neighbors in the Middle Atlantic States to join us in congratulating the Rehoboth Beach Patrol and its Alumni Association for calling together for the first time lifeguards who have served the resort over the past 75 years, including a 91-year-old who last mounted a guard stand in 1926 as well as the 46 current members of the patrol.  They deserve our admiration and our thanks, and we all wish them a successful and rewarding reunion this week.                          ____________________
