 President, on another matter, later today we will consider the nomination of Dana Baiocco, the President's choice to join the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Ms. Baiocco's resume speaks for itself. After receiving her J.D. cum laude from Duquesne University, she clerked in the Western District of Pennsylvania before launching an impressive career in private practice.  For two decades she has stood at the center of complicated cases and gained national recognition for her mastery of the legal questions surrounding consumer safety. This experience makes Ms. Baiocco an ideal candidate to help the CPSC protect consumers effectively and efficiently without imposing unnecessary barriers to free enterprise.  Testifying before our colleagues on the Commerce Committee, she pledged to seek that balance with ``transparency'' and an ``open door policy'' and to remain ``guided by the rule of law.''  I look forward to advancing this qualified nominee when we vote this afternoon and urge all of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________
