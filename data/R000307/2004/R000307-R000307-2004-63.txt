President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a vital member of the Intelligence Committee, be recognized for 5 minutes. Senator Warner is a previous member of the Intelligence Committee, now again on the Intelligence Committee, and he is chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He has a unique perspective to offer my colleagues. Is 5 minutes appropriate?
