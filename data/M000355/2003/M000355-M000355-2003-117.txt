 Last year is the first year since the Budget Act was passed when the Senate didn't pass a budget. Last year, the leadership--I was about to get into that--didn't pass a budget and failed to enact all but two of the appropriations bills. They had plenty of time and energy to complain about jobs, and they did nothing about them.  The results are very different this year. We passed a jobs program, and today more Americans are at work than any time in U.S. history, a record 138 million jobs. This new leadership stands in sharp contrast to the past leadership.  Last year, the old leadership stalled desperately needed legislation on homeland security. For months, they could not decide whether to reduce or increase the President's power to fight terrorism. It took an election to break that deadlock. To use the Democratic leadership's words, it took the American people to say that amateur hour was over, and that is what the American people said a year ago.  These are the facts of leadership. When the margin of the majority is the same but the record of accomplishment is so different, the answer can only be leadership. A one-vote majority this year versus a one-vote majority lastyear, and I would argue the big difference is the leadership of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader.  I don't believe these types of attacks help in any way to advance the important business of the American people, the business they, in fact, elected us to do. The people want results, not name calling. We need to focus on the job, stop hurling epithets, stop the blame game, and instead complete the work the American people sent us here to do.  We all know that the last 2 weeks of this session are going to have ample opportunity for tension and disagreement. We have probably been together about as long as we ought to be this year, but the job is going to be finished by November 21, and it would be a lot easier if we could keep our rhetoric in check and not say things in the passion of the moment that we subsequently regret.  Much work remains to be done. We intend to accomplish the major tasks remaining for this year prior to Thanksgiving, and we are well on our way to doing that.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
