 President, on another matter, I want to speak for a minute on the failure of fast-track trade negotiating authority for the President of the United States and the action of the House of Representatives this past weekend.  Last week, the Senate voted by a margin of 68 to 31 to proceed to debate on the fast-track bill. I believe without a doubt it would have passed here and would have been passed by a very huge bipartisan margin. But the leadership in the House decided not to bring the bill to a vote and risk a defeat on such an important issue for our Nation. The leadership of the House decided that on the advice of the President of the United States because he could not deliver even 20 percent of the Democrat vote, the vote of his own party, in the other body.  Unfortunately, the result is the same. The President of the United States still does not have the negotiating authority that every other President since Gerald Ford has had. How ironic that the Democratic-controlled Congresses in the past granted fast-track authority to a Republican President--such as Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush--and yet Democrats in this Congress refuse to give the President, a President from their own party, the same authority. Who would have thought that the President could not convince one-fifth of his own party to vote with him on such an important issue? This was a big win for leaders of labor unions in Washington. They proved that they have more influence with Democrats in the House of Representatives than the President of the United States does. But it was not a win for the rank and file union members, the workers who manufacture the products or perform the services that would be exported throughout the world.  It was not a win for the farmers of America either who increasingly depend on foreign markets for a big share of their income. It was a big loss for working men and women of this country.  I know some may question my qualifications for drawing these conclusions. You might say, how can a Republican Senator substitute his judgment for that of labor leaders? So I would like to read a few quotes from a Washington Post editorial of November 11.  As you know, Mr. President, the Washington Post has often taken theside of labor against Republican policies. So I believe they might have some credibility on this issue, as well.  Labor opposed fast track because they believe that liberalized trade leads to American companies relocating to other countries and American workers losing their jobs to imports. They also argued that fast track was flawed because it didn't give the President authority to force other countries to adopt our labor and environmental standards.  The Washington Post, for one, believes that the lack of fast-track authority actually makes it more likely that Americans will lose their jobs. The Washington Post says that the President, not having negotiating authority, makes it more likely that American workers will lose their jobs.       . . . while fast track's defeat may be good news for a few      unions . . . it certainly doesn't help the vast majority of      American workers. With the President less able to knock down      trade barriers overseas, U.S. manufacturing firms will have      more, not less, incentive to relocate, to get footholds,      inside closed markets.  That bears repeating, Mr. President. Without fast track, companies have more incentive to relocate. That's because high trade barriers may prohibit U.S. companies from exporting to a foreign market. In order to sell in that area the company would actually relocate there.  Why would we want a trade policy in this country that would make an American company go to some other country to make a product to sell in that country, when if you reduce the barriers in that other country through these negotiations, that company could stay in America and export to that country and become competitive?  Just within the last 2 weeks, I had a CEO of a major corporation in Des Moines, IA, our capital city, who said if the President doesn't get this authority and the barrier to Chile reduced through trade or through trade negotiations, then he was going to have to move there to build to do the business in South America that he wants to do.  The United States has one of the most open economies in the world. Our average tariff is just 2.8 percent. Many other countries have virtually closed markets. According to the World Bank, for instance, China's average tariff is 23 percent; Thailand, 26 percent; the Philippines, 19 percent; Peru, 15 percent; Chile, a flat 11 percent tariff.  It can be difficult for American companies to export to a country like China that places a 23-percent tariff on our goods. The tariff prices our goods out of the market. One alternative for these companies is to actually move their plants to China and avoid paying that tariff.  The preferred alternative, Mr. President, and the one that is going to benefit American workers and, hence, benefit the entire economy, because American workers are very productive, is obviously to negotiate with China to lower tariffs, bring their tariffs down to our level. Then the companies can stay here, employ American workers and export their goods to China.  But we can't negotiate these tariffs down without the President fast-track authority. That is why fast track is so important. It leads to lower tariffs in foreign countries. Most importantly, it leads to the preservation of American jobs.  Fast track also leads to the creation of new jobs. Exports already support 11 million jobs in this country. Each additional $1 billion of sales of services or manufactured products creates between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs. These jobs pay 15 percent to 20 percent higher than non-export-related jobs. In Iowa, companies that export provide their employees 32 percent greater benefits than nonexporting companies.  All of this is in jeopardy without our passing a bill giving the President the authority to negotiate. As the Washington Post puts it, ``[w]ith exports growing more slowly, or not at all, fewer new jobs will be created.'' So the failure of fast track hurts the workers of this country.  Mr. President, the editorial has one final comment on labor's concerns with worker standards in other countries. ``Less trade certainly won't improve the standards of overseas workers, for whose welfare many Democrats claimed concern. And with the United States Government hamstrung, Japan, the European Union and developing countries will have a greater influence in shaping world trade policies. How hard do you think they'll push for improved labor and environmental standards?''  Mr. President, I don't often say that the Washington Post is right. Economic stability and prosperity are the only proven means of increasing labor and environmental standards. The United States, due to our affluence, has the luxury of imposing high labor and environmental standards. Other countries don't yet have this ability. But increased trade will bring this economic stability, and it will lead to higher labor and environmental standards in other countries as well.  Cutting off trade, or failing to pass this legislation, reduces our influence in these other countries and it increases the influence of countries such as Japan and the European Union. Can we trust Japan and the European Union to advance America's interests in world trading negotiations? The Washington Post correctly assumed that we cannot. Only the President of the United States, and the Congress working in conjunction with him, because that is what this legislation can do, can advance our interests and protect our interests. Only we can influence other countries to improve their environment and labor standards, to improve human rights, and to embrace democracy through the process of international trade that brings people together rather than keeping people apart.  That is what I am most concerned about. The failure of fast track leaves a vacuum of leadership in international issues. Up until now, this vacuum had been filled by the United States. Ever since World War II, to some extent going back to the Reciprocity Act of the 1930's, since 1934, the United States has led the world in reducing barriers to trade, and we have benefited greatly from this leadership.  American workers are the most productive, highest paid workers in the world. American companies produce the highest quality products. And American consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their income on necessities such as food than consumers in any other country. These are the benefits that we have enjoyed because we have been willing to lead on trade.  I'm afraid that our leadership may now be questioned by our trading partners after last weekend's events. These countries are going to move on without us. They are going to continue to form regional and bilateral trading arrangements that won't include the United States. The United States won't be at the table to protect our interests. And the losers in all of this will be the American workers, the loss of jobs, and the consumers won't have the benefit that they now have.  Mr. President, I hope we can return next year and we can have a rational debate about what trade means to this country--because somehow that has been lost in the process--and how important it is for the President of the United States to have fast track authority, to be the living representation of America's moral leadership, to lead in free and fair trade, which we have done for 40 or 50 years.  We have already lost 3 full years without this legislation and the opportunity to lead; 20 agreements we have missed out on. We cannot afford to wait any longer.  I ask that the Washington Post editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 11, 1997]                          The Fast-Track Loss       Trade liberalization benefits most people, but it also      invariably hurts a few. Those who are helped--as goods become      cheaper, as standards of living rise, as exports grow--often      don't attribute their good fortune to rising trade, which is      after all only one component of a complex economy. Those who      have lost their jobs or believe they have lost their jobs to      overseas competition, on the other hand, don't hesitate to      affix blame. In the political process, the losers and      potential losers naturally lobby vociferously; the winners, a      larger but more diffuse group, don't. To rise above the      special interests of the losers (while taking into      consideration their legitimate needs) and vote in the overall      interest of society is what we should expect of our      politicians--it has something to do with statesmanship. And      until now, every Congress since President Ford's time has      managed to do just that. But this Congress, in failing early      Monday morning to approve     trade-negotiating authority for President Clinton, did the      opposite--it caved in to the special pleaders. Washington      insiders will measure the defeat in its impact on Mr.      Clinton--whether it spells the beginning of his lame-     duckhood, and all the rest. But the more serious damage is to      U.S. economic leadership--America's ability to help shape the      global rule book--and, potentially, to global economic      prosperity.       The post mortems will find no shortage of culprits. Mr.      Clinton overpromised on NAFTA and underdelivered on the      promises he made to Congress to win NAI approval. He waited      too long to push for renewed negotiating authority--known as      ``fast track,'' because it allows him to negotiate treaties      that Congress can reject but not amend--and then don't even      have legislation ready when he finally, this fall, began the      campaign for what he called his most important legislative      priority. More broadly, his inconstancy over the years left      many members of Congress unwilling to put faith in his      promises and assurances. Businesses, which generally support      free trade, jumped into the fight too late and too half-     heartedly. And 25 Republicans congressmen who could have      provided the margin of victory but who withheld their backing      in a failed effort to extort support from Mr. Clinton for an      unrelated (and unjustified) proposal to gut America's family-     planning assistance overseas, also bear responsibility.       But of course the lion's share of blame--or credit, as they      would have it--goes to Mr. Clinton's fellow Democrats and      their backers in organized labor. In the end, fewer than 45      of 205 House Democrats were ready to stand by their      president. In part, this reflects the growing importance of      union contributions to political campaigns. Since the      Democrats lost control of the House, businesses have shifted      their giving heavily to Republicans; total Democratic      receipts from political action committees have gone down, and      the union share has gone up--to 46 percent in 1996.       Of course, most Democrats said they were voting on the      merits, not the dollars. But while fast track's defeat may be      good news for a few unions, such as in the textile trades--     though even that is arguable--it certainly doesn't help the      majority of American workers. With the president less able to      knock down trade barriers overseas, U.S. manufacturing firms      will have more, no less, incentive to relocate, to get      footholds inside closed markets. With exports growing more      slowly, or not at all, fewer new jobs will be created. Less      trade certainly won't help improve the standards of overseas      workers, for whose welfare many Democrats claimed concern.      And with U.S. government hamstrung Japan, the European Union      and developing countries will have a greater influence in      shaping world trade policies. How hard do you think they'll      push for improved labor and environments standards?       Mr. Clinton yesterday withdrew his proposal before it could      go down to defeat, and he said he intends to try again in      this Congress. The signs are not auspicious, but you never      know. Maybe next time the greater good will prevail.
