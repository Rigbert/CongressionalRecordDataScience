President, I am delighted that the report is finally available for S. 507, The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 17 to 1 in favor of a Hatch-Leahy substitute to this bill on May 22. I urge all Members to take the time to learn about this legislation, which is designed to assist American innovation.  The Omnibus Patent Act would reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. The bill would:  Reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies;  Slash redtape in the Patent and Trademark Office;  Increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and  Facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions.  In Vermont, we have a wide variety of independent inventors and small companies. It is especially important to me that this bill help them as well as larger, more specialized firms. I have spoken with independent inventors and representatives of smaller companies to learn what reforms they recommended. I have tried to ensure that their recommendations were incorporated into the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment that was reported by the Judiciary Committee.  I am especially gratified that the Hatch-Leahy substitute responds to the concerns of independent inventors and small businesses concerning the matter of 18-month publication. These concerns were articulated at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by the president of the Vermont Inventors Association, Bill Parker. Mr. Parker suggested giving applicants who only file in the United States a choice whether or not to publish early. He also recommended that we enhance the protections granted to those who choose 18-month publication if we wish to encourage them to take that course.  The substitute does both of these things. In particular, it allows any applicant to avoid publication before the granting of the patent simply by making such a request upon filing the application and by certifying that the application has not--and will not--be published abroad. The substitute also provides for the issuance of patents on individual claims in published applications as they are approved, rather than waiting for the disposition of all claims contained in such an application, asnow occurs. This allows applicants to gain full patent protection--including reasonable royalties, damages, and attorneys fees when appropriate--for some of their component inventions earlier than they would have under the original draft of the bill.  I was also concerned that, as introduced, the bill did not adequately protect an applicant who is diligently prosecuting a patent but whose application takes more than 3 years to process. The ability to have a full 17 years of patent protection is important to small and large patent applicants alike. The Hatch-Leahy substitute makes clear than a applicant who diligently prosecutes a patent application before the PTO should receive a full 17 years of patent protection.  Another matter of special importance to me is the section I suggested be added in the Hatch-Leahy substitute to enhance access to patent information. I have long thought that electronic access should be more widespread, and I want to work with the Patent and Trademark Office to ensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic accessibility of patent information in rural Sates and eventually in all areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make further advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, which is only now getting a patent and trademark depository library.  Although the goal of the reexamination provisions--reducing legal bills for patent applicants--was laudable, I was concerned that the legislation protect again harassment by third parties. The Hatch-Leahy substitute enhances protection against harassment by strengthening the estoppel provisions, to prevent a party from raising an issue that was raised or could have been raised in one forum from raising it in some other forum thereafter. In this way, the reexamination provision in the Hatch-Leahy substitute will provide an alternative to the current costly and time-consuming process of Federal litigation and, at the same time, protect patent applicants against undue harassment.  I am also glad that the substitute amendment clarifies that it is not the Senate Judiciary Committee's intent to undercut the Copyright Office in any way. The Copyright Office has served this country well for over a hundred years, and it should continue in that role.  Vermont has a great tradition of ``Yankee ingenuity.'' In fact, the very first U.S. patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, a native of Pittsford, VT, who discovered a process for making potash. Today's inventors can be much like the inventors of Thomas Jefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage, or home lab. They can also be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our colleges and universities. Our Nation's patent laws should be fair to American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists, and larger corporations. To maintain America's preeminence in the realm of technology, which dates back to the birth of this republic, we need to modernize our patent system and patent office. Our inventors know this and that is why they support this legislation.  I am delighted that our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has joined as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to Senate consideration of S. 507 without delay.                          ____________________
