President, today I proudly rise to introduce The Natural Gas Production Act of 2005.  One of the challenges facing our economy is increasing energy prices. Take, for example, natural gas that accounts for 22 percent of American energy consumption. According to the Energy Information Administration, over the next 20 years, U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by over 50 percent. At the same time, U.S. natural gas production will only grow by 14 percent. At a time when natural gas prices are already at an all time high, it is critical that we increase our supply by developing our domestic natural gas.  This legislation will provide an incentive to increase the supply of domestically produced natural gas, which in turn will help alleviate high natural gas prices.  The Natural Gas Production Act of 2005 will add natural gas produced from formations more than 15,000 feet deep (Deep Gas), to the list of qualifying fuels for the Section 29 non-conventional tax credit. Experts consider deep gas drilling at more than 15,000 feet to be a non-conventional source of energy production.  Studies show the resource potential below 15,000 feet for natural gas is great. The Department of Energy's Strategic Center for Natural Gas has estimated there to be 130 trillion cubic feet below 15,000 feet in the lower 48. In comparison, that is equal to the proven and potential reserves on the Alaskan North Slope.  While these vast reserves remain, very little production is occurring from depths greater than 15,000. Deep gas wells require a considerable amount of time and money. On average these wells cost more than $6.1 million, and for wells deeper than 20,000 feet costs can exceed $16 million. Add to that the minimum one-year and longer drilling time and you can clearly see that Federal drilling incentives are needed to help promote and speed production of this enormous potential resource.  To drill a deep well, a drilling rig will employ about 25 people directly. In 1979, 128 deep well completions in Oklahoma created 2,630 jobs. In addition to direct jobs, economists estimate that 60 to 75 indirect jobs will be created as well.  Due to changes in the regulatory governance of the industry and cyclical market conditions over the next two and one-half decades, deep drilling activity all across the country has declined substantially.  I am introducing this legislation, along with Senator Vitter, today to encourage more domestic production in an area of proven reserves that will increase our supply. I thank Senator Vitter for his work and I urge members to support us in this effort. I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  If you have any questions, please contact Mike Ference on my Staff at 224-1036.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 926       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Natural Gas Production Act      of 2005''.     SEC. 2. CREDIT FOR PRODUCING FUEL FROM NONCONVENTIONAL SOURCE                    TO APPLY TO GAS PRODUCED ONSHORE FROM                    FORMATIONS MORE THAN 15,000 FEET DEEP.       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (B) of section 29(c)(1) of      the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified fuels)      is amended by striking ``or'' at the end of clause (i), by      striking ``and'' at the end of clause (ii) and inserting      ``or'', and by inserting after clause (ii) the following new      clause:       ``(iii) an onshore well from a formation more than 15,000      feet deep, and''.       (b) Eligible Wells.--Section 29 of such Code is amended by      adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(h) Eligible Deep Gas Wells.--In the case of a well      producing qualified fuel described in subsection (B)(iii)--       ``(1) for purposes of subsection (f)(1)(A), such well shall      be treated as drilled before January 1, 1993, if such well is      drilled after the date of the enactment of this subsection,      and       ``(2) subsection (f)(2) shall not apply.''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of the      enactment of this Act.                                 ______                                       By
