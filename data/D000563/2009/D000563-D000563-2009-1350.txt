I rise to speak in support of that nomination.  The Justice Department and our Nation are fortunate that President Obama has put forward this nomination. Mr. Ogden has the experience, the talent, and the judgment needed for this critical position.  The Deputy Attorney General is the No. 2 person at the Justice Department. He is the day-to-day manager of the entire agency. This includes supervising key national security and law enforcement offices such as the FBI and our counterterrorism operations. Mr. Ogden is a graduate of Harvard Law School, former law clerk to a Supreme Court Justice, which is one of the most prestigious jobs in the legal profession. He had three senior positions in the Janet Reno Justice Department and served as her Chief of Staff, Associate Deputy Attorney General, and also served as Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division, a position for which he received unanimous confirmation by this Senate. Mr. Ogden also served as the Deputy General Counsel at the Defense Department.  Given this excellent background, it is not surprising that David Ogden gained the support of many prominent conservatives. At least 15 former officials of the Reagan and both Bush administrations have announced their support for his nomination. They include Larry Thompson, the first Deputy Attorney General of the most recent Bush administration; Peter Keisler, former high-level Justice Department official; and Rachel Brand, another high-level Justice Department official in the Bush administration. Their words are similar. I will not read into the Record each of their statements, but they give the highest possible endorsement to David Ogden.  Due to a scheduling conflict, I could not attend his hearing, but I asked him to come by my office so we could have time together and I could ask my questions face to face. We talked about a lot of subjects, including criminal justice reform, human rights, and the professional responsibilities of the Department of Justice lawyers. I was impressed by Mr. Ogden's intellect, his management experience, and his commitment to restoring the Justice Department's independence and integrity.  We talked about the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, a subcommittee I will chair in the 111th Congress, and the issues we are going to face--including the Mexican drug cartels, which will be the subject of a hearing in just a few days, racial disparities in the criminal justice system in America, and the urgent need for prison reform. That is an issue, I might add, that is near and dear to the heart of our colleague, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. I am going to try to help him move forward in an ambitious effort to create a Presidential commission to look into this.  The Justice Department will play an important role in reclaiming America's mantle as the world's leading champion for human rights. Mr. Ogden and I discussed the Justice Department's role in implementing President Obama's Executive orders in relation to the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities and review of detention and interrogation policies. We discussed the investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, as to the attorneys in that Department who authorized the use of abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and I requested this investigation. Mr. Ogden committed to us that he would provide Congress with the results of the investigation as soon as possible. This is the kind of transparency and responsiveness to congressional oversight we expect from the Justice Department and something that we have been waiting for.  We also discussed the Justice Department's role in ensuring that war criminals do not find safe haven in the United States. I worked with Senator Coburn who is a Republican from Oklahoma, on the other side of the aisle. We passed legislation allowing the Justice Department to prosecute the perpetrators of genocide and other war crimes in the U.S. courts. I believe Mr. Ogden appreciates the importance of enforcing these human rights laws.  At the end of our meeting, I felt confident David Ogden will be an excellent Deputy Attorney General.  I want to make one final point. There is some controversy associated with his appointment that I would like to address directly. I am aware there has been some criticism that David Ogden represented clients whom some consider controversial. He has been criticized in his representation of libraries and bookstores who sought first amendment free speech protections, and for his representation of a client in an abortion rights case.  I would like to call to the attention of those critics a statement that was made by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, when he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee several years ago at his confirmation hearing.  He was asked about the positions he had advocated on behalf of his clients as an attorney. Here is what the Chief Justice told us:       It's a tradition of the American Bar Association that goes      back before the founding of the country that lawyers are not      identified with the positions of their clients. The most      famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the      British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that      for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution      in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule      of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.  And he went on to say:       That principle, that you don't identify the lawyer with the      particular views of the client, or the views that the lawyer      advances on behalf of a client, is critical to the fair      administration of justice.  You practiced law, Madam President. I have too. Many times you find yourself in a position representing a client where you do not necessarily agree with their position before the court of law. But you are dutybound to bring that position before the court so the rule of law can be applied and a fair outcome would result. If we only allowed popular causes and popular people representation in this country, I am afraid justice would not be served.  Chief Justice Roberts made that point when he was being asked about his representation of legal clients. I would say to many on the other side of the aisle who are questioning David Ogden's reputation, they owe the same fairness to him that was given to Chief Justice Roberts in that hearing.  I would remind the conservative critics of Mr. Ogden, look carefully at that testimony. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  After 8 years of a Justice Department that often put politics over principle, we now have a chance to confirm a nominee with strong bipartisan support who can help restore the Justice Department to its rightful role as guardian of our laws and the protector of our liberties.  David Ogden has the independence, integrity, and experience for the job. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for his nomination to be Deputy Attorney General.
