Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank my esteemed colleague, Senator Frank Murkowski, for his hard work on this important piece of legislation. Recognition should also go to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.Bass) for his efforts on a companion House bill. Both of these men are to be congratulated for constructing this commendable piece of legislation.  S. 1367 is a simple bill that would modify the boundary and increase appropriations for the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site in the State of New Hampshire. Dedicated to the great American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, this historic site was the first park dedicated to an artist. Authorized in 1964, the site consists of 150 acres of land, 11 historic buildings, 15 acres of wetlands, 2.5 miles of trails, and a large collection of the artist's original artworks.  This is a good bill that will help bring much-needed improvements to one of our Nation's most unique and beautiful national historic sites.  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1367.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
