 President, I am pleased to join Senators Moran and King in reintroducing the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2013. This legislation comes in response to a Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act, which requires veterinarians to treat animals with controlled substances at the location in which they are registered. This interpretation of the law is very burdensome to both farmers and veterinarians, and it shows a lack of common sense by the DEA. In many cases a sick animal such as a horse, cow or pig cannot be transported to the veterinarian's office, and has to be treated on the farm or even in the pasture. When a larger animal is ill and needs treatment it has been common practice for the veterinarian to make a house call to treat the affected animal. The ability for veterinarians to make house calls is a key component in the ability to effectively treat livestock animals.  I am very concerned about the problems we face in the diversion of controlled substances especially powerful narcotics. However, efforts to control the diversion of controlled substances need to take into account the needs of legitimate patients whether human or livestock. Forcing a farmer to load a sick animal into a trailer for a trip to the veterinarian's office is not a practical solution to ward off the diversion of controlled substances. Rules governing the use and transportation of controlled substances must be practical and not overly burdensome. In the case of veterinary medicine the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act of 2013 strikes the right balance.  This legislation allows a veterinarian to transport a controlled substance ``in the usual course of veterinary medicine practice at a site other than the registrants registered principal place of business or professional practice.'' The bill also requires the veterinarian to only dispense controlled substances in a State where they are licensed to practice veterinary medicine, which will help to eliminate the transportation of controlled substances across State lines. I have heard from numerous veterinarians and other stakeholders that this bill is needed in order to provide certainty that our veterinarians will be able to use the necessary tools available to them without interference from the DEA. Overly burdensome regulations can have a detrimental impact on businesses in this country. This is an instance of the Federal Government not using common sense, and causing unnecessary problems for the people responsible for maintaining the health of our Nation's livestock herds. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense bill.                          ____________________
