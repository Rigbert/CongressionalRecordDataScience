President, consistent with Senate standing orders and my policy of publishing in the Congressional Record a statement whenever I place a hold on legislation, I am announcing my intention to object to any unanimous consent request to proceed to legislation extending any expiring laws that does not include extension of unemployment benefits and COBRA health insurance benefits.  Last night, there was an attempt to extend some laws that expire at the end of the month without extending the enhanced unemployment insurance and COBRA health insurance benefits that were enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. I objected to that attempt.  I did so because Oregon currently has one of the highest unemployment rates in the Nation with an unemployment rate of 11 percent. Extension of unemployment benefits is critical for many unemployed Oregonians who are in jeopardy of running out of benefits if they are not extended before the end of this month. What's worse, many jobless Oregonians and unemployed workers in other States lose their health benefits when they lose their jobs, leaving them without either income or health care. In order to ensure unemployed workers in Oregon and other States will not be left without these critical, lifeline benefits, I am announcing my objection to any unanimous consent to extend other expiring laws, unless extension of unemployment benefits and COBRA benefits are included as part of the legislation.  I have no objection to the Senate proceeding to H.R. 4213 to provide for certain extenders because extension of unemployment and COBRA benefits are included as part of that legislation.                          ____________________
