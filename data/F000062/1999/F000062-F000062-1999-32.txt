 President, I rise to speak today about the untimely death of Sacramento Mayor Joe Serna. This past Sunday, November 7, 1999, the City of Sacramento and the State of California lost an inspirational public servant and a great statesman. The death of Mayor Serna represents a loss for all of those who had the honor to know him, and for the entire City of Sacramento.  Mayor Serna had a distinguished public career, culminating in the election as Mayor of our State's Capital City in 1992. He served his country and his community as an educator, Peace Corps worker and public servant. He was a man of compassionate spirit, dedicated ideals and principled acts.  Mayor Serna's accomplishments, both personally and professionally, are many. Here are a few highlights:  1966--Earned his Bachelor's degree in Social Science and Government at California State University, Sacramento.  1966--Earned his Master's degree in Political Science at University of California, Davis.  1966--Served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala.  1969--Joined the faculty at California State University, Sacramento.  1975--Served as Education Advisor to then-Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally.  1981--Elected to the Sacramento City Council, where he would serve 11 years.  1991--Received the Distinguished Faculty Award.  1992--Elected as Mayor of Sacramento.  1995--Received the Economic Development Leadership Award by the National Council for Urban Economic Development.  1996--Reelected as Mayor of Sacramento.  1998--Led the effort for the redevelopment of downtown Sacramento.  1998--Received an honorary doctorate degree from Golden Gate University.  I have known Mayor Serna for many years, and he was a visionary for Sacramento and the region.  Mayor Serna led California's Capital City toward a more positive and prosperous direction. He was extremely dedicated to the economic revitalization and redevelopment of Sacramento. Under his leadership, the Sacramento City Council helped to revitalize the downtown community, the region's heart and center. He appointed the first Council of Economic Advisors to help frame the City's economic agenda. In addition, Mayor Serna assembled a negotiating team that preserved the Sacramento Kings, the region's National Basketball Association Team, when the King's owners threatened to move the team out of town.  Mayor Serna was not only an honorable mayor, he was also a role model to the Latino community and an inspiration to all Californians. He was the first Latino elected as mayor of one of California's major cities, exemplifying the success that one can attain through education, hard work, and commitment--regardless of ethnicity. I believe Mayor Serna transcended ethnic politics without every losing sight of his ethnic background and his humble beginnings.  Mayor Serna grew up working in the fields of San Joaquin County. In the early 1960's he was an activist with the United Farm Workers, fighting for farm workers and for disadvantaged people. He went on to earn his bachelor's degree in Social Science and his master's degree in Political Science. He later entered the Peace Corps to serve the people in Guatemala as a community-development volunteer. Mayor Serna went on to became a professor at California State University in Sacramento and then served his community as Mayor of the City of Sacramento.  Along the way, he helped to inspire a host of talented Latino elected officials at all levels of government. Community leaders such San Joaquin County Supervisor Steve Gutierrez, State Senator Deborah Ortiz, and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante attribute their participation in public service in part to the example and inspiration of Joe Serna.  As Supervisor Steve Gutierrez said, ``Mayor Serna went from being a farm worker to organizer to an educator to mayor of Sacramento. He was truly an exemplary public servant and leader.''  Most recently, I had the pleasure to meet with Mayor Serna in Sacramento just hours after a heinous shooting had occurred at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. We had an opportunity to discuss at length the issue of hate crimes and other regional issues. Mayor Serna was passionate about his community and he deeply cared for its people. Even until his final days, he worked for a better life for his fellow citizens.  Joe Serna leaves a powerful legacy in many lives and a lasting vision for his beloved city of Sacramento. He was a dynamic leader, and we Californians were fortunate for his service. Mayor Serna will be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Isabel, the entire Serna family, and the community of Sacramento.                          ____________________
