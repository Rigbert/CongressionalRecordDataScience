Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 4721, a bill to provide for all right, title, and interest in and to certain property in Washington County, Utah, to be vested in the United States.                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4721, an act to      provide for all right, title, and interest in and to certain      property in Washington County, Utah, to be vested in the      United States.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them, The CBO staff contacts are John R.      Righter (for federal costs), and Lauren Marks (for the      private-sector impact).           Sincerely,                                                 Barry B. Anderson                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).       Enclosure.     H.R. 4721--An act to provide for all right, title, and          interest in and to certain property in Washington County,          Utah, to be vested in the United States       H.R. 4721 would transfer about 1,550 acres in real property      in Washington County, Utah, to the federal government. As      compensation for the government's taking of private property,      the legislation would provide an immediate payment of $15      million, with a subsequent amount to be paid to Environmental      Land Technology, Ltd., the property owner, at a later date.      The amount of the second payment would depend, in part, on      whether the federal government could negotiate a settlement      with the property owner.       Under a negotiated settlement, the second payment would      include the difference between the property's appraised value      and the initial payment of $15 million, plus interest accrued      from the date of the legislation's enactment. Alternatively,      if the amount of the second payment is decided in a court of      law, it would include the remaining property value as      determined by the court, accrued interest, reasonable      expenses of holding The property from February 1990 to the      date of the final payment, and reasonable court costs and      attorneys' fees. The legislation would provide the full faith      and credit of the United States to make such payments without      farther appropriation.       CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4721 would increase direct      spending by $15 million in fiscal year 2001. The amount of      the second payment is uncertain and will probably be      determined in court. Based on information from the Bureau of      Land Management (BLM), CBO estimates that a second payment of      $43 million would be made in 2002. The estimated total of $58      million is the midpoint between the government's and the      property owner's estimates of the property's value (between      $30 million and $70 million), plus accrued interest and      reasonable property and court-related expenses. This estimate      assumes that, based on the wide difference in their estimates      of the property's value, the two sides would be unable to      negotiate an out-of-court settlement. Because H.R. 4721 would      affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.      The changes in direct spending are shown in the following      table.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      By fiscal year, in millions of dollars                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   2001    2002    2003    2004    2005    2006    2007    2008    2009    2010----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Changes in outlays..............      15      43       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0Changes in roceipts.............

In addition, because it is possible that BLM would have      purchased the property under current law using funds      appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund,      implementing the legislation could reduce the need for future      appropriations.       H.R. 4721 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined      in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose      no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 4721      would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, on      the property owner who would be required to confer his      property to the, federal government, CBO estimates that the      cost of complying with the mandate would fall below the      annual threshold established by UMRA ($109 million in 2000,      adjusted annually for inflation).       The legislation would require, 30 days after enactment, the      landowner to confer to the United States all right, title,      and interest in and to, his property located within and      adjacent to the Red Cliffs Reserve. That requirement would be      a mandate as defined in UMRA. The cost of complying with the      mandate would be the fair market value of the land, expenses      incurred and lost interest in transferring the property to      the federal government, and the costs of relocating.      Estimates of the value of the property range between $30      million and $70 million. Thus, CBO expects that the direct      costs of complying with the mandate would fall below the      threshold established by UMRA ($109 million for private-     sector mandates in 2000, adjusted annually for inflation).      The legislation provides that, in exchange for his land, the      landowner would receive an initial payment $15 million, as      well as a subsequent payment to be determined either through      a negotiated settlement or through litigation.       On October 10, 2000, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for S.      2873, a similar bill reported by the Senate Committee on      Energy and Natural Resources on October 2, 2000. CBO's two      cost estimates are identical.       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are John R.      Righter (for federal costs) and Lauren Marks (for the      private-sector impact). This estimate was approved by Peter      H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
