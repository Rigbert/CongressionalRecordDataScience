President, the Benton County Drug Treatment Court is a shining example of our Nation's drug court system. As one of only 10 mentor courts in the Nation, the Benton County Drug Treatment Court serves as a model program for the over 2,500 treatment courts in the United States. This achievement is especially significant given that the Benton County Drug Treatment Court started as an ambitious pilot program only 10 years ago.  The positive impact drug treatment courts have on individuals, families, and communities throughout our country is remarkable. Due to tireless efforts underway since the first drug court was established over 20 years ago, there is now a system in place which, if completed, reduces the likelihood of drug relapse for individuals, provides increased housing stability, and brings families together. The positive outcomes from completion of drug courts are well documented and benefit those outside the system as well by reducing costs to the taxpayer.  Congratulations to the Benton Country Drug Court on their 10th anniversary. Because of innovative solutions like drug courts, our country is one step closer to breaking the cycle of addiction which has plagued our country for far too long.                          ____________________
