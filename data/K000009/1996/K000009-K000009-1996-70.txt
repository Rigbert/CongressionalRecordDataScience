Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that.  All I can say is that one quality seems to be missing in this Chamber, and that is good measure, good measure, on the part of the Republican Party. And if I could plead with the Members who are here on the floor, please heal your wounds, take us away from this edge of brinkmanship. Pass the bill that the Senate has sent over here.          TRIBUTE TO 100TH BIRTHDAY OF SENATOR EVERETT DIRKSEN
