Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cliff Moshoginis of Kalamazoo, Michigan, who was named Airport Manager of the Year by the Michigan Association of Airport Executives on Thursday, September 15, 2011.  Mr. Moshoginis began his career at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport in 1993. In 1999, he rose to assistant director of the airport, and in 2006 became its director. Mr. Moshoginis was chosen as the recipient of this impressive honor by the president of the association and other members of the board. He himself previously served as president of the association and currently acts as its legislative committee chair.  Despite enormous challenges that have directly affected the air transportation industry in recent years, Mr. Moshoginis has displayed great innovation in keeping our airports safe and efficient. It is because of his vision and direction that the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport has prospered, seeing an 11 percent increase in employment and approval of several new construction projects.  I was pleased that the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport recently receivedvital funding for ongoing construction of a new terminal. This expansion has been good for economic growth in our district and made the airport a more efficient gateway to southwest Michigan.  The honor bestowed upon Mr. Moshoginis is an achievement that makes us all very proud to have such a remarkable person serving the people of our district. Congratulations to Mr. Moshoginis and his employees for being recognized with this well-deserved achievement.                          ____________________
