It is well documented that America needs to address the science, technology, engineering and math deficit--this entire bill is a reflection of that understanding. This deficit is possibly greatest in the Nation's poorest school districts. Yet these school districts also offer a reservoir of potential--potential, if properly tapped, that could generate hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers who can help ensure that America can compete in the global marketplace, and harness the economic promise--and good paying jobs--of emerging fields like nanotechnology.  I have seen some of the nanotechnology equipment that folks will be able to use these funds to purchase. And honestly, it is exciting stuff. I expect that it will help generate the enthusiasm, as well as the knowledge and understanding, necessary to attract and retain America's future nanotechnologists.  So I would urge the Director of the National Science Foundation, as he is implementing this program, to give special attention to grant proposals that include a nanotechnology element.
