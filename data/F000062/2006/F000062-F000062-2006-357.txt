  There, being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   Congress of the                                                United States,                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2006.       Dear Senator: We write to express our strong support of the      Feinstein amendment to S. 2611 and ask you to vote for it      when considered on the Senate floor.       The Feinstein ``orange card'' amendment would simplify the      implementation of the legalization program considerably,      creating a uniform and tough path to permanency for all hard-     working undocumented immigrants living in the United States--     without providing them an automatic pardon or amnesty.       To qualify, undocumented individuals would be required to      have been physically present in the United States and working      by January 1, 2006. They would have to pay a $2000 fine and      back taxes, learn English and American civics, and pass      extensive criminal and security background check. After      working for at least 6 years, orange card holders could apply      for legal permanent residence, but only after all current      applicants for a green card are adjudicated.       S. 2611, as currently drafted, creates a complicated,      three-tiered process that could undermine the success of the      legalization program. We fear that without amendment, the      legalization program will be costly and difficult to      administer, prone to widespread fraud and inherently unfair      to those that it would, perhaps even inadvertently, exclude.       It is our position that for a comprehensive approach to      work, immigration reform must be tough and enforceable and      bring as many undocumented individuals out of the shadows as      possible. If reform fails to do this, we will be wasting an      important and historic opportunity to get at the root of the      problem with our immigration policy. Rather than fixing our      broken system once and for all, S. 2611 could postpone our      ability to get control of migration flows into our country      and secure our homeland.       The Feinstein amendment would strengthen the effectiveness      and fairness of S. 2611, and is, therefore, in the best      interests of all Americans. We urge you to vote yes on the      Feinstein amendment.           Sincerely,     Grace Flores Napolitano,       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC).     Luis V. Gutierrez,       Chair, CHC Immigration Task Force.                                  ____                                       Coalition for Comprehensive                                           Immigration Reform.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations,      we are writing to express our strong support for the      Feinstein ``Orange Card'' amendment which replaces the three-     tiered treatment of undocumented immigrants in S. 2611 with      one simple process that applies to undocumented immigrants      who lived in the U.S. on January 1, 2006 and meet other      strict requirements including paying taxes, learning English,      passing criminal and security background checks, and paying a      $2000 fine.       Under the Feinstein amendment Orange Card holders may      become lawful permanent residents when all current applicants      for green cards have been received from them (estimated to be      6 years), or 8 years after the bill becomes law, whichever is      earlier. This means that they are essentially ``in line''      behind those who are currently awaiting visas through our      legal immigration system. Orange Card holders must check in      each year with the government and show that they continue to      meet all of the requirements listed above.       There are numerous other important advantages of the      Feinstein Orange Card amendment including: one simple process      to legalize qualifying undocumented immigrants who entered      the U.S. before January 1, 2006; equal treatment of all      family members; and ease of administration with less      potential for fraud. Moreover, the amendment increases the      effectiveness of comprehensive immigration reform by      maximizing the extent to which undocumented immigrants      currently in the United States can access a path to U.S.      citizenship.       We are deeply concerned that S. 2611 will exclude too many      immigrants who are hard working, law abiding, and making      important contributions to this country. We believe the best      way to reform the law is to maximize the number of immigrants      who legalize and to create a process that works. We urge you      to recognize the many contributions that these immigrants      make to our country and provide a path to citizenship which      is consistent with the spirit of S. 2611 in that immigrants      would have to meet the same requirements for working paying      taxes, learning English, and waiting in line behind others      but without creating unnecessary and cumbersome parallel      processes which will be difficult to administer and will      leave too many behind.       We strongly support the Feinstein Orange Card amendment and      urge you to support it.
