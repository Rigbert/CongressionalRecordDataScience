 President, leadership grounded in common sense and compassion and elevated by imagination and vision is the hallmark of Richard Clarke's 30-year career at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. [PG&E], the last 8 as chairman of the board and chief executive officer.  As his retirement nears, I should like to salute him. Over the years, first as mayor of San Francisco and now as U.S. Senator, I have worked closely with Richard. Not only on questions involving utility service, but on a broad range of community issues, I have known Dick as a person who quickly gets to the heart of issues and directly speaks his mind.  Even further, he has been involved in a wide range of charitable and civic activities, and gives meaning and substance to the accolade ``civic leader.''  During his tenure as PG&E's CEO, Richard Clarke made environmental improvement a company priority and created programs that implemented policies to conserve energy. So effective were these innovations that PG&E received the President's Environment and Conservation Challenge Award in 1991, the Nation's highest recognition for corporate environmental excellence. In that same year, then President Bush named him to the President's Council of Sustainable Development.  At the same time, Richard, as chair of the Bay Area Council and the Committee on Jobs, worked to bring together other business leaders of San Francisco business and focus their collective knowledge and talents on ways to make government more efficient and the economy stronger.  Under Richard Clarke's guidance, PG&E has won national recognition for improving the workplace by establishing child day-care centers for employees and advancing opportunities for women and minorities.  His sense of community concern and compassion is reflected in his effort of such worthwhile efforts as Francisco Food Bank and Project Open Hand, which provides nourishing meals to people living with AIDS, to United Way and the San Francisco Symphony, where he serves as a board member. He personally developed and championed programs that encourage PG&E employees to become mentors to disadvantaged young people and to provide guidance to small, developing businesses in the inner city.  As he retires, Richard Clarke leaves behind a remarkable record of accomplishment--success in business and community affairs. He takes with him the admiration and respect of all those who have worked with him, and who wish him all the best in retirement.                          ____________________
