 President, I think it would be very helpful to make a side-by-side comparison of these two letters.  It would help bring my main point about Mr. Hamre into sharper focus.  Mr. Bacon's two letters are identical in every respect but one.  A major discrepancy exists between the last paragraph on the first page of the first letter and the same paragraph in the second letter.  I would like to quote from that portion of the first letter.  This is Mr. Bacon talking:       Senator Grassley claimed Hamre presided over a scheme to      make illegal progress payments. Again, the facts are quite      different. Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, has carried      out the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator      Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by      proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments.       That legislation was first proposed by the IG.  Mr. Bacon's statements do not square with the facts. They are inaccurate.  Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and always sticking to the facts.  My article on Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payment policy is no exception.  I have documents to back up every point I have made.  From day one, I have never strayed from the facts and conclusions presented by the DOD IG.  From day one, the IG and legal counsel have maintained that the department's progress payment policy ``results in the rendering of false accounts and violation of the law.''  Nothing has changed since the IG issued its report in March 1992.  The illegal progress payment policy remains in effect at this very moment.  The IG has consistently maintained that the ``status quo is unacceptable'' and that the policy must be brought into compliance with the law.  After 5 years of unproductive meetings, the IG recommended that the department seek ``legislative relief.''  The IG proposed a temporary exemption from the law, while the progress payment operation was being overhauled.  But when the draft language hit the street late 1996, it was not at all what the IG had in mind.  This language was drafted by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service but was Mr. Hamre's brain child.  It was far reaching, comprehensive and permanent.  The IG and legal counsel came unglued when they saw it and killed it in the end.  Mr. President, those are the facts--according to the IG--not according to the Senator from Iowa.  Mr. Bacon's first letter is out of sync with the facts.  When the IG, Ms. Eleanor Hill, saw Mr. Bacon's first letter, I am told, she blew her top.  She picked up the phone and called Mr. Bacon. He was on travel, but his principal deputy, Mr. Bernath, was in his office over at the Pentagon.  She confronted him with the truth.  He agreed right then and there to retract the false and misleading statements in Mr. Bacon's first letter.  Mr. President, that's how we ended up with Mr. Bacon's second letter.  I would now like to quote from the revised portion of his second letter:       Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, is working to carry out      the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator      Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by      proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments.      Prior to proposing legislation, Mr. Hamre had discussed with      the DOD IG the possibility of seeking legislative relief if      it was too difficult for the department to comply with the      current statute.  These revisions give Mr. Bacon's letter an entirely new meaning.  ``Is working to carry out'' is a far cry from ``has carried out.''  ``Discussed with the DOD IG'' is a far cry from ``first proposed by the DOD IG.''  The revisions--demanded by the IG--strengthen my main point, Mr. President. They showcase Mr. Hamre's shortcomings.  I need to thank Mr. Bacon.  His letters make my case:  Mr. Hamre has failed to carry out the IG's recommendations and bring his policy into compliance with the law.  Mr. Hamre's policy continues to operate outside the law at this very moment, and that's exactly why he felt like he needed legislation.  He needed to cover his back side.  He needed legal cover for his illegal policy.  Now, I would like to commend Mr. Bacon for being more truthful and accurate.  But there's one little problem.  His first letter still stands as a matter of record.  Where did the misinformation come from in the first place?  Did Mr. Bacon dream it up by himself? Or did someone set him up? If so, who? Did Mr. Hamre have any knowledge of this letter?  Mr. President, I have written Mr. Bacon. He needs to answer my questions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1997.     Hon. Kenneth H. Bacon,     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Bacon: I am writing in response to your letters of      June 11, 1997 and June 13, 1997, to Mr. Albert Eisele, Editor      of The Hill.       Your letters attempt to address some of the points I raised      in an editorial piece, which appeared in the June 4, 1997      issue of The Hill.       Mr. Bacon, you suggest that I have distorted the truth and      ignored the facts. On the contrary, I pride myself on doing      my homework and always sticking to the facts, and my article      on Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payments policy is no      exception. Ironically, it is clear from the revisions you      were forced to make in your second letter--to correct errors      you made in your first letter--that it is you who has ignored      the facts and distorted the truth.       From day one, I have never strayed from the facts and the      conclusions presented by the Department of Defense (DOD)      Inspector General (IG). From day one, the IG and legal      counsel have maintained that the department's progress      payment policy ``results in the rendering of false accounts      and violation of the law.'' Nothing has changed since the IG      issued its report in March 1992. The illegal progress payment      policy remains in effect at this moment. From day one, the IG      has maintained that ``the status quo is unacceptable'' and      the policy must be brought into compliance with the law.      After five years of endless meetings and ``seeing no light at      the end of the tunnel,'' the IG recommended that the      department consider seeking ``legislative relief.'' The idea      was to obtain a temporary exemption from the law--while the      progress payment operation was overhauled. The language      itself was drafted at Mr. Hamre's direction--not by the IG      but by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. When that      language hit the street, it was not at all what the IG had      envisioned. It was far reaching and comprehensive and      permanent. The IG and legal counsel expressed strong      objections to it and killed it in the end.       Those are the facts, Mr. Bacon. If you have any questions      about the facts, I suggest you contact the IG. You need to      talk with Mr. Bob Lieberman. He is the Assistant IG for      Auditing. His number is 703-604-8901. He will set you      straight. He knows the progress payments issue from top to      bottom and beginning to end. He's the expert.       When you speak to Mr. Lieberman, you will quickly discover      that you are the one who departed from the facts. You will      quickly discover that your first letter contains inaccurate,      misleading, and even false information. This is the most      offensive portion of your letter:       ``Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD Inspector General, has      carried out the IG's recommendations on progress payments.      Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried to legalize the      crime'' by proposing legislative changes concerning progress      payments. That legislation was first proposed by the      Inspector General.''       After you signed and mailed this letter to the Hill, I was      given a copy. I immediately realized that your primary      assertion was false. The suggestion that Mr. Hamre had      brought his progress payments policy into compliance with the      law was totally and completely wrong. It did not square with      the facts--as I know them. So I sent your letter to the IG      for comment to make sure I wasn't off base. I have been told      that the IG, Ms. Eleanor Hill, was enraged when she saw that      statement. She called your office to complain. You were on      travel, but she spoke with your deputy. He agreed to retract      your false and misleading statements. As a result of the IG's      complaint, you sent a second, revised letter to The Hill.      This one is dated June 13, 1997. The false statements have      been removed from this letter. They have been replaced by      statements that constitute a fairly accurate reflection of      the facts. The revised statement is as follows:       ``Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD Inspector General, is      working to carry out the IG's recommendations on progress      payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried to legalize      the crime'' by proposing legislative changes concerning      progress payments. Prior to proposing legislation, Mr. Hamre      had discussed with the DOD Inspector General the possibility      of seeking legislative relief if it was too difficult for the      Department to comply with the current statute.''       Mr. Bacon, your second letter takes a big step in the right      direction. ``Is working to carry out'' is a far cry from      ``has carried out,'' and ``discussed with the DOD IG'' is a      far cry from ``first proposed by the DOD IG.'' Those      corrections conform with the facts as I understand them.       Mr. Bacon, the corrections you made in your second letter      strengthen my main point and showcase Mr. Hamre's      shortcomings. In fact, they make my case: Mr. Hamre has      failed to carry out the IG's recommendations and bring his      progress payment policy into compliance with the law. His      progress payment policy continues to operate outside of the      law at this very moment, and he knows it. That's exactly why      he proposed legislation. He wanted legal cover for an illegal      operation. He wanted to sanction a policy that the IG had      declared illegal and that he had personally authorized. As I      said, he wanted to legalize the crime. And finally, this      legislation was not dreamed up by the IG. It was the brain      child of Mr. Hamre and the Defense Finance and Accounting      Service.       I commend you for trying to be more accurate and truthful,      but your original letter still stands as a matter of record.      You signed and mailed it. How did that happen? Was the      misinformation of your own making, or did someone else set      you up? I would like some answers.       Mr. Bacon, I would like to understand the true origins of      the false information contained in your first letter. Is this      something you dreamed up on your own? If not, where did you      get the information? What organization within the department      provided this information? Please provide the name and title      of the person who supplied this information. And did you      discuss this particular piece of information with Mr. Hamre?      Did Mr. Hamre have any knowledge of this information? Was Mr.      Hamre aware of your letter before it was mailed to The Hill?       I request a response to my questions by June 24, 1997.       Your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
