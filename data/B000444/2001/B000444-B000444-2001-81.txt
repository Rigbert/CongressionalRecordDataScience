 I was at the funeral of a brave young American, Aerographer's Mate Second Class Matthew Michael Flocco, whose life was one of those so tragically ended at the Pentagon on September 11. I believed it was important to be there with the family, to make sure they knew that America shares in their grief and stands ready to assist them in any way we can.                          ____________________
