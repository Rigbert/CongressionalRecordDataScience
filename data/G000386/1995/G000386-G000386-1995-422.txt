 President, since there are no further amendments, other than the managers' package--and that is to this bill that is before us--and no other Senators are seeking the floor at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now stand in recess until 4:30 p.m. this afternoon.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:09 p.m., recessed until 4:30 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer [Mrs. Hutchison].
