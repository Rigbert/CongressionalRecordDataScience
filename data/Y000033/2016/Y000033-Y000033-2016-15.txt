Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to thank Mr. Shuster, Mr. Gibbs, and Mr. DeFazio for their work on this bill. This bill is a good bill.  I just say to all of you: We are getting close to the end of this session--and a lameduck, too. This isn't perfect for everyone. It is not perfect for me in some cases, but let's get a piece of legislation done without nitpicking it and saying: Well, I didn't get what I wanted.  I don't disagree with Mr. DeFazio about the funding. That is something we have to work on with the appropriators. They don't like the idea there is a set-aside fund for repairing the harbors, but let's address that battle at a later date.  This is a good piece of legislation. It will create a better system of infrastructure for water, harbors, ports, and drinking water, too. It is a legislative package that has been put together with a lot of hard work with staff.  As we get in this battle, Well, I don't want it, it is a Democrat bill, it is a Republican bill, we ought to think this is a House bill, a bill that can do the job. It will come out of this House, it will go over to the Senate, and we will have a conference. We have another chance to finish this project for the people of America.  So I am asking us not to get into this little bit of nitpicking and get good piece of legislation such as this done.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
