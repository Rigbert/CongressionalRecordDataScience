Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 1977, the Interior appropriations bill. My amendment reduces funding for two unnecessary aircraft and some vehicles to be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These savings are then made available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for two purposes.  In 1906, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Allotment Act to allocate lands to Native Alaskans. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 repealed the 1906 Allotment Act and an allottee must have filed an application with the Department of the Interior by December 18, 1971. It has been over 23 years since eligible allottees filed their applications and there still remains a need to resolve the on-going case load of Alaska Native allotment disputes at the Department of Interior. In February of 1994, the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, the Alaska Legal Services, and the Alaska Federation of Natives met to discuss solutions to resolve these disputes, propose to close the last of Native allotment cases and an attempt to finalize land dispute problems in this area. This amendment intends that half of these funds--$442,000--be used for the Alaska Native allotment attorney fee program at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This will provide funds for representatives for Native allottees with cases with pending at various stages of review within the Department of Interior and before the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The need for outside counsel in these cases is required because of the attorneys within the Department of Interior recognize a conflict of interest between the Native allottees and their institutional clients.  The remaining funds are to added to the Bureau's Wildlife and Parks program as additional funds for monitoring and enhancement of the salmon returns within the Arctic-Yukon-Kustokwim regions in Alaska. The Athabaskan, Yup'ik and Inupiaq Natives of western and interior Alaska live a subsistence way of life from harvests of different fish and mammals. Although these resources supply most of their food needs, they also need cash to purchase essentials such as gas, and nonperishable foodstuffs and harvesting equipment such as boats, outboard motors, nets, and rifles. Commercial fishing provides that small but necessary income since other jobs are scarce and seasonal in rural Alaska. Fishing income averages $4,000 from about 7 weeks of fishing and the per capita income in the villages of these regions is about 60 percent of the U.S. national average. Beginning in 1990, chum salmon stocks in these regions declined significantly and spawning escapements were inadequate. For the upcoming fishing seasons, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is predicting below average return of salmon to these regions. This program fund is intended for salmon monitoring, enhancement and restoration and research projects in these regions.                          ____________________
