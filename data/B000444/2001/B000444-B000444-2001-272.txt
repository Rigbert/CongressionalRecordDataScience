 Senator Helms was wary at the front end of this when he was named, whether or not he really was going to do it. He held up his nomination until he came before the committee to say: I will commit to Helms-Biden. Once he did that, it was home free and he headed to work. But he did a remarkable job.  So I do not, in my praise for Senator Helms, mean to in any way suggest that at the end of the day this could have been done without the ingenuity, intelligence, and dedication of Ambassador Holbrooke and his staff, who, as the chairman has pointed out, many nights toward the end stayed up close to around the clock getting this locked down.  So I think we are at a good place. I have been with my friend from North Carolina too long not to think I understand what is behind his reluctance to lift a cap that locked into law the amount we would pay for peacekeeping. In 1994, out of frustration with the United Nations and its waste and failure to modernize, the U.S. Congress passed a piece of legislation that said starting October 1, 1996 we will not pay any more than 25 percent of the peacekeeping assessment. Then we were being charged about 31 percent, as the Senator said.  Now this may confuse people. Although the Helms-Biden change we aremaking today will allow over half a billion dollars to go to settle our accounts, if we do not do something about that 25 percent cap--because in spite of everything Ambassador Holbrooke, did our peacekeeping rate is not going to go down to 25 percent this year--we will, by the end of the year, accrue another roughly $70 million in debt. We will be behind the 8-ball another $70 million in terms of what we ``owe'' the U.N.  If I did not know better, I would say, as the old saying goes, my friend from North Carolina is from Missouri because he is a show-me guy. I am hopeful I can convince him or he can become convinced--not that I can convince him--but he will become convinced before the legislative year is over hopefully that these changes are real and maybe we should lift that 25- percent cap. Knowing him, he may toy with the idea of either not doing it at all, doing it temporarily, doing it conditionally--I do not know what. I know he will come up with something.  I say to him and my colleagues, I for one feel very strongly--we have gone this far--we should not now undo the good will and circumstance we have created, primarily through his leadership.  Again, not lifting the 25 percent cap now does not do any damage, any injustice, or any harm to the good that has been done, but if we do not by the end of the year deal with this--and he is committed we will deal with it; not how, not what the result will be, what his position will be, but we will deal with it--if we do not deal with it, I fear we will have begun to undo some of the significant good that we did by changing this legislation.  Mr. President, I thank former President Clinton and former Secretary Albright who were also instrumental in lobbying world leaders to have their countries accommodate this change, which is overdue.  I note parenthetically, when we signed on to these commitments, it was a different world. We were the only game in town economically. The combined GDP of Europe eclipses ours. Thank God, through the good works of a lot of people, including the generosity of the American people, the rest of the world is doing pretty well in many places, and they can afford to pay more. But it still took a lot of cajoling, it took a lot of nursing, it took a lot of diplomatic skill to get it done.  I say to my friend from North Carolina, I look forward to, before the summer passes, being back on the floor, hopefully with an agreement on what to do about the 25-percent cap set in 1994, but at least here to ventilate it, debate it, and let the Senate work its will on what we should do about it.  I note parenthetically that Secretary of State Powell supports such an amendment to the 1994 law. I received a letter from him 2 days ago on this subject.  I have no doubt the Senator has thought about it a lot and will think about it, and I have no doubt that whatever decision he comes to on the 25-percent cap, it will be viewed through the prism of making sure the American people are not paying more than they should and that the American taxpayers catch a break.  It has been an honor working with Senator Helms. As I said, he and I came the same year, 1972. We have both been here 28 years, going on 29. We have, as the old saying goes, been together and we have been agin one another. For me, it is always more comfortable when we are together. It has never, never been anything other than a pleasure, since I shifted my responsibilities as top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee to Foreign Relations, working with Senator Helms.  I am told there are some of our colleagues who wish to speak to this. I, quite frankly, would be surprised if there is a controversial aspect to this. It passed out of our committee this morning 18-0, unanimously, with very little debate and with some considerable enthusiasm.  I hope there will be bipartisan support for these objectives. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter from Secretary Powell.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       The Secretary of State,                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2001.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Biden: Thank you for your January 23 letter      regarding the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's plans, at      next week's business meeting, to take up the question of      revising Helms-Biden legislation to allow a second tranche of      payments of UN arrears to go forward. I appreciate the      Committee's willingness to move forward so quickly with this      needed step.       In your letter, you asked for my views as to whether a 1994      State Authorization Bill provision that places a 25 percent      cap on our contribution to UN peacekeeping should also be      revised, so that we can pay at the new assessment rate we      negotiated in December. My staff have informed me that,      unless this cap is revised, we will accrue new arrears of      around $77 million in this fiscal year alone. Clearly, this      needs to be taken care of to avoid falling into new arrears;      my preference would be to move on it now, so that we can put      this behind us quickly and focus together on further steps      toward UN reform. I hope that the Committee will take the      necessary steps to amend the 1994 provision as rapidly as      possible.       Again, thank you for your letter. I welcome your      partnership on this and other matters as we seek to advance      America's foreign policy interests in the months ahead.           Sincerely,                                                  Colin L. Powell.
