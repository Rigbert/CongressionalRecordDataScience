  This bill would create a two-State circuit, with one tiny State dwarfed by a large State. California would have 94 percent of the new ninth circuit's caseload.  It is also a very costly proposal. I find it just ironic that the committee would vote to spend so much for no demonstrated gain, when this Congress is so concerned--and I believe commendably concerned--with reducing the costs of the judiciary.  Splitting the ninth circuit would require duplicative offices of clerk of the court, circuit executive, staff attorneys, settlement attorneys, courtrooms, libraries, and mail and computer facilities.  The estimated additional costs of a new or rehabilitated courthouse for a proposed headquarters in Phoenix range from $23 to $59.5 million. Both GSA and CBO have allocated startup costs at an additional $3 million.  GSA and CBO have estimated annual costs of duplicative staff positions at $1 million, and an additional $2 million for the cost of leasing space for the headquarters until permanent quarters could be made available.  So we have duplicative staff to the tune of $1 million, and additional lease costs--unnecessary--of $2 million.  If the twelfth circuit, as proposed in this second-degree amendment, were to be created, substantial expenses already incurred by the taxpayers also would be wasted. Congress has authorized, and GSA has already completed, an extensive post-earthquake restoration of the current ninth circuit headquarters building in San Francisco, at a cost of over $100 million. The GSA has also completed the build-out of the court of appeals courthouse in Pasadena. I am told that 35 percent of the $100 million was essentially spent on quarters for the ninth circuit.  I do not believe that this effort to split the ninth circuit really represents a genuine effort to deal with the problems of the U.S. court system.  I believe, really, it is an example of judicial gerrymandering because some decisions made by that court were not to the liking of certain people. I am aware of the fact that the Senator from Montana, in his press release of May 25, states:       We are seeing an increase in legal actions against economic      activities in States like     Montana, such as timbering, mining, and water development.      This threatens local economic stability, but as bad as this      economic backlog is, I am particularly disturbed by      the delays experienced by families of victims.  The press release of the Senator from Montana also says:       State Senator Ethel Harding, of Polson, knew firsthand the      pain of this kind of delay, whose daughter was murdered by      Duncan Meccans 20 years ago, but Meccans was put to death      only 2 weeks ago. The appeal ended up in the ninth circuit      three times over the 20-year period, and part of the delay      can be attributed to the heavy caseload and inefficient      system of the ninth circuit.  Senator Burns' press releases illustrate the fact that, clearly, this effort to split the ninth circuit is politically motivated--because a habeas decision of the ninth circuit was not agreed with, for example. I respectfully submit to my distinguished colleague from Montana that there is habeas reform pending. I happen to support that reform. I submit to this body that that is the appropriate way to deal with habeas reform--not to gerrymander the circuit, but to pass a reform law that changes habeas corpus.  Another issue that was brought out in Senator Burns' press release was the Montana sheriff's appeal of background checks under the Brady law. This was cited as further evidence of the need to split Montana and other northwest States from the circuit. I go into this not to measure the good or the bad of the decision relating to background checks, but simply to say that I believe this is the heart of the reason for the split. It is being done precipitously, without study, at great cost, and I believe for the wrong reasons. It, therefore, sets a precedent for these kinds of political maneuverings.  Let us take a look at the ninth circuit. The ninth circuit does a good job. In the 23 years following the Hruska Commission report, the ninth circuit has become a national leader in experimentation in judicial administration. It is producing good results. The average time, from oral argument submission to disposition, is 1.9 months, or half a month less than the national average. In fact, the ninth circuit is the second most efficient circuit in deciding cases once they are submitted to judges.  The ninth circuit terminates over 8,500 cases a year, almost two-fifths more than the number it terminated 7 years ago.  Since 1992, the number of cases pending before the ninth circuit has decreased annually.  It is also the first Federal court circuit to automate its docket with computerized issue tracking systems that are far more sophisticated than anything available in 1973. These systems keep ninth circuit panels apprised of other panel decisions, helping them avoid intra-circuit conflicts.  So the ninth circuit has pioneered a number of different technological and structural improvements. Additionally, it has used a limited en banc procedure, which has also proved effective in resolving potential intra-circuit conflicts. All active judges participate in the decision as to whether a case will go en banc. The Court's rules allow for rehearing by the full court at the request of either judges or litigants. So either a judge or a litigant can request a hearing by the full court.  It should be noted that the limited en banc procedure is called upon very infrequently. There are only about 12 to 13 limited en banc decisions per year out of a total of about 4,000 written decisions.

Dated: This 9th day of March, 1995.                                                                    ____                          State Bar of Montana                              resolution 4       Whereas, Montana is one of nine states and two territories      of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit;      and       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit has provided significant guidance to all circuit      courts regarding issues of collegiality, maintaining      precedent and effectively accomplishing and administrating      the business of the circuit courts; and       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit has been a leader in implementing Gender Equity and      recognizing the need to address Racial and Ethnicity concerns      to improve the involvement of all citizens in the      administration of justice; and       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit has provided innovative leadership in the involvement      of lawyers in all functions and committees of the circuit;      and       Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth      Circuit has instituted long range planning to project the      needs of the circuit into the upcoming century; and       Whereas, Montana has therefore reaped significant benefit      from being a part of the Ninth Circuit; and       Whereas, the Congress has once again undertaken      consideration of a bill to divide the circuit and to create a      new Twelfth Circuit which would divide out the northern tier      states into a new separate smaller circuit; and       Whereas, a divided circuit would remove the numerous      benefits which Montana enjoys as a part of the United States      Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with very little, if      any, gains; and       Whereas, a divided circuit would result in additional one      time construction and division costs and increased annual      administrative expenses thereby straining the already      inadequate budget of the Judiciary, resulting in fewer funds      for the direct administration of justice and for Civil      Justice panel lawyers and other essential components of the      administration of justice; and       Whereas, a division of the Ninth Circuit would not address      or resolve the principal problem of circuits which serve      rapidly growing regions, that is, the crisis of volumes of      filings with inadequate judicial resources to resolve them;      and       Whereas, a division of the circuit would remove the present      opportunity to obtain the appointment of a practicing Montana      lawyer to current vacancies on the Ninth Circuit and would      significantly reduce the opportunity to appoint practicing      Montana lawyers to the Twelfth Circuit in the future.       Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the State Bar of      Montana Opposes Passage of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals      Reorganization Act of 1995. Senate Bill 853.       Dated this          day of June, 1995.                                                                    ____                                  The State Bar of California,                             San Francisco, CA, February 26, 1996.     Re Opposition to H.R. 2935 and Substitute Bill S. 956, Ninth          Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995.     Hon. Bill Baker,     House of Representatives, Longworth Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Baker: The Board of Governors of the      State Bar of California urges you to oppose H.R. 2935 and      substitute bill S. 956, which would split the Ninth Circuit      Court of Appeals, leaving California, Hawaii and the Pacific      territories in a new Ninth Circuit and placing the remaining      seven states (Alaska, Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah      and Washington) into a new Twelfth Circuit.       H.R. 2935 was introduced on February 5, 1996. Substitute      bill S. 956 was reported out of the Senate Judiciary      Committee on December 21, 1995. We urge you to oppose both of      these bills.       The case for splitting the circuit has not been made. The      Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit; however, size alone      does not argue for its division. In fact, we believe the size      of the Ninth Circuit gives its residents certain advantages.      It is an advantage to all states bordering the West Coast to      have a single federal court of appeals. This single circuit      provides uniform and predictable case law applicable to the      region and crucial to Pacific Rim trade, which is of growing      importance to California and other Western states. Splitting      the region into two circuits is likely to increase inter-     circuit conflict, forum shopping and races to the courthouse.      The size of the Ninth Circuit also provides greater      flexibility in responding to caseload growth and greater      diversity of judicial backgrounds as a result of judges drawn      from a larger area.       The issue of caseload growth is common to courts of appeals      nationwide. However, repeated division of circuits in      response to growth is not likely to be the answer to this      problem and will likely create a proliferation of balkanized      circuits. Splitting the Ninth Circuit, ostensibly because of      its caseload, before considering how to respond to growing      filings nationwide, will complicate rather than advance      solutions to caseload growth.       In an era where shrinking financial resources dictate cost-     saving measures, a Ninth Circuit split would increase costs      by requiring a new circuit office, more court clerks and      attorneys, as well as additional courtrooms and libraries.      Absent a compelling argument for a split, and a clear and      comprehensive study on the most efficient method to      effectuate this division, the proposals are both premature      and imprudent.       The Board of Governors respectfully urges you to oppose      H.R. 2935 and substitute bill S. 956.           Very truly yours,                                                  James E. Towery,     President.                                                                    ____                          State Bar of Arizona         Resolution of the Board of Governors, October 20, 1995       This Board, in repeated resolutions, has expressed its      opposition to the various proposals to divide the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals and its support for maintaining the      Circuit as it is. A new proposal has now been raised as to      which the view of the Bar is desired. This new proposal would      divide the Circuit by creating a Ninth Circuit of California,      Hawaii and the Pacific Islands and a Twelfth Circuit      consisting of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana,      Nevada and Arizona. Such a plan would be extremely      unfortunate for Arizona and wastefully unwise as a matter of      judicial administration. The considerations which concern us      follow:       1. The proposal cuts Arizona off from California, the state      with which it shares the greatest legal and economic ties. On      the one hand, as we have previously declared, Arizona does      not wish to be in a circuit dominated by California; but at      the same time, it needs to be in a circuit with California.      Our law is commonly guided by California law. The proposed      division puts a premium on racing for choice of forum so that      California and Arizona parties to a disputed business      transaction will each have an incentive to sue first to keep      the matter in ``their'' circuit; and yet this may be a matter      which, without fostering a race to the courthouse, might      never be litigated at all.       2. The headquarters of the proposed Twelfth Circuit would      presumably be in Seattle. This would materially increase      costs and inconvenience for Arizona attorneys and litigants.      Airfare between Arizona and either Portland or Seattle is      such that this proposal will cost Arizonans at least two or      three times as much in every case. Flights to the Northwest      take twice as long as to San Francisco and are less than half      as frequent, giving Arizona endless burdens with so remote a      court.       3. Politically the disadvantages to Arizona are      substantial. With the present Ninth Circuit, non-California      senators outnumber California senators 14 to 2, and non-     California judges also outnumber California judges. In the      newly proposed Twelfth Circuit, Arizona and Nevada would be      outnumbered in the Senate 10 to 4, which means that the      judgeships and courthouses will go to the Northwest.       4. The dollar waste is regrettable. The Ninth Circuit      presently has a major court building to serve the Circuit in      Pasadena and is in the final stages of completion of a $100      million post earthquake renovation of the present Circuit      headquarters in San Francisco, a headquarters for the entire      Circuit. Not only will much of the San Francisco space be      wasted under this proposal, but something of the kind will      have to be duplicated in the proposed Twelfth Circuit. There      will also need to be duplication of offices of Clerk, Circuit      Executive, computer center, mailroom and other support      offices.       In the light of all these factors, the Board of Governors      of the State Bar of Arizona strongly recommends against the      proposal for a new Arizona-to-Alaska Twelfth Circuit.

Re Division of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (S. 956).     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,     U.S. Senate, 109 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inouye: The Hawaii State Bar Association Board      of Directors last week voted unanimously to oppose proposed      legislation to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.       Similar legislation proposed in 1989, 1991, and earlier      this year was also opposed by the Hawaii State Bar      Association. See 10/30/91 letter from Wolff to Inouye,      Exhibit A.       A position paper prepared by the Office of the Circuit      Executive dated 6/22/95 sets forth the arguments against      dividing the Ninth Circuit. See Exhibit B. The Hawaii State      Bar Association is in agreement with those arguments and      would like to reiterate its concern over inconsistent law      that would inevitably occur as a result of a division in the      Ninth Circuit. As explained in Peter Wolff's 10/30/91 letter      to you, a different rule of law might apply to a maritime      case depending on whether the departure or destination point      was Seattle or Los Angeles.       We hope that you will vote and lobby against the passage of      Senate Bill 956. If we can be of any assistance to you in      this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at 547-     6119.           Sincerely,                                                  Sidney K. Ayabe,     President.                                                                    ____                      The Federal Bar Association                             RESOLUTION 95-    support for the position of the ninth circuit court of appeals                concerning the split of the ninth circuit       Whereas, Congress has before it Senate Bill No. 956, which      is designed simply to split the Ninth Circuit Court of      Appeals by creating a new Twelfth Circuit comprised of the      District Courts for the States of Montana, Idaho, Washington,      Oregon and Alaska; and       Whereas, the Ninth Circuit Judges are overwhelmingly      against the division of the circuit and the Ninth Circuit      Judicial Council, the governing body for all of the courts in      the Ninth Circuit, recently voted unanimously against any      legislation which would divide the Ninth Circuit;       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, that the Federal Bar      Association states it support for the position of the United      States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, as expressed      by Chief Judge J. Clifford Wallace of the Ninth Circuit given      before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 13, 1995,      and in the Position Paper of the Office of the Circuit      Executive for the United States Court for the Ninth Circuit      dated June 30, 1995;       Be it further Resolved that the President of the Federal      Bar Association is authorized and directed to communicate      copies of this resolution to Senator Orrin Hatch and the      Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein      forthwith.                                                                    ____                                              Idaho State Bar,                                                 February 7, 1990.     Re Idaho State Bar Resolution S2-1     Hon. James R. Browning,     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, San Francisco, CA.       Dear Judge Browning: This is in response to your inquiry      concerning the Idaho State Bar's position on the proposal to      split the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.       Perhaps uniquely, the Idaho State Bar is limited in its      ability to take political positions. Idaho Bar Commission      Rule 906 requires that we engage in a plebiscite of our      members before considering resolutions for changes of law or      policy. The resolution process is conducted each November.       Resolution S2-1, considered last fall, was entitled      ``Bifurcation of 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,'' and was      circulated at the request of both of our U.S. Senators. A      copy of the resolution is included with this letter.       The resolution failed by a vote of 978 to 2373.       Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.           Sincerely,                                               William A. McCurdy,                                       President, Idaho State Bar.                               Exhibit 2                                         Governor Pete Wilson,                                                 December 6, 1995.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Orrin: I have been following with interest the current      debate over whether to split the Ninth Circuit, and wish to      register my strong opposition to any split before an      objective study is concluded as to whether a split before an      objective study is concluded as to whether a split will      properly address the concerns that have been raised      concerning the size of the circuit.       As you know, I have been on record in opposition to      previous bills to split the circuit on the grounds that they      were a form of gerrymandering which sought to cordon off some      judges and keep others.       Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit handles more cases than any      other circuit. However, the median time for it to decide      appeals (14.8 months as of December 1994) is only slightly      higher than that for the Sixth, Seventh, and D.C. Circuits      and less than the Eleventh Circuit (14.8 months), and in      fairness, the destruction of the San Francisco courthouse in      the Loma Prieta earthquake is party responsible for the      backlog.       Splitting the circuit, without adding more judge, will not      necessarily expedite the processing of the Ninth Circuit's      cases and may generate a number of inconsistent rulings along      the West Coast in areas such as admiralty, environmental law,      and commercial law, since the West Coast would be split,      under the pending proposal, into two circuits (i.e.,      California in one, and Washington and Oregon in the other).      Indeed, splitting the Ninth Circuit could add an additional      burden on the Supreme Court, which ultimately must resolve      conflicts between circuits. I recognize that some concerns      have been raised over intra-circuit conflicts, but there is a      mechanism for resolving them--the en banc hearing. See      Fed.R.App.Pro. 35.       Ultimately, the real issue raised in the debate over      splitting the Ninth Circuit appears to be one of judicial      gerrymandering, which seeks to cordon off some judges in one      circuit and keep others in another. If this is the issue, I      submit that the proper means to address this is through the      appointment of new judges who do not inspire judicial      gerrymandering because they share our judicial philosophy      that judges should not make policy judgments but interpret      the law, based on the purpose of the statute as expressed in      its language, and who respect the role of the states in our      federal system.       An objective study can focus on the concerns raised about      the Ninth Circuit and determine whether a split is the      answer. For instance, reform of our habeas corpus procedures      and reforms which curb frivolous inmate litigation may do      more to address a growing caseload than splitting the      circuit.       In any event, I would urge that a study be commissioned to      carefully examine the concerns raised about the Ninth Circuit      and determine whether the concerns are legitimate and whether      a change in the circuit's boundaries is the best method of      addressing them. I would be pleased to contribute one or more      representatives to assist with such a study.           Sincerely,     Pete Wilson.                                                                    ____                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,                                                Ninth Circuit,                                      Reno, NV, December 18, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am pleased that you are going to      carry your opposition to S. 956 to the floor of the Senate.      You will be speaking for more than the interests of the      citizens of your state. This important issue affects all of      the people of our nation and their united belief that there      must be one federal law applicable to each of us.       As you know, I was a Republican member of the United States      House of Representatives from a district in southern      California for a period of 12 years, commencing in 1967. I      served continuously on the House Judiciary Committee. In      addition, I was a member of the Hruska Commission in 1972-73.      I left Congress voluntarily in 1979. In 1984, I was appointed      by President Reagan to the United States Court of Appeals for      the Ninth Circuit. I am now an active judge on that Court.       The foregoing record of public service gives me, I believe,      special insights into the management of cases within the      existing Ninth Circuit. My understanding of the role of      circuit courts in our system of federal justice has changed      over the years from that which I held when the Hruska      Commission issued its final report in 1973. At that time, I      endorsed the recommendations of the Commission calling for a      division of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits. I have grown wiser      in the succeeding 22 years.       The Hruska Commission was created to deal with the problem      of the Fifth Circuit. In recommending the division of the old      Fifth Circuit into a new Fifth Circuit and a new Eleventh      Circuit, we were responding to the united views of federal      judges and bar associations in the respective states, and not      insignificantly, the views of the late Senator Eastland, the      then Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The      recommended changes in the Fifth Circuit were ultimately      implemented, but those respecting the Ninth Circuit were,      wisely I think, not.       You have recommended a new Commission to be appointed to      review and update the findings of the old Hruska Commission.      I endorse this recommendation. Although I strongly oppose the      division of the Ninth Circuit, I believe the Senate is      entitled to review facts, and modern case management      techniques, now employed within the Ninth Circuit. Moreover,      the continued balkanization of our circuits must be      confronted and the case for fewer, larger, circuits, must be      studied. I wish you well in this undertaking.       The proponents of a new Twelfth Circuit have evidently      abandoned their often made arguments that the new circuit      would be needed to save excessive travel costs. No circuit      stretching from Tucson, Arizona, to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska      will support this argument.       The majority report also contains the misleading statement      that the recommended division of the Ninth Circuit is not in      response to ideological differences between judges from      California and judges elsewhere in the circuit. I strongly      disagree that such a motive does not in fact underlie the      proposal for the change. Such a regionalization of the      circuits in accordance with state interests is wrong. There      is one federal law. It is enacted by the Congress, signed by      the President, and is to be respected in every state in the      union. The law in Montana and Washington is the same law as      exists in Maine and Vermont. It is the mission of the Supreme      Court to maintain one consistent federal law. I do hope that      you will challenge the supporters of the revision to explain      the reasons justifying their proposal.           Respectfully,                                               Charles E. Wiggins,                                                    Circuit Judge.
