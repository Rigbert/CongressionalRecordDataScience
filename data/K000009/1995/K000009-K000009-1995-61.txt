Speaker, tonight, in the few minutes allocated, I would like to talk a bit about why our people, the American people, are working harder, but in fact, they are finding that their dollar buys less.  They are working longer hours, more hours; some families 2 and 3 jobs, and yet when they go to pay the bills at the end of the week, or at the end of the month, the dollar just does not stretch as far as it used to stretch. In fact, both Newsweek and Time magazines have had tremendous articles in the last month on wages in America and what is happening to the American family as a result.  Today, Mr. speaker, the Commerce Department announced very disappointing economic statistics for our country: basically, that the economy is stuck dead in the water. There was a story on the front page of the New York Times today which I am going to put in the Record that reads in the first paragraph that the economy really had extremely paltry growth in the second quarter, and we, as a country, are stuck at the 50-yard line. We just cannot seem to move forward.  The article also talks about the stagnation of wages and the job insecurity felt by millions and millions of our American families. One wonders why we do not hear more about it here in Washington because this is the reality of what our friends and neighbors are living with every day.  Mr. Speaker, tonight I want to talk a little bit about what I call the ``trade drag'' on our economy, the trade deficit drag that is really helping to hold down the ability of our people's wages to grow. If we think about the car races we might see at the Indianapolis 500, where they have to slow down and that big parachute comes out the back, and even a car that is going 150, 200 miles an hour stops almost in place. That is how a trade deficit works in terms of the ability of this economy to move forward.  Over the last decade, our Nation has lost over $1 trillion, $1 trillion of economic growth, to other places in the world. We have been amassing gigantic trade deficits, more imports coming in here than our trade deficits, more imports coming in here than our exports going abroad, and that has created pressure on the companies and the workers in our country because of low wages and working conditions.  There is no environmental enforcement in these other places around the world where these goods come from, and all of a sudden we find our workers in competition with the lowest-wage workers in the world in the most undemocratic places we could ever imagine living in.  Let us look at some of the results of that. If we take a look at this year alone, we expect that we will have $184 million more of merchandise coming in here than we are sending off shore through our exports.  This year we will have an increase over last year, when that deficit was $166 billion. When we figure every billion translates into 20,000 lost jobs in this country, all of a sudden we begin to think about things that are happening in our own communities back home and we begin to understand the dynamic of what is happening in 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 places across this country where we are essentially exporting abroad our manufacturing productivity and importing goods from low-wage places around the world.  We were told that NAFTA, the agreement with Mexico, would be a good thing for America. I would sure like to see some of the proponents get back on television; we have not heard a word from them lately because, in fact, the numbers are working exactly in reverse.  If we look at the figures of both the United States and Mexico, prior to NAFTA signing we always sent more exports down there than imports were coming in from Mexico. But just in May of this year, we had a $1.6 million deficit with Mexico. That is just in 1 month; that is over 25,000 jobs. We have lost one plant a day to Mexico since NAFTA was signed.  Mr. Speaker, our trade deficit with Mexico this year is expected to reach over $20 billion. That is an exact reversal of the trade figures prior to the signing of NAFTA. In fact, we are also amassing gigantic trade deficits with Canada for the first time. It is projected this year to be over $14 billion. So as a result of NAFTA, this year, the United States-Mexico-Canada combined, we will have over $34 billion trade deficit just with those two countries.  Mr. Speaker, part of the reason for the fiscal drag on the people of this country is that our trade policies are absolutely backward and do not benefit our people here at home.  Mr. Speaker, I submit the following for the Record:                [From the New York Times, July 27, 1995]                        Clinton and the Economy                          (By David E. Sanger)       Washington, July 27.--On Friday morning, the Commerce      Department will issue a figure that until very recently the      White House was dreading: an accounting of the economy's      paltry growth in the second quarter of the year, a grim      statistic that for much of the year looked as if it would be      the first step off a steep cliff.       The number will likely be around five-tenths of a percent,      a long, long fall from the economy's spectacular performance      last year. But now there is a growing consensus among      economists and traders that the figure will likely be the      year's worst and that a rebound is already under way.       They are basing their optimism on the usual hodgepodge mix      of home sales, the pace of exports, inventory levels and      other straws in the economic wind that recently suggest that      the worst is probably over. At the White House, officials are      already declaring that the much talked-about ``soft landing''      has arrived.       The second-quarter figure is coming out at a time that the      second quarter seems no longer relevant,'' Treasury Secretary      Robert E. Rubin, who has predicted publicly for several      months that the rebound would start in the second half of the      year, said today. ``The question now is how strongly do we      resume growth.''       The political import of all this is lost on no one in      Washington: It has been more than 40 years since a Democratic      incumbent ran for the Presidency with the economy seemingly      strong, inflation under control and unemployment off the      front page. Against all the speculation just a few months      ago, Bill Clinton now looks as though he may break the spell.       What that means in concrete political terms--the first      primary is still seven months away--is anyone's guess. Even      if the economy does bounce back in the coming months, it is      far from clear that there will be corresponding political      gains for Mr. Clinton.       Growth was strong and inflation was low last November, and      the result was a Republican seizure of both the House and the      Senate. In the postwar era, growth had to average more than      4.6 percent in the year leading up to an election for a      Presidential incumbent to be re-elected.       And the stagnation of wages and the job insecurity felt by      millions of Americans remain a major economic problem, and an      even bigger political one, a point Mr. Rubin and other      Administration officials acknowledge.       But an economy in downturn as the primaries approach seemed      probable just a few months ago, and Mr. Clinton's economic      advisers are delighting in the fact that the business cycle      seems unlikely to give the Republicans any fresh ammunition.       ``This gives tremendous momentum to the Clinton re-election      candidacy,'' Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, the      former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who      until a few months ago was considered a likely candidate to      run the campaign, said in his office today. ``We ought to      take the quotes from all those guys on the Hill who were      predicting doom and gloom and throw them back in their      faces.''       The Republicans, of course, will retort that the man who      brought about the soft landing was not Bill Clinton but one      of their own: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal      Reserve. Last year he was regularly portrayed by the White      House as the lurking force of evil in the economy, raising      interest rates last year to head off inflation.       On several occasions the White House forgot its stated      policy of never arguing in public with the Federal Reserve,      carping about its approach and saying that it would cost jobs      and growth. More than a few times Mr. Rubin had to call his      colleagues in the Cabinet and ask them, politely, to shut up.       Now, after a considerable amount of revisionist thinking,      Mr. Greenspan has become something of an economic hero in the      White House. The interest-rate increases are now viewed in a      kinder light, in part because they choked off inflation but      especially because rates began to come down again last month.       Suddenly the most likely successor to Alan Greenspan, whose      term runs out next March, is Alan Greenspan. (The reality is      that probably no one else could get confirmed: The Republican      leaders of the Senate would probably hold up the nomination      of any other candidate until after the next election.)       Certainly not all the news has been good, and anyone      wanting to construct a pessimistic outline for the months      ahead has plenty to work with. In May, personal income      declined slightly, the first fall since January      1994. In June, a leading index of manufacturing purchases      declined for the second consecutive month, after nearly two      years of growth. Car sales plunged alarmingly in the spring,      leaving the chief executives of the Big Three shaken.      Mortgage applications are down, even though interest rates      have dropped nearly two points in eight months. the savings      rate continues to fall.       Some economists maintain that any good news is simply a      delay of the inevitable. ``If the economy survives 1995      without a recession, next year will offer no respite from      hazards,'' the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard      College wrote last week in one of the blitz of newsletter      analyses that has preceded Friday's report on gross domestic      product. ``The probability of a recession beginning either      this year or next is 60 percent.''       If so, Mr. Clinton could find himself in exactly the      condition he managed to exploit brilliantly against George      Bush.       But inflation seems increasingly unlikely to be an issue as      the election approaches; it is not only down in this country      but around the world. The job market has remained      surprisingly strong, an impression bolstered today when the      Government announced a large decline in claims for      unemployment benefits. Retail sales are up, though much of      that comes from huge promotions that car makers are using      after they were caught by surprise by slow sales early in the      year.       There are three major issues that seem to bother the      Administration's top official when they talk about the      economy: What will happen to personal income, whether a      showdown with the Republicans over the budget sends the      markets into a tailspin and what happens if the country's      export boom suddenly dries up.       All the economic indicators in the country can turn up, but      if income stays stagnant, Mr. Clinton's advisers agree, he      will be unable to convince voters that much has changed,      ``It's the problem the President works on the most,'' Mr.      Rubin said today, referring to proposals in his budget for      training and education. ``Because median real wages have not      behaved well, too many Americans can't feel in their own      lives what has happened in the economy.''       The second concern is that the battle over the budget will      bring the Government to a standstill in October, with all      kinds of hard-to-predict economic fallout. ``We've had the      Government close for a day or two in the past; but what we      are worried about is something much longer and worse,'' a top      Administration official said recently. ``And it is unclear      who would be blamed for that, Bill Clinton or Newt      Gingrich.''       And the third concern is that the hidden miracle of the      economy--exports--will finally cool off. Just how much      exports are rising is a matter of how you measure, but the      trend is pointing to a 15 percent increase over last year,      fueled by the weak dollar. That is a remarkable achievement      at any time, but particularly when the country's No. 2 and      No. 3 trading partners, Japan and Mexico, are in the most      dire economic trouble they have suffered in years.       Whether the country's economic growth can be sustained even      if the domestic economy slows further, then, depends in large      part on keeping up a huge flow of goods to Europe and      Southeast Asia. And that means depending on economies over      which Mr. Clinton has virtually no control.       ``What no one has noticed in the past year or so is that      now fully 50 percent of our exports go to the Pacific      Basin,'' said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade      representative and another potential candidate to run Mr.      Clinton's compaign. ``That is why we have such a critical      interest in continuing the market openings there and building      those relationships.''       But Asia is also where the United States has its biggest      trade deficits, and they, too, have widened over the year.      That could be the wedge the Republicans turn to first.                          ____________________
