The United States has been fortunate to have dynamic and devoted men and women who willingly and unselfishly dedicate their lives in service to our country. Colonel Robert E. Crowley is one such individual. Saturday, June 26, 2010, is Colonel Crowley's change of command ceremony at March Air Reserve Base in California, when he passes on his duties as Commander of the 358th Civil Affairs Brigade and retires from the United States Army. Colonel Crowley assumed command of the 358th Civil Affairs Brigade on August 9, 2008. The brigade, headquartered at March Air Reserve Base, California, consists of four Civil Affairs Battalions located in California and Arizona.  A native of New London, Connecticut, Colonel Crowley was commissioned an Infantry Officer in 1982 through the University of New Hampshire Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program and qualified as a Civil Affairs Officer in 1994. His previous commands include Commander, 404th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne) and Chief of Civil-Military Operations, United States Southern Division, HQDA.

As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Colonel Crowley, who choose to live their lives in service to our country. He joins a unique brotherhood that, from the first shots at Lexington during our own revolution, has stood to protect us and defend the ideals of freedom and democracy. I know we are all grateful to ColonelCrowley for his lifetime of service and salute him as he retires after 28 years of honorable service in the U.S. Army.                          ____________________
