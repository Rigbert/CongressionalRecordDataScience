Speaker, corporate downsizing and layoffs continue to heighten the anxiety of the American worker.  In the new economy of the 1990's American workers can expect to change jobs seven or eight times throughout their careers.  No one can guarantee American families job security--however, American families can be protected from the destructive consequences of economic change--such as families losing health insurance and losing pension protection. We can also offer job training to increase the skills of our workers facing a rapidly changing job market.  Both President Clinton and the Democratic families first agenda call for initiatives to solve these problems, as well as to promote worker retraining and put people on the path of re-employment and higher wages.  But Government cannot solve the problem of worker anxiety alone--Corporate America must take responsibility, as well.  The following essay by noted social commentator Paul Harvey directly addresses the issue of corporate responsibility. Mr. Harvey, in his unique style, discusses Aaron Feurstein, president of Malden Mills, who continued to pay his employees even after his plant burned down.  Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Feurstein's actions--it is this type of commitment that builds security, trust and commitment between our Nation's workers and their employees.               [From the Paul Harvey News, Apr. 27, 1996]                          None of My Business       Any business begins with an idea and grows by selling that      idea. It sounds simple. It is not.       Retirement areas are studded with cheap grave markers. Pa      and Ma, recently retired, have always enjoyed meeting people.      Why not take their life savings and invest in a small retail      business?       Buying and selling sounds like fun.       But Pa and Ma and their business are likely to suffocate      under an avalanche of tax forms and other government required      documents.       You'll see this cruel rise and fall repeated many times in      any shopping mall. This next relates to that, however,      distantly:       These days, for any business to keep going requires further      investment in tax accountant, lawyers, bookkeepers and sales      staff.       And on the way to incorporation on a large scale, the      business is likely to accumulate redundant layers of      bureaucracy and to leave its ``heart'' behind.       You have sometimes been amazed at how some big corporation      will invest millions of dollars a year in ``public      relations'' then--with one heartless massive layoff of      workers just before Christmas--the corporation shoots itself      in the foot.       A corporation has outgrown its britches when its bean-     counters announce with pride ``record profits'' one week      before its labor relations lawyers are scheduled to negotiate      a new contract.       What has come to be called ``corporate downsizing'' is      going to be a significant economic issue in the next      election.       There is no way to streamline an over-bloated business      other than by shrinking the number of employees but unless      corporate giants also practice ``the golden rule'' in their      dealings with employees they are inviting a rude rebuke.       Enlightened management has already learned to weigh short-     term profits and the obligation to stockholders--and balance      those considerations against treating employees fairly,      preserving customer loyalty and maintaining an affirmative      public image.       Any CEO who orders layoffs in the name of cost-cutting      while preserving his own multi-million dollar income intact      is at least unfeeling.       Industries are going to need all the friends they can get      next polling time.       One good example is worth a thousand admonitions: When      Malden Mills burned last December, its President Aaron      Feurstein vowed to rebuild and to keep all his workers on the      payroll.       This icon of corporate decency has been rewarded with three      divisions already running again and 80% of all employees back      at work.       It cost Malden Mills ten million dollars to pay those      workers while they are idle but, back at work, both quality      and efficiency are better than ever. At one plant production      has doubled!       Mr. Feurstein says, ``To discard responsibility to our      workers and to think only of profit in the long run will      profit no one.''                          ____________________
