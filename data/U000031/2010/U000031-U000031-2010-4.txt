Speaker, I would just briefly like to say I echo the remarks by the dean of the House and the dean of the Michigan delegation.  I knew Marv Esch as a staffer. He was a wonderful man, dedicated to this House and to making things work.                              {time}  1530  We will all miss him. It is sometimes tough to be a Wolverine, and as you know, he was a great Wolverine.
