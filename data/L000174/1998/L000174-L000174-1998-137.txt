President, I have a statement relating to an amendment I had intended to offer concerning the Global Environment Facility, which I have decided not to offer in the interest of finishing action on this bill. There is strong, bipartisan support for the GEF and I hope we can find additional funds for it later in this session.  Mr. President, this bill contains $47 million to pay a portion of our arrears to the Global Environment Facility. An amendment I had planned to offer would provide an additional $145 million, which would cover our outstanding arrears which currently total $192 million. Unfortunately, there is no money in the bill to pay our FY 1999 contribution to the GEF.  The Balanced Budget Act provides for an automatic adjustment of the discretionary budget caps to accommodate these additional arrears, so my amendment would not require an offset or any additional budget authority.  Mr. President, if we are going to provide $47 million toward the arrears we owe the GEF, we should provide the whole amount. There is no reason not to do it. That was one of the purposes of the Balanced Budget agreement.  It does not require additional budget authority. But it we miss this chance, we will make it virtually impossible to pay these arrears later on when we no longer have the benefit of the automatic adjustment under the Balanced Budget Act.  The GEF is the world's largest environmental organization. It has enjoyed bipartisan support in the Congress for years. It funds projects to protect biodiversity, stop ocean pollution, prevent ozone depletion, and promote energy conservation.  A few Members of the Congress have called the GEF a ``back-door'' funding mechanism for the Kyoto Protocol. What is the evidence of that? The GEF was established years before Kyoto was even conceived of. For years, the GEF has been pushing the developing countries to do more to prevent global warming. Kyoto has not changed that. If anything, it has made it even more relevant and timely.  The Resolution on Kyoto sponsored by Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel earlier this year calls on the developing countries to do more to prevent global warming.  That is one of the GEF's goals, and a reason why we should support it.  The GEF is not only good for the environment, it is good for U.S. business. American contractors have won 30 percent of the GEF contracts awarded to donor countries. These contracts have primarily gone to American companies involved in environmental engineering, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. The U.S. is the world's leader in these areas, and our companies will reap the rewards as the GEF helps the developing countries confront their exploding populations, huge energy demands, and a legacy of ignoring the consequences of environmental pollution.  The GEF has funded over 500 projects in 119 countries. Each dollar the U.S. contributes is matched by 5 dollars from other donors and 10 dollars from the developing countries themselves, private companies, and other international institutions. But without strong U.S. participation there is far less incentive for other countries to contribute.  Mr. President, I am reluctant to call this free money, since no money is free. But this is about as free as any money we are going to see. My amendment would not require one dime of additional budget authority for us to erase $192 million in past commitments to an organization that deserves our strong support.  Mr. President, to expedite completion of this bill at this late hour, I have agreed to withhold offering my amendment. However, is is my fervent hope that we will revisit this issue, and that if additional budget authority becomes available later this session that we use some of it to make a contribution to the GEF for FY 1999, and that we make the cap adjustment provided for under the Balanced Budget Act to cover the $192 million in arrears that would be made available under my amendment. To do so would not affect any of the other funds in this bill, but it would fulfill our commitment to pay these arrears, and support the most important international organization devoted to protecting the environment.
