President, I want to recognize the work of organizers in Springfield, IL, who are kicking off the national Civil War Sesquicentennial observation by reading President Abraham Lincoln's ``Farewell Address'' on the 150th anniversary of its original delivery. The speech will be reenacted in Springfield and individuals across the Nation are invited to join them online for a simultaneous reading of it. Organizers hope to set a Guinness World Record for the most people reading aloud from the same document simultaneously.  This year marks the sesquicentennial of two momentous chapters in our national history: President Abraham Lincoln's inauguration and the beginning of the Civil War. Two years ago, we celebrated the bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth. As part of that earlier celebration, the Library of Congress displayed a remarkable collection of Lincoln artifacts. They included copies, written in Lincoln's own hand, of his first and second inaugural addresses and his immortal Gettysburg Address. Also included was a copy of President Lincoln's poignant ``Farewell Address'' to Springfield, his adopted home, on February 11, 1861. More than a thousand residents came out that day to wish Mr. Lincoln goodbye as he headed to Washington to become President. He delivered his remarks extemporaneously:       My friend--No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my      feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the      kindness of these people, I owe every thing. Here I have      lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to      an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is      buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may      return, with a task before me greater than that which rested      upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being,      who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance      I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and      remain with you and be every where for good, let us      confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care      commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend      me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.  President Lincoln, of course, did not live long enough to help write all of the chapters of American history that he had hoped for us. It has fallen to each generation of Americans since him to take up that pencil and write the next chapters: the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act . . . the first African American president, another lanky lawyer from Illinois. But we know there are chapters that still need to be written.  I urge my fellow Senators to join me in recognizing the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln's first inauguration, even as people in Springfield and around the country recite his Farewell Address.                          ____________________
