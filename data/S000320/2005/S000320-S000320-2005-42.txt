 That is good news in the Senate on a Thursday afternoon. During the next vote, we will try to finalize those amendments. Senator Mikulski and I, the managers of the bill, have been working with everybody in the Senate to try to move the bill forward. It is our expectation that we will quickly proceed to passage of the bill. I, therefore, alert all Senators now that they should remain close to the Chamber, following this upcoming vote, hopefully for final passage.  I yield to my colleague.
