Mr. Speaker, the Republican trillion-dollar tax bill is a disgrace. It is the height of irresponsibility. It is a trillion-dollar give-away to the special interests and the high-rollers.  The Republican plan does nothing to protect Social Security. The Republican plan does nothing to strengthen Medicare. The Republican tax scheme does nothing to reduce our national debt.  We are at a crossroads in America. We have an historic opportunity to preserve and protect Social Security, to strengthen Medicare, and to pay down this awful national debt. We should not, we cannot, and we must not let this historic opportunity pass us by.  We have balanced our national budget. We have put our economic house in order. The Republican tax scheme is irresponsible. It does not address our needs, and it will lead us down the road to economic disaster. The Republican plan is a dangerous and dark step backwards. It should be and it must be defeated, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
