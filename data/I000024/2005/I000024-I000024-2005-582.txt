President, today, I want to enter into this debate, as we have so many times, on these judicial nominees, including Justice Priscilla Owen and Justice Janice Rogers Brown, both of whom are highly qualified.  Priscilla Owen was nominated by President Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a seat that has been designated a judicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. That means we have to fill the seat. She has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994 and was endorsed for reelection by every major Texas newspaper. She practiced commercial litigation for 17 years. She received her undergraduate degree from Baylor University and graduated third in her class from Baylor Law School in 1977. The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Justice Owen as ``well-qualified,'' the highest possible rating. She is the first nominee considered well-qualified by the ABA to be denied a floor vote by the Democrats.  Priscilla Owen even has significant bipartisan support from three former Democrat judges on the Texas Supreme Court and a bipartisan group of 15 past presidents of the State Bar Association of Texas. Justice Owen has served the legal field in many capacities. She was liaison to the Texas Supreme Court's mediation task force and on statewide committees on providing legal services to the poor and pro bono legal services. She has always been very sensitive to the poor.  Justice Owen organized a group called Family Law 2000, which warns parents about the difficulties children face when parents go through a divorce.  Similarly, President Bush has nominated Justice Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This morning, I was at the White House. As I came back, I walked by that district court office and thought very much at that time about Justice Brown. She currently serves as an associate justice on the California Supreme Court, a position she has held since 1996. She is the first African-American woman to serve on California's highest court and was retained with 76 percent of the statewide vote in her last election.  It is kind of interesting that they use the term ``out of the mainstream'' quite often. Yet here is someone who got 76 percent of the vote in a statewide election. Justice Owen actually got 84 percent. I don't think anybody in this body has been able to gain those majorities.  Justice Brown was the daughter of a sharecropper. She was born in Greenville, AL, in 1949. She grew up attending segregated schools during the practice of Jim Crow policies in the South. Her family moved to Sacramento, CA, when she was in her teens, and she later received her B.A. in economics from California State, and earned her J.D. from UCLA School of Law in 1977.  She has participated in a variety of statewide and community organizations dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens of California.  For example, she has served as a member of the California Commission on the Status of African-American Males, as a member of the Governor's Child Support Task Force, and as a member of the Community Learning Advisory Board of the Rio Americano High School.  Two weeks ago, my colleague in the other Chamber, Congressman Dan Lungren of California--he is a Congressman I served with for many years when I was in the other body, and he went on to be the Attorney General from the State of California. He spoke of his professional experience with Justice Brown. I really think it is important to go back to people who have served with them at the grassroots level. He was in State government with her in the early 1990s. Congressman Lungren said:        . . . It is my observation that in the absence of the      opportunity to be voted up or down, to be subjected to a      debate on the floor of the United States Senate in the      context of such a consideration, that in fact the Janice      Rogers Brown that I know in the State of California . . . is      not the person that I hear discussed, the person that I hear      characterized, or the person that I see presented in the      press and other places.       When I was elected the attorney general in the State of      California and took office in January of 1991, I asked a      number of people who had previously served in the attorney      general's Office for recommendations of people who should      serve at the top level of the department of justice in my      administration. Her name (Justice Brown) was always offered      by those who had experience in that office.       During the confirmation hearings that we had, I had the      opportunity to review the opinions that she had written while      on the appellate court. Interestingly enough, every single      member of the appellate court on which she served recommended      her confirmation to the California supreme court. I recall at      the time that the chief justice of the California supreme      court, Justice Ron George, surprised the public hearing that      we had by actually putting on the table every     single written opinion that she had done and advising      everybody there that he had read every opinion that she had      written at that point in time, not once but twice, and      rendering his opinion that she was well qualified to serve on      the California supreme court.  Further quoting:       If you look at her opinions, they are the opinions of      someone who understands what I believe jurists ought to      understand, that their obligation is to interpret the law,      not make the law.  He concluded his statement by saying:       My point this evening is a simple one. That which we are      observing in the Senate is denying the American people an      opportunity to review the nominees of the President of the      United States. It is my belief that Janice Brown should be      presented to the United States Senate for consideration. She      is an American story. From the humblest background, she has      risen to the highest court in the most populous State in the      Nation. She subscribes to a judicial philosophy considered      radical in some circles, that the text of the Constitution      actually means something. She holds to a consistent      enforcement of individual rights that is not result oriented.       In my judgment, these are the qualities of a true jurist      and is why she should be confirmed to sit on the DC Circuit      Court of Appeals and, at the very least, that her story be      told in open debate on the floor of the United States Senate      in the context of the consideration of her nomination by the      whole body.  That is what we are attempting to do today. This is a debate that could quickly be brought to an end by a simple up-or-down vote. We offered the minority as much time as they wanted to debate these nominees, as long as an up-or-down vote would follow. But this hasn't happened.  As a matter of fact, at least seven of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have actually stated the same thing--that nominees deserve an up-or-down vote regarding previous nominees, and they all received an up-or-down vote. The same people now that are objecting to an up-or-down vote are the ones who stood up and said we think they should have an up-or-down vote previously. Somehow that has changed from the 1990s, and they don't want that.  Let me remind them that Senator Durbin said this on September 28, 1998: We should vote the person up or down. That is all we want.  Senator Feinstein, on September 16, 1999, said a nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up or down.  Again, Senator Feinstein, a month later, said in October of 1999:       Our institutional integrity requires an up-or-down vote.  That is what we are talking about, our institutional integrity. I agree with Senator Feinstein from 1999.  On March 7, 2000, Senator Kennedy said:       The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court said, ``The      Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any      particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry,      it should vote him up or down, which is exactly what I would      like.  Senator Lautenberg said:       Talking about the fairness in the system and how it is      equitable for a minority to restrict the majority view, why      can we not have a straight up-or-down vote?  That was on June 21, 1995.  Senator Leahy, who actually chaired that committee, said:       When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S.      Supreme Court, I was the first Member of the Senate to      declare my opposition to his nomination. I did not believe      that Clarence Thomas was qualified to serve on the Court.      Even with strong reservations, I felt that Judge Thomas      deserved an up-or-down vote.  Again, 4 years later, Senator Leahy said:        . . . I also took the floor on occasion to oppose      filibusters to hold them up and believe that we should have a      vote up or down.  Senator Lincoln said:       It's my hope that we'll take the necessary steps to give      these men and these women especially the up-or-down vote that      they deserve.  That was in the year 2000.  Senator Sarbanes said:       It is not whether you let the President have his nominees      confirmed. You will not even let them be considered . . .      with an up-or-down vote.  I could go on and on. In fact, I did the other day. I went over so many of these people who are demanding an up-or-down vote. Not only are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle holding up these qualified judges by not allowing an up-or-down vote, I also believe they are discriminating against people of faith.  I will reiterate a quote from an article in the L.A. Times that I read on the floor in April regarding the filibuster of qualified nominees, such as Justices Owen and Brown. It states, and I am quoting now the L.A. Times which has never been accused of being a Republican newspaper:       These are confusing days in Washington. Born-again      conservative Christians who strongly want to see President      Bush's judicial nominees voted on are leading the charge      against the Senate filibuster, and liberal Democrats are      born-again believers in that reactionary, obstructionist      legislative tactic. Practically every big-name liberal      senator you can think of derided the filibuster a decade ago      and now sees the error of his or her ways and will go to      amusing lengths to try to convince you that the change of      heart is explained by something deeper than the mere      difference between being in the majority and being in the      minority.  I know that both Justice Brown and Justice Owen are active members of churches and are distinguished women of faith.  Justice Brown has taught adult Sunday school at her church for more than 10 years, and Justice Owen teaches Sunday school and is the head of the altar guild at her church.  One has to ask the question, Have we come to the point in America where Sunday school teachers are disqualified by the strength of their faith and the boldness of their beliefs?  The Bible urges us, like Justices Brown and Owen, to be bold in our faith. I Timothy 3:13 says:       For they that have used the office of a deacon well      purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in      the faith which is in Christ Jesus.  Hebrews 4:16 says:       Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that      we may obtain mercy. . . .  I agree with Justice Brown, as she recently told an audience, that people of faith were embroiled in a war against secular humanists who threatened to divorce America from its religious roots, according to a newspaper quoted in an April 26, L.A. Times article.  One example of this attack is our parental notification and consent laws which require girls under 18 who are seeking an abortion to either notify or obtain permission--either notify or obtain permission--from one or both of her parents. Many States have such laws. However, there are many instances where these protective laws have been struck down by liberal judges who are bypassing the law and legislating from the bench.  For example, on August 5, 1997, the California Supreme Court issued its decision in American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren. The court held that the 1987 statute requiring minors seeking abortion to obtain parental consent or judicial authorization violates the California Constitution's explicit right to privacy.  This is outrageous. Parents have a right to know what their children are doing. Children who are not old enough to vote or drink, why should they be old enough to have an abortion without at least telling their parents? We are not talking about getting permission, we are talking about notifying them.  In another case, Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the Supreme Court held that statutes, which allow a parent or guardian to absolutely prohibit an abortion to be performed on a minor child, were unconstitutional.  There are a number of such cases. The whole point is this is outrageous.  We keep hearing people say these two justices are out of mainstream America, and I suggest to you, Mr. President, that it is the individuals who are making the accusations who are out of the mainstream. It was not long ago that they did polling on all these traditional values, and it would seem to me that the traditional values are in the mainstream. It is the liberals who are opposing these nominations who are out of the mainstream.  To give an example, by 85 to 15 percent, Americans say religion is very or fairly important in their lives. Only 15 percent say it is unimportant.  In the case of Government should help faith-based initiatives to help the poor, 72 percent of Americans agree. On the issue of whether violent attackers of pregnant women who kill the baby should be prosecuted for killing the baby, 84 percent say yes. That is mainstream.  On the issue of whether children should be allowed to pray in school, 78 percent of Americas agree.  And 73 percent of Americans favor a law requiring women under the age of18 to get parental consent for any abortion. Democrats are with the 24 percent who oppose it.  That is mainstream America, Mr. President. Also, 74 percent oppose removing all references to God from oaths of public office--74 percent--and 91 percent of Americans want to keep the phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Those who are opposing them are on the other side of these issues. I suggest this all averages to over 78 percent of the American people believe these issues, and that is clearly the will of the American people. That is mainstream. That is what our Founding Fathers talked about when they founded this great country, this one Nation under God.  We have said it over and over again. I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada is here to speak. I agree with all the liberal Democratic Senators who in the 1990s said: All we want is an up-or-down vote; that is all we are asking today. They got theirs, now we deserve ours.  I yield the floor.
