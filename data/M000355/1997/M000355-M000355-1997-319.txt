 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true Kentucky legend. Triple Crown winners have a special place in every thoroughbred racing fan's heart, especially those of us who are lucky enough to have enjoyed their successes.  The last favorite to win the derby and the only undefeated triple crown champion in history, Seattle Slew came into the famed mile and a quarter race full of promise. Overcoming a disastrous start, the big bay righted himself and headed for the front where he would remain for the rest of the race, securing the first of the three jewels he would collect during the spring of 1977.  A mere 11 horses in history have won the triple crown, with only 3 accomplishing the feat since 1948. Select company indeed. If horse racing is the sport of kings then Seattle Slew is truly one of its emperors.  Some may think the champion stallion now lives the ``Life of Riley'' at Robert and Alice Clay's Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, KY. But, Seattle Slew did not stop setting records when his racing days were behind him, a fact I know the Clay family is eternally grateful for. He has sired dozens of champions who have racked up almost $50 million in career earnings.  The world recognizes that Three Chimneys is known for its champions, but even among the daunting lineup stabled in Midway, Seattle Slew stands out.  So, here's to the Clays, Three Chimneys, and most importantly one of the great legends in sport, Seattle Slew. As I grow older, 20 years seems like a very brief time, but it has been more than long enough for this great stallion to leave his indelible mark on the sport and those who love him.  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the April 27 Lexington Herald Leader be printed in the Record.  The article follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 27, 1997]                           A Champion Endures                            (By Mark Story)       He had no reason to be a champion.       In a sport where pedigree is everything, Seattle Slew was a      commoner, the son of an unproven, unknown sire (Bold      Reasoning) who would die not long after Slew's birth.       He was born deformed, ``turned out in front,'' which meant      at least one of his legs was not correctly aligned to the      rest of his body.       In his first year of life, he was so awkward his handlers      nicknamed him ``Baby Huey'' after the accident-prone cartoon      character.       Only by a freak of nature could such a horse aspire to      greatness.       But in the world of racing, freaks do occur.       Twenty years ago this spring, Seattle Slew stamped himself      with racing immortality.       Overcoming one obstacle after another, he became the only      horse ever to win the Triple Crown--the Kentucky Derby, the      Preakness and the Belmont--with an unbeaten record.       Then, after almost dying from a mysterious viral illness,      he returned to the track as a 4-year-old and re-established      his legend, defeating 1978 Triple Crown champion Affirmed      along the way.       As a sire, Slew has also attained greatness, producing      champions such as 1984 Derby winner Swale, Slew o' Gold and      Capote. The legendary Cigar is a Seattle Slew grandson, as is      Pulpit, one of the favorites for this year's Derby.       At 23, Slew shows little sign of slowing down. He continues      to be a productive sire, commanding a $100,000 stud fee while      standing at Three Chimneys Farm.       Not a bad life's work for a freak.       ``This horse is all heart, every bit heart,'' said Mickey      Taylor, one of Slew's owners during his racing days and his      syndicate manager now. ``He tried his best at everything we      ever asked him to do. And he had the talent to do about      anything we asked.''                           an obstacle course       For Seattle Slew, nothing ever came easily.       His trip through the Triple Crown was an epic tale of      problems overcome.       Derby obstacle. Sent off as the 1-2 favorite by a Derby      crowd of 124,038, he very nearly lost the race in the      starting gate.       Fractious in the gate, Slew was caught flat-footed when it      opened. He nearly reared coming out of the gate, came very      close to making a sideways start and alarmingly near to      throwing jockey Jean Cruguet.       Before he ever started running, he was five lengths behind      the field.       In the Churchill Downs owner's boxes, Mickey Taylor put      down his binoculars.       ``I wished we were anyplace else in the world at that      moment,'' he said last week. ``I thought we were cooked.''       On the track, Cruguet didn't feel much better. But the      French jockey made a snap decision. He asked Slew for      everything he had. ``It was do or die,'' Cruguet said last      week. ``It was easy to decide for me: We had to go.''       And go Slew did.       Flying toward the front, he bulled through horses and,      miraculously, was within a head of the leader, For The      Moment, after a quarter mile.       More miraculously, Slew did not tire after his sprint to      the front. He won by 1\3/4\ lengths over Run Dusty Run.       The win was sweet vindication for Slew trainer Billy      Turner. Early on, Turner had decided never to ask Seattle      Slew to do too much in training. He was afraid if he worked      him too hard, the horse's natural inclination toward speed      would become dominant and Slew would never develop the      stamina required to run Classic distances.       This was a courageous, disciplined training decision--and      one widely second-guessed in the weeks leading up to the '77      Derby. The joke was that Turner was ``walking Slew up to the      Derby.''       It took guts to stay with it.       ``This was a very fast horse,'' Cruguet said. ``A lot of      people would have burnt him up. Billy did a very good job      getting him to stretch out and run distances.''       Preakness obstacle. But speed was the problem in the      Preakness. A talented, fresh speed horse, Cormorant, would      try Slew at Pimlico after skipping the Derby.       Cormorant's connections were so confident they showed up in      Baltimore sporting ``Slew Who?'' T-shirts.       Then Cormorant drew the inside post position, the place to      be on a Pimlico track with tight turns and a bias toward      speed.       In the race, Cormorant beat Slew to the front and to the      rail. He then held his spot, forcing Seattle Slew to race him      around the track on the outside.       So Cruguet and Slew dug in. They hooked Cormorant in a      withering speed duel, running the fastest mile (1:34\4/5\) in      Preakness history.       Cormorant wilted; Slew didn't, and finished the race 1\1/2\      lengths ahead of Iron Constitution.       Belmont obstacle. In the Belmont, the problem was supposed      to be distance. Many thought Slew was not bred to run 1\1/2\      miles. But that turned out to be a breeze; the problem was      traffic--not horses on the track, but cars parked around the      track. There were so many that Seattle Slew could not get to      the track.       When he finally made it, the race was almost an anticlimax.      Slew controlled the pace from the front and easily defeated      Run Dusty Run by 4 lengths.       The 10th Triple Crown winner, Slew was the only one who was      undefeated at the time he won.                           off-the-track woes       Seattle Slew's racing brilliance was nearly matched by the      turbulence that would engulf his owners and handlers over the      years.       At the time of the Kentucky Derby, Karen Taylor, Mickey's      wife, was listed as the owner.       A former flight attendant, Karen Taylor became a media      darling in the spring of 1977 for her unassuming ways. ``I      live in a mobile home and I drive a pickup truck,'' she said      then, ``but I've got a hell of a horse.''       But by the time the horse ran in the Belmont, it had become      public that the ownership of Seattle Slew was more complex.       It turned out the horse was actually owned through a      corporation (Wooden Horse Investments Inc.) by the pension      and profit-sharing plans of Dr. James Hill and a logging      company owned by Mickey Taylor, Karen's husband.       Hill, at the time a New York-based veterinarian, had helped      the Taylors pick out Seattle Slew at the 1975 Fasig-Tipton      yearling sale.       As an act of friendship, they say now, the Taylors      eventually made Hill a half-owner in Seattle Slew.       New York racing officials looked askance at Slew's      ownership structure.       In court documents from a subsequent lawsuit, Taylor and      Hill maintained that ownership of Seattle Slew was set up as      it was for tax reasons.       But in New York, it was against the rules for a practicing      veterinarian to have ownership in a horse. The rationale was      that it created at least the appearance of a conflict of      interest if a vet were treating horses who might race against      a horse he owned.       On August 25 of '77, New York racing officials suspended      Hill for 30 days. He called the suspension unjust, but did      not appeal.       For the ``Slew Crew,'' as the horse's connnections were      called, the trouble was just beginning.       After the Belmont, trainer Turner announced that Slew would      be taking several months off from training. He even had the      racing shoes taken off the horse's hooves.       But in a controversial decision, the owners overruled him      and decided to race Seattle Slew in the $300,000 Swaps Stakes      at Hollywood Park in July.       The race was a disaster.       Sent off as the 1-5 favorite, Slew never fired and was      humiliated, finishing a badly beaten fourth, 16 lengths      behind winner J.O. Tobin.       To this day, the Taylors maintain that Turner signed off on      shipping Slew west, but the trainer was widely quoted after      the race saying that was untrue. In one interview, he called      it ``the dumbest thing I ever heard.''       ``After the Belmont, (Seattle Slew) was dead,'' Cruguet      said, ``. . . The owners, they thought he was a machine.''       Cruguet said he knew after a quarter mile that he was on a      beaten horse. ``This horse had never lost,'' Cruguet said.      ``It was not a good feeling.''       From that day on, things were never the same for the      original ``Slew Crew.''       By December of 1977, the owners had fired Turner. The sides      could never heal the breach over the decision to ship west.       Eventually, Turner would sue the owners, claiming they      reneged on a promise to give him a lucrative lifetime      breeding share in Seattle Slew.       Shortly after Turner was fired, Seattle Slew almost died.       For four days in January of '78, the horse ran a fever. For      a time, he refused to eat or drink. His bodily functions      ceased. A low white blood cell count suggested a serious      infection.       His owners were distraught. Karen Taylor would cradle the      ill horse's head on her lap, and sing him lullabies.       ``Ninety-nine percent of horses would have died,'' Mickey      Taylor said.       Slew didn't. In fact, he recovered and returned to the      track to win five of seven races as a 4-year-old (both losses      were in photo finishes). He added to his legacy by defeating      Affirmed and was 1978's Champion Older Horse.       What almost killed Slew? Mickey Taylor said he knows, but      will not reveal it until Seattle Slew's career at stud is      finished. He did say the horse was not poisoned.       But even after Seattle Slew's racing career ended, the      turmoil among his ``Crew'' did not. By 1992, the owners were      suing each other.       Once, Hill and Taylor had been so close that Hill said they      did not need a contract to do business: ``A handshake with a      man I trust'' was enough, he said.       In 1992, Hill filed suit against Taylor, claiming that      Taylor had, among other things, siphoned money from their      corporation, used corporation money to buy houses for family      members and hired and overpaid his relatives.       In November of '93, a jury in Lexington found for Hill and      awarded him $4.4 million.       Now, the Taylors said they do not speak with the Hills.       ``There really isn't much there to be said,'' Karen Taylor      said.                      `it's almost like he knows'       Today, Seattle Slew occupies a 16 16 stall in the main      stallion barn at Three Chimneys Farm.       Among those quartered with him are two of his sons, Slew O'      Gold and Capote as well as such well-known horses as Arazi      and Wild Again.       Even at 23, Slew boasts the top stud fee at the farm      ($100,000). ``He's one of the most potent horses we have,''      said Three Chimneys Stallion Manager Wes Lanter.       As a sire, Slew has emerged as clearly superior to the      other two modern Triple Crown winners, Secretariat and      Affirmed.       ``It's not even close,'' said William Munn, a thoroughbred      pedigree expert based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.       Seattle Slew has had success on both sides of his line. He      sired another Kentucky Derby winner, Swale (1984) and another      Horse of the year, A.P. Indy (1992). On the other side,      Cigar, who tied Citation's North American record with 16      straight wins, was the son of a Seattle Slew mare.       Though there are no guarantees in the world of horse      health, farm officials think Slew has a good chance to live      into his 30s.       Many of Seattle Slew's days start about 7 a.m., when he is      saddled and ridden around the all-weather track at Three      Chimneys, where he has stood at stud since 1985.       (Continuing his knack for finding off-the-track turmoil,      Seattle Slew began his stallion career at the ill-fated      Spendthrift Farm, which collapsed financially in 1988).       It is fairly unusual for horses standing at stud to be      ridden, but Three Chimneys rides all its stallions.       ``We think it keeps them healthy, and we think it keeps      them happy,'' said Farm Manager Dan Rosenberg.       The man who knows Slew better than anyone, his groom of 15      years, Tom Wade, says Slew hasn't changed much over the      years. He has a touch of arthritis and his back has drooped      just a bit. ``But he's a fit horse,'' Wade said. ``You can      look at him and see that.''       Now, as the 20th anniversary of his Triple Crown      approaches, Judy DeHaan, the exercise rider at Three      Chimneys, has noticed something funny about Slew.       ``It's almost like he knows,'' she said. ``He's gotten a      little spring in his step again. Lately, it's like `Hold on      Judy. We're gonna go.'       ``Even at 23, on his good days, he's still got      it.''                          ____________________
