President, I would like to take a moment to tell you about a remarkable young man from my hometown of Springfield, IL. His name is Matthew Blade. In late May, Matthew graduated from Lutheran High School in Springfield as his class valedictorian. He was also the president of his senior class, president of his school's Spanish Honor Society and an Illinois State scholar. He was involved in theater and Madrigal singers and his school's praise band. He was a member of Students Against Destructive Decisions. Outside of school, Matthew volunteers at a local food pantry, and he is an Eagle Scout.  If Matthew Blade had done nothing more, he would be exceptional. What makes Matthew's accomplishments even more extraordinary is that Matthew Blade spent half of his high school years battling bone cancer.  He first felt the pain in his left arm when he was 15 years old, a sophomore. At first, he thought he might have pulled a muscle playing soccer. When the pain didn't go away, Matthew went in for x rays, then an MRI. The same day he underwent the MRI, Matthew and his parents, Doug and Tricia, received the devastating diagnosis. The pain in Matthew's arm was not a sprained muscles; it was most likely osteocarcoma, a type of bone cancer.  What Matthew did next tells you a lot about his character. He went to school, didn't tell anyone about his diagnosis, took a biology exam--and aced the test.  But Matthew wasn't able to keep his diagnosis private for long. Over the next 9 months he underwent 18 grueling chemotherapy treatments. Each time, he had to be hospitalized for 4 or 5 days. His mom Tricia never left his side. Matthew lost his hair and his eyelashes. When he was up to it, he went to school, often pulling an I.V. bag on a pole. When he was too sick for school, he kept up with his lessons from home or from his hospital bed.  What got him through those hard times, he said, was his faith, prayers, the love of his family, and ``great doctors and nurses'' at St. John's Hospital in Springfield and Children's Hospital in St. Louis. His other saving grace, he says, were his friends, who never treated him differently and helped him to feel like a normal kid, even at his sickest.  Matthew undergoes scans every 6 months to monitor his health. His latest scans, in June, showed ``no detectable cancer.'' These days, his hair has grown back. He is playing soccer again. He is working this summer as a counselor at a church summer camp, working with little kids, ages 5 to 7.  But the cancer changed Matthew in some ways. Early in his treatment, he had to have a 6-1/2 inch section of his left humerus bone--the long bone in his upper arm--removed, so he can no longer lift his left arm above his head. After the surgery, Matthew had to wear a sling, which made playing his guitar impossible, but Matthew adapted. He learned how to play the ukulele.  Before his diagnosis, Matthew wanted to be a lawyer. Now, he wants to be a pediatric oncologist, to help other kids with cancer. He is looking forward to starting college in the fall at St. Louis University.  In his valedictory remarks, Matthew told his classmates: ``Life--like a hike through the mountains--is full of peaks and valleys. The more time you spend in the valleys, the sweeter the peaks will seem.'' By his example, Matthew Blade has taught his classmates--and really, our whole town of Springfield--how to endure life's valleys, and how to cherish its peaks.  I want to wish Matthew all the best on his accomplishment, and I know I am not alone in saying that I can't wait to see what he does with the rest of his remarkable life.                          ____________________
