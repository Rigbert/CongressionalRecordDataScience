Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Representative Bill Emerson, a distinguished American who served his country with unsurpassed dignity and an inspiring fighting spirit.  Representative Emerson began his public service as a teenaged House page in 1954. He later served on the staffs of Representative Bob Ellsworth and Senator Charles Mathias.  In 1980, Representative Emerson sacrificed a lucrative lobbying career to run for Congress. Through his dogged determination and exemplary integrity, Bill Emerson defeated the Democratic incumbent, becoming the first Republican in 50 years to represent the Cape Girardeau-Bootheel region.  During his 16 years in Congress and throughout his life, Bill Emerson earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues and the public. He was able to rise above politics and work together with Members on the other side of the aisle to pass legislation benefiting our country. As a compassionate leader on the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson dedicated much of his efforts to food stamps and nutrition programs.  No matter what challenge life threw at him, Bill Emerson attacked it with every fiber in his body. He fought and defeated alcohol dependency and never gave up his fight against cancer. Since being diagnosed with cancer last November, Bill's spirit and zeal for life never wavered.  This House and our country has lost a great American patriot. I offer my condolences to the family and friends of the Honorable Bill Emerson.
