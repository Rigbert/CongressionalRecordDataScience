Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's thoughtful comments regarding crisis levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking and the need to do something about it. This is a deadly serious matter with national security implications. That is why this bill has increased funding by $15 million since fiscal year 2013 in order to fight wildlife poachers and traffickers.  Without question, Republicans do not want to see elephants go extinct; but when the Fish and Wildlife Service made the unilateral determination to ban the trade and transport of products containing ivory that have been in the United States legally for years, we heard from orchestra musicians, art museums, wildlife conservation organizations, collectors of fine antiques from chess pieces to pool cues to firearms, and nearly everyone in every organization in between.  They are united in support for elephants, but they are also united in their opposition to new Federal restrictions on products that contain ivory legally obtained. The reality is family heirlooms and rare musical instruments didn't cause the problem, andthe Fish and Wildlife Service should be acknowledging as much.  This bill keeps the status quo, allowing for continued legal trade and transport so that collectors, musicians, and others can get on with their lives until the Fish and Wildlife Service writes a rule that reflects the legitimate concerns of law-abiding U.S. citizens.  The administration is rumored to be just days away from publishing a revised rule to address most of these concerns. If that is the case and if the revised rule solves the problem, then there will be no need for this provision in the final conference report later in the year.  In any case, I remain fully committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a reasonable solution moving forward. In the meantime, I must oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
