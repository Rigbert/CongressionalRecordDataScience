Speaker, as a Member of the Appropriations Committee, I am particularly concerned that our tax dollars be spent efficiently and effectively. Congress has created hundreds of programs that help communities and families deal with numerous issues related to joblessness, homelessness, poor health, and education. We created each of these programs with its own rules and regulations to deal with specific problems. In some areas where local needs do not perfectly fit the problems covered by these programs, services for children and families are vastly inadequate. In other areas, services overlap and duplicate each other. Multiple programs may point multiple case workers toward a single family, but each individual case worker only handles one aspect of that family's needs. I believe the time is long overdue for Congress to deal with this problem. We must coordinate our categorical programs to provide more effective and efficient help to children and families.  Imagine a single mom who is trying to get off welfare. She gets up in the morning and helps her two children, ages 4 and 7, get ready for school. Together, they walk down the street to the bus stop. All three of them get on the bus together and go to school. Mom drops the 4-year-old off at Head Start, takes the 7-year-old to second grade, and goes down the hall to her own computer literacy and graduate equivalency degree classes.  When the family needs immunizations or health screenings, they can go to the school-based clinic. There is also a social services office at the school. The social services coordinator can help the family find housing, food, and health care. There is also a job placement coordinator down the hall to help mom find a job when she finishes her classes.  At the end of the day, the family goes home from school together. Mom cooks a meal she learned about in her nutrition course taught by the school nurse. She gives her children jobs in the kitchen recommended by the parent education coordinator.  The kinds like going to school. They know it's important, because mom goes to school, too. Mom talks to their teachers every day and knows if there is a problem in the classroom. If one of the kids is sick, mom is at school to take care of them. Instead of spending her day traveling from school to GED classes to computer training to social service office after social service office, mom can focus on her most important tasks: caring for her children and learning marketable skills so she can find a job and support her family.  Unfortunately, this model of coordinated, one-stop programs to help children and families move off of government assistance is rare. Last fall, I pretended that I was a welfare parent for a day. I needed help with child support enforcement, housing, school registration, child care, and heating my home through the winter. Even though caseworkers expedited my applications, I spent more than 2 hours driving across southern Maryland collecting several hundred pages of application forms.  Our service system is too disconnected. There are literally scores of different programs in separate parts of each community. Caseworkers spend far too much time dealing with redtape and paperwork, multiple eligibility criteria, application processes, and service requirements. These workers may not know about each other or talk to each other, even when they are helping the same families.  We have asked families to get back on their feet so they can take care of themselves and their children but our maze of Federal rules, regulations, and systems makes it more difficult for community programs to assist families in doing this. We must help these families help themselves by reinventing a system of coordinated, one-stop programs.  This is why I am reintroducing the Family Services Improvement Act. The bill takes important steps to correct these problems. It seeks to eliminate Federal redtape and unnecessary regulation. It will give local programs the flexibility they need to address local problems. It will create incentives for program coordination which will serve children and families better while making more efficient use of our resources. It will shift Federal attention to outcomes so we can make sure that we are getting real results for our taxpayer dollar. Our taxpayers, and our children, deserve nothing less.                          ____________________
