 Dodd, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Enzi,         Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Robb, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray,         Mr. Gorton, Mr. Hutchinson Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Bingaman, Mr.         Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Lugar):  S. 2323. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to clarify the treatment of stock options under the act; read the first time.                    worker economic opportunity act Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. Senator Dodd and I have worked closely with Senators Jeffords and Enzi, as well as Senators Abraham, Bennett, Lieberman, and others to develop this important bill. This important bipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive lucrative stock options from their employers--once considered the exclusive perk of corporate executives.  In recent years our country's innovative new workplaces and creative employers have offered new financial opportunities--such as stock options--for hourly employees. The Department of Labor recently issued an interpretation of the decades-old labor and employment laws that could keep normal employees from reaping the benefits of these perks. When I realized this, I decided we needed to fix this problem--it would have been a travesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the average employee to share in his or her company's economic growth.  This law simply says: it makes no difference if you work in the corporate boardroom or on the factory floor--everyone should be able to share in the success of the company.  Our bill changes the outdated laws so they don't stand in the way of economic opportunity for American workers. In sum, the bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure that employer-provided stock option programs are allowed just like employee bonuses already are. Also, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that specifies that employers have no liability because of any stock options or similar programs that they have given to employees in the past. The bill I am introducing today is what I hope will be the first of many common-sense efforts to drag old labor and employment laws into the new millennium.  I am very pleased that Secretary Herman and the Department of Labor have worked with us on this legislation. The Worker Economic Opportunity Act is also supported by a broad range of high tech and business groups who have joined together to form the Coalition to Promote Employee Stock Ownership. This group has been of great assistance throughout the development of this bill.  An identical companion bill to the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is being introduced in the House today. As a result, I am optimistic that we can work to ensure that this much-needed fix to the FLSA becomes law in the near future.
