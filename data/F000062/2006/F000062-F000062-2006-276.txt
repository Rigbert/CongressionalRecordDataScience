 President, I rise today to introduce the Redwood Valley County Water District Loan Renegotiation Act of 2006.  This legislation seeks to implement prior congressional action taken in 1988 to require the Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate debts owed by the Redwood Valley County Water District to the United States. It is an absolutely essential step if the Redwood County is to obtain a firm and reliable water supply.  In 1983, the Redwood Valley County Water District completed a project to supply water to a rural agricultural community near Ukiah, in Northern California. Two Bureau of Reclamation loans totaling $7.3 million partially financed this project.  Unfortunately, the District was unable to repay these loans. This occurred for several reasons: The initial use projections developed by the District and reviewed by the Bureau were seriously flawed; the District's ability to raise funds was restricted when a moratorium on new hook-ups was imposed; and concerns for endangered species reduced the District's water allotment by 15 percent.  As a result of this situation, in 1998 Congress passed Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 that indefinitely suspended the District's obligations to repay these Bureau loans and ordered the Secretary of Interior to renegotiate the terms of the loans. This loan renegotiation has never taken place and now the District finds its water supply highly uncertain. The Bureau of Reclamation acknowledged in a 2000 report that the District needs a reliable water supply in order to solve its current financial dilemma.  The District has recently identified two potential new projects, either of which could supply a firm and reliable source. No government funds will be sought for these projects, and the District will rely on private financing, a strategy that the Bureau is encouraging. However, before the District can secure private financing for new projects, it must renegotiate the existing loans to provide for their repayment subsequent to repayment of the new loans.  This legislation requires the District to repay the United States the currently suspended loans once the new loans have been repaid. The new water project will provide enough revenue to allow the District to repay both its private loan and the United States government. By providing a workable and reasonable solution to a longstanding problem, the legislation creates a win-win solution for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Redwood Valley County Water District.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3189       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. RENEGOTIATION OF PAYMENT SCHEDULE.       Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 (102 Stat. 2573) is      amended as follows:       (1) By amending paragraph (2) of subsection (a) to read as      follows:       ``(2) If, as of January 1, 2006, the Secretary of the      Interior and the Redwood Valley County Water District have      not renegotiated the schedule of payment, the District may      enter into such additional non-Federal obligations as are      necessary to finance procurement of dedicated water rights      and improvements necessary to store and convey those rights      to provide for the District's water needs. The renegotiated      schedule of payments shall commence when which additional      obligations have been financially satisfied by the District.      The date of the initial payment owed by the District to the      United States shall be regarded as the start of the      District's repayment period and the time upon which any      interest shall first be computed and assessed under section 5      of the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422a      et seq.).''.       (2) By striking subsection (c).                                 ______                                       By
