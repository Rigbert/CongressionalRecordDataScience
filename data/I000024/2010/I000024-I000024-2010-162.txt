President, first of all, I would like to make one statement on the DeMint amendment that was just defeated. I have to say this, as the person who was most recently characterized as the most conservative Member of the Senate: If there is anyone out there who thinks that was a conservative vote on earmarks, they are wrong. There has never been one case where an earmark has saved one penny that has been reduced.  I have to say this: Senator DeMint had $70 million worth of highway earmarks that were in the amendment that we are talking about right now.  Real quickly: The Feingold amendment does not reduce the deficit one penny. Because of environmental laws and other things, the CBO and the administration have said the average time for a highway project is 13 years. For example, in my State of Oklahoma, Highway 40--a huge project--was started in 1991. If this amendment had been in there, that project would have been terminated in 2001.  I urge my conservative friends, unless you just don't like highways and roads, to kill this amendment.
