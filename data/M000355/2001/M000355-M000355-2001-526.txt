 President, the next amendment will be offered on the Republican side. I had indicated to my colleague, Senator Dodd, it will be either in the area of soft money or an amendment concerning lobbyists. We are going to work that out during lunch. It will be laid down at 2:15 p.m. Of course, the amendment will be laid down at the beginning. We will not have the confusion that surrounded the last amendment, and everyone will be fully apprised of what is in it.
