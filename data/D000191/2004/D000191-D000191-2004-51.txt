Speaker, well, today we finally have the 9/11 Commission report; but unfortunately on the other side of the aisle, they want to focus on Sandy Berger, a former high-ranking official in the Clinton administration and his transgressions, whatever they might be. Whatever they might be, they did not kill 3,000 people. They did not destroy the World Trade Center. They did not attack the Pentagon, the United States of America, attempted to attack the Capitol and the White House, and he is not planning another attack on the United States of America, unlike al Qaeda, who is still out there planning another attack.  In fact, we have heard from the head of homeland security. It is an imminent threat of attack that will happen sometime between now and the election. And this report points to the fact that we have not taken the steps necessary to utilize and better utilize the resources of the Government of the United States of America to forestall that attack.  Now, remember, a number of us on this side of the aisle called for a Cabinet-level position to coordinate intelligence on the head of the homeland security. The President said no; but after public opinion moved against him, finally they threw out a proposal, just about 2 years ago today.  And 2 years ago today they threw out this proposal, full-blown from the basement of the White House, to create a 270,000-person bureaucracy that would be the Department of Homeland Security; but curiously enough, it did not go to the issues raised in this report, which is it did not touch the intelligence agencies, the CIA, all the intelligence agencies at the Defense Department. They were excluded from Homeland Security. It did not go to the FBI, who failed to coordinate and get the information and share information with the CIA and let people into the country who were on a terrorist watch list, but we let them into the country with visas who were some of the perpetrators of this attack.  They say we need to make major structural changes to address those deficiencies. We have not made them. The Department of Homeland Security did not do it. We created this little weeny thing called the TTIC, Terrorist Threat Information Center, where the various agencies sent over short-term detailees who have no authority, who are supposed to share; but they still do not share. They do not like to share. We have multibillion dollar intelligence agencies, and they are like 3-year-olds. It is mine; it is mine. They do not want to share. Unfortunately, people die when they do not share, and we need to break down that culture.  Now they want to go back and blame Berger and the Clinton administration. This report says both the Clinton administration, the Clinton administration and the Bush administration are to blame, but that is history. What are we going to do today to adopt the recommendations of this report? Because they say the problems are ongoing. They are ongoing. They are still not sharing. We are still not coordinating. We are not defending ourselves to the best of our ability. They make two recommendations, a national counterterrorism center. Great idea, seems like to me. And a national intelligence director, who would be appointed by the President, based in the White House, with a large staff and would have the authority to make the intelligence agencies and the FBI share. No more 3-year-olds saying mine, mine, you cannot have it, but make them share in a meaningful way.  Put together the pieces of the puzzle. They point out here we had 10 pieces of the puzzle, but we failed to put it together. We cannot fail again, but they are saying we will. This is a nonpartisan report, unanimous by Republicans and Democrats alike. Most former elected officials, Governors, Senators, Members of Congress. This should not be politicized.                              {time}  2300  Let us not waste time down here talking about Sandy Berger. Maybe he committed a crime, maybe. Maybe he did not. Fine. They are investigating, put him in jail if he committed the crime. That is not the point. The point is there is someone out there planning an attack on the United States today which has nothing to do with what that guy might have done or not done, but it has a lot to do with what we have not done here with the inadequacies of the Homeland Security Department that we adopted 2 years ago that are ongoing.  It is all in this report. I urge people to get a copy, to read it and to demand that their Members of Congress, their Senators take meaningful action in the near future.                          ____________________
