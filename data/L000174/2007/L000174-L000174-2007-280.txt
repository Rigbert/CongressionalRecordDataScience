President, I compliment my colleagues for moving so rapidly through the Military Construction legislation. It brings us to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which Senator Gregg, my friend and neighbor from New Hampshire, and I will be handling. I want to make a couple comments.  If there are Senators who have amendments, I urge that they bring them to the floor. I understand because of the policy luncheons, it will probably be about an hour before we get to an amendment. But if there aren't any amendments pending, it would be my intent, if the Senator from New Hampshire has none, to go to final passage. We would like to wrap up this bill, if we can, today. I thank both Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for calling up this bill. I also thank Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for the allocation we have.  I do want to say, at the risk of causing political problems for him back in my neighboring State of New Hampshire, how appreciative I am to Senator Gregg and his staff for the bipartisan way they worked with me and my staff. Senator McConnell and I had established this way of doing things for a number of years, when he was chairman and I was chairman. We realized that, almost like the Vandenberg rule, bipartisanship has to begin at the water's edge. We have tried to do that with this bill.  We have a balanced bill. When it was reported out of the Appropriations Committee, 28 of the 29 members of the committee voted for it.  As a housekeeping matter, I remind Senators that on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 83 to 14, the Senate approved S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, clearing the measure for the President. This act will significantly improve transparency and accountability in the legislative process.
