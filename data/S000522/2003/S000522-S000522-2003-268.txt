Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 109) urging passage of a resolution addressing human rights abuses in North Korea at the 59th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and calling on the Government of North Korea to respect and protect the human rights of its citizens, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 109       Whereas the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this      preamble referred to as ``North Korea'') is, in the words of      the United States Department of State, ``a dictatorship under      the absolute rule of the Korean Workers' Party'' that      ``prohibits freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and      association . . . [and] restricts freedom of religion,      citizens' movements, and worker rights'';       Whereas according to the State Department, ``[t]he [North      Korean] Penal Code is Draconian, stipulating capital      punishment and confiscation of assets for a wide variety of      `crimes against the revolution,' including defection,      attempted defection, slander of the policies of the party or      State, listening to foreign broadcasts, writing `reactionary'      letters, and possessing reactionary printed matter'';       Whereas, as noted in the State Department Country Reports      on Human Rights Practices, the North Korean regime executes      political prisoners, opponents of the regime, some      repatriated defectors, some members of underground churches,      and others, sometimes at public meetings attended by workers,      students, and school children;       Whereas the North Korean regime subjects all its citizens      to systematic, intensive political and ideological      indoctrination in support of the cult of personality      glorifying Kim Jong Il and the late Kim Il Sung which, in the      words of the State Department, ``approaches the level of a      state religion'';       Whereas the North Korean regime divides its population into      categories, based on perceived loyalty to the Party and the      leadership, which determine access to employment, higher      education, place of residence, medical facilities, and other      resources;       Whereas the North Korean regime attempts to control all      information, artistic expression, and academic works inside      North Korea and strictly curtails freedom of speech;       Whereas the Government of North Korea holds an estimated      150,000 to 200,000 political prisoners in camps that its      State Security Agency manages through the use of forced      labor, beatings, torture, and executions, and in which many      prisoners also die from disease, starvation, and exposure;       Whereas according to eyewitness testimony provided to the      Committee on International Relations of the House of      Representatives by camp survivors, camp inmates have been      used as sources of slave labor for the production of export      goods, as targets for martial arts practice, and as      experimental victims in the testing of chemical and      biological poisons;       Whereas according to eyewitness testimony provided to the      Committee on International Relations by a camp survivor,      female camp prisoners are not permitted to have children and      their newborn babies are routinely and brutally killed by      camp authorities;       Whereas according to the State Department ``[g]enuine      religious freedom does not exist'' in North Korea and, in the      words of the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom, ``[t]he North Korean state severely      represses public and private religious activities'';       Whereas the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom has highlighted ``reports that [North      Korean] officials have arrested, imprisoned, tortured, and      sometimes executed North Korean citizens who were found to      have ties with overseas Christian evangelical groups      operating across the border in China, as well as those who      engaged in such unauthorized religious activities as public      religious expression and persuasion'';       Whereas according to eyewitness testimony provided to the      Committee on International Relations in May 2002, a North      Korean prison camp survivor witnessed a group of Christian      prisoners being tortured to death in 1990 for refusing to      repudiate their faith;       Whereas more than 1,000,000 North Koreans are estimated to      have died of starvation since 1995 because of the failure of      the centralized agricultural system operated by the      Government of North Korea;       Whereas the risk of starvation and the threat of      persecution in North Korea have caused many thousands of      North Koreans to flee their homeland, primarily into the      People's Republic of China;       Whereas the Governments of the People's Republic of China      and North Korea have been conducting aggressive campaigns to      locate North Koreans who are in the People's Republic of      China without permission and to forcibly return them to North      Korea;       Whereas North Koreans who seek asylum while in the People's      Republic of China are routinely imprisoned and tortured, and      in some cases killed, after they are returned to North Korea;      and       Whereas the 59th session of the United Nations Commission      on Human Rights is scheduled to be held in Geneva,      Switzerland from March 17 to April 25, 2003: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) urges the Secretary of State to support efforts to      draft, introduce, and pass a resolution addressing human      rights abuses in North Korea at the 59th session the United      Nations Commission on Human Rights;       (2) urges all members of the United Nations Commission on      Human Rights to support a resolution addressing human rights      abuses in North Korea at the 59th session of the United      Nations Commission on Human Rights; and       (3) calls on the Government of the Democratic People's      Republic of Korea to respect and protect the human rights of      its citizens, such as those recognized in the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights.
