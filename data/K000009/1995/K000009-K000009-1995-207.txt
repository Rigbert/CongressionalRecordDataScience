. merchandise trade deficit widened last year to $166 billion, the worst performance in the history of the United States. What does that $166 billion deficit mean? It means $166 billion worth of U.S.-made goods were lost to import sales in our own marketplace. It means jobs lost here in America. And it means in order for us to pay the bills, more foreign investment here in the United States on which our people end up owing principal and dividends to others off shore, not ourselves.  Incredible as it may seem, what does the executive branch's Trade Ambassador say about all of this? Well, he just turns his back. He said, ``It is not the worst.'' He says he is happy as a clam that exports rose 12 percent last year.  But, my friends, that is only half the ledger, because imports rose even more, nearly 16 percent. The flow is heavier and heavier in the wrong direction. If you are $166 billion more in the hole, how can it be a good outcome?  In fact, the trade numbers for last year were worse than they were in 1993 and worse than in 1992 and worse than in 1991. If this administration's trade policies are so good, why are the numbers worse than even in the Bush years which, by the way, back then were the worst ever in the history of the United States? Remember, each lost billion represents 20,000 jobs the United States shuttled out to somewhere else.  Think about this. Last year the United States sucked in a staggering $800 billion worth of foreign-made goods, much of the goods we used to make here. And have you noticed prices have not gone down?  We sucked in $66 billion more from Japan than we exported from them. That has been a continuing hemorrhage through our adult lifetimes. We sucked in $26 billion more from China than we exported there, a nation not known to respect political freedoms for a free market or the rule of law. And this year it is anybody's guess how many billions more we will suck in from Mexico that we export down there. Our former trade surplus with Mexico bit the dust late last year, even before the peso devaluation.  So, when you look at your paycheck and wonder why you have not been keeping pace with price increases, ask yourself what would happen if the United States and your community made $800 billion more of goods right here in the U.S.A.? Think about it. For those of us old enough to remember, we would be in Ozziet and Harriet land once again.                          ____________________
