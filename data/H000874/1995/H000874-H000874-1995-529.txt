 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. My predecessor who spoke, the gentleman from the State of Pennsylvania, indicated that he owed it to his constituents to state his position. I think that is fair and correct. We ought to state our position. I have consistently and without fail told my constituents that I opposed the limitations of terms. This is a bipartisan position. I was on the floor and I hope many of you, if you were not on the floor, heard the remarks of the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Illinois, Henry Hyde, when he spoke. He referred to this amendment and to other amendments imposing restraints on the people--forget about the restraint on us--the restraint on the people to select from all the options people they wanted to come to this House, the people's house and to speak for them and represent them.                              {time}  1745  Mr. Chairman, he referred to the imposition of this restriction on the electorate as the dumbing-down of democracy. That was the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde]. I think he was correct.  Adlai Stevenson was once asked his philosophy of democracy, and his response was, ``Trust the people, trust their good sense, their decency, their fortitude, their faith. Trust them with the facts. Trust them with the great decisions.''  Every year the people consider the deliberations of Congress, and every other year, every second year, they make a choice. They decide whether or not the Representative that they have sent to Washington to represent them has carried out the objectives that they believe are appropriate.  We have term limits; that has been stated over and over. It is 2 years. Under the Constitution we must return to the people.  Now I am one of those who returns to my people every night because I live in this area, so I do not feel that I ever lose touch with my people. But the fact of the matter is it is appropriate that every 2 years they can assess whether Steny Hoyer has been a Representative in which they have faith and trust and which they believe is carrying out their best interests. Do they agree with me on every issue? Of course not. They are, like every constituency, filled with people who believe that we ought to pass this bill or we ought not to pass this bill. Ultimately, however, they make a choice.  Mr. Chairman, the genius of our system is that in a democracy we give them that choice. We do not need to protect them against themselves. They have made choices, and in point of fact it is a shame that the demagoguery that sometimes passes for debate and alleges that we have an institution peopled with careerists who have 25, and 35, and 45 years is simply not true. Do we have people who have been here that long? Yes, we do. But the average term, as so many have said, is 7 years in this House. Over half of the House is new since 1990.  We have turnover, and that is, while an accelerated phenomenon, not a new phenomenon. It was a phenomenon that in 1992, with 11-year service, maybe the senior member of my delegation, the other seven elected after that.  So the fact of the matter is the American public is doing its job well.  Do we always agree? No, we would have, on our side, have preferred they voted for us this time. They did not. But let us not diminish their choices by this unwise policy.  Reject term limits.
