 President, this amendment would allow a Governor of a State to opt into the ethanol program. Both Alaska and Hawaii have been able to become exempted from the ethanol mandate. The question this presents for many of us is this: If a Governor of a State believes the program is cost effective, believes it is going to clean up their environment, believes it is all of the things the ethanol proponents say it is, then surely that Governor will opt in.  But if a Governor of a State, depending upon geographical location, infrastructure for delivery, or science about the product, might decide not to opt into the program, that Governor would have that opportunity. This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Nickles, McCain, Kyl, Gregg, Wyden, Leahy, Schumer, Reed, Sununu, Kennedy, and Clinton.  I thank them for their support and yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Arizona.
