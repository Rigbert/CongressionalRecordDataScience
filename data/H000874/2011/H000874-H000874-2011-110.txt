We're not there, but I have said many times during the course of this debate that to govern isto compromise, not to sell out. Some people think on this floor that voting for a compromise is somehow a sellout. We cannot run America on that theory, and that is not what democracy is all about.  I urge my colleagues to ensure that America, in fact, pays its bills.
