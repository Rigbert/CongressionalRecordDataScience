President, I say to my friend, thank you for expressing your point of view. You are the first person to speak on it in opposition. I hope you don't carry the day, but you might.  It is interesting that some are fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks when it comes to prescription drug benefits, but where were these voices during the tax cut debate? We were sunsetting tax cuts right and left, creating the biggest deficit in the history of the United States, and I didn't hear a word from the deficit hawks.  When it comes to helping senior citizens paying for drugs, we have to be responsible. This amendment is responsible. It is sunsetted. We have a report from CBO which says that. The $570 billion does not take into account the fact that this is sunsetted in 2010. It works within the $400 billion.  The second issue raised here is that there are people--and I think my friend from Pennsylvania is perilously close to this coalition--who don't care much for Medicare. They don't think it is a very good program. Well, the vote is in on Medicare, and it is 88 to 12. Eighty-eight percent of the people who had a chance to move out of Medicare didn't do it. They stayed. I hope you will vote for the MediSAVE amendment.
