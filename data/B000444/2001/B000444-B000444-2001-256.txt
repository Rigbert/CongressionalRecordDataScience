 WELLSTONE. I will make a couple points, and then I will yield to get the Senator's response.  My point is, why would you want to have these kinds of rules and these kinds of provisions when you have a family being put under because of medical bills?  I am trying to get all my notes together, one by one.  My colleague said, conceptually why not somebody who has lost their job? That could very well be an amendment that I will have on this bill. It is pretty horrible when people lose their jobs. By the way, the next thing they worry about, when they lose their job, is losing their health care coverage. You sort of assume, if somebody loses their job, they can find another job. But what if somebody has been put under because of a medical bill and they themselves are struggling with a disease or a disabling injury? It seems to me this would be the first, if you will, order of exemption.  My colleague says there are sweeping changes to this amendment. That is true. This bill is also cause for sweeping changes. It depends on whether you think the changes are good, whether you think they are the right thing to do or not. That is where we disagree.  Now, it is true--and this is a key point to make--that what I am doing is saying there ought to be some discretion in the system. My colleague talked about the standards. I do not mind having rigorous or even rigid standards, as long as you do not capture the wrong people. But you are capturing the wrong people. The people who pay the price, as I have tried to argue, are people who, again, as determined by the court are filing for bankruptcy because of medical expenses. I think that is about 50 percent of the cases, at least on the basis of what I have seen.  Although, interestingly enough--and I do not want to have a side debate with my colleague on this--although, interestingly enough, in consumer surveys actually people cite credit card companies as the reason they file for bankruptcy before they do for medical expenses.
