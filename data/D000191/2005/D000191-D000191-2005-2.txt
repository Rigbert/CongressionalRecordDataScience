  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, the Christmas tree is lit and decorated on the west front of the Capitol; but meanwhile here in the House Chamber, the Republican elves are toiling on the gifts to be put under the tree for the American people.  For the wealthiest, the investors who earn over $300,000 a year, fabulous gifts, huge new extensions of tax cuts. Unfortunately for seniors, working families, and the poor, there is nothing but a box of rhetoric. They even have to forego the usual lump of coal because it is too expensive with the Bush failed energy policy.  Even worse, the tax cut for the wealthiest among us, those who earn over $300,000 a year, will be paid for by cuts in student financial, food and nutrition assistance, school lunches, Medicaid care for poor people. The list kind of goes on and on. Merry Christmas.                          ____________________[Page H12054]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR THE WEALTHY  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
