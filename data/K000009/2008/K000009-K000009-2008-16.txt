 The SEC must be a major part of the solution. This bill does not do it.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, before one cent is even considered, this Congress first ought to pass a bill to create and fund an independent Emergency Financial Crimes Unit to investigate the malfeasance, securities fraud, false accounting, and insider trading that were the root causes of this extravagance that must now be resolved in a rigorous and thoughtful manner. This bill does not do it. Draft the right deal, not a fast deal.  I thank the gentlelady and the gentleman for yielding.
