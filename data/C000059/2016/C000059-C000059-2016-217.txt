Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment to the Corona, California community is truly exceptional. Next week, on January 21, 2016, John Downs will be honored as a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. John has dedicated himself to the Corona community.  John is the second generation owner of local business icon Downs Energy. The business was started in 1962 by John's father, Elvin Downs. In 1976, Downs Energy made the decision to launch a key lock operation to sell fuel around the clock to trucking companies. John works closely on the day-to-day operations with his wife Catherine.  John is also a devoted father and husband. He and his wife Catherine have two children, Sherry Downs Messner and Mike Downs. John describes having his children follow in his footsteps as something that makes him smile.  John's tireless passion for his family and the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call John a friend, fellow community member and great American. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating John on achieving the Lifetime Achievement Award.                          ____________________
