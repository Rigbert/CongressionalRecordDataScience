 President.  Mr. President, we are here on the floor of the Senate this evening talking about the maritime cargo security bill. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. I have been working on this issue since September 11, 5 years ago, when I recognized, as did others, that we have an extreme vulnerability in our port cargo container system when it comes to our Nation's security.  We have been working since that time to put together legislation. I commend Senator Collins and her staff, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, the Finance Committee, and numerous Senators who have worked together to get us to this point.  As I said earlier on the floor of the Senate, this measure is extremely important. For the first time, when this bill is passed and it goes to the President's desk, we will assure that every cargo container coming into this country has a much higher level of security. We also will put in place what is called the GreenLane bill, which will allow an even higher point of security for companies that voluntarily opt to make sure that when their cargo containers are loaded overseas, they are secured, that we know what is in them, we know who is handling them, and we know if they have been diverted. They will be tracked across the ocean, and before they ever come into our ports we will know that they are safe.  Those cargo containers with that higher level of scrutiny will then move off of our ports in a much more efficient and quick manner, leaving behind those containers that will still need to have a higher degree of inspection.  Finally, our bill will make sure we have a way to resume cargo handling quickly and efficiently should a terrible incident ever occur at our ports.  This bill balances the need of making sure our ports and our containers and the people who live and work around those containers, as well as the cargo there, are secured. It balances that with the important economic activity that occurs at ports across our country.  When this bill was brought to the floor of the Senate earlier last week, it lacked one critical component, and that was a dedicated funding stream. As I shared with my colleagues, I was deeply concerned that if we did not fund this bill, we would leave an empty shell and an empty promise to the people of America that we were securing our ports.  That is why today I was very happy the Senate agreed to my amendment to have a funding stream and to put that into this bill to make sure, as it moves forward, we will have the personnel we need to make sure the regime we have put in place actually occurs, that we will have the infrastructure that will be needed to make sure we can assure a secure system of cargo containers this country relies on for its economic activity.  That amendment was adopted, and with that I believe this bill is one we can all be proud of. Within a few days, as we work through the rest of the amendments, I, for one, will finally be able to sleep at night knowing we have made a major move forward.  So there are still amendments to be brought forward to the Senate. I know we are going to work our will through them. But I commend all of our colleagues for stepping up to the plate on this important issue.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record four editorials that talk about the need for funding.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               (From the Everett Herald, Sept. 10, 2006)               Fully Fund Murray's Bill on Port Security       Five years after terrorists seared feelings of      vulnerability deep into the American consciousness, much has      been done to improve our security. Airport security has been      enhanced by more than $20 billion in federal spending.      Locally, first responders are more capable of dealing      effectively with a disaster, natural or manmade.       But public safety leaders here and elsewhere worry about a      potential terrorism target they believe is still neglected:      our seaports. Only a tiny percentage of the approximately 10      million containers that enter our ports are inspected,      leaving gaping holes that terrorists could exploit with a      radioactive bomb or other weapon. And costs for many of the      physical upgrades in port security since Sept. 11, 2001, have      been borne by local ports rather than the federal government.       On Thursday, Congress sent a signal that it may be ready to      give port security the serious attention it needs. Senators      announced an agreement on bipartisan legislation that Sen.      Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced shortly after the 9/11      attacks and has been pushing ever since. It's expected to get      a floor vote this week, then go to a conference committee      that will iron out differences with a similar bill already      passed by the House.       What's still needed, though, is dedicated funding. Murray's      bill calls for $835 million annually for a program that will      create higher levels of cargo security, allow cargo to be      inspected and tracked from the time it leaves the factory      floor overseas, and implement a plan to resume trade quickly      after an attack to minimize its impact on the economy. `` The      bill also calls for $400 million in security grants to local      ports.       ``I've been very clear with everyone that I can't support      another NCLB (No Child Left Behind) bill,'' Murray said      Friday, referring to the federal education bill that      educators complain was far heavier on mandates than money.      ``We have to provide the funding or it will never be fully      implemented.''       The bill originally sought to use money from tariffs on      imported goods, but members of the Finance Committee      objected, arguing that if tariffs were lowered, funding would      dry up. Murray concedes that point, and said she'll offer an      amendment this week that would tap existing customs fees that      aren't related to duties.       A fully funded bill will mean a more secure Puget Sound,      which has major ports in Seattle and Tacoma and a growing      container operation at the Port of Everett. Ship activity in      Everett has increased roughly tenfold in the past two years,      and as, business continues to grow in Seattle and Tacoma,      even more figures to come north.       Five years after terrorists proved their desire to hurt us,      our ports remain a huge potential target. Congress mustn't      wait any longer to act.                                  ____                       In Our View--Secure Ports                    (By Columbian editorial writers)       Five years after 9/11, Senate should take action on      Murray's GreenLane bill, because the horror of 9/11 was      orchestrated in the air, the logical immediate concern was in      air-travel security. But five years after 9/11 it is      frightening to see what little the United States has done to      enhance port security.       The intransigence and complacency is especially alarming in      Washington state, the nation's most trade-dependent state.       There's good news, though. Thanks largely to U.S. Sen.      Patty Murray, D-Washington, Congress is finally paying proper      attention to port security. Murray's GreenLane bill co-     authored with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine has been approved      by the House and passed by the Senate Homeland Security      Committee. Last Thursday, senators announced agreement on      port security legislation, and they are expected to vote on      the measure this week.       Even if approval is expedited and it should be this      congressional footdragging is inexcusable. We're glad Murray      has kept forcing Congress to pay attention. The GreenLane      offers five desperately needed components:       It would create tough new standards for inspecting and      approving all maritime cargo.       It offers the Greenlane option, a faster and even higher      level of security for companies that agree to have their      cargo tracked and monitored from the time it leaves a factory      overseas until it reaches the United States.       The bill offers a plan for quickly resuming maritime trade      after any incident, minimizing the economic impact of      terrorism.       Port security grants would allow ports to strengthen their      perimeter security.       The Department of Homeland Security would be held more      accountable for port security, in part by establishing an      Office of Cargo Security Policy.       Locally, Port of Vancouver Executive Director Larry Paulson      said Friday that he has been frustrated by the congressional      foot-dragging. But he is confident about his port's security.      ``It's less of an issue here because the emphasis is on      containers, and we handle very few containers,'' Paulson      said. ``The greater concern for port security in our state is      in Seattle and Tacoma.''       In a speech Friday, Murray enlisted a RAND Center for      Terrorism and Risk Management Policy report that presented      this horrifying scenario: Terrorists put a 10-kiloton nuclear      bomb inside a cargo container and detonate it at the Port of      Long Beach, Calif. According to the report, up to 60,000      people would be killed instantly, 15,000 more would be      injured, 6 million people would flee the area and economic      losses would be about $1 trillion.       In Seattle and Tacoma, ports are close to downtowns and      Interstate 5. Imagine how enticing that is to an evil mind      that wants to kill Americans and cripple our economy.       Murray also pointed to the 2002 closure of several ports on      the West Coast. It cost the U.S. economy about $1 billion a      day. She said one study estimates that if all U.S. ports were      closed for nine days, it would cost the national economy      about $58 billion. Of course, the greater concern of port      security is preventing deaths and injuries. Five years     even five months is far too long. The Senate should expedite      passage and implementation of the GreenLane bill for      enhancing port security.                                  ____                  [From the Oregonian, Sept. 12, 2006]                  Time To Land Tightened Port Security       A bill that addresses the vulnerability of U.S. shipping      fetches up in the Senate, but still needs to be brought to      shore       The most impressive thing about the port security      legislation that the Senate begins debating today isn't the      bill's boldness or its thoroughness. It's the five years it      took the bill to get to this point.       Talk about a slow boat from China.       Five years after what was supposed to be a new reality,      after constant warnings about the vulnerability of U.S. ports      that inspect only about 6 percent of incoming cargo      containers, the bill raises some new barriers against a      seagoing Sept. 11. Ports ``were extremely vulnerable,'' says      Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who has been pushing the bill,      ``on the fact that five years after 9/11 they've failed to      address homeland security issues.''       This bill may not entirely address those issues, but at      least it finally raises them.       It requires the Department of Homeland Security to set      minimum container security regulations, sets up an Office of      Cargo Security Policy to coordinate federal and local port      policy, and makes some federal money available.       Maybe most usefully, it sets up a ``Green Lane'' program to      swiftly move cargoes already inspected at their point of      departure. Most containers will still remain uninspected, but      sending already-checked containers through will, in Murray's      phrase, ``reduce the size of the haystack where we're trying      to find the needle.''.       Even after last week's: carefully negotiated deal among      three Senate committees, the bill faces serious hazards to      navigation. The Senate has rejected the House's way of      financing the programs, without completely agreeing on its      own. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wants to attach to it a major      rail security program, an excellent idea by itself that could      send port security off the tracks.       In a Congress with minimal accomplishments and a swiftly      dwindling number of days to manage any, a bill with real      prospects can be a magnet to any idea that any legislator      wants to slip across, even if the weight of the additions      ends up sinking the bill.       Our strong feelings about getting serious about maritime      security may be basic strategic thinking, or may be mostly      slack-jawed astonishment at how long this process has taken.      It might even be the touchy sensitivity coming from living in      a city that not only includes a major port, but is named      after it.       There are legitimate points to debate about this bill, and      the Senate has two days to debate them.       Let's just hope Congress isn't still debating them next      year, which would make it six years after action should have      happened.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 2006]                               Safe Ports       The brief session of Congress that just convened is      distinguished in part for what is absent from its agenda--     immigration and lobbying reform, for example. A notable      exception, though, is a serious bill that has just. emerged      from the Senate Commerce, Finance and Homeland Security      committees: the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006.       The bill contains several common-sense proposals It      requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a      strategy to rapidly resume trade after an incident at one of      the nation's ports, in order to limit economic slowdown. It      codifies a number of good programs in law, including the      Container Security Initiative, which, if it operates      properly, will target suspect cargo for inspection in foreign      ports before it gets close to the United States. And it      establishes deadlines for Homeland Security to complete      critical infrastructure projects--including installing      radiation portal monitors in the nation's 22 biggest ports by      the end of next year.       Two things distinguish this moderate legislation from the      irresponsible rhetoric on port security that has marred      debates on the subject for years. First, it does not call for      100 percent of containers arriving at U.S. ports to be      individually inspected for all dangerous materials. The      ``inspect all containers'' mantra is a red herring that      exploits Americans'' fears about what might slip through in      order to score political points, ignoring the fact that there      are much more cost- and time-effective ways of keeping      dangerous cargo out of the country.       To her credit, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the      bill's key sponsors, recognizes that the tithe and money it      would take to inspect all 11 million containers that come      into the country every year would be prohibitive with the      technology available today, and she has committed to vote      against it if such a provision is added. Instead, the bill      calls for a pilot program in which the feasibility of      individually inspecting all containers leaving three overseas      ports will be gauged, which should test promising next-     generation technologies without significantly slowing the      pace of trade to the United States.       Second, while providing five years of steady funding for      port security projects, the bill does not dedicate money for      port security in perpetuity. The initial costs of making      essential improvements such as buying radiation detectors,      putting up fencing around ports and coordinating inspection      procedures with ports overseas will require a fair amount of      steady start-up cash. But a half-decade of grants for      improving port security ought to be enough. After that, port      security should have to compete for federal money with other      worthy projects.       With those sensible checks in place, the Senate should pass      this bill.
