 President, I commend these revealing articles to my colleagues.  In the first article, U.S. District Court judge, William Nickerson, is quoted as saying, ``As a taxpayer, I would probably complain,'' when asked about a judicial conference hosted at the five-star Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. The second article recounts that a Federal judge and former Congressman introduced a resolution to reduce the cost of judicial conferences in the ninth circuit by having them less frequently. Sadly, this responsible and wise proposal was defeated by a vote of 5 to 3. This amendment removes the requirement that conferences be held, giving Federal courts the flexibility to schedule conferences or, if they decide not to schedule them, just to not have a conference.  In brief, Mr. President, the amendment will limit the location of judicial conferences to the geographic boundaries of the circuit to minimize travel costs which obviously come when there is travel outside of the circuit.  It would also amend Federal law so that judicial conferences are no longer mandatory, and express the sense of the Senate that the Federal Judiciary should explore the idea of using new communications technology--teleconferencing, et cetera--to conduct conferences without travel.  I believe the amendment will save money and give new and needed flexibility to the Federal courts.  As I said, Federal judges from around the country are currently compelled by law to attend a conference with other judges at least once every 2 years. So, I cannot fault anyone with scheduling these conferences or attending them since the law requires it.  But I can--and do--find fault with those who choose only the most luxurious hotels and resorts.  I can--and do--find fault with some of the activities at these publicly funded conferences.  According to some press reports, less than a third of the time judges spend at these conferences relates to judicial work. In one case, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, during one 3-day conference at Hilton Head, SC, only 10 hours were set aside for work. The rest of the time was left open so that the attendees could socialize, visit with each other, or do whatever.  Importantly, Federal courts are continuing these expensive conferences at the same time judicial resources are scarce and funds for representing poorer Americans are drying up. I respectfully submit that these are not sound priorities.  The amendment that I and Senator Kyl offer today does what even some judges want to do. It would limit the location of judicial conferences to major urban areas--I want to emphasize this--within the circuit court of appeals, not outside. A few circuits, where judges are dissatisfied with the resorts within their circuit boundaries, have been going halfway across the country to attend a judicial conference--at taxpayer expense.  I am not the first to note the extravagance and unnecessary expense associated with these conferences. Fair-minded judges have been complaining about these conferences themselves for years. To name just a few, Circuit Judge Charles Wiggins, of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Smalkin have both complained that these conferences are unjustifiably expensive. A few years ago, a district court judge in Kansas City, like Judge Wiggins in the ninth circuit, was so outraged by the posh, remote resorts where these conferences are hosted that he introduced a resolution to limit the location of conferences. Yet another judge has referred to judicial conferences as a sort of ``camp.'' And U.S. District Court Judge Carl Rubin was quoted by the Cleveland Plain Dealer as saying ``there are a lot of things I'd rather see the taxpayers' money spent on than sending me to Hilton Head for 3 days.'' According to that same article, Pete Seep of the National Taxpayers' Union states his opinion that ``Federal taxpayers are paying judges to party.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters written to me by Federal judges--one from Michigan and one from Texas--urging me to trim the excesses associated with judicial conferences be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of            Michigan,                                          Flint, MI, July 6, 1995.     Re Travel/Chambers savings.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative          Oversight and the Courts, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I read in a recent article in the      Wall Street Journal how you were trying to effectuate needed      savings in the budget for the federal judiciary. As a member      of the lowest rung on the ladder of the federal judiciary, I      offer two suggestions for savings within the judicial branch.       I have been a bankruptcy judge for 11 years. As you know,      federal judges are required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 to attend a      judicial conference each year. The first year I attended such      a conference, it occurred to me that there was a place where      some savings could be effected. In my experience, the      judicial conferences are arranged so that the judges travel      usually on a Tuesday and return home on a Friday or Saturday.      As you are well aware, commercial airlines give tremendous      discounts for early booking with a Saturday night stayover.      The thought came      to mind long ago that if judges were required to attend the conference      over a Saturday night, it could save a lot of money. This      concept holds true for Federal Judicial Center functions as      well.       My suggestion was met with the response that judges prefer      to be home with their families on the weekends. While that is      obviously true (when I suggested this, I had two small      children at home, ages eight and five), I did not think it      was too much to ask high government officials to give up a      weekend once in a while, especially since such a large      savings would be created. Now that funding is much tighter, I      repeat this suggestion.       Another suggestion deals with the cost of furnishing      chambers. Due to expansion in the district court, I was asked      to move my courtrooms and chambers out of the federal      buildings in Flint and Bay City. In the process, I was given      a budget for furnishing chambers (which included my personal      office, my secretary's office and reception area, my law      clerk's office, the library, the media room, two attorney      conference rooms, and the courtroom waiting area) for $25,000      total. We just about made it for that amount. I do not know      for sure, but I have been told that other judges are allowed      roughly $50,000 for furnishing a much smaller chambers' unit.      Perhaps some uniformity would save some money. While I am in      accord with the statements of the federal judge quoted in the      Journal article with respect to there being a need for      decorum and dignity in a federal courthouse, I also concur in      your efforts and those of Senator Baucus to provide that at a      lower cost.       By effectuating some reasonable savings in non-essential      areas, Congress ought to be able to reinstitute cost of      living increases for the judiciary. Without such regular      adjustments, of course, Congress is condemning the judiciary      to consistent decreases in take-home pay.           Sincerely,                                                Arthur J. Spector,     U.S. Bankruptcy Judge.                                                                    ____                                              U.S. District Court,                                    Western District of Texas,                                    San Antonio, TX, June 6, 1995.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Grassley: At a recent conference of the Fifth      Judicial Circuit, we were advised of your efforts to address      government expenditures for judicial meetings and      conferences. I applaud and encourage such efforts. All      branches of government must search for and find ways of      reducing government expense. This area can be modified,      relatively painlessly, with no loss in the quality of      judicial services provided.       Title 28 U.S.C. Section 333 allows an annual circuit      conferences and requires that one be held in each circuit no      more than every two years. Attendances for judges summoned is      mandatory. Perhaps Section 333 could be amended to reduce the      number of circuit conferences and/or permit participation to      be optional. Once per year, we also hold separate workshops      for circuit judges, district judges, magistrate judges, and      bankruptcy judges. These instructional meetings address      various substantive topics and can be beneficial. However,      the information can be provided to us in written form at our      offices to avoid the cost of travel, housing, meals, and      lectures.       I am sure many more ways of reducing expenses for judicial      meetings exist. These meetings can be valuable but are not      absolutely necessary to the administration of justice.      Particularly in these economic times, their cost is difficult      to justify. I wanted you to know that judges will support,      and even participate in, efforts to reduce the amount of      money allocated to the judiciary's budget.           Sincerly,                                                  John W. Primomo,                                            U.S. Magistrate Judge.
