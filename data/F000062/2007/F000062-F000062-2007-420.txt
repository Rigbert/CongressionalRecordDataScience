 President, I offer today private immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola and Cindy Jael Arreola, Mexican nationals living in the Fresno area of California.  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in the United States for over 20 years. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 20, and Cindy, age 18, also stand to benefit from this legislation. Their other three children, Roberto, age 15, Daniel, age 11, and Saray, age 9, are United States citizens. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Arreola and their two eldest children face deportation.  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  The Arreolas are in this uncertain situation in part because of grievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it compelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of Immigration Review seeking his disbarment for the disservice he caused his immigration clients.  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an agricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several years, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, had he known about it.  Mrs. Arreola was living in the United States at the time she became pregnant with her daughter Cindy, but returned to Mexico to give birth so as to avoid any problems with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Given the length of time that the Arreolas had, and have been, in the United States it is quite likely that they would have qualified for relief from deportation pursuant to the cancellation of removal provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but for the conduct of their previous attorney.  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to remain in the United States is the devastating impact their deportation would have on their children--three of whom are U.S. citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since they were toddlers. For these children, this country is the only country they really know.  Nayely, the oldest, is a junior at Fresno Pacific University. She was the first in her family to graduate from high school and the first to attend college. She attends Fresno Pacific University, a regionally ranked university, on a full tuition scholarship package and works part-time in the admissions office. She is majoring in international business.  At her young age, Nayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to achieve her full potential both in her academic endeavors and through the service she provides her community. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services, Cary Templeton, at Fresno Pacific University states in a letter of support, ``[t]he leaders of Fresno Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), a college preparatory program in which students commit to determining their own futures through achieving a college degree. Nayely was also president of the Key Club, a community service organization. She helped mentor freshmen and participates in several other student organizations in her school. Perhaps the greatest hardship to this family, if forced to return to Mexico, will be her lost opportunity to realize her dreams and further contribute to her community and to this country.  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility for her community and country. By all indication, this is the case as well for all of the members of her family.  The Arreolas also have other family who are lawful permanent residents of this country or United States citizens. Mrs. Arreola has three brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who is a U.S. citizen. It is also my understanding that they have no immediate family in Mexico.  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their taxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked hard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was previously employed as a farm worker, but now has his own business repairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home for his family.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced today will enable the Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their community as well as the United States.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. I ask unanimous consent that eight letters of community support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  January 2, 2007.       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein. I Maria Esthela Garay would      like to let you know that Nayely Arreola was my student at      the beginnings of January 1989. It was my pleasure to meet      and have her as my student. She was very obedient and nice.      Nayely was always a very organized girl, and respected the      rules of the class. She also always finished the class work      since she was in preschool. I am glad I met Nayely since she      was and will always be an educated girl.       Nayely is a young girl who will continue her education with      the help of her parents whom I appreciate very much. She is      the pride and joy of those around her and her family in      Porterville California. If you would     like to know more feel free to call me at (559) 920-1852.           Sincerely,     Maria Esthela Garay.                                  ____                                       Jesse and Angie Aldaco,                                 Terra Bella, CA, January 2, 2007.     Re Arreola Family.       Dear Dianne Feinstein. We have known the Arreola family for      three years now and are delighted to have ever met them. Mr.      Isidro Arreola is a very good father, husband, businessman      and member of his church. He portrays everything a good      citizen should be.       His wife Maria Elena is a very hard working woman as well      as a great caretaker of her family. She motivates her      children to further their education.       Their oldest daughter is attending the University and      taking courses on International Affairs. She comes during the      weekends to be with her family.       The Arreolas are a great example to other members of the      community of how a good Christian family should be.           Sincerely,     Jesse and Angie Aldaco.                                  ____                                                 Raquel Garza,                                 Porterville, CA, January 3, 2007.     Re Arreola Family.       Dear Dianne Feinstein. The Arreola Family are very good      friends of mine. They participate in the church that I also      attend. Isidro Arreola is a very hard workingman and has his      own business from home. Mr. and Mrs. Arreola bring up their      children a in a good Christian environment. They are a great      example in their church and the community. They are elders in      their church and are considered leaders. They always go an      extra mile than what is asked of them. Their children try      very hard in accomplishing their dreams and goals. It is a      privilege to know this family and would not hesitate to speak      up for them in any situation. This family is very honest and      loving.           Sincerely,     Roquel Garza.                                  ____                                               Maria Gonzalez,                                 Porterville, CA, January 2, 2007.     Re Arreola Family.       Dear Dianne Feinstein: I have known the Arreola family for      5-6 years. I used to work with Maria Elena Arreola and are      delighted to have ever met her and her family.       This family is a great example to fellow community members.      They are a good Christian family that set good examples to      others. Isidro Arreola is a very hard working man repairing      appliances. We attend the same church and they are leaders in      the church. They demonstrate many Godly traditions and      beliefs. They are a great family to know and have nearby.      Their children are very studious in school and are always      eager to become better. We are all very proud of their oldest      daughter that attends the University and accomplishes her      dreams.           Sincerely,     Maria Gonzalez.                                  ____                                                  January 1, 2007.     Re Arreola Family       Dear Dianne Feinstein: The Arreola Family are very active      in their church and Mr. Isidro Arreola is a very hard working      man. They do what they can to bring up their children in a      positive environment. I can seriously say that they are a      very good family wanting the best for their children. They      are good friends of ours and visit socially my family. If you      require any more information do not hesitate to call me in      the evenings.           Sincerely,     Perla Garza Martinez.                                  ____                                                December 31, 2006.       Dear Dianne Feinstein, (Senator): I am writing this      recommendation on behalf of the Arreola family. It has been      my profound comfort and pleasure to have known this family      for many years. I have found them to be bright, well      organized, self sufficient people.       Seldom have I met a family with more social integrity.      Their togetherness, respect and appreciation for one another      can not go unnoted.       Their degree of civility is not only noticed in their      church but in their community and in their institutions of      learning. They are gracious, honest people who have, by their      own initiative, earned the right to human freedom and      dignity.       The above statement is based on humanitarian observances      and has little to do with the political movements dealing      with immigration.       I am interested in the wellbeing of the Arreola family in      its entirety.       I do not believe that it would be prudent for the State of      California to make any disruptive moves effecting the life      style of the Arreola family.       Senator Feinstein, I am asking you to consider the unique      role in which this family plays in the wellbeing of the State      of California.       The family consists of: Mother, MariaElaina, Father,      Esidronio, Children, Nayely and Cindy, Children, (already      citizens), Roberto, Daniel, Saray.           Thank You,                                           Mr. Lynn Morgan McLean,     Retired Educator.                                  ____                                              Porterville, CA.     Ms. Diane Feinstein      Regards: Areola Family       Dear Ms. Feinstein: Pursuant to the case of the Areola      family, I would like to take this opportunity to give my      highest and best recommendation on behalf of my family and      myself. We had the pleasure of meeting this wonderful family      through Christian Services. They have proved to be a very      respectful family with strong principles and that of      accomplishing many goals that will prepare them for their      future.       I am a business owner, therefore I am very careful about      making any types of recommendations or references on behalf      of my family, myself and our family owned business. This      family, however, is very special to many, including our      congregation and community.       Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my letter.      If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.           Respectfully,     Patricia Esquivel.                                  ____                                                  January 2, 2007.       Senator Diane Feinstein Greetings: The present letter I am      writing to you is to recommend Nayely Arreola. I know Nayely      since she was 8 years old. At that age she was my best      student in Sunday school class, always eager to learn God's      Word. She was a very smart child and demonstrated good      behavior among her fellow students treating them with      kindness and respect.       As a young lady Nayely developed very fine manners. I      always remember her coming out from one of the classrooms at      Granite Hills High School were I used to work as custodian,      She always greets me with a broad smile and a big hug; not      caring if I was sweaty and dirty.       Moreover, my husband and I, know her parents very well. We      attend the same Christian church regularly, where I am      pleased to see Nayely when she is in town. We all have had a      good friendship through all these years.           Sincerely,                                                      Maria Ochoa.                                 ______                                       By
