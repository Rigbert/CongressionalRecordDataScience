I tried my best to move this debate away from one man, one nomination, to the state of the economy.  Basically, what the Senator has said is that unless we can have this one nominee, we don't care about the economy; let it languish, falter, and let the American people lose hope. We are going to stick with this one political issue.  I think there is a way out of this morass with Miguel Estrada. I think we can do it cooperatively, with the production of documents and the honest answering of questions. I don't think we should delay the business of the Senate indefinitely and ignore the serious problems facing our Nation in the process. I hope there will be some reconsideration of the issue.
