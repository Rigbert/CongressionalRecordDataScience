The minority leader of the Senate has asked this Senate to move to the issue of the state of America's economy, that we take up immediately the question of what we can do to save businesses, create jobs, and I think foster some hope in America.  There was an objection immediately from the Republican side of the aisle. They do not want to discuss this issue.  I ask the minority leader the following: Since he has been home--and I have been in communication with the people of my State of Illinois--is it not a fact now that we have reached a point where our economy is dissembling, our foreign policy is in disarray, and this Congress is totally disingenuous, it ignores the reality of the challenges facing America today? I also ask the minority leader if he would tell me what he believes we should be debating at this point in time to do something about turning this economy around and bringing hope back to America.
