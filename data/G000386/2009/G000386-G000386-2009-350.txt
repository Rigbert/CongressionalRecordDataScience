 President, I must object. Before I do so, I will make this little statement. Obviously, the chairman, in keeping his word to me, has gone on to deliver on that word by working out arrangements on some amendments I wanted. It might look confusing to the public at large as to why on this side we are objecting. As we do things in the Senate on unanimous consent, any one person can object.  We have asked a lot of Members on our side what they thought about this particular UC request because we knew about it ahead of time. On behalf of a number of Members on our side of the aisle, acting for them, I must and do reluctantly object.
