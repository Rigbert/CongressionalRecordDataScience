Matt Schiller, a teacher at Poly High School, was one of three teachers honored last month at an event in Riverside, California.  Matt graduated from U.C. San Diego in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and received his teaching credentials and a Master of Science degree in biochemistry from U.C. Riverside in 2002. Whilepursuing his master's degree, Matt became a teaching assistant and realized his passion for teaching science.  After graduating from U.C. Riverside, Matt completed his student teaching at A.B. Miller High School in Fontana, and taught physical science and biology at Westlake High School. He also taught chemistry through U.C. Riverside's Faststart summer program in 2008 and 2009. Matt has been teaching chemistry and earth science at Poly High School in Riverside since 2004.  Being recognized for his outstanding efforts is not new to Matt. In fact, he was awarded the Walton B. Sinclair Award in 2001 for being an outstanding student teacher at U.C. Riverside, and he also received the ``Special Friend to Special Education'' award from Conejo Valley Unified School District in 2003 for his work with the Information Technology Academy at Westlake High School. Additionally, he received special recognition for his collaboration with students in publishing a scientific article on protein structure.  True to his character of never settling for the status quo, Matt resurrected the Advanced Placement chemistry class which had not been available at Poly High School for several years. In his first year of teaching, more than 60 percent of his class passed the AP test. A 60 percent passing rate is still better than the national average, but that did not stop Matt from pushing himself to help even more of his students succeed. In 2009, that number grew to 92.3 percent, which is an incredible testament to Matt's dedication.  Matt has also taken the initiative to improve his contact with parents. He regularly emails the parents of his students with upcoming test information and packets of work, as well as routine grade checks so parents can stay in tune with their child's progress.  Matt has shown diversity in his non-science interests as well. In 2006 he started a photography club at Poly High School to share his interest in photography. The club has grown from a handful of students to nearly 100 students. And at the end of each year, the students display their work in a gallery in downtown Riverside.  Additionally, Matt coaches the Mock Trial club, and has led his team to the state competition two of the last six years.  Matt has said that the most important part of teaching is giving back to the community and his students; his actions have spoken much louder than his words. Matt has truly shown that he is an exemplary educator.  Matt Schiller's tireless passion for science and education has contributed immensely to the betterment of his students and the entire community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Matt a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many students, parents, and faculty members are grateful for his service and join me in congratulating Matt on receiving this prestigious award.                          ____________________
