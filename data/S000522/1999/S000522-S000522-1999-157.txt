Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for managing this rule, and I also thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) for his statements as well.  I also wish to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the chairman of the full Committee on International Relations; the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter), chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, both of whom have been very instrumental in working on this bill. And my thanks also to my good friend, the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney), who is a cosponsor of this legislation. She is the ranking member of our subcommittee, and we have worked very cooperatively on this legislation as well.  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be the prime sponsor of H.R. 2415, the American Embassy Security Act. This legislation is the result of four hearings that we held, several days of markup in both subcommittee and full committee, and several weeks of negotiations with our friends on the other side of the aisle. Virtually every member of the committee had some input, had provisions that he or she thought should be included.  We worked very, very hard during a lengthy process. And Joseph Rees, my chief of staff and general counsel, and other members of the full committee on the other side of the aisle all worked in a cooperative way to try to craft a bipartisan bill.  The bill's unifying theme is about the promotion of American values. I am particularly proud that the bill authorizes $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 in security upgrades for our missions and for our personnel around the world. This is the worldwide security budget recommended by Admiral Crowe's commission, which was charged with investigating the terrorist bombings of our embassy in Kenya and Tanzania and determining how to protect our embassies and overseas personnel from future attacks.  Unfortunately, the administration recommended only $290 million for embassy security in its fiscal year 2000 budget, about one-fifth of the Crowe recommendation, and a fifth of what Congress appropriated last year. So without this bill, we would have faced an 80 percent cut from the recommendation in security of our overseas missions and personnel.  I do believe, Mr. Speaker, that if our Congress has one single responsibility with respect to foreign policy, and to me this is the most important, it is the protection of our people who work overseas in our embassies, our consulates, and other missions. They have to be our priority number one. This bill reflects that concern.  Let me also point out that we held, as part of those hearings, a hearing on March 12 on the security of U.S. missions abroad. Admiral Crowe testified, and I would like to just quote him briefly in talking about security, ``the Boards were most disturbed regarding two interconnected issues,'' he said. ``The first of these was the inadequacy of the resources to provide security against terrorist attacks, and the second was the relatively low priority accorded security concerns throughout the U.S. Government and by the Department of State.'' He also pointed out, and I just want to continue quoting him, that he found it very ``troubling,'' the failure of the U.S. Government to take the necessary steps to prevent such tragedies, talking about the time since Bobby Inman's report on terrorism.  We also heard, Mr. Speaker, from David Carpenter, the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security at the United States Department of State, and he pointed out, and I quote briefly, ``The terrorist threat is global, lethal, multidimensional and growing. Our analysts estimate that during the 12-month period, there were over 2,400 threats or incidents against U.S. interests overseas. Their estimate for the same period for a year ago,'' he goes on, ``is approximately 1,150 such threats or incidents. This is an increase of over 100 percent in the past year.''  We also heard at the hearing, Mr. Speaker, from Daniel Geisler, who is the President of the American Foreign Service Association, and he pointed outthat our core message to the committee, to the Congress, to all of us is that we must commit ourselves to never again suffer needless loss of life from terrorism and directed violence. He pointed out in his testimony that he had ``grave doubts,'' and I am quoting him now, ``that this failure will be corrected. Our doubts were heightened by the administration's grossly inadequate request for funds to build safer embassies. The fiscal year 2000 budget request,'' he goes on, ``does not have a single penny for construction funds, even though the State Department has proposed that OMB request $1.4 billion for worldwide security.''  This legislation meets that commitment of $1.4 billion, and I think it is very important. The gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) had a hand in this, and we all are working to make sure that that happens. We hope the appropriators will do likewise.  The bill also promotes American values by promoting human rights and protecting refugees. We authorize a modest increase for refugee protection, bringing the total to $750 million. And at a time when the world seems awash in refugees, we must do our fair share.  I think it is worth noting that year after year the State Department has requested and gotten a raise for its own operating expenses, while at the same time cutting the budget for refugee protection. Our bill includes special provisions for protection of refugees from Kosovo, Tibet, Burma, Viet Nam, and Sierra Leone, as well as refugees resettling in Israel.  We also single out the grossly underfunded Human Rights Bureau for an increase as well. This bureau of the State Department is charged with ensuring that the protection of fundamental human rights is afforded its rightful place in our foreign policy; yet it has only 65 employees, about half the size of the Office of Public Affairs and about the same size as the Office of Protocol.  Mr. Speaker, the $7 million the Department now spends on human rights in its bureau is only slightly more than half the amount, and that is $12 million, it plans to spend on public relations next year. If human rights matter, we ought to be putting more not less resources into the bureau charged with seeing to it that our embassies abroad and also the reporting and our message is that human rights do matter.  The bill further promotes American values by permanently authorizing Radio Free Asia, which would otherwise be required to close its doors on September 30 of this year. It continues the effort to ensure 24-hour freedom broadcasting into the People's Republic of China, and will also make possible additional RFA broadcasts to the people of North Korea and Vietnam. It also ensures the survival of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty into the next millennium and increases funding for the National Endowment for Democracy.                              {time}  0040  Mr. Speaker, these relatively small programs are among the most cost effective of efforts to promote freedom and democracy around the world.  H.R. 2415 also directs that our international exchange programs be conducted in a way that again promotes American values and fundamental beliefs. It authorizes carefully targeted exchange programs for the peoples of Tibet, Burma, East Timor, and sub-Saharan Africa. It requires that all of our exchange programs be administered so as to prevent them from being taken advantage of by spies and thugs from totalitarian governments and to include more people who are genuinely open to the principles of freedom and democracy.  There are a number of amendments that will be offered. There will be an amendment that will get an hour's time on the United Nations Population Fund. I continue to believe that until the U.N. Population Fund gets out of China and stops its complicity with the most brutal and barbaric programs that have been used against women that we should stop our funding, as we did last year, Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan way.  The current law for fiscal year 1999 that was signed by the President says no money to the UNFPA, and our language says no money again unless they get out of China. And we will have that debate, of course, when that amendment is offered next week.  This is a bipartisan bill. I support the rule, as well.
