People's Utility Districts (PUDs) have consistently been at the forefront of this effort.  Central Lincoln PUD, in my congressional district, is an excellent example of People's Utility Districts that have consistently demonstrated a commitment to delivering clean energy and conservation resources to their customers. Due to their relatively small size and local consumer ownership, PUDs are able to meet the unique energy needs of their community while also investing in local renewable energy resources.  With the assistance of a nearly $10 million federal grant, Central Lincoln PUD is poised to implement an energy saving smart grid system. Central Lincoln will contribute an additional $9 million to the endeavor. A portion of these funds will go toward the installation of smart meters in home and business. These advanced meters will empower consumers to more effectively manage their energy use, leading to significant savings.  In addition to the smart grid project, Central Lincoln PUD has made a priority of aiding local residents, industry, and businesses with energy conservation efforts. These projects range from weatherization advice for homes to the large-scale implementation of energy saving measures at local businesses. Through this sort of individually tailored energy consultation, Central Lincoln PUD has facilitated significant energy savings for many customers who otherwise may not have had access to such resources.  Capitalizing on their costal location, Central Lincoln PUD has become a significant playerin the development of wave energy technology. As a platinum sponsor of Oregon State University's Wallace Energy Systems & Renewable Facility, Central Lincoln PUD directly contributes to research into this clean and renewable technology.  Central Lincoln PUD has demonstrated an extraordinary dedication to bringing clean energy and energy conservation resources to all of their customers. Notably, Central Lincoln--and other PUDs--have shown that this can be done while still holding energy costs well below the national average.                          ____________________
