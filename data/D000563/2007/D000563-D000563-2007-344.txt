The Senator from Missouri spoke for approximately 10 minutes on an issue and asked that that not be deducted from the Republican morning business time. I am happy to acknowledge that, and I ask that we be given 10 minutes, 2 of which will be given to the Senator from West Virginia. So that protects those still here for the 30 minutes originally allocated for Republican morning business.
