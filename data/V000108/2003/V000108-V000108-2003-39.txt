Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I rise to congratulate Mr. Edward Robinson on his retirement from The Community Hospital in Munster Indiana, where he served as the Hospital Administrator for 37 years. Mr. Robinson has been a substantial fixture of the health care community in Northwest Indiana and he will be greatly missed.  Ed Robinson attended the University of Pittsburgh after receiving a highly competitive four-year scholarship from the American Legion. After the completion of his undergraduate college degree he was designated as a Distinguished Military Graduate by the United States Air Force in 1950, when he received his commission.  With his commission, Ed served as a Captain in the United States Air Force for three years and was stationed in Korea with the Fifth Air Force and was also a staff officer for the personnel at the headquarters of the Eighth Air Force, Strategic Air Command.  Knowledge has always been something valued by Ed. He holds a Master's Degree in Hospital Administration from the Graduate School of Public Health of the University of Pittsburgh, as well as a Master of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Arts Degree from the same institution. Mr. Robinson was awarded on Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Calumet College in May 1997.  Ed's career as a health care professional has been multifaceted and world-renowned. He has been published in numerous professional journals and received first prize in the ``Hospital Topics'' editorial National-wide competition for his thesis on ``Nursing Staffing Pattern in an Intensive Care Unit.'' Ed is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Health in London, England. As a member of the program committee of the Atlantic Economic Conference, an international group, he has presented papers in Paris, Rome, Puerto Rico, Scotland, and Munich on various hospital economic topics. He has been a presenter at numerous seminars with John Goodman and Associates regarding Hospital Based Heart Centers.  Nobly, Ed has committed a life of service to Northwest Indiana through his work in the health care community. He has received the Meritorious Service Award from the Munster Board of Trustees and a Special Award for Outstanding Leadership from the Munster Medical Research Foundation. He is also a founding member of the Board of Directors of Community Foundation, Inc. and the President of the Board of Directors of Hospice of the Calumet Area. He has also shared his time with Board of the Northwest Indiana Symphony, as well as serving as Co-Chairman of the Community Veterans Memorial Park in Munster.  Mr. Speaker, Ed Robinson will be greatly missed at The Community Hospital by all of those who have served with this caring and compassionate man. At this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Mr. Robinson for an outstanding career, not only in health care, but also in service to his community. Ed's leadership and passion for his career are to be commended, and his professional absence from the Northwest Indiana community will surely be missed.                          ____________________
