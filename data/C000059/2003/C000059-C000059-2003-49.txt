Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Norco, CA are exceptional. Norco has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Barbara Carmichael is one of these individuals. After 13 years of service to the city, Barbara will step down as a councilmember.  Barbara moved to Norco in 1980 and quickly became involved in the community as a 4-H leader. As an honorary FFA Chapter farmer Barbara truly fit in to the rural lifestyle of Norco. Barbara has been involved with many community organizations including the Chamber of Commerce Fair Committee, a Foundation Board Member for Corona Regional Hospital and member of the Riverside Community Hospital college advisory board. She has also represented the City of Norco as a Mosquito Abatement Trustee, on the Economic Development Advisory Council, the Ad Hoc Committee for the retention of the Naval Warfare Assessment Center. She is a member of the Corona/Norco School Advisory Board and the host of monthly Senior Town Hall meetings. She is also the current President of the Norco Seniors and Pet Relief organization and is a Charter and active member of the Norco Horsemen's Association.  Barbara was first elected to the Norco City Council in November 1990, was elected Mayor in 1992 and 1998. She has served as Mayor Pro-Tempore three times. During her tenure on the Norco City Council Barbara has accomplished an enormous amount for the residents of Norco including the construction of five low-to-moderate income homes; a pilot curbside recycling program and the Sixth Street Facade program; a Directional Sign Program for new homes was approved; a new City Hall was opened; an agreement was reached with the City of Jurupa for the purchase of desalter water; the Lake Norconian Club and central hotel were designated as historic landmarks; the second phase of senior housing was approved; a new senior center was completed; the Animal Keeping Ad Hoc Committee was formed; the proposal to purchase Hidden Valley Golf Club was rejected and barbed wire was prohibited adjacent to equestrian trails.  Barbara's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Norco, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she steps down from the Norco City Council.                          ____________________
