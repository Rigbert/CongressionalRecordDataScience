 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a lifelong Kentuckian who dedicated his life to serving others, the Reverend Denvis Rush. Known to many simply as ``Preacher,'' the Reverend Rush was a Kentucky icon who passed away earlier this year at the age of 85 from complications of liver cancer.  The Reverend Rush began preaching at the age of 18. His 66-year career spanned eight different churches in Eastern Kentucky and allowed him to embark on mission trips to Indonesia, Africa, South America, and Korea. He touched thousands of lives by officiating at numerous baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Despite his illness, he continued to preach and stood before his congregation for a final time the Sunday before he passed away.  In addition to his ministerial duties, the Reverend Rush was a longtime chairman of the Oneida Baptist Institute's school board and served on the executive board of the Kentucky Baptist Convention. He was also active in other community organizations where he and his wife of 63 years, Juanita, would donate their time and energy to help improve the quality of life of those around them. The Reverend Rush is survived by his wife; a daughter, Joyce Rush Woods; four sisters; a brother; four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.  The Reverend Rush was a very modest man who, when asked to reflect on his lifetime of achievement, said, ``I haven't done it. The Lord's done it, through a little old nobody.'' But the thousands of people he touched all certainly thought he was somebody, somebody special. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our sympathy to the family and friends of the late Rev. Denvis Rush by honoring and recognizing all of the contributions he made to communities in Kentucky and around the world. He will be missed.  Mr. President, I ask unaminous consent to print in the Record an article from The Lexington Herald-Leader, ``Denvis Rush, minister, dies,'' about the Reverend Rush's life.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald Leader, Feb. 9, 2005]``Denvis Rush, Minister, Dies; Had Conducted Revivals on 4 Continents''                         (By Jennifer Hewlett)       The Rev. Denvis Rush held revivals on four continents. He      officiated at thousands of funerals and weddings in Laurel      and Clay counties and other Eastern Kentucky counties. For      decades he preached several times a week at Kentucky      churches.       When he found out that he had liver cancer in November, he      declined to undergo chemotherapy because he knew it would sap      his energy. He wanted to use every bit he had left to preach      the word of God, friends said.       The Rev. Rush, a Baptist minister for more than 66 years,      died Monday at Marymount Hospital in London. He was 85 and      lived in London. In addition to his family, he leaves behind      thousands of friends whose lives he deeply touched.       ``There were times in his life when he had more influence      on the people of Clay County than any elected official would      have, and that's saying a whole lot,'' said the Rev. Thermon      Taylor, pastor emeritus of Liberty Baptist Church in London      and a longtime friend.       ``He did so many things for the people in Clay County and      Jackson and Perry and Leslie. . . His influence is extremely      wide,'' Taylor said.                            preaching at 18       The Rev. Rush, a Laurel County native, began preaching at      age 18 and pastored his first church, Laurel River Baptist      Church in London, soon afterward. He was pastor of Providence      Baptist Church near London at his death.       Before moving to Providence about 14 years ago, he pastored      Horse Creek Baptist Church in Clay County for 37 years.      During     several of those years, the Rev. Rush pastored Lily Grove      Baptist Church, an African-American church in Clay County, at      the same time.       ``There was no color barrier with him. He was color      blind,'' Taylor said. ``He helped them build a new church. He      did a lot of the work himself with his two hands. . . . They      loved him and he did them.''       At one time, the Rev. Rush was a member of the executive      board of the Kentucky Baptist Convention.       ``Whenever decisions were to be made within our      association, one of the questions always asked was 'What does      Brother Rush think about it?' '' said Roy Faulkner, director      of missions for the Laurel River Baptist Association.       ``He's an icon in Kentucky among Baptists.''       For decades, Rev. Rush was Oneida Baptist Institute's      biggest cheerleader, said Kay Underwood, administrative      coordinator at the school and wife of the school's president,      W.F. Underwood.       For several years, the Rev. Rush, who had been a longtime      chairman of the school's board, hauled groceries donated by      an area wholesale grocer to the Clay County school for the      students, faculty and staff members. He bought a truck just      for that purpose.       ``He has really been a wonderful ambassador for Oneida,''      Kay Underwood said. ``One of our buildings is named after him      and his wife, Juanita.''       The minister, Underwood said, wasn't a wealthy man who      could give a lot of money to the school, which has more than      300 students in grades six through 12, but he was a major      influence on others who could.       ``One of the tender things to me . . . he had a heart for      children. He loved anything a child did. . . . This was a man      who was a preacher, a man of God who was busy, busy, busy,      but he was never too busy for a little child. I think that's      why he had such a heart for Oneida,'' she said.       For the past five years, the Rev. Rush was the mission's      teacher and coordinator at Laurel Lake Baptist Camp outside      Corbin.       When he was at the camp, ``it was sort of like the Pied      Piper, with kids following him all over the campus,''      Faulkner said.                        clear creek scholarships       There is a scholarship at Clear Creek Bible College in Bell      County named for the Rev. Rush, who studied there. Money for      the scholarship was contributed by people whose lives he      touched.       The Rev. Rush influenced many young preachers, Taylor said.                          worldwide revivalist       Over the years, the Rev. Rush held revivals not only in      North America, but in Africa, Asia and South America.       Taylor recalled one mission trip to Brazil that the Rev.      Rush took. While there, he gave witness to an elderly man on      his front porch. A teenage girl inside the house told the      Rev. Rush through an interpreter that she needed his help      when he finished with the old man.       ``She said, ``I'm 16 years old and I've got AIDS and I'm      dying.' He taught her how to become a Christian,'' Taylor      said.       ``He had more understanding. He knew how to talk to      people,'' Taylor said.       ``His heart was in missions. . . . He told me just a week      or so ago that if he had one thing he could do again was he'd      like to go back and preach in Kenya one more time,'' Faulkner      said.       The Rev. Rush preached for the last time Sunday. He      preached twice that day. He was to have preached at a funeral      today, having agreed to do so less than a couple of hours      before he died. After he found out he didn't have long to      live, he held a revival and officiated at several funerals      and weddings.       The Rev. Rush is survived by his wife, Juanita Rudder Rush;      a daughter, Joyce Rush Woods of Manchester; four sisters; a      brother; four grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.                          ____________________[Pages S2841-S2842]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            MORNING BUSINESS                                 ______                                                   TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DENVIS RUSH  Mr. McCONNELL.
