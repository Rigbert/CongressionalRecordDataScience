President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. At 11 a.m. the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the A-plus education savings account bill. If cloture is not invoked, the majority leader hopes consent will be granted to set the cloture vote on a motion to proceed to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation, at 2:30 p.m. If that is not possible, the Senate will recess following the 11 a.m. vote until 2:30 p.m. Otherwise, under the consent the Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will begin debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1269.  In addition, the Senate may also consider and complete action on the D.C. appropriations bill, the FDA Reform conference report, the Intelligence authorization conference report, and any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action.
