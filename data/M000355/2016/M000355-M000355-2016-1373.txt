 President, the Energy Policy Modernization Act is the result of months of hard work across the aisle. It passed committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Congress hasn't passed legislation to update America's energy policies in nearly a decade. It is time we change that.  This broad, bipartisan energy bill offers a good way forward. It will help Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It will help Americans save energy. Not only will this bipartisan legislation help bring our energy policies in line with the demands of today, it will also position us to benefit from the opportunities of tomorrow. So let's work together and pass it.  The Senators from Alaska and Washington are proven bill managers. I ask our colleagues who have amendments they would like to be considered to bring them to the managers. Let's get going and pass this important legislation for our country.                          ____________________
