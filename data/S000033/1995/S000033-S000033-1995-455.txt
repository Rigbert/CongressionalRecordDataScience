 Speaker, at a time when the congressional leadership is proposing  [[Page E554]] huge tax breaks for the wealthy, an increase in military spending and major cutbacks in a wide variety of programs which tens of millions of low and moderate Americans desperately need, I am happy to tell you about the results of the municipal election yesterday in Burlington, VT--the State's largest city.  Peter Clavelle, a Progressive, won the mayoral election with 5,055 votes. Peter Brownell, the Republican incumbent, came in second with 4,815 and Paul Lafayette, the Democrat, came in third with 1,793. Further, Progressives and Independents held their seats on the city council which will give the Progressives more voting power than they have ever had before.  Mr. Clavelle, in opposing the Republican and Democratic candidates, called for property tax reform and a progressive tax system which is based on ability to pay. He also called for keeping Burlington's waterfront open for all the people--not just the wealthy. He indicated that the goal of his administration would be to make government work for the average citizen--not just those who have a lot of money. Mr. Clavelle had the support of city unions, women's groups, environmentalists, and many low income citizens.  I should also mention to you that Mr. Clavelle and the Progressives did their best in the low and moderate income wards of the city. In ward 2 he received 65 percent of the vote in the 3-way race, and in ward 3 he received 58 percent of the vote. The voter turnout was also significantly higher than the 38 percent by which the Republican's won their national mandate on November 8, 1994.  While the results of this municipal election have almost everything to do with local issues and local personalities, I do believe that national politics played a role. In Burlington, VT, as in other communities across America, middle income and working people are becoming increasingly concerned about the class warfare which is going on in Washington. They want to see government represent all the people--not just big money interests. They want to see government protect the elderly, the children, women, and the poor--rather than just those who make large campaign contributions.                          ____________________
