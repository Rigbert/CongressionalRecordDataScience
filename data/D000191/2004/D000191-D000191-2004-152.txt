Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to thank Frank D. Jackson of Eugene, OR, for his tireless efforts to improve the lives of working men and women and their families.  Frank Jackson is a man of conviction, dedicated to serving his community by strengthening labor rights. His unwavering vision for working America has put him on the front lines in the fight for decent pay and benefits, safe and healthy workplaces, and dignity and respect for the rank and file.  Until he retired in 1992, Jackson worked two jobs for decades--firefighter and union activist. He has been a steadfast advocate for workers since joining his first union at the age of 15 and was recently inducted into the Labor Hall of fame for his many years of leadership in the labor movement. He served as president and secretary-treasurer of his union, Eugene Firefighters Association Local 851, International Association of Fire Fighters; president and executive secretary-treasurer of the LaneCounty Labor Council; senior vice president of the Oregon State Fire Fighters Council; and Executive Board member of the Oregon AFL-CIO.  In solidarity and strength, I am proud to salute Frank Jackson for his wholehearted commitment to organized labor and working people in Oregon.                          ____________________
