Malcolm Miller, a retired anesthesiologist and Mayor of the City of Norco, California. Malcolm passed away last night at the age of 65 after a brief battle with liver cancer. He will be deeply missed.  Dr. Miller graduated from medical school from the University of Cape Town in South Africa and specialized as an anesthesiologist at Harvard Medical School. After teaching at Harvard for three years, he transferred to the University of California, Irvine where he taught as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology.  Dr. Miller later entered private practice at Orange County's St. Joseph Hospital and Children's Hospital where he served as Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology and as a member of the Board of Trustees. He was elected as the District Director for the Orange County Society of Anesthesiologists and served on the Board of Directors of the California Society of Anesthesiologists. He also served as a member of the Claims Review Committee of the Cooperative of American Physicians.  Dr. Miller is a naturalized citizen of the United States. He moved to Norco in 1997 when he married his wife, Donna, a longtime resident. Since then, he has served on the Streets and Trails Commission and was elected to the Norco City Council in 2007. Both Dr. Miller and his wife have been avid equestrians, and proud members of the Norco Horsemen's Association. Furthermore, Dr. Miller was a strong advocate for an innovative and forward-thinking project to convert animal waste into a renewable energy source.  Dr. Miller was in his first term on the City Council after being elected in 2007, and will be remembered for using his profound intellect to better the community around him.  On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the remarkable life and legacy of Dr. Miller. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his wife and his dear family and friends.                          ____________________
