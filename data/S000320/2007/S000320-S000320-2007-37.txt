 President, I will not replicate what Senator Mikulski went through. She has done a very thorough explanation of the bill. This is a very complex bill. It funds Commerce-Justice-Science--NASA, for example--and related agencies. I will touch on some things.  I chaired this committee before and Senator Mikulski was the ranking Democrat on the committee. Now she chairs it and I am the ranking member. She probably has related on many occasions that we go back to our House days. We were on the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives, working together then on a lot of these same issues but perhaps manifested in different ways.  This bill funds a number of our Nation's most important programs and initiatives, and I am pleased to outline some of the highlights. I thank Senator Mikulski, the chair of the committee. She works well with us, our staffs work together, and we tried to bring forth a bill that reflects our strong bipartisan relationship.  This bill was crafted with a tight allocation of $54 billion. Within these limitations, the subcommittee was forced to strike a difficult balance between the competing priorities of law enforcement, terrorism prevention, research, space exploration, and U.S. competitiveness through investing in science.  For the Department of Justice, the committee's recommendation is $24.3, $2 billion over the request.
