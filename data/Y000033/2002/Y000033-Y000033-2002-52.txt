Mr. Speaker, I was in my office watching this debate. If I could do one thing in this Congress, being one of the longest-serving congressmen, it would be to shut off the television. The nonsense I heard from that side of the aisle that affects my committee is pure, pure BS. That is exactly what it is. And they are playing the political game on television so the people at home can watch this dishonesty as they present it.  I worked very hard on this and I must tell the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), I worked very hard, including the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), who is the ranking member, to make sure as it came down that we reinstated, and $31,799,104,000 is going to be spent. Yes, that is what it is. Just read it. Has the gentleman read it?
