 President, I wish to say a few words about an issue of enormous importance to the people of the State of Vermont and people all over this country; that is, the issue of making sure that in America this winter nobody goes cold, that nobody freezes to death, that children do not become ill because the thermostats in their homes are turned down so low.  The issue I am talking about is to ask for support for legislation that is being introduced by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine which would level fund the LIHEAP program at $4.7 billion. As most of my colleagues know, LIHEAP is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.  Here is the problem we face. We are in the midst of a horrendous recession. Unemployment is sky high. In many cases, wages are in decline, poverty is increasing, and at the same time the price for home heating oil and propane gas is going up. According to the Energy Information Administration, average expenditures for households that heat with oil or propane are forecast to be higher than in any previous winter. Heating oil prices are currently averaging about $3.90 a gallon. So what people in the Northeast and people all over this country are looking at are the highest home heating oil prices we have ever seen, coming in the midst of a terrible recession, with unemployment high and wages in decline.  In Vermont, heating oil prices are already 34 percent higher than they were at the same time last year. It is currently $3.82 a gallon, compared to $2.85 a gallon last year. What is happening is that because of cuts--significant cuts--in LIHEAP funding, the average LIHEAP benefit in Vermont is 45 percent less this year than it was last year, and that is $474 per family as opposed to $866 last year.  One thing that has to be understood about LIHEAP is that nearly 80 percent of funding from this program goes to our citizens who are elderly, families with preschool kids, and the disabled. So the people who benefit from this program are some of the most vulnerable people in our country. Eighty percent of the funding, once again, goes to senior citizens, families with preschool children, young children, and people who are dealing with disabilities.  It is not uncommon in the State of Vermont and in other States for the temperatures to drop to 10 below zero or 20 below zero in the wintertime. When people do not have enough funds to heat their homes or their apartments, serious problems arise.  What I want to do is take a moment to read some comments my office has received from Vermonters all over the State who are trying desperately to stay warm this winter.  Josie Crosby, 81 years of age, of Brattleboro, VT, said this:       We will have money for one more tank. After that, I don't      know.  That is a woman who is 81 years of age who has money for one more tank of oil. After that, she is not sure how they will stay warm in the winter.  A 48-year-old from Orleans County in the northern part of our State wrote this:       I was able to get 100 gallons of fuel last week, and for      that I am grateful. The struggle begins now on how to stretch      that fuel as long as possible. I had to buy a portable      electric heater to keep halfway warm while waiting for fuel      assistance. I don't even want to see how high my electric      bill will be. I am an honorably discharged disabled veteran      and have limited funds. I have already slashed my food bill,      so what goes next? My meds, my electric service, my home?  That is from a disabled vet in the northern part of Vermont.  A 59-year-old woman in central Vermont writes:       I have been keeping my thermostat as low as I can      ``almost'' tolerate. I bundle up in the house with several      sweaters, and even a coat and hat at times. When company      arrives, I am embarrassed at how ridiculous I probably      appear. I am just barely squeaking through each month. I have      made cuts everywhere possible, including food.  Wendy Raven, 62, from Whitingham, VT, writes:       I had to drag my bed out of my bedroom and put it in the      living room, then close off the bedroom for the winter. I      will have to eat even less than I do now in order to pay my      fuel bills. I have done everything I can to button up the      place, but now all I can do is pray I get through the winter      without a bill so large it will again take me until next fall      to pay it off.  Is that where we are in the United States of America--that we force people to live under those conditions?  A 31-year-old woman from Bennington, VT, writes:       We are now trying to stay warm by scraping up enough for a      gallon or two of heating oil a week, and keeping the      thermostat down very low. I turn the furnace off during the      day when my child is in school and turn it on an hour before      she gets home so that the house gets warm. We are hoping to      qualify for crisis fuel assistance or we are in trouble,      because there is nowhere to get the extra money needed to pay      for the fuel, especially considering its continuously      increasing cost. We have to choose what bills to pay each      month and what ones not in order to put food on the table.  In this great Nation, in the midst of a recession, in the midst of high unemployment, in the midst of growing poverty, we as the Senate must be very clear that nobody in this country is going to go cold this winter; that we are not going to pick up a paper in Maine or Rhode Island or Vermont or North Dakota and read that some senior citizen was found frozen to death. That is not what we are going to allow. That is why Senators Jack Reed, Olympia Snowe, I, and many others are working hard so that at the very least we can level fund LIHEAP so that nobody in our country goes cold this winter.                          ____________________
