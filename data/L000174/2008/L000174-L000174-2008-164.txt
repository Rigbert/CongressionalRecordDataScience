President, the Burlington Free Press recently printed an article about SymQuest Group Inc. in South Burlington. It was especially interesting to me, as I know the cofounders, Larry Sudbay and Pat Robins, very well.  In the article, Mr. Sudbay was said to make their success and the honors they have won seem very easy. One would have to know Larry Sudbay to realize that what he makes seem easy can be a Herculean task for most people.  The other cofounder is Pat Robins of Burlington. I was privileged to not only be a classmate of Pat's at St. Michael's College, but to have the further privilege of maintaining our friendship for the past 50 years.  Vermont is a small State with much to make us proud. People like Larry Subday and Pat Robins make our State even better.  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, June 2, 2008]                People, Paper and Pixels Propel SymQuest                         (By Joel Banner Baird)       South Burlington.--Behind thick glass, like a motionless      aquarium in the company's lobby, the SymQuest Group Inc.      server room might hold the visitor's interest for a minute or      two, tops.       Even CEO and co-founder Larry Sudbay can be easily      distracted from the racks of hardware and colorful cabling--     especially when one of his 152 employees walks by.       In this hardware-and-software company, everyone seems to be      on a first-name basis; people are the moving parts at      SymQuest. On May 21, Gov. Jim Douglas honored the 12-year-old      company as the recipient of this year's winner of Vermont's      top business accolade: the Deane C. Davis Award, citing      SymQuest for its outstanding commitments to work environment      and community--and for its vitality.       Last week, Sudbay, 51, made it sound simple.       He described the privately held, office systems management      firm's steady, double-digit growth as ``fun momentum.''       In a nutshell, he said, his goal in management ``is to      allow our employees to thrive, and to create raving fans.''       The company's 3,000 customers must be right: Sudbay      predicts this fiscal year's sales to more than quadruple the      $9 million SymQuest earned in 1997.       There's still room for expansion at the company's 40,000-     square-feet headquarters on Community Drive. But a cautionary      history looms, as well: SymQuest is housed in the footprint      of now-extinct computer giant Digital Equipment Corp.       Sudbay and SymQuest co-founder Pat Robins sidestepped the      fragile dot-com bubble of the past decade by integrating      computer systems development with the lower-tech standbys of      office work flow: copiers and printers.       ``The Jetsons meet the Flintstones here,'' Sudbay quipped.       Approximately 20 percent of the company's revenues come      from toner shipments and service contracts, he added.       SymQuest continually researches ways to better bridge the      gap between pixels and paper.       Sudbay returns again and again to a fundamental question:      how does information--often an intangible product--move      through a business? And how is it thwarted?       His engineers, sales reps and technicians came up with a      winning strategy: maximize customers' uptime with secure,      off-site monitoring, matched with prompt, people-to-people      service.       Rob Bromee, who directs SymQuest's support center, said the      company's proprietary ``Sentinel'' devices allow his team to      diagnose and even predict failures on clients' computers and      networks.       ``This is not just patch management,'' he said. ``We're      listening. We like to go back upstream from the problem, to      see what's causing it.''       Remote monitoring now extends to printers and copiers, as      well. SymQuest can read meters and gauge maintenance needs;      customers receive toner shipments days before they're needed.       In theory, a company in Bangkok could choose to delegate      its IT management to SymQuest. For Sudbay, a 1979 graduate of      University of Vermont, the vision remains in New England:      Regional is beautiful.       ``Keeping everyone within two hours is our goal,'' he said.      ``Local is too small; regional provides us with the economy      of scale for purchasing similar to big Web and Wall Street      companies.       ``This isn't India,'' he continued. ``We're based in the      same time zone as our customers. If they need a physical      presence, we're able to put our capes on.''       Sudbay said a tighter network of offices also allows      employees to develop ties to their communities. Plaques on      the walls at the South Burlington headquarters laud      volunteers and charity fundraisers; firefighters, Little      League coaches and Penguin Plungers.       The Deane C. Davis Award also cited SymQuest's direct      outreach of cyber-expertise.       In February, following a competitive grant process,      SymQuest awarded a ``$25,000 Office Makeover'' to a drug      treatment and youth center near its Plattsburgh office.      Another makeover is under way to upgrade networking at a      mental illness center in Keene, N.H.       Neighborliness, Sudbay said, is essential to good business.       ``Simply put, we're looking for mutually profitable, long-     term relationships with customers,'' he said. ``The old adage      where good guys finish last? Well, it's bogus. Good things      happen to good people.''                          ____________________
