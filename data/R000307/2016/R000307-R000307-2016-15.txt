President, reserving the right to object. I want to make certain that my colleagues understand my position on this matter. My hold on Eric Fanning's nomination is not in relation to his capabilities, expertise, or character, and it is certainly not intended to bring undue stress to our U.S. Army. Rather, my hold on the nominee is to protect the security ofthe United States and especially the people of Kansas.  I will be more than happy to vote for Mr. Fanning once the White House addresses my concerns regarding the President's efforts to move Guantanamo Bay terrorist detainees to the mainland, with Fort Leavenworth, KS, the intellectual center of the Army, very high on the list.  I have been clear, honest, and flexible with the White House. I am simply asking that they communicate to me what all those who have reviewed Fort Leavenworth already know; that Fort Leavenworth is not a suitable replacement for the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. The White House has not reciprocated.  I have prepared lengthier remarks on my position in this matter. At this time, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 additional minutes.
