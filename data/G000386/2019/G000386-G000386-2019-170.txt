 The Secret Service has a program of alerting people to some of those things and training people.  Understanding the common factors of the past acts of mass violence can help us prevent future tragedies. The Secret Service, through its National Threat Assessment Center, compiles and studies data on these risk factors.  Yesterday, the Secret Service released its report entitled ``Mass Attacks in Public Spaces,'' which confirms that there are often warning signs before targeted violence.  Following up on the expertise of the Secret Service, I introduced a bill that goes by the acronym EAGLES Act to expand the National Threat Assessment Center to conduct additional research and training to prevent targeted violence.  Congress should pass this law to help stop violence before it happens.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
