President, I had the honor to serve on the Senate intelligence subcommittee for 4 years. It is an awesome assignment. That committee can suck up more time from a Senator's schedule than any other assignment I can think of. I easily spent half of my time in committee in the Senate Intelligence Committee room, and I am almost certain that I didn't attend half of their meetings.
