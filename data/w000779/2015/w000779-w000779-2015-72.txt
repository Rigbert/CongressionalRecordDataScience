President, I am a firm believer in the power of higher education. It is our Nation's responsibility to honor the institutions that consistently provide America's youth with the skills necessary to make our country a better place. I am thrilled to recognize the achievements of Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center, on its 50th anniversary as a center for marine studies.  Over the last half-century, thanks in large part to early collaboration with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the Hatfield Center has served students from community college to post-doctoral candidates. In addition to providing educational opportunities, the Hatfield Center works closely with the Environmental Protection Agency to research the most pressing environmental issues of our generation. As climate change and sustainability increasingly impact our Nation's agriculture and energy policies, Oregonians can take comfort in knowing that OSU's Marine Science Center has the technology and partnerships necessary to spearhead State, national and global initiatives.  It always amazes me how quickly novel ideas transform into success stories. Since its establishment in 1965, the Hatfield Marine Science Center has worked extensively with the colleges of Oregon State University and various State and Federal agencies to produce seawater systems, experimental wet labs, and other programs that have attracted some of the Nation's top scientific minds. It gives me great pleasure to say that the Hatfield Marine Science Center is home to the Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station--a program recognized internationally for its innovative approach to the study of marine mammals.  I am particularly excited to witness the results of OSU's world-class Marine Studies Initiative. In addition to the construction of a top-notch research and teaching facility, the Marine Studies Initiative will offer students the opportunity to see how marine studies intersects with the other elements of a liberal arts education. Thousands of young adults, as well as experienced professionals, will gain a greater appreciation for the role of business, government, and big data in the world of marine studies. The addition of an undergraduate degree program in marine studies, projected to attract 500 students in-residence to Newport by 2025, will yield tremendous partnerships in the years ahead. The Federal Area Redevelopment Administration must be incredibly proud of the intellectual profit that its $960,000 investment has produced.  The future of our planet depends upon unique and innovative approaches to the environmental challenges of our era. Higher education is an integral part of the solution. But more specifically, interdisciplinary programs that promote awareness of agricultural, energy, and oceanic issues, and that simultaneously connect the environment to the liberal arts, are a key to building the training necessary to solve imminent problems. I could not be prouder of what OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center means for our State, our Nation, and for the world.                          ____________________
