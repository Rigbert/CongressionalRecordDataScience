I have been allocated 10 minutes. I would like to use 5 and give 5 to the Senator from New York and allow the other Senators--I have noted several Republican Senators who wish to speak for whatever period the Senator from West Virginia would be prepared to work out with them. He was kind enough to allow me 10 minutes, which I will share with the Senator from New York if it meets with the approval of the Senate.  Let me defer to the Senator from West Virginia because I believe under the existing order I have 10 minutes and he has 1 hour, if I am not mistaken; is that correct?
