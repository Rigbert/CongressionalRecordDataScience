 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m. tomorrow, Friday, October 8. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved; provided further, that the Senate then immediately proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4520, the FSC/ETI JOBS bill, provided it is available. I further ask unanimous consent that the majority leader then be recognized in order to file a cloture motion on the conference report. I further ask unanimousconsent that following the filing of that cloture motion, the Senate proceed to a cloture vote on the pending substitute amendment to S. Res. 445.
