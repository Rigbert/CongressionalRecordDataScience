President, I rise today to commend St. John's Hospital in Springfield. This is National Hospital Week, when communities across the country celebrate the people that make hospitals the special places they are. This year's theme sums it up nicely: ``People Care. Miracles Happen.'' It recognizes the health care workers, volunteers, and other health professionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, curing and caring for their neighbors who need them.  An example of this dedication is the Parent Help Line of St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois. The program won the American Hospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer Excellence, which highlights special contributions of hospital volunteers.  The Parent Help Line provides parents and agencies with easily accessible, low-cost parenting information and support to help strengthen families and prevent child abuse. Trained volunteers give parenting tips, support and referrals to about 100 callers a month. Volunteers also visit parents of newborns and offer information about infant growth and development and about the Parent Help Line services, and a volunteer nurse makes a follow-up call to each family one month after discharge. Volunteers taking part in an intervention program regularly call parents identified as high risk. Parenting classes, program and support groups are made available to parents, and a television show on parenting issues airs weekly on a local public access channel. A monthly newsletter is mailed to more than 1,500 individuals and agencies in central Illinois.  Mr. President, I want to congratulate St. John's Hospital for this award-winning program.                          ____________________
