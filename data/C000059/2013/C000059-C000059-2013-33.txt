Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Cindy Roth is one of these individuals. On May 9, 2013, Cindy will be honored with the Frank Miller Civic Achievement Award for her service as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce.  Cindy's relationship with the Chamber began through a work experience program after working under then-Senator Bob Presley out of high school. She later worked for the Chamber as a receptionist while attending Riverside Community College. Soon, she was taken under the wing of the Chamber's former President and Riverside City Councilman, Art Pick. When Pick died in 1999, the selection committee selected Cindy as President.  Under Cindy's leadership, the Chamber has actively promoted and supported the community, fostered growth among its members and engaged federal, state and local representatives to become the third largest Chamber in southern California and the eighth largest in the state. It is currently composed of over 1,300 business enterprises, civic organizations, educational institutions and individuals. Following in the footsteps of her predecessor, she has also reached out to women business owners and encouraged them to get involved in the local economy.  Cindy's dedication is not only to local business, but also to the wider community. She serves with numerous organizations, including the Monday Morning Group of Western Riverside County, the Science and Technology Education Partnership, the Raincross Exchange Club, the Foundation Board of Trustees for La Sierra University, and the Honorary Commanders of March Field. She has received the 1996 Community Service Award from the Rotary Club of Arlington, the 2000 Athena of the Inland Valleys Award, and was previously honored as the 2003 Woman of the Year by Assemblyman John Benoit.  I have come to know Cindy well through many years working together on a variety of projects in Riverside, and it has been an honor to work with her on behalf of the community. I can personally attest to Cindy's incredible work-ethic, professionalism and positive attitude. Throughout her career, Cindy has been supported by her husband, California State Senator Gen. Richard Roth, USAF and her daughter, an alumnus of the University of California, Riverside.  In light of all Cindy has done for Riverside, the Mission Inn Foundation will honor her with the Frank Miller Civic Achievement Award at the historic Mission Inn in Riverside. Cindy's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Riverside County. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
