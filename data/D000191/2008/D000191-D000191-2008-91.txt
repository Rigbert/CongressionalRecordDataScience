Speaker, tomorrow, this House will take up a critical piece of legislation, H.R. 3058. This legislation would extend the secure rural schools program for 4 years. If this legislation is not adopted, we expect that more than 7,000 teachers in rural districts across the United States of America will be laid off. We expect that in more than 600 counties critical services such as sheriffs deputy patrols, jail deputies who perform services in the jail, and other critical emergency services will end. Road funds will be impacted in terms of critical road and bridge maintenance. This is must-pass legislation.  But we also recognize that the United States of America is in a fiscal bind here. So the Democrats have reimposed something pretty simple most Americans live by called pay-as-you-go. So we had to figure out a way to pay for this. We've gone through a whole ream of proposals, and we've found one that works, and I think in this time of record-high oil and gas prices, it's particularly appropriate.  We would have in place a renegotiation of existing leases which omitted a price trigger at $35 a barrel or impose a conservation resource fee if those companies would renegotiate. A number of good citizen companies have renegotiated, including Shell, BP and Conoco. A number of other not-so-good citizen companies, those which are extorting incredible amounts of money from the American consumer, such as ExxonMobil, have refused to renegotiate, and they're trying to take their unintended windfall.  Now, many on the other side of the aisle are going to say this is unconstitutional. Well, I would urge my Republican colleagues to read the CRS Report for Congress, No. RL 33974. It addresses those issues in depth. It's not a taking. It doesn't violate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. It doesn't violate substantive due process and equal protection. And it doesn't cause a breach of contract.  In fact, CRS finds that the government, but of course not this administration, the Bush administration, may have a cause of its own under a section called unilateral and mutual mistake.  Everyone admits these provisions, these triggers are supposed to be in the bill. At $35 a barrel, that's about $100 a barrel ago, the subsidies were supposed to go away for these oil companies. They didn't because some bureaucrat messed up. So, in fact, the preponderance of evidence is that the government has a cause of action to reinstate lawful charges against those oil companies. This bill would do that, and it would assure the future of more than 600 counties, hundreds of school districts, 7,000 teachers.  If we don't pass this, if you lean on the slender read, if you're concerned about the wealth of the oil companies, I refer you to ExxonMobil's and others' most recent statements. I refer you to the Wall Street Journal to look at the price of oil hovering in the upper $120 a barrel when this fee was supposed to come in at $35 a barrel.  You can't lean on the unconstitutional read, but if you do want to side with the oil companies over and above rural schools, public safety, maintenance of roads, bridges and highways in rural counties across America, then you will side with the oil companies in this vote tomorrow.  I hope a majority of my colleagues join me on the right side of this issue.                          ____________________
