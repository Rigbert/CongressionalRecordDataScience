President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator DeWine in introducing the Kids and Terrorism Preparedness Act to strengthen our ability to protect our children as our Nation prepares for and responds to acts of terrorism.  Every generation has a defining event. Our parents will never forget the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the baby boomers will never forget the day President Kennedy was shot. This generation will always remember September 11 and the horrific images of the two airliners slamming into the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  These terrorist attacks have evolved into an ongoing crisis that has created some particularly difficult challenges for our Nation's children. Thousands of children lost a family member or loved one on September 11. Tens of thousands more are close to another child who suffered an immediate loss. Millions of other children across the country watched the repeated broadcasts of the fiery crashes, workers falling to their deaths, the terrible building collapses and the panic that followed. These images have enacted an emotional and psychological toll on all Americans, but children are particularly vulnerable. Moreover, the current anthrax scare has only added to the anxiety of children who now fear that their own houses may not be a sanctuary against a bioterrorist attack delivered through the mail.  As our Nation takes steps to plan and prepare for future attacks, it is critical that we consider the unique needs of children who are more susceptible to biological and chemical attacks. Since they are smaller than adults, they may get sick from smaller amounts of harmful substances. They have a higher respiratory rate than adults, which means that they would get relatively larger doses of an inhaled substance in the same period of time. Moreover, some dense chemical agents, like chlorine and sarin, accumulate close to the ground, right in the breathing zone of children.  The problem is compounded because our current tools to combat terrorism are now always sensitive to children's needs. For example, Cipro, which is being widely prescribed for people who have been exposed to anthrax, is generally not recommended for use by children because of concerns that it can impair bone and joint growth. It is clear that immediate steps must be taken to develop drugs and vaccines appropriate for children that can be used to respond to a bioterrorist threat or attack.  Children also need different sized medical equipment from adults. I am therefore extremely troubled that, at present, many ambulances and emergency departments do not have child-sized equipment and supplies, such as oxygen masks, IV-tubes and neck braces. We must therefore do more to support our Emergency Medical Services workers and ensure that they are trained and equipped to meet the specific medical needs of children.  The legislation we are introducing today will help us to meet these special needs of children as our nation prepares to defend itself against terrorist threats. For example, it more than doubles the resources available through the Department of Health and Human Services Emergency Medical Services for Children program to ensure that first responders, our firefighters, our police, and our paramedics, are trained and equipped to handle the special medical needs of children.  It also authorizes grants to enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the pharmaceutical, biotech, and device industries, to formulate a plan for the development of new, and enhancement of existing, drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and medical devices that may be appropriate to prevent and treat children who are exposed to a bioterrorist attack. This is critical because children are not simply smaller versions of adults, their bodies react to drugs differently.  To help meet the mental health needs of children in crisis, the legislation authorizes grants to be administered by the Center for Mental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for emergency mental health prevention and treatment services for children who are directly affected by terrorist acts. To deal with other unique needs of children, our bill provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with broad authority to allocate emergency crisis response grants. Such grants could be made at the Secretary's discretion to State and local governments or public or private non-profit organizations serving children to increase the coordination and the development of bioterrorism preparedness efforts relating to the needs of children.  These are difficult and dangerous times, but all is not bleak. We can take great comfort from the extraordinary resources with which America is blessed. Besides our spiritual muscle, we have a proof of economic, scientific, and material strength which we have only just begun to tap. The legislation we are introducing today will help to strengthen our response to the terrorist threat by ensuring that the special needs of children are not overlooked, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By
