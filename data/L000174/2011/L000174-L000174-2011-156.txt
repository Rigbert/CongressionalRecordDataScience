We all support the Peace Corps' mission and we want to do everything we can to help it succeed, and at the same time ensure that volunteers have the training and support they need. There are inherent risks whenever an American travels, studies, works, or serves overseas, especially in remote areas in poor countries where law enforcement and judicial systems are often corrupt or dysfunctional. But what happened to Kate Puzey should never have happened. We need to do everything reasonably possible to protect the safety of Peace Corps volunteers, and this bill represents a major step forward. I am very pleased that it bears Kate's name. I know Peace Corps Director Aaron Williams has already taken some significant steps in this regard, and that he shares our goal.
