 For the past couple of weeks, in conference with their House counterparts, they have worked in good faith to reach a compromise to address urgent priorities, including funding for our Nation's border security.  The product of this work is a compromise that no side will view as a perfect deal. For instance, I am frustrated by House Democrats' cynical opposition to including commonsense extensions of the Violence Against Women Act and other important items. Nevertheless, this agreement is something both sides should view as an important step, and today, I hope we will vote to advance it.  When the Senate votes on the agreement, we will be voting to avoid a second partial shutdown and provide the certainty of a fully functioning Federal Government. We will be voting to deliver another downpayment on the President's commitment to securing our Nation's borders and keeping American communities safe. And we will do it free from the influence of poison pills that sought to derail progress and stifle compromise.  To be sure, in recent months, we have seen the radical left go out of its way to try to gum up the works. Even the Speaker of the House threw her support behind wild assertions that tried-and-true methods of securing sovereign borders were now immoral. They said there wouldn't be more than one dollar for border barriers. They said there should be fewer tools for the men and women who enforce our immigration laws. Fortunately, none of that nonsense has carried the day.  So here we are, with a solemn deal in front of us. As the Senate prepares to vote later today, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Chairman Shelby, along with Ranking Member Leahy and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. This legislation will mark success for our bipartisan process by finalizing all the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year. Thanks, as well, to Shannon Hines and the entire Appropriations staff, whose hard work made this agreement and all of last year's progress possible.  Later today, I hope each of my colleagues will join me in moving forward with the agreement produced by this hard work, and the President will sign it into law.                            ____________________
