I rise today to recognize and honor one of those individuals: Richard Scott Alden, Jr. On Friday, May 1, 2009, Scott passed away peacefully at his home after a battle with cancer. He will be deeply missed.  Scott was born April 16, 1953 in Pasadena, California. He graduated from Riverside Poly High School in 1971 and received a football scholarship to Arizona State University. While Scott was a Sun Devil, his team won 51 games, four Western Athletic Conference Championships and four Fiesta Bowls.  Scott was a devoted Christian and was ``born again'' through Christ September, 1975. He graduated from ASU with a degree in Business Administration in June, 1976 and married Ann Stiles later that year. After graduation, Scott began work with his father, Dick Alden, founder of Empire Oil Company, now Western Refining-Wholesale, as General Manager, and in 1990 was advanced to President.  Scott was active in Harvest Men's Bible Fellowship, Alliance Petroleum Corporation and served as Chairman of the Advisory Board for The Salvation Army.  Scott was predeceased by his daughter, Jennifer. Survived by his wife, Ann Alden; daughter, Elizabeth Alden of Newport Beach; son, David Alden of Long Beach; parents, Richard Alden of Riverside, and David and Nina Mitchell of Riverside; sister, Michelle Fisher of Aliso Viejo; and brother, Eric Alden of Huntington Beach.  On May 8, 2009, a memorial service celebrating Scott's life will be held at Harvest Christian Fellowship. Scott will always be remembered for his incredible faith, giving spirit, and sense of humor. His dedication to his family, church and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Scott's family and friends; although Scott may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
