Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of H.R. 6.  By encouraging innovation and providing more resources for groundbreaking research, we can provide a better future for our children and our grandchildren.  America has a rich history of scientific discovery, from putting a man on the Moon to finding a cure for polio. With the right focus, we can do the same in finding cures for devastating diseases, like cancer and Alzheimer's.  I want to thank Chairman Upton for his commitment to making Alzheimer's one of the neurological diseases on which the CDC will collect data. 21st Century Cures will improve the lives of all Americans by bringing research from the lab to our families.  I thank the chairman, the committee, and the staff for all of their dedicated work on this.
