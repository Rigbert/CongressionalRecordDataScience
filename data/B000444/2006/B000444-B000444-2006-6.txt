 President, at the end of this year, Anthony ``Tony'' Zagami will retire after 40 years of public service, including the last 16 years at the Government Printing Office, which publishes the Congressional Record for all of us every day.  I first met Tony when I served in my first term in the Senate. He was working as a legislative assistant in the Democratic cloakroom. He spent 25 years working in the Congress, including general counsel to the Joint Committee on Printing.  In 1990, Tony left to become the general counsel at the Government Printing Office. When he retires it will be with the distinction of having been the agency's longest-serving general counsel.  As he moves on, I know all my colleagues join me in thanking him for his dedicated service, and wish him the best for the future.                          ____________________[Page S11320]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              RETIREMENT OF MR.
