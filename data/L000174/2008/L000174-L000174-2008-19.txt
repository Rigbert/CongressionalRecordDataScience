President, I rise today to recognize the great achievements of a wonderful Vermont businessman, Bob Miller, president of R.E.M. Development Company in Williston.  Bobby started R.E.M. Development in 1984, and over the last quarter century, the company has grown to become one of Vermont's largest commercial real estate developers. While it is hard to travel around Vermont without running into one of Bobby's projects, his lifelong commitment to bettering his community is both admirable and commendable.  Bobby recently received two special awards for his outstanding business practices and devotion to the community. Citing ``their determination, success, and philanthropy,'' the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce honored R.E.M. Development as its 2008 Large Business of the Year. In addition, saying that Bobby ``typifies the true spirit of service and self-sacrifice in representing the finest ideals of Vermont citizenship,'' the Vermont Chamber of Commerce presented him with its 2008 Citizen of the Year Award. I congratulate Bobby and R.E.M. Development for both of these well-deserved achievements.  I ask unanimous consent to have a November 17, 2008, Burlington Free Press article about Bobby Miller's successful career printed in the Record so all Senators can read about a prosperous Vermont businessman who continually gives back to his community.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the Burlington Free Press, Monday, Nov. 17, 2008]                    Miller Is a Builder and a Giver                          (By Adam Silverman)       Williston.--Just about anybody can create and run a      thriving business when times are good. When the economic      outlook is gloomier, though, success requires more careful      planning and management.       That's both a piece of advice from and a guiding philosophy      for Bob Miller, president of Williston-based R.E.M      Development Co., a 24-year-old company that builds and leases      commercial real estate. Even with recession fears spreading,      Miller said business is flourishing.       ``There is always demand,'' he said last week while sitting      behind his granite-topped desk at an industrial park he owns      on Avenue D. ``I don't think there's a good time or a bad      time to go into business. Either you have a business plan      that's going to work, or it's not. Anyone can make it in good      times.''       Outside, cars, trucks, big rigs and package-delivery vans      frequented the businesses that rent space in his buildings.      The park represents just a fraction of the 2 million square      feet of real estate R.E.M rents, a total that makes the      company ``the region's largest commercial industrial      developer of manufacturing, distribution, warehouse, and flex      space,'' it boasts on its Web site.       Miller, 73, of Burlington, whose initials compose his      company's acronym, incorporates another component into his      philosophy: the need for philanthropy, for businesses to give      back to their communities. He has donated money and      construction services to hospitals, exposition centers and      youth recreational facilities, among many others. Miller and      his wife, Holly, give what they call the ``three Ts''--time,      talent and treasure.       ``It's kind of fun to take on one of these projects and      stand back and say, `We really helped this neighborhood,' ''      Miller said. ``It's a great way to get your name out. There      are rewards for philanthropy. People know you're out in the      community giving back and not just taking, taking, taking.      That's not why we do it--we do it because we want to--but      there is that relationship in getting involved.''       Those components of Miller's work, the successful company      and the devotion to philanthropy, led to two awards he      received last week.       The Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce honored      R.E.M Development on Tuesday as its large business of the      year, citing Miller and the company for ``their      determination, success, and philanthropy.'' Three days later,      the Vermont Chamber of Commerce presented Miller its Citizen      of the Year Award, also championing his business acumen and      his good works.       Miller ``typifies the true spirit of service and self-     sacrifice in representing the finest ideals of Vermont      citizenship,'' the Vermont Chamber says on its Web site.      ``His commitment to the prosperity of the people and      businesses in Vermont reaches statewide.''       Among Miller's projects is Burlington's Gosse Court Armory,      an old National Guard facility the military donated to the      city in 2005 for transformation into a community center.       The city approached Miller about a potential contribution      after budget estimates exceeded available resources. Miller      looked at the plans, said he could do the work for $500,000      less than the $1.3 million estimate, and agreed to serve as      general contractor. Later he wrote a check for $100,000.       ``It's really extraordinary to have a developer with his      skills and expertise step forward to do this for his      community,'' the city's chief administrative officer,      Jonathan Leopold, said earlier this year.       Sitting in his office last week, Miller fielded a phone      call from a construction worker at the armory. Without      referring to any plans or drawings, Miller helped solve an      engineering challenge from memory, delivering precise      instructions. Then he drew a sketch on a blank sheet of paper      to help an observer understand the issue: the alignment of      basketball hoops and the configuration of lines on the      gymnasium floor.       Miller's talent for drawing and engineering came naturally,      he said. A Rutland native, Miller thought during high school      he wanted to be a mechanic, but after graduation he turned      toward engineering. His first job was as a draftsman.       He moved to Burlington in 1959 and helped draft electrical      plans for the University of Vermont's library and Burlington      High School; because the money wasn't great, Miller also      tended bar, he said. In 1972 he started New England Air      Systems, which he ran for     a dozen years, and then he sold it to the employees and      created the company he continues to run--with 12-hour days      during the week and seven hours on Saturdays.       ``One of my philosophies is, you've got to make money or      you're not going to be in business,'' he said. ``I love the      business. I love the challenge of negotiating. I'm fiercely      competitive. I may not look that way, but I'm a highly      competitive guy. But I'm not a sore loser, either.''       Miller is especially happy to see businesses ``grow with      us,'' starting out small and expanding as their success      increases. R.E.M Development, which Miller runs with his son,      Tim, is devoted to helping its tenants, but expects serious      effort in return, Miller said.       ``We try to help people get started. I'm a great advocate      of the underdog, because that's where I came from,'' he said.      ``We want people to make a profit, but they've got to work      for it, as we do.''       Businesses first must craft a solid, well-researched,      thorough, realistic business plan, Miller suggested. Then      they must forge relationships with customers and with      vendors, and develop and maintain a positive reputation.      That's helped Miller thrive.       ``When we really need a product, we can get that product,''      he said, referring to critical building components. ``People      know they will get paid. We don't cry wolf every day, but we      do cry wolf from time to time.''       Last, and sometimes of special importance, is for an owner      to be able to abandon an unsuccessful venture, as he did with      a portable-storage project he launched just before 9/11, even      though a stigma can be attached, Miller said.       ``If you're successful, everyone thinks you're a genius. If      you fail they think you're a schmuck,'' he said. ``Don't fall      in love with 'em. Drop 'em if it doesn't work. You have to be      a realist.''       Regardless of the situation, Miller encourages other      business owners to give back. He likes to quote fellow      Vermont philanthropist J. Warren McClure, who died in 2004:      ``If you can't give a dollar, you'll never give a hundred.''       ``Give what you can,'' Miller said. ``We have an      obligation. There are many, many, many needs. And you can      have a lot of fun doing it.''                          ____________________
