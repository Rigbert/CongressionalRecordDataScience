Mr Speaker, I have, somewhat famously, opposed H.R. 1472, a bill which attempts to single out bears as a species to be managed by the House of Representatives instead of local wildlife experts. I believe this bill is a ``one size fits all'' attempt at government, inappropriately taking local control away and nullifying local expertise. I am not alone on my position against this bill. I would therefore like to submit for the Record the following letter from the National Rifle Association, which explains their opposition to the bill as well.                                                        June 2003.       Dear Representative: As the leading voice for millions of      American gun-owners and hunters, the National Rifle      Association wishes to advise you of our opposition to H.R.      1472, the ``Don't Feed the Bears Act of 2003.'' This      legislation would prohibit the use of bait in bear hunting on      all federal lands.       Although H.R. 1472 addresses one method of bear hunting,      the real issue here is about who manages resident wildlife.      H.R. 1472 opens the door to federal preemption of the rights      of the fifty states to manage resident wildlife, including      establishing the means and methods of hunting in a safe and      ethical manner. The NRA is unalterably opposed to such      federal infringement.       Congress has passed legislation giving the Federal      government management authority over certain categories of      wildlife which it felt required a national focus: migratory      birds, marine mammals, and endangered and threatened species.      At no time in its history has Congress selected an individual      species for federal management. H.R. 1472 sets this unwise      precedent.       This legislation is being advocated by organizations      opposed to all methods of hunting, not just the use of bait      in bear hunting.     Nothing could better achieve their goal of ending hunting in      the United States than a bill that federalizes wildlife      management. Rather than having to promote their views in each      of the fifty states, the anti-hunting community is seeking to      have Congress preempt the field.       Those states that allow the use of bait in hunting do so      because they have concluded that it is a humane method of      hunting, that it meets the ethical standard of ``fair      chase,'' and that it is a necessary tool for management of      their bear populations. H.R. 1472 places Congress in the      position of being a wildlife biologist, making decisions for      states on how certain wildlife populations must be managed.      If Congress were to adopt this legislation, it would be      placing itself in the position of having to address every      issue pertaining to wildlife management, not just one method      of bear hunting.       The NRA strongly urges you to oppose H.R. 1472 because of      its attempt to preempt the authority of the states to manage      resident wildlife. If you are a cosponsor of the bill, we      urge that you reconsider your support for it.       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this      important issue.           Sincerely,                                                 Chris W. Cox,                                               Executive Director,     NRA Institute for Legislative Action.                          ____________________
