 Although I may speak long, I speak seldom. But this is very important to me and to our country. I want to make sure, whether people agree or disagree with my proposal, they understand it. And if they disagree, they know why they disagree. A lot are agreeing.  Here is the deal. There are two alternatives we have now been offered. One side says we are going to keep things from getting worse, where we have no strategy to make them better. The other side of the equation says, things aren't going to get better so we better get our troops out of there as quick as we can. Neither speaks to what I think is our national interest and objective and they are dual: One, get the troops out as rapidly as we can and leave behind as stable and integrated country as possible. Because if we don't leave behind a stable government, we are going to do exactly what I predict is going to happen in Afghanistan. We are going to be back in Afghanistan. Read today's paper. My argument is, we should be sending more forces rather than less. Read the paper today. The paper today says our folks and the Afghanis and others say the Taliban is about to occupy again the Pashtun area, that the rural areas of southeastern Afghanistan are now controlled by the Taliban and al-Qaida.  Hear me. If they are controlled by the Taliban and al-Qaida, mark my words, that control will be consolidated because we left too soon, we don't have enough resources there, and we didn't finish the job. I don't want the same thing happening in Iraq. So just pulling troops out, which I would love to do, pulling them out and trading a dictator for chaos is no answer. Leaving them in without a plan to be able to bring them out with a country left behind is also not a plan.  Here is the deal, five pieces to my proposal, all contemplated by the present Constitution and all totally consistent with the establishment of an integrated government. The first part of that plan requires that there be strong central government control over revenues, border, natural resources, and distribution of them. As part of that, we would also do what the World Bank has done before: Have a World Bank committee overseeing the distribution of resources, which we have done in many countries, to guarantee transparency.  The second piece of this is a requirement that the Constitution be amended, or theoretically it could be done by the Parliament, where the Sunnis are guaranteed a portion of the oil revenues after the central government has paid all its bills, as the Kurds would be and as the Shia would be.  The third piece of this is, instead of doing what the administration has done, which is in this budget cut off more economic aid to Iraq--I find that amazing. We are ending economic aid, reconstruction aid in Iraq. What is the plan for this democracy? We should, in fact, continue economic aid to Iraq, which I am sure is hugely unpopular because it has been so badly spent so far, but require a fundamental change in the distribution of that aid away from megaprojects to small-bore projects. We should, at the same time in part 3, be calling upon our erstwhile partners who committed resources to Iraq to deliver them. And we should have an altar call for our Arab friends in the gulf who are making ExxonMobil look like a piker. They have plenty of money. And it is as much in their interest to see civil war not break out, as it is in ours.  All of that aid should be conditioned on one important thing: A guarantee of human rights and women's rights. People say: Biden, we know you wrote the Violence Against Women Act. What is the deal here? The reason is not only is it morally the right thing to do, it is essential for there to be any prospect of a democratic Iraq emerging in the future, essential that women have rights and are protected. And the condition upon the aid should be the guarantee and ability to oversee not abusing the rights of women in their laws, in their provinces, similar to our States, similar to the State of Delaware, the State of Mississippi, as well as the fact that overall human rights be something that is transparent.  The fourth piece of this plan calls for what I have been calling for, for 2 years, I admit. Dr. Kissinger has been calling for it for a year and three-quarters, Secretary Shultz has been calling for it. Secretary Powell is calling for it. We need a regional conference. We need to get all of Iraq's neighbors, such as we did in Afghanistan, get all of Iraq's neighbors to essentially enter into an agreement not to meddle in Iraq's affairs. People ask: Why would they do that? Why would Iran do that, why would Turkey do that, why would the Arab neighbors do that? A simple reason: The last thing any of them want is a civil war.  They say the Iranians might want a civil war. No. What the Iranians want is what they have. What they have now is Americans being bled financially and physically, with 10 or 12 divisions tied down. That is what the Iranians want.  What they don't want is a civil war. You ask why? In Tehran, the Government of Tehran and the clerics know that 75 to 80 percent of their constituency hates them. They know they are incredibly unpopular. You are sitting on top of an unpopular government, knowing that there is not enough energy for there to be another revolt, another revolution among the people. Do you want 17 million of your Shia Arab brothers--and don't forget the Iranians are not Arab, they are Indo-European, they are Persian--do you want 17 million of your Shia Arab brothers learning how to fight and learning how to muster their physical capability perhaps for the next year on your border while they are engaging with 60 million of your Shia citizens who don't like you? I guarantee you, the answer is ``no.'' They don't want that.  The Turks don't want a civil war. Civil war means the Kurds are going to go their own way. The last thing the Turks want is the Kurds going their own way. And for Lord's sake, the Arab Gulf States don't want a civil war because they then begin to count their days. So it is in everyone's interest.  How do you get this regional conference? I believe we can and I am confident we will. Get the P5, the permanent 5 of the Security Council to laydown the parameters for a regional conference, get a U.N. Security Council resolution passed calling for a regional conference on Iraq and nonintervention. And then do what I have been calling for for 2 years, set up a contact group made up of the regional and world powers who will essentially police the deal--not send troops into Iraq, police the deal--so that all those who sign on in the region do not interfere and observe they are not interfering.  The fifth piece of my plan calls for a date to be announced, that by the end of 2008, the majority of American forces will be redeployed. There are two reasons for that. To give the U.S. military certainty, to give them certainty to plan, for there is no possibility of them pulling American forces out in 6 months or 8 months. I am not going to presume to tell the military how long an orderly change in our presence in Iraq would take and when it should take place. If it occurs sooner, all the better.  But the second reason to state it is to let the Iraqis know, as Democrats and Republicans and the President himself have acknowledged, that as long as they think we are there forever, they are not about to step up to the ball to make the hard decisions.  So I believe the only reasonable prospect of holding Iraq together, to avoid partitioning, which could be a disaster, is to give the region breathing room and incentive to stay in the deal.  I hope over time this will get a closer look. As Dr. Kissinger said, and I spoke with him and Vice President Cheney in Philadelphia at the World Affairs Council, when they asked Dr. Kissinger, after my speech along these lines, what he thought, he said he thought the plan warranted very close scrutiny. When I laid it out to Ash Carter, he thought the plan was a good plan. When I laid it out to other people, including former Republican and Democratic members of the foreign policy establishment, it went from: Joe, is this partitioning? and once explained that it wasn't, to not a bad idea, to fully embracing the idea.  This is going to take a while. I remember when I came to this floor in the early 1990s and to the shock and dismay of my colleagues called for us lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnians and calling for air strikes against the Serbs. My colleagues thought that was crazy.  I remember when I came back again, after meeting with Milosevic and him having told people in a private meeting that when he asked me what I thought about him, I told him I thought he was a war criminal and I would spend my career seeing that he was tried as one, my colleagues thought it didn't make sense. It took 3 years to convince the administration we should move. It takes time. But they did move. We didn't lose an American force. We stopped a genocide. We stopped the dismantling of an entire region of the world, and we saved the lives of at least a quarter of a million people.  We can do that again. Don't expect everyone to embrace this plan. I realize it is strategically pretty broad. I realize it takes time to digest. My fervent prayer is, I would love it if 6 months from now, what I proposed proves not to be necessary because the Iraqis have embraced and rallied around this new government, that the insurgency is stopped, that we have not had continued ethnic cleansing, and that there is a unified central government as is. I would be delighted, delighted to stand on the floor and have people say: Told you, Joe. You didn't need the scheme you laid out.  I pray God that is true. But I respectfully suggest to you it is not likely to be true. We better have a plan B for pulling out American troops precipitously without a plan, for keeping them in without a plan is a disaster either way you look at it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech I delivered earlier this week at the World Affairs Council be printed in the Record.    The Way Forward in Iraq: Avoiding Partition, Preserving Unity,                      Protecting America's Interests       It's an honor to be back at the Philadelphia World Affairs      Council.       First, let me apologize to those of you confused by the      schedule. It shows me speaking this afternoon. Instead, you      get me to start your day. Look at it this way: things can      only get better. And they will, because I understand that      Vice President Cheney and Secretary Kissinger will be here      for lunch.       I'd like to focus on an issue that weighs heavily on our      national consciousness--Iraq.       I start from this hard truth: President Bush does not have      a strategy for victory in Iraq. His strategy is to prevent      defeat and to hand the problem off to his successor.      Meanwhile, the frustration of Americans is mounting so fast      that Congress might end up mandating a rapid withdrawal, even      at the risk of trading a dictator for chaos, and a civil war      that could become a regional war.       Both are bad alternatives.       Today, I will argue for a third way that can bring our      troops home, protect our fundamental security interests, and      preserve Iraq as a unified country.       I developed this plan with Les Gelb, the president emeritus      of the Council on Foreign Relations. It recognizes this new,      central reality in Iraq: a rising tide of sectarian violence      is the biggest threat to Iraq's future and to America's      interests. It is premised on the proposition that the only      way to hold Iraq together, and to create the conditions for      our troops to responsibly withdraw, is to give Shiites,      Sunnis, and Kurds room to breath in their own regions.       Let me tell you what our plan is not: it is not partition.      Let me tell you what our plan is: It is consistent with      Iraq's constitution. It is consistent with the new unity      government. And it is consistent with--in fact, it is      necessary to--the goal of keeping Iraq unified within its      existing borders and not a threat to its own people, its      neighbors, or to us.       I'd like to share the details of our plan with you.                         The Current Situation       I was last in Baghdad on December 15th to observe the      elections. It was my sixth trip to Iraq. It was incredibly      moving to see Iraqis go to the polls.       I came back with a finger stained purple from the polling      ink. But I also returned with this warning: we must not, yet      again, prematurely declare, ``Mission Accomplished.'' Yes,      Iraqis voted by the millions, but who did they vote for?      Ninety percent cast their ballots for sectarian and ethnic      parties. Far from a democratic turning point, the elections      reflected Iraq's deepening fault-lines.       Here's where we are in Iraq: we can't lose on the      battlefield and the insurgents can't win as long as enough      U.S. troops remain. But, as both our Ambassador and our top      general in Iraq acknowledge, violence between the Shi'a and      Sunnis has surpassed the insurgency as the main security      threat. It is driving the country toward chaos and civil war.       Simply put, the sectarian genie is out of the bottle.      Ethnic militias increasingly are the law in large parts of      Iraq. They have infiltrated the official security forces.      Sectarian cleansing has begun in mixed areas, with tens of      thousands of Iraqis fleeing their homes in recent weeks.      Dozens of dead bodies turn up daily in Baghdad.       Meanwhile, Iraqis have less electricity, clean water,      sewage treatment and oil than before the war. Iraq's      government ministries are barely functional. Iraq looks more      like a failing state, not an emerging democracy.       There is no purely military answer to this slow but certain      downward spiral. With more troops and the right strategy, we      might have stopped the insurgency. But no number of U.S.      troops will stop a civil war. To prevent it, we need a      political solution. The national unity government in which      the President has put so much stock is necessary, but it is      not enough. We have had ``unity'' governments for three years      in Iraq. Yet sectarian violence has escalated.       What the Iraqis need now--and what this plan proposes--is a      genuine political way forward that, like our own Articles of      Confederation, gives Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds the      confidence to pursue their interests peacefully in a unified      country. In fact, the central government this plan proposes      for Iraq would be even stronger than America's first      government. With time, we can hope they will come to their      own Philadelphia freedom.       At the same time, I believe we can't pull our forces out      precipitously, just as we can't keep them in Iraq      indefinitely. Withdrawing them too soon would open the door      to all out civil war that could turn into a regional war. It      also would leave parts of Iraq a haven for terrorists. That      would be disastrous for U.S. interests.       What our troops deserve--and what this plan proposes--is a      clear target date for redeployment that, coupled with a      political settlement, will allow us to leave Iraq with our      basic interests intact.                       A Five Point Plan for Iraq       Ten years ago, Bosnia was drowning in ethnic cleansing and      facing its demise as a unified state. After much hesitation,      the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton      Accords to keep the country whole by dividing it into ethnic      federations. We even allowed Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs to      retain separate armies. With the help of U.S. troops and      others, Bosnians have lived a decade in peace. Now, they are      strengthening their common central government, and disbanding      their separate armies.       The Bush Administration, despite its profound strategic      misjudgments, has a similar opportunity in Iraq.       The idea is to maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it      and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis the room to run their      own affairs. The central government would be left in charge      of common interests. We would encourage Iraqis to accept this      formula with major sweeteners for the Sunnis, a military     plan for withdrawing and redeploying U.S. forces, and a      regional non-aggression pact. The plan has five elements:     1. One Iraq With Three Regions       The first element is to establish three largely autonomous      regions with a viable but limited central government in      Baghdad.       The central government would be responsible for border      defense, foreign policy, oil production and revenues. The      regional governments--Kurd, Sunni and Shiite--would be      responsible for administering their own regions.       The United States shouldn't impose this solution and we      don't have to because federalism is already written into      Iraq's constitution. In fact, the constitution creates a      limited central government and establishes a procedure for      provinces combining into regions.       Increasingly, each community will support federalism, if      only as a last resort. Until recently, the Sunnis sought a      strong central government because they believed they would      retake power. Now, they are beginning to recognize that they      won't. Their growing fear is Shi'a power in a highly      centralized state, enforced by sectarian militia and death      squads. The Shi'a know that they can dominate the government,      but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds want to      consolidate their autonomy.       Some will ask whether this plan will lead to sectarian      cleansing. The answer is that it's already happening.      According to the Iraqi government, 90,000 people have fled      their homes since the February bombing of the Samarra mosque      for fear of sectarian reprisals. That's a rate of more than a      1,000 people a day. This does not include the tens of      thousands of educated Iraqis from the middle class who have      left the country.       We must build in protections to prevent more cleansing and      to improve security in the big cities, which the      Administration has failed to achieve. Baghdad would become a      federal zone, while densely-populated areas with mixed      populations would receive both multi-sectarian and      international police protection.       A global political settlement won't end the Sunni      insurgency, but it should help to undermine it. The Zarqawi      network would no longer have the sectarian card to play.      Sunni Nationalists and neo-Baathists would still be unhappy      but they would be easier to contain.       Similarly, while decentralization won't end the militia      problem overnight, it is the best way to begin rolling it      back. Right now, there is no plan to disband the militia.      Militias have so heavily infiltrated the security forces that      our training program is effectively making them better      killers. The regions can become magnets for the militia,      integrating them into local forces, and eventually into the      national force. Again, the constitution already provides for      security forces within the regions. There is nothing radical      in this proposal.       The Administration is focusing only on putting together a      unity government. But the ``unity'' government of the past      year wasn't able to govern or stop the violence. This one      offers little more promise. A much broader political      settlement that gives each community breathing space is the      best bet to prevent civil war and to keep Iraq intact.     2. A Viable Sunni Region With Shared Oil Revenues       The second element of the plan is to gain agreement for the      federal solution from the Sunni Arabs by giving them an offer      they can't reasonably refuse.       Basically, they get to run their own region. That's a far      better deal than the present alternatives: either being a      permanent minority in a centrally run government or being the      principal victims of a civil war.       As a major sweetener, we should press the Iraqis to write      into the constitution that the Sunnis would receive about 20      percent of all present and future oil revenues. That's      roughly proportional to their size. And it's far more than      they'd get otherwise, since the oil is in the north and      south, not the Sunni center. These revenues represent the      only way to make the Sunni region viable economically. If      Sunnis reject the deal, there is no guarantee they will get      any oil revenues.       The central government would set national oil policy and      distribute the revenues, which would reinforce each      community's interest in keeping Iraq intact. There would be      international supervision to ensure transparency.       Why would the Shiites and Kurds sign on? Petroleum experts      agree that the Iraqi oil industry will attract much more      desperately needed foreign capital if it is run as a unified      whole. Shiites and Kurds will get a slightly smaller piece of      a much larger pie. That's a better deal than they would get      by going it alone. Guaranteeing Sunnis a piece of this pie      will reduce the incentive of insurgents to attack the oil      infrastructure. That, too, would be good for everyone.     3. More Aid, But Tied To The Protection Of Minority And          Women's Rights       Third, instead of ending U.S. reconstruction assistance, as      the Bush Administration is doing, we should provide more. But      we should clearly condition aid on the protection of minority      and women's rights. The incompetence of the Bush      Administration's reconstruction program makes more      reconstruction money a hard sell. A new aid effort would have      to be radically different than the old one. For example,      instead of international mega-firms pocketing valuable      contracts, spending a huge chunk of each one on security, and      then falling short, Iraqis should be in the lead of small-     scale projects that deliver quick results.       The President also should insist that other countries make      good on old commitments, and provide new ones. He should      focus on the Gulf States. They're enjoying windfall oil      profits. They have a lot at stake in Iraq. They should step      up and give back.       But all future U.S. aid would be tied to the protection of      minority and women's rights, clearly and unambiguously. We      should insist other donors set the same standard. Aid would      be cut off in the face of a pattern of violations.       President Bush is now silent on protecting minority and      women's rights. If they are not upheld, there can be no hope      for eventual democracy in Iraq.     4. Maintain Iraq's Territorial Integrity And Engage Its          Neighbors       Fourth, this plan proposes that the United Nations convene      a regional security conference where Iraq's neighbors,      including Iran, pledge to respect Iraq's borders and work      cooperatively to implement this plan.       The neighbors may see decentralization as a plot to carve      up Iraq. But they have an equally strong interest in not      seeing Iraq descend into a civil war that could draw them      into a wider war. Engaging them directly can overcome their      suspicions and focus their efforts on stabilizing Iraq, not      undermining it.       The U.N. Security Council should precede the conference      with a call for the necessary declarations. The permanent      members of the Security Council should then sponsor and      participate in the conference to show a united international      front.       After the conference, Iraq's neighbors will still be      tempted to interfere in its weakened affairs. We need an on-     going mechanism to keep them in line. For two years, I've      called for a standing Contact Group, to include the major      powers, that would engage the neighbors and lean on them to      comply with the deal. I'm not alone. Former Secretaries of      State Kissinger, Shultz, and Powell have all called for the      same thing.       President Bush's failure to move on this front is      inexplicable. There will be no lasting peace in Iraq without      the support of its neighbors.     5. A Responsible U.S. Drawdown And A Residual Force       Fifth, the President should direct U.S. military commanders      to develop a plan to withdraw and re-deploy almost all U.S.      forces from Iraq by 2008. If the military can do it sooner      without precipitating a meltdown, so much the better.      Regardless, the President should make it clear that the      direction we're heading in is out, and no later than 2008.       We would maintain in or near Iraq a small residual force--     perhaps 20,000 troops--to strike any concentration of      terrorists, help keep Iraq's neighbors honest, and train its      security forces. Some U.S. troops and police would also need      to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force deployed      to the major multi-sectarian cities, as in the Balkans. Such      a force is now a non-starter with other countries, despite      their own interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq and the region.      But a political settlement, and their role in helping to      bring it about through a regional conference and Contact      Group, could change their calculus and willingness to      participate.       Right now, our troops are still necessary to prevent total      chaos. But unless the Iraqis see and believe we are leaving,      they will have little incentive to shape up. Redeployment is      also necessary because we can't sustain this large a force in      Iraq without sending troops back on fourth and fifth tours,      extending deployments, and fully mobilizing the Guard. That      would do serious long-term damage to our military.       A clear plan also would end the fiction the President keeps      repeating of a ``conditions based draw down.'' What      conditions justify the draw down of 30,000 troops since the      December elections? The situation has gotten worse.       President Bush's refusal to give clear direction leaves our      military unable to plan an orderly draw down. It also leaves      our troops, the Iraqis and the American people in the dark.      It's time to end the guessing. It's time for clarity, but      clarity with responsibility. Redeploying our troops over 18      months will allow the political settlement I've proposed to      take hold and prevent all-out civil war.                        Redeeming Our Sacrifice       This plan for Iraq has its own risks. But this      Administration has left us with nothing but hard choices.       The choice I'm proposing may be the only way left to keep      Iraq intact and allow our troops to come home with our      fundamental security interests intact.       The choice I'm proposing can give all of us--Republicans,      Independents, Democrats, Americans--realistic hope that our      sacrifices in Iraq were not in vain.       Thanks for listening.
