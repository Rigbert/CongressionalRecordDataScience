 President, I rise in support of S. 1399, a bill I am happy to cosponsor with Senator Harkin, to name the post office in Glenwood, IA, the William J. Scherle Post Office Building. Former Congressman Bill Scherle served in the U.S. House of Representatives for four terms, from 1967-1975. Before that, we served together in the Iowa House of Representatives. Bill Scherle is originally from New York State, so he was not born an Iowan, but you would never know it. He acclimated well to Iowa, living on a farm near the small southwestern Iowa town of Henderson. Bill is a farmer through and through. He was a plainspoken conservative voice in Congress and he represented his largely rural western Iowa district well. He then went on to serve his country in the Department of Agriculture. Bill Scherle has given a good portion of his life to public service and it is fitting that a post office near his home be named in his honor. In fact, Bill Scherle's legacy as a public servant is demonstrated by the fact that this bill to honor him is a bipartisan initiative. Both Senator Harkin and I recognize the contribution made by Bill Scherle to Iowa and to the United States. I was very sorry when I recently learned that Bill is in poor health. I wish him the best and my prayers are with him and his family. I am glad that we have this opportunity now to recognize Bill and his service to his State and his Nation. I would like to thank Chairman Collins for her help in allowing this bill to be moved quickly through the Government Affairs Committee and the Senate. I know that Congressman King, who follows in Congressman Scherle's footsteps, has sponsored a similar measure in the House with the support of others from the Iowa delegation. Those who know Bill Scherle or know of his legacy understand why this honor is so appropriate and I hope this bill can be enacted very soon.
