As noted in the school's history, ``While the world has changed dramatically since the founding of our School in 1884, essential characteristics of our school have remained constant.''  Since it's founding in 1884, Maumee Valley has seen itself as ``a warm, family-centered, comfortable environment that encourages passion and creativity in our exceptional student body.'' The school is built on the foundation of a visionary board, supportive parents, and the dedication and commitment of our talented faculty and staff, and has never lost focus on its core purpose, to provide the best educational opportunities for its students.   Maumee Valley Country Day School's original school was on North Summit Street in downtown Toledo and known as the Smead School for Girls. The school soon moved to the Judge John Fitch Homestead in Toledo's Old West End. The current school's Smead building was completed in 1934. Beginning in the 1950s, the school saw increasing construction and expansion to its present day. Now in the 21st Century, Maumee Valley embarks on new transformations to further develop education in the new century.   Maumee Valley Country Day School's mission is ``to enable students to become enlightened, compassionate and contributing citizens of our global community, while preparing graduates for their best opportunities in higher education.'' Over three centuries, the school and its leadership, parents and students, have carried forth this mission. As they pause to mark this milestone 125th year celebration, I join the school families past and present in looking toward a bright future.                          ____________________
