 President, on an entirely different matter, yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with some of our Nation's heroes. These men and women are taking part in Warrior Games 2015, an annual DOD-organized sporting event for both veterans and wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers from every corner of the country. This year's games featured approximately 250 athletes from the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Marine Corps. All of these wounded warriors gave it their all in heated competition. Their bravery and their perseverance through adversity serve as a source of inspiration to the rest of us. Their determination serves as a continuing reminder that heroism endures long after events on the battlefield.  It was a great honor to meet some of these courageous athletes and their families yesterday afternoon. They were here in the Capitol. I shared the thanks of a grateful nation with many men and women who wear our Nation's uniform or who recently have. I shared my personal gratitude as well, because their heroism and their sacrifice represent an enduring source of freedom for every other American.  I hope they never forget it. I hope they are reminded when looking out to cheering crowds on the field, because America won't forget what the men and women who stood in our defense have given all of us for our freedom.  So let us hope that our Nation will always find brave warriors like them.                          ____________________
