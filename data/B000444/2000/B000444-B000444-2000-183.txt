 President, I will respond.  What the Senator has written in the legislation I would characterize as having tried to do something after the horse is out of the barn.  Here is the deal. I am not suggesting there will be any hostilities before the U.S. forces leave. I am not suggesting there will be hostilities as the U.S. forces leave. If I were Milosevic, the KLA, or anybody else, I would have garlands and roses strewn along the road as they were on their way out. I would be throwing them bouquets. I would be giving them chocolates andcigarettes as they left. I would not do a thing. I would wait until they were gone. That is No. 1.  No. 2, when they go, I predict to you that you will see in the councils of Europe an overwhelming discussion about whether or not the Europeans will stay, and in what numbers.  At that point, if there is hostility, if Mr. Milosevic moves on Mitrovica to annex the top of the state, or if there is a movement in Montenegro to topple the Government, is the Senator saying to me that automatically authorizes the President of the United States to send whatever forces he wishes back in?
