President, I am going to make a unanimous-consent request, I notify my colleague from Louisiana. This unanimous-consent request will extend and reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program, the reason he came to the floor. It includes the provisions that are also part of the earlier discussion about the extenders package. It is a lengthy list and many of these are traditional annual reauthorizations of a number of provisions in the Tax Code that encourage research and development, the development of biofuels, and that sort of thing.  It also includes, for the record, $33.7 billion in emergency spending to extend unemployment compensation benefits to the end of the year. It would help 10,700 residents of the State of Louisiana who currently are being cut off from unemployment compensation. It includes $16 billion, paid for, that is going to be given to the States to help them deal with the costs of Medicaid in this recession. It has the provision in there for the so-called Medicare doc fix and a number of other provisions.  I am going to give the Senator from Louisiana an opportunity to extend the National Flood Insurance Program by agreeing to the following unanimous consent:  I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay before the Senate the Message from the House on H.R. 4213, the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act; that the Senate move to concur with the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 4213 with the Baucus amendment No. 4386; that the motion to concur with an amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
