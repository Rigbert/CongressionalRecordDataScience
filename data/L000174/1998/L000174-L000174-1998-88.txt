President, on April 2, 1998, in a statement I made on the Senate floor, I attributed the creation of the Dodge Development Center and Veterans Assistance Office in Rutland, Vermont to Chapter One of the Vietnam Veterans Association, also located in Rutland. I need to clarify for the record that, although some of the early members of VVA Chapter One were part of the very early stages of the idea, VVA, Chapter One was not responsible for the development, founding, or creation of the center.  Years of hard work went into organizing community involvement, volunteer labor and donations, fundraising, remodeling, and furnishing that has resulted in the establishment of the only homeless shelter just for veterans in Vermont--the Dodge Development Center. I want to congratulate the people primarily responsible for this accomplishment. They are: Robert Rummel, Paul Albro, Cynthia Turrell-Burns, Peggy Gibbud, Jeff Hatch, Clark Howland, Gene Miner, Tom Neary, Lance Warner, and Tim Beebe. There were also dozens of volunteers and community members who helped them make this dream come true.  I thank them for their persistence. They have worked through many funding and permitting hurdles over the years. On Veteran's Day this year, they will dedicate the center and open the doors of the shelter to homeless veterans. Again, I want to congratulate them and thank them for their determination.                          ____________________
