 President, if I might add something, this is a classic example of the Senate at its best. It is a significant bipartisan measure put together, as the majority leader indicated, with leadership on his side of the aisle and on our side by Senators Alexander, Domenici, and Stevens. This is a significant piece of legislation that wehope to be able to move in the very near future.
