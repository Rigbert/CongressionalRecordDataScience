 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian. Ms. Ione Duke of Morgantown, KY, gives fully and wholeheartedly of herself to her church [[Page S1963]] and community. She deserves to be recognized for her many contributions as she turns 90 years young.  Ms. Duke joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1915. For the past 79 years Ms. Duke has devoted much of her time to religious service throughout western Kentucky. Among her accomplishments are serving as the first president of the Local Missionary Society and Organization, her appointment by the Bowling Green district as the Rural Woman of Kentucky, and presiding as the church choir director and pianist from her youth until 1980.  Ms. Duke's musical talent allowed her to pursue a career in teaching public school music and directing high school choir in several schools throughout Butler County. Ms. Duke has also directed countywide cantatas that encompassed a group of singers from all denominations.  Ms. Duke has been actively involved in many civic organizations. She is a member of the Historical Society of both Butler and Ohio Counties. She was involved in the Women's Civic League. She has contributed her energy and talents to many other organizations and projects in which she volunteered tirelessly.  Mr. President, Ms. Duke's church and community should be very pleased to have such an outstanding member. Her community owes her a debt of gratitude and I feel that she deserves much recognition for her accomplishments and contributions. It is impossible to list everything Ms. Duke has done to make western Kentucky a better place, but she is truly an outstanding person and I extend to her my congratulations on her many accomplishments.                          ____________________
