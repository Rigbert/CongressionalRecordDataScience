When we try to use the argument you are not going to be able to get the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs to agree, if they don't agree, I don't want to invoke this.  I will say, yes, that is the intent and the letter of this amendment. It is very simple, and I can't imagine anyone will want to go on record saying that we want to stop the use of any kind of landmines if it is not in the best interest of our fighting troops over there as certified by the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs.
