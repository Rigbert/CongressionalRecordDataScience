Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2660 has been introduced by our distinguished colleague from Louisiana, Jim McCrery. This is a noncontroversial bill that simply increases the amount of the authorization level for the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge.  It is my understanding that there is interest in expanding the boundaries of this refuge, but these efforts are constrained by the provisions of Public Law 96-285 that legislatively created the refuge.  H.R. 2660 will increase from $10 million to $20 million the amount of funds that may be appropriated to the Department of the Interior, and it makes those funds available as of October 1 last year. These modifications are necessary because the cost of acquiring certain lands for inclusion in the Refuge were more expensive than anticipated.  Finally, the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge had been deemed critical habitat for the threatened Louisiana black bear and the river is the only major waterway in the Louisiana delta that has not been extensively altered by channelization.  Congressman Jim McCrery has made a persuasive case, and I compliment him for his outstanding leadership on this legislation. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 2660.
