President, so let me read then what we have here. It says, ``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act may be made available to pay any voluntary contribution of the United States to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies (including United Nations Development Program),'' and on and on. ``If''--and what triggers this, among other things--``if the United Nations * * * borrows funds from any international financial institution,'' which would include the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and others as listed, the International Monetary Fund, and so on.  Under that, unless some waiver is given, we would be precluded from contributions to UNICEF, International Atomic Energy Agency, World Food Program, and any of these others. I do not know how one could read it otherwise.
