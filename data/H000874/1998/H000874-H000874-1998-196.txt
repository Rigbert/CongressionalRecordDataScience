Speaker, I thank the former page from Arizona for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I was never a page, but I had the opportunity, as I have told page classes in the past, as President of the Maryland Senate, to run the page program in the Maryland Senate for four years. It was, like the page program we have here, an extraordinary, unique education for a very select group of young people, a group of young people who had an experience, as you have had, like a very, very, very small percentage of their age group have.  We talk about the future being up to you. The gentleman from Michigan (Dale Kildee), who has done so much for the page program over the years, talked about Franklin Roosevelt's observation about some generations being given much, and some generations having much expected of them.  In my opinion, all generations through the ages of pages ought to have a lot expected of them, and we expect a lot of you. We expect a lot of you because you are outstanding members of your generation. Unlike some other outstanding members of your generation, you have had an experience that they will not have. You have had the opportunity to be present firsthand in the body that is looked to throughout the world by the billions of people who live on our planet as the center of democracy, as the center of a successful effort for people to come together and peacefully resolve differences.  During the course of your being a page here and your very outstanding service to not just us as individual Members of Congress but to this institution and to the people of America, you have had the opportunity to see some pretty animated debate. You have seen some of us get, I would say, angry at some times at one another. Duke Cunningham has gotten angry from time to time, and I have gotten angry from time to time. But then you saw a Duke Cunningham and a Steny Hoyer come together as friends, honored by their neighbors in being elected to this House, knowing full well that we are all Americans, and though we are animated in debate, it is really that on which we agree that is most important. You have had that opportunity.                              {time}  1515  There is a lot of cynicism in America among some people about their Democratic institutions, and that is not helpful in a democracy. We need to have citizens have confidence in their democracy, in their institutions of government, and particularly in this House and the Senate just down the hall, because that is the way we resolve our differences and make progress as a democracy, a model for the world.  You, with your special knowledge, can educate your generation to the substance of what their democracy is all about as represented here in the people's House. I am always pleased.  I thank my friend, the gentleman from California, and my friend, the gentleman from Arizona, for allowing me to participate in this farewell. But it is not farewell. Obviously the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) is here, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) is here, and you may be here for years to come in various capacities.  But thank you. Thank you for taking the time to expend the effort to learn, to participate, to contribute to making this House and this country a better place. You are richer for it. We are richer for your service. I hope that you will go back to your respective communities and your families and your schools and talk to your friends, educate them further, and make our democracy better. Congratulations to all of you. Godspeed.
