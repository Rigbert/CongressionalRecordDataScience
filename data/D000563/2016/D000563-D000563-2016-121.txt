President, I would like to address the issue just raised by the Senator from Massachusetts and responded to by the Senator from Texas.  The Senator from Massachusetts carefully avoided mentioning the obvious. This is the same Republican majority that will not fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. For the first moment in the history of the United States--in the history of the United States--we have a Presidential nominee sent to fill the vacancy of the late Justice Scalia, and the Republicans in the Senate refuse to give him a hearing or a vote. That has never--underline the word ``never''--happened in the history of the United States of America. When we say do your job, it starts at the highest Court and goes straight down to every Federal court in America.  I sit on the Judiciary Committee, and what I think is particularly galling, troubling, and worrisome is that each one of these nominees has been carefully vetted by the Department of Justice, by the FBI, by Republican staffers--everyone imaginable--culling through every aspect of their life to see if they are truly worthy of being a lifetime appointee to the Federal bench, and they all passed the test. They were all voted out of committee, and they all languish on the floor of the Senate for the very reason the Senator mentioned.  The Senator from Texas and many others are lying awake at night praying for the moment when President Donald Trump can pick Federal judges in America. Unless Judge Judy is coming out of retirement, I have no idea where he is going to turn to find judicial talent, but I will tell you, we have judicial talent, approved by Democrats and Republicans, languishing on this calendar at great personal expense.  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for raising this issue.                           Zika Virus Funding  Mr. President, I would like to also comment on the Zika virus and the threat to the United States. You bet it is serious. We have seen the photographs that have been displayed here of the children who are born with serious birth defects because of the Zika virus.  It is so serious the President of the United States notified this Senate in February--February of this year--to act immediately on providing $1.9 billion--$1.9 billion--to protect as many people as possible from the spread of this virus and the terrible effects it has. The President asked for $1.9 billion not only to deal with the mosquitoes and the infection but also to develop a vaccine so we can liberate America from the concern of this virus showing up next year and the year after.  So there was a $1.9 billion request in February. To date--to date--the Republican leadership in the House and Senate have failed to produce the $1.9 billion that was suggested by the President.  We had a compromise number of $1.1 billion that was approved by the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote almost a month ago. I think there were 87 Senators who voted for it because we all understand it is a public health emergency. Well, in our bicameral system, the bill then went over to the House of Representatives. What happened next tells the story of what is wrong with the Republican-controlled Senate today. They took our bipartisan bill for $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, they put it in a conference committee, they held a meeting but didn't invite any Democrats, and they then came up with a bill that provided $1.1 billion, but listen to how they did it.  They took money away from fighting the Ebola virus in Africa, which we feared several years ago would spread to the United States and still is a threat to Africa and to many other people. They took the public health money to fight the Ebola virus and said: We will transfer it over, and you can fight the Zika virus.  Apparently, the Republicans believe we can only fight one public health challenge at a time. We don't have time for Ebola. We are going to move to Zika. The Centers for Disease Control--the preeminent agency in the world when it comes to fighting public health disasters--has warned us don't do this. We are still worried about the spread of Ebola and the danger of it.  But they didn't stop with that. They didn't stop with taking the Ebola money and putting it into the Zika virus. They then turned around and larded the bill up with every political ornament they could think of that would captivate the hearts of the rightwing. Listen to what they included in the bill. They included a provision that cut $500 million from the Veterans' Administration to process veterans' claims.  Have you heard of that issue? I sure have back in Illinois. Our veterans wait way too long to get the disability payments they deserve for having served our country. The Republicans cut $500 million from that effort, but they weren't finished. They then turned around and said: We want to make an exemption in the Clean Water Act so certain chemicals can be sprayed around water supplies. What has that got to do with this and why do we need to do it at this moment? It is one thing they have been longing for. The third thing they turned around and did, after they cut the money from the VA and after they made this provision to change what the EPA can regulate and, as I mentioned earlier, took the money out of Ebola--they then moved on to say: We know that women across America will be concerned about family planning because of the threat of the Zika virus so they put language in the bill prohibiting Planned Parenthood from providing family planning to those who are concerned about the spread of the Zika virus. They just can't stay away from Planned Parenthood, and they included it.  And while you might think that was enough to make this the most controversial political bill to move from the House, they had one more trick up their sleeve--a provision to allow the display of Confederate flags in our veterans cemeteries--Confederate flags. Why?  Why would you take an important bill dealing with a public health crisis and lard it up with all of these miserable provisions that just excite the hearts of some political rightwingers? They did it because they were hoping we would stop the funding for the Zika virus. It is stopped now waiting for a clean bill. They know the President will never sign this bill as written.  If we would go back to the original bipartisan bill passed in the Senate, we would certainly get approval for it. That is why, I answer the Senator from Texas, we wait for the day when we can get back to bipartisanship on this important public health threat.  I see there are others seeking the floor. The last point I will make is that we are going to vote in a short period of time on this GMO legislation. I have a lengthy statement that I will put in the Record about my position, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the New England Journal of Medicine. This is an August 20, 2015, article from the New England Journal of Medicine entitled ``GMOs, Herbicides, and Public Health.'' It makes the point very directly that there has been no credible scientific evidence that GMO foods pose any danger to consumers who consume them. But there is a credible concern about the use of chemicals in theproduction of these GMO products and how they are being larded on these fields, creating real concern about the ultimate impact on public health by these agricultural chemicals and the runoff.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  GMOs, Herbicides, and Public Health      (By Philip J. Landrigan, M.D., and Charles Benbrook, Ph.D.)       Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not high on most      physicians' worry lists. If we think at all about      biotechnology, most of us probably focus on direct threats to      human health, such as prospects for converting pathogens to      biologic weapons or the implications of new technologies for      editing the human germline. But while those debates simmer,      the application of biotechnology to agriculture has been      rapid and aggressive. The vast majority of the corn and      soybeans grown in the United States are now genetically      engineered. Foods produced from GM crops have become      ubiquitous. And unlike regulatory bodies in 64 other      countries, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not      require labeling of GM foods.       Two recent developments are dramatically changing the GMO      landscape. First, there have been sharp increases in the      amounts and numbers of chemical herbicides applied to GM      crops, and still further increases--the largest in a      generation--are scheduled to occur in the next few years.      Second, the International Agency for Research on Cancer      (IARC) has classified glyphosate, the herbicide most widely      used on GM crops, as a ``probable human carcinogen'' and      classified a second herbicide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid      (2,4-D), as a ``possible human carcinogen.''       The application of genetic engineering to agriculture      builds on the ancient practice of selective breeding. But      unlike traditional selective breeding, genetic engineering      vastly expands the range of traits that can be moved into      plants and enables breeders to import DNA from virtually      anywhere in the biosphere. Depending on the traits selected,      genetically engineered crops can increase yields, thrive when      irrigated with salty water, or produce fruits and vegetables      resistant to mold and rot.       The National Academy of Sciences has twice reviewed the      safety of GM crops--in 2000 and 2004. Those reviews, which      focused almost entirely on the genetic aspects of      biotechnology, concluded that GM crops pose no unique hazards      to human health. They noted that genetic transformation has      the potential to produce unanticipated allergens or toxins      and might alter the nutritional quality of food. Both reports      recommended development of new risk-assessment tools and      postmarketing surveillance. Those recommendations have      largely gone unheeded.       Herbicide resistance is the main characteristic that the      biotechnology industry has chosen to introduce into plants.      Corn and soybeans with genetically engineered tolerance to      glyphosate (Roundup) were first introduced in the mid-1990s.      These ``Roundup-Read ``crops now account for more than 90% of      the corn and soybeans planted in the United States. Their      advantage, especially in the first years after introduction,      is that they greatly simplify weed management. Farmers can      spray herbicide both before and during the growing season,      leaving their crops unharmed.       But widespread adoption of herbicide-resistant crops has      led to overreliance on herbicides and, in particular, on      glyphosate. In the United States, glyphosate use has      increased by a factor of more than 250--from 0.4 million kg      in 1974 to 113 million kg in 2014. Global use has increased      by a factor of more than 10. Not surprisingly, glyphosate-     resistant weeds have emerged and are found today on nearly      100 million acres in 36 states. Fields must now be treated      with multiple herbicides, including 2,4-D, a component of the      Agent Orange defoliant used in the Vietnam War.       The first of the two developments that raise fresh concerns      about the safety of GM crops is a 2014 decision by the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to approve Enlist Duo,      a new combination herbicide comprising glyphosate plus 2,4-D.      Enlist Duo was formulated to combat herbicide resistance. It      will be marketed in tandem with newly approved seeds      genetically engineered to resist glyphosate, 2,4-D, and      multiple other herbicides. The EPA anticipates that a 3-to-7-     fold increase in 2,4-D use will result.       In our view, the science and the risk assessment supporting      the Enlist Duo decision are flawed. The science consisted      solely of toxicologic studies commissioned by the herbicide      manufacturers in the 1980s and 1990s and never published, not      an uncommon practice in U.S. pesticide regulation. These      studies predated current knowledge of low-dose, endocrine-     mediated, and epigenetic effects and were not designed to      detect them. The risk assessment gave little consideration to      potential health effects in infants and children, thus      contravening federal pesticide law. It failed to consider      ecologic impact, such as effects on the monarch butterfly and      other pollinators. It considered only pure glyphosate,      despite studies showing that formulated glyphosate that      contains surfactants and adjuvants is more toxic than the      pure compound.       The second new development is the determination by the IARC      in 2015 that glyphosate is a ``probable human carcinogen''      and 2,4-D a ``possible human carcinogen.'' These      classifications were based on comprehensive assessments of      the toxicologic and epidemiologic literature that linked both      herbicides to dose-related increases in malignant tumors at      multiple anatomical sites in animals and linked glyphosate to      an increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in humans.       These developments suggest that GM foods and the herbicides      applied to them may pose hazards to human health that were      not examined in previous assessments. We believe that the      time has therefore come to thoroughly reconsider all aspects      of the safety of plant biotechnology. The National Academy of      Sciences has convened a new committee to reassess the social,      economic, environmental, and human health effects of GM      crops. This development is welcome, but the committee's      report is not expected until at least 2016.       In the meantime, we offer two recommendations. First, we      believe the EPA should delay implementation of its decision      to permit use of Enlist Duo. This decision was made in haste.      It was based on poorly designed and outdated studies and on      an incomplete assessment of human exposure and environmental      effects. It would have benefited from deeper consideration of      independently funded studies published in the peer-reviewed      literature. And it preceded the recent IARC determinations on      glyphosate and 2,4-D. Second, the National Toxicology Program      should urgently assess the toxicology of pure glyphosate,      formulated glyphosate, and mixtures of glyphosate and other      herbicides.       Finally, we believe the time has come to revisit the United      States' reluctance to label GM foods. Labeling will deliver      multiple benefits. It is essential for tracking emergence of      novel food allergies and assessing effects of chemical      herbicides applied to GM crops. It would respect the wishes      of a growing number of consumers who insist they have a right      to know what foods they are buying and how they were      produced. And the argument that there is nothing new about      genetic rearrangement misses the point that GM crops are now      the agricultural products most heavily treated with      herbicides and that two of these herbicides may pose risks of      cancer. We hope, in light of this new information, that the      FDA will reconsider labeling of GM foods and couple it with      adequately funded, long-term postmarketing surveillance.
