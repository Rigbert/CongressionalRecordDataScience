President, I rise today to introduce the Congressional Responsibility for Immigration Act, a bill to deny fast-track procedures to trade agreements that include immigration provisions. We have witnessed outrage in both parties and in both houses of Congress to the inclusion of ``temporary entry'' provisions in the Free Trade Agreements (``FTAs''), with Chile and Singapore. Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, along with other concerned Members, have stated clearly that they never again want to see trade agreements that include immigration provisions. This bill will allow us to do more than rely on the vague assurances that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has offered in response to our strongly-held concerns--it will provide a major deterrent that should prevent this Administration and future Administrations from ignoring Congress' authority over immigration policy. I am pleased that Senator Feinstein--who has led the fight against the inclusions of immigration provisions in the Chile and Singapore agreements--Senator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy have joined me in introducing this bill.  This bill is simple and straightforward. It states that whenever the Senate considers legislation to implement a free trade agreement, any Senator could raise a point of order against the bill on the grounds that it includes an immigration provision. If the point of order were upheld, the bill would have to be considered under ordinary procedures, allowing us to amend it and strike provisions that violated our constitutional authority over immigration. Succeeding Administrations have told us for decades that they simply cannot pursue trade agreements without ``fast-track'' authority, and Congress has chosen to give that authority to the Executive Branch. Having surrendered some of our power, however, we must be all the more vigilant in ensuring that this surrender remains limited in scope.  It has been widely reported that the USTR considers the ``temporary entry'' provisions in the Chile and Singapore agreements to be models for future agreements. I have criticized those provisions because I share the concerns expressed by Senators Feinstein, Lindsey Graham, Sessions and others that the United States Trade Representative should not be in the business of amending domestic immigration laws, as these treaties do. The decision to include immigration provisions was not only unauthorized but also unnecessary to achieve the Administration's stated goals. Congress has already created the H-1B program, which allows foreign workers with specialized skills to work in the United States. That program was established after a lengthy process of public hearings, debate, and negotiation, and it has worked to help meet labor shortages and strengthen our economy. If the Administration feels that the program needs to be changed, or a new visa category created, it should have sought to do so through the ordinary legislative process.  By including immigration provisions in trade agreements, the Executive Branch not only usurps Congress' authority to create programs, but also to amend them if they prove to be unsuccessful. Any amendments that Congress makes to immigration policies that are made through trade agreements are subject to challenge as violations of those agreements. As a result, our hands are tied not just at the time of the negotiation, but for all future legislative activity as well. This is simply unacceptable--it was not the purpose of our trade agreements and it is neither a wise nor a constitutionally appropriate means of creating our immigration policy. We must pass this bill and restore our proper separation of powers.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1481       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Responsibility      for Immigration Act''.     SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON TRADE AUTHORITIES PROCEDURES.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, section 2103(b)(3) of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion      Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3803(b)(3)) and the      provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.      2191) (trade authorities procedures) shall not apply to any      bill implementing a trade agreement between the United States      and any other country, if the implementing bill contains any      provision relating to the immigration laws of the United      States or the entry of aliens.       (b) Point of Order in Senate.--       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering an      implementing bill, upon a point of order being made by any      Senator against any part of the implementing bill that      contains material in violation of subsection (a), and the      point of order is sustained by the Presiding Officer, the      Senate shall cease consideration of the implementing bill      under the procedures described in subsection (a).       (2) Waivers and appeals.--       (A) Waivers.--Before the Presiding Officer rules on a point      of order described in paragraph (1), any Senator may move to      waive the point of order and the motion to waive     shall not be subject to amendment. A point of order described      in paragraph (1) is waived only by the affirmative vote of a      majority of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn.       (B) Appeals.--After the Presiding Officer rules on a point      of order under this paragraph, any Senator may appeal the      ruling of the Presiding Officer on the point of order as it      applies to some or all of the provisions on which the      Presiding Officer ruled. A ruling of the Presiding Officer on      a point of order described in paragraph (1) is sustained      unless a majority of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen      and sworn, vote not to sustain the ruling.       (C) Debate.--Debate on a motion to waive under subparagraph      (A) or on an appeal of the ruling of the Presiding Officer      under subparagraph (B) shall be limited to 1 hour. The time      shall be equally divided between, and controlled by, the      Majority Leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate, or      their designees.                                 ______                                       By
