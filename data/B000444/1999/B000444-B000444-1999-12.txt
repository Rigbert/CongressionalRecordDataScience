 President, I rise today to salute four Delaware golfers who continue to make the citizens of my State proud.  Last June, Margaret Butler, Mary Kaczorowski, Joyce Ruddick and Alice Wooldridge played in and won theAmerican Cancer Society Golf Championship at Maple Dale Country Club in Dover, Delaware. They then advanced to the Mid-Atlantic Championship at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia and won the Delaware State Title in Division 3. And on December 3rd and 4th, they will be representing Delaware and looking to continue their winning ways at the P.G.A. West in LaQuinta, California.  Having talked with members of this foursome on a few occasions, it is clear to me that these women take their golf quite seriously. Together, they embody the spirit of competition and sportsmanship and are fine examples of personal achievement and Delaware pride. But most importantly, these women realize that their participation in this event helps to raise essential funding for cancer research and programs. Millions of Americans suffer from cancer-related illnesses, and events like these give us all hope for finding a cure.  While I acknowledge that I may be a bit biased in my viewpoint, I also know a group of champions when I see them. I, among many, believe that talent is often overrated and that character is the true determining factor for any success one has in life.  I have seen these women drive a golf ball and I can confidently say that both talent and character reign supreme for this team. It is therefore my pleasure to extend to them my deep expression of thanks for having represented Delaware so well this year and, as they prepare for their biggest challenge to date, to wish them continued success in the National tournament.  We in Delaware are very proud of these four women, and we will be rooting for them!                          ____________________
