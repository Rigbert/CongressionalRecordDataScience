Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Christine Kennedy, the Administrator and Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Mrs. Kennedy has served the House of Representatives with distinction since 1972. Unfortunately, Mrs. Kennedy will be retiring at the end of this year and will be starting a new and I am sure equally rewarding private life. I know that she is looking forward to spending more time with her daughter, Lauren.  I have known Chris since I came to Congress. Chris started her career with the Federal Government in 1972 as a clerk at NASA. She joined the staff of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in 1974 becoming the Administrator and Chief Clerk in 1995 of the Committee on Resources which was the successor Committee to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.  When I moved from the Chairmanship of the Committee on Resources to the Chairmanship of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I asked Chris to take the position of Administrator and Chief Clerk of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Thank goodness, she agreed to do so.  Chris is one of those people who often is unheralded and unseen but who is essential to the workings of this institution. She is one of the most organized and efficient people I know. You know that if Chris is on the job, the job will get done and will be done well. She is thorough and has a detailed knowledge of the procedures and processes that keep the Committee operating.  In addition, she is loyal and generous to her colleagues, her friends, and to myself and my wife, Lu. We have relied on her in so many ways over the years to insure that our work with Committee, including the many codels and field hearings conducted by the Committee have been done in full accordance with the Rules.  I want to express to her my deep appreciation for her hard work and for her support of my efforts as Chairman of two Committees. Without her efforts, our Committees would not have a record of accomplishment that is unmatched by any Committee.  I know that I speak for my wife, Lu and for the Members and Staff of the Committee and for the many friends that she has made as a member of this Congressional family in wishing her all the best and many years of happiness in her new life.  She will be missed in so many ways, but we expect that she will continue to be a member of our Congressional family in the years to come. Best wishes to a good friend and an outstanding staff member.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2150]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              ON THE RETIREMENT OF MRS.
