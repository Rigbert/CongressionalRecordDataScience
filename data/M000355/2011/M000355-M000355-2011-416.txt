 President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of an upstanding hero of the Commonwealth, the late Mr. James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham. A native of Somerset, KY, Mr. Eastham passed away peacefully on December 28, 2010. He was 87 years old.  Born in Pulaski County, KY, James not only served both his community and country selflessly, but touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of meeting him. His courageous and patriotic spirit led him to join the U.S. Marines Corps where he served as a staff sergeant and crew chief aboard a B-25 bomber, and in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater where he was awarded two Bronze Stars for duty at and during the Luzon and southern Philippine campaigns. He was also presented with the impressive award of the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a Bronze Star for his bravery during combat with the enemy.  After the war, James continued to serve his community as a regional salesman for Morton Salt Company, as a longstanding member of the Kiwanis Club and the Somerset Masonic Lodge No. 111, and as a member of the First Baptist Church where he taught Sunday school and served as a chair of a building committee for the church's new sanctuary. It was no surprise that James's conscientious and excellent character earned him a spot on the Somerset City Council for 18 years, where he played active roles in helping to establish the Somerset Community College and finding a location for what is now the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. It is evident that both his family and the people of his close-knit community respected and valued James's tireless dedication and steadfast leadership, as he will always be fondly remembered as a man who stood firm in his beliefs.  I could surely continue to praise the works and accomplishments of this brave and humble man, but I will simply ask that my colleagues join me in remembering a true gentleman who poured his heart into serving, protecting, and strengthening his family, his country, and the Commonwealth. My thoughts go out to his beloved wife, Virginia; his three children, Jimmy, Wayne, and Lisa; his sister Edna; his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and many other beloved friends and family members.  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about a contribution that was made in James's name to the Reid S. Jones Fund, a fund named in honor of his dear friend that helps veterans make educational advancements. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30, 2011]   Foundation Launches Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund With Contribution                     Honoring James ``Onion'' Eastham       The Jones Educational Foundation Inc., a 501(C)3 not-for-     profit corporation based in Somerset, has launched the Reid      S. Jones Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution made by Dr.      Sonya Jones honoring the late James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham.       According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO of The Jones      Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the      friendship between James ``Onion'' Eastham, a man who was      regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.       Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the      wars in which the United States has fought. The initial      donation honors veterans who served in the European and      Pacific theaters of World War II.       ``I had been thinking about the Foundation setting up a      fund for veterans in Dad's name ever since I made a donation      in his memory to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors      Memorial building at Union College,'' Mr. Jones said.       Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1959. He went on to do      graduate work in education at Eastern Kentucky University.       ``When Mr. Eastham passed away in late December, I knew it      was time,'' Dr. Jones added. ``Dad thought so much of his      friend that I felt he would want me to do something special      to honor Onion's memory.''       Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April 15, 2005)      entered the U.S. Army at a crucial point in the history of      World War II. he was stationed in Germany, and he fought in      the Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in what has been      called ``one of the bloodiest battles'' of World War II.       Conducted in the dense, mountainous region of Belgium, the      Battle of the Bulge was Adolf Hitler's last major offensive      against the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944, until      Jan. 25, 1945.       When he enlisted in the Army as a private, Reid Jones was      18 years of age. He married Elva Sears on Dec. 30, 1944,      shortly before shipping out to the European front. He was      promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and remained in      Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the      process of reconstruction.       James ``Onion'' Eastham (Sept. 22, 1923, to Dec. 28, 2010)      served in the Asiatic-Pacific theater where he was awarded      two bronze stars for duty at and during the Luzon and      Southern Philippine campaigns. He also received the      Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a bronze star for duty      involving combat with the enemy.       Reid Jones and Onion Eastham were ``two of a kind,'' said      Jimmy Eastham, son of the former Somerset City Council member      who served as staff sergeant and crew chief aboard a B-25      bomber in the United States Marine Corp.       Jones and Eastham both were salesmen after the war. Jones      worked for many years for Fram Corp. and Eastham for the      Morton     Salt Co. The two men liked to get together and engage in the      high art of Southern storytelling. Both formed strong      friendships with other men in the Somerset community.       ``Dad and Onion Eastham were part of a group of men who      convened initially at Dad's car lot out on East Mt. Vernon      Street, then at Dad's automotive parts store on Ogden Street      in the building now owned by Dr. Byron Owens,'' Dr. Jones      said.       ``After Dad retired from Fram, he devoted most of his time      to the automotive business and our family's rental      properties,'' Dr. Jones continued.       ``When Dad closed the automotive parts store housed in the      same building with Mother's antiques and collectibles, he and      his buddies met for coffee at the Sugar Shack over on the      strip,'' she said.       Meeting for coffee was part of their ``daily routine,''      said Jimmy Eastham.       From time to time, the group also included Bobby Claunch,      Howard Eastham, Ledger Howard, Penny Starnes, Don Stone, Jim      Williams and Bob Williams in addition to Reid Jones and Onion      Eastham.       Like his father, Jimmy Eastham served as a member of      Somerset City Council. He and the Eastham family have given      their enthusiastic endorsement to the Reid S. Memorial Fund      with Dr. Jones' cornerstone contribution in memory of James      ``Onion'' Eastham.       ``It is a good idea to establish the fund even if it      weren't done in the name of my father,'' Eastham said.       Both Reid Jones and James Eastham were ``very patriotic,''      according to Virginia Eastham, mother of Jimmy, Lisa (Bandy)      and Wayne Eastham.       When Reid Jones returned from the war, he worked first as a      teacher and principal in the Pulaski County and Somerset City      school systems. He is remembered, particularly by former      students at Shopville High School as a firm teacher who was      not afraid to exercise discipline when he thought it was      needed.       Later, in the 1960s, he joined Fram Corp., based in      Providence, RI, as a district sales manager. Frequently, he      was recognized for exceeding sales quotas. He was      instrumental in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts across the      southeastern United States.       Reid Jones was a 32nd degree Mason and a member of Oleika      Shriners Temple in Lexington. He served on the board of      directors of First United Methodist Church.       In addition to being an influential member of Somerset City      Council, James ``Onion'' Eastham was a member of the Somerset      Masonic Lodge #111 and a long-standing member of the Kiwanis      Club. He was also a member of First Baptist Church where he      taught Sunday school and served as chair of a building      committee for the church's new sanctuary.       As a member of Somerset City Council from 1964 to 1982,      Eastham played an active role in helping to establish      Somerset Community College and finding a location for what is      now Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. He considered running      for mayor, but his job as a regional salesman for Morton Salt      Co. created time constraints that caused him not to seek      office.       According to Clarence Love, city clerk during the years      Eastham served on council, ``he was very conscientious.'' In      Love's opinion, Eastham was an ``excellent councilman.''       Jimmy Eastham said he thought his father most likely would      be remembered most for ``standing for what he believed in.''       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund was established, first and      foremost, to help veterans with educational issues.       ``A veteran might return from Afghanistan ready to go to      law school and need some assistance,'' Dr. Jones said. ``Or,      a veteran might return and want to become a law enforcement      officer or a mechanic.''       As interest on the fund grows, money will be awarded to      veterans who demonstrate great potential for success in      professional and vocational arenas.       Primarily, the Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund intends to honor      ``the warrior spirit,'' Dr. Jones said, ``the spirit of      courage and bravery'' that has helped to keep the United      States free.       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund is now open for tax-     deductible contributions.
