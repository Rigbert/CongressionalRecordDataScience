 President, I appreciate the majority leader's call this morning. He basically covered the items he has gone over. We will be cooperating, to the maximum extent possible, to move forward with the work in the Senate. I, such as he, will have an opening statement as we begin this session shortly after the majority leader completes his statement.                          ____________________
