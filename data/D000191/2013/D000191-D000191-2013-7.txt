But you can get it in your imagination.  So let's deal with the real problems before us. If we are going to produce energy on Federal lands, make sure there is no real conflict. Let's keep the multiple use concept. I think most members of the public support that, not give oil and gas a predominant use. Let's also keep in mind that we have to look at alternative energy development on Federal lands so that we can deal with climate change, which some of us believe in.  This warmed-over leftover turkey proposal will pass the House, of course, but that will be the last that anyone hears of it. Happy Thanksgiving.
