President, today I am reintroducing the Librarian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Whitehouse, Durbin, Klobuchar, Smith, Cardin, and Van Hollen.  In 1989, a seven-year civil war broke out in Liberia that claimed the lives of over 200,000 people, displaced over half of the Liberian population, halted food production, and destroyed the country's infrastructure and economy. A second civil war then followed from 1999 to 2003, further destabilizing the country and creating more turmoil and hardship for its people.
