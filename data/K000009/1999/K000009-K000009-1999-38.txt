Hastert, and the majority leader of the other body, Mr. Lott, that is essentially disenfranchising the membership of this body with regard to one of the most important issues before us, and, that is, meeting the needs of rural America, the disaster affected regions of our country, our farmers, who are experiencing historically low prices and bad weather, sort of twin eviscerators, that we are witnessing the hemorrhaging of equity out of rural America.  For the record and for the American people and hopefully for my fellow Members, I come to the floor tonight to recount what has been happening here sort of below the surface where the press is generally not picking up on it.  Employing what certainly must be the most unusual committee process I have ever experienced in my 17 years here in the House, the Republican leadership of this House has basically taken the drafting authority of our appropriations agriculture subcommittee away from our membership. Last week, the Republican leadership of this House as well as the Senate subcommittee twice recessed our conference committee because they could not reach agreement on the Republican side of the aisle on at least three provisions relating to regional compacts regarding milk, sanctions on terrorist states, and the level of disaster assistance that is really necessary in our country to meet the needs of our farmers in rural communities coast to coast. Our subcommittee has not met since last Wednesday due to that disorganization. Then over the weekend and early this week, Speaker Hastert and Senator Lott, their offices began drafting something for floor action. That effort is now being circulated in the form of a committee report that a majority of House subcommittee Republicans thus far, as of 5 p.m. today, had refused to sign, and which no Democrat had seen at all, certainly not those of the subcommittee of jurisdiction where we have legal responsibility to meet our obligations to the American people.  The Republican leadership appears to be deal-making on such matters as mandatory price reporting, for example, to try to get a majority of the members on their side of the aisle to sign on to that report. The difficulty is that if that happens, let us say they make enough deals to bring that bill to the floor, that will be brought to the floor without our subcommittee membership in conference being allowed to amend and discuss under regular order as is required by the rules of this institution. Thus, Democrats for sure will not be able to offer amendments on such critical issues as the fairness and the adequacy of the formulas and the commodities and sectors to be covered in the bill, as well as the economic level of assistance and disaster assistance titles of the bill, which are extremely expensive and depending on how they are drafted benefit certain regions of the country and certain sectors more than others. We will not be able to deal with the sanctions issue, we will not be able to deal with many of the other titles of the bill that our members wanted a chance to discuss. We will only be left with the option on this floor of taking that report and being given a moment in time to vote to recommit it back to conference, which obviously has been recessed, if we do not like something that is in that report.  As of Tuesday at 5 o'clock, now it is 6:25 here in Washington, the minority membership of the committee does not have a copy of the working document, at a time when rural America is in crisis. I have really been working with the leadership on our side of the aisle and I have pleaded with the leadership on the other side of the aisle to let us go back to regular order.  This is wrong, this is not the way to run the Nation, and really what you find out is in the end that good government is good politics. If we use the full membership of this institution, if we each bring our experiences to the table, which is what a conference committee is supposed to be for, in the end we produce legislation that meets the needs of all corners and all quarters of our country. This is really the wrong way to do business.  Today we had to pass a continuing resolution to keep this institution and the country operating for the next 2 weeks in order that these respective bills might be finished. The Agriculture appropriation bill this year isone of the most important we will bring before this body. These procedures that have been used are completely atypical. I would beg the leadership to go back to regular order.                          ____________________
