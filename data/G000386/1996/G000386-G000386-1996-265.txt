 I am not going to send the amendment to the desk quite yet. Also, I inform the leadership on both sides of the aisle that I do not have any intention of speaking for an extra long period of time. But before I agree to a time limit, I want to make some opening remarks in regard to my amendment. After that, I will have an opportunity to sit down and probably work something out with the leadership on the time.  Mr. President, we are at a point in the defense authorization bill where I want to bring up the point that we ought to be saving some money in infrastructure costs, but we are not. We ought to be saving some money in infrastructure costs because it is just natural that infrastructure ought to be somewhat less as we downsize the military, both from the standpoint of personnel and from the standpoint of the number of bases we have, and a lot of other factors. The fact that we really are not, the point of my amendment is to drive that point home, but also to offer a plan that will allow us to guarantee that when we are told that money should be saved, that it is in fact saved.  We are in a situation here, Mr. President, where from a political standpoint we ought to have the votes to accomplish what I want to accomplish. I do not anticipate that we do. I anticipate that we are in a long process of educating the people of this country and the Members of this body to the fact of what I have already stated, that if we are going to close bases to save money, somewhere we ought to be able to show the American people that here is X numbers of dollars we saved. Because that is what we were told would happen; if we closed bases, we would save money. But we have had even experts like the General Accounting Office audit to identify the savings, and they have issued reports that it is not saved.  But we are also in a political environment here where--in past years, it has been very easy for us to make some points on saving money from the standpoint of my being a conservative Republican. Leading the efforts to cut the defense budget or to save money, I would almost have the full support of Members on the Democratic side of the aisle because they were generally of the opinion that Republican Presidents were spending too much on defense, even wasting money on defense, so fiscally minded Republicans, joining together with Democrats, would have enough votes to actually win the battle and to save the taxpayers money.  But now we have a political situation in the last 3 years where we have a Democrat President and a Republican Congress, and we find people on the Democratic side of the aisle, even though that President may be spending money above and beyond the level he should be doing it as Commander in Chief, they seem to be in a position where they want to get behind their President even if they might disagree with him on the amount of money he is spending. So we have a divided Democratic Party more so than usual on the issue of saving defense money.  As is typical on this side of the aisle, my Republican side of the aisle, it seems that there is a willingness just to give more money to defense because somehow by giving more money you get more defense.  The point that I try to drive home so often to my colleagues and I think it is legitimate; and I am speaking now just about people in this body who considerthemselves conservative; and for the most part those are people who are also registered as Republicans and elected to this body as Republicans--is that we are constantly admonishing the other side of the aisle, for decades, that you cannot solve in the typical way liberals like to solve problems, throwing money at those problems, and somehow just by spending more money on a lot of social problems, you actually solve those problems; and we would always say, ``Well, you know, it's not how much money you spend, but it's how you spend it, and how you invest it, whether or not you're going to get your money's worth.''  We do not seem to have the same caution on this side of the aisle when it comes to money for defense. We seem to take the attitude that if you just put more money in the defense budget, give more money to the Pentagon, somehow you are just automatically going to have more defense.  I raise this argument more so at the level of adopting the budget as opposed to the defense authorization bill. I suppose that is really a better place to make that generic argument about more money for defense or less money for defense. But I think it is legitimate, when we are dealing with a very specific item like infrastructure costs, and particularly when we were told over the last several years that if we close bases we ought to save money, and if we cut down on the number of personnel in the Defense Department we ought to save money, that after a few years of that argument, you ought to be able to look and say, ``Yes. We have saved X number of dollars. Here it is.'' I would have believed it. The General Accounting Office expected to find it. But the reports of the General Accounting Office do not confirm those savings.  The point is, savings are real things. You ought to be able to see them. My amendment is geared toward the proposition that if there is going to be savings, we ought to know where those savings are and what they ought to be used for and that, if they are going to still be spent in the defense budget and not reduce the deficit, at least we ought to know what they buy. So that is the basis for my amendment.  But I will to get into more detail about my amendment, more specifics in just a moment. I want to remind my colleagues of the debate we had on April 15 in this body. It was a very excellent debate on what the size of the defense budget should be. At that point, the budget resolution we had before us had already added in an extra $12 billion to the budget for defense. That is $12 billion over and above what the President had recommended that we spend on defense. I opposed that move. I opposed it by offering an amendment to cut back most of that money. The vote was 57 to 42 against what I was trying to accomplish.  The majority rules in this body, and I am willing to accept it. But all that extra money then is in the bill before us as a result of the decision that we made on the budget resolution and also the decision of the Senate Armed Services Committee to go to the maximum allowed under the budget resolution.  Most of this money is for modernization of our military capabilities. But, sadly, an analysis of the bill shows that $12 billion does not buy much at the Pentagon. That should come as no surprise to people who have been watching the defense budget and how the Defense Department has operated over a long, long period of time. It does not come as any surprise to me.  The money has been spread around in so many different areas that all we end up with is a few bits and pieces. If you would take the key area of combat aircraft as an example, this is what we get. We get six extra F-18's, two extra AV-8B's, four extra F-16's. That is it, 12 more fighters. The military needs to buy hundreds of fighters each year to modernize the force. The other areas are not much better. We do get a few extra missiles, a few extra transports, a few extra helicopters. But I might say that we do not get one extra ship for the Navy, as an example.  Now, all of this added together, I suppose somebody is going to make a case that it is absolutely needed and it is going to improve and modernize our military considerably. But it seems to me that when you see exactly what we get, then it is not even a reasonable downpayment on modernization. And $12 billion--of course, when you look at what this bill has for a total expenditure for a year--happens to be peanuts at the Pentagon, kind of a drop in the bucket.  So this brings me to a point that I have hammered on for years, as I indicated, admonishing my colleagues, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle, that throwing more money at the Department of Defense is not going to solve the problem. We will never succeed in modernizing the force structure at these prices without fundamental reform.  Now, it happens that there are even outstanding members of the Armed Services Committee that have been fighting a long time for fundamental reform. I want to commend my colleagues for fighting for fundamental reform. I think that fundamental reform is very, very important to make sure that whatever extra money we spend--including the $250-some-billion we are going to spend--is invested wisely and we get the most bang for the buck. But it seems to me that the reform ought to go ahead of the additional $12 billion.  We have had some types of reform over the last 15 years. But, again, we think we make some dramatic changes--what we feel are dramatic changes--in the way the Defense Department does business. After you look back at it, you really do not see the changes come about that we had hoped for when we passed the reforms or the reforms that go on within the Defense Department that can be done without actually passing the legislation.  We have had a host of defense reforms, one after the other. But there tends to be a big gap between promises and reality. None of these reforms have worked completely as advertised. We do not get all of the desired impact that we want to have.  Some could even been classified as bureaucratic tricks to cover for business as usual. It all leads up to the fact that what the Department of Defense needs to do is to find a new way of doing business--a completely new way of doing business, a new attitude, a new culture there. But, in fact, we really never really get the complete changes that ought to be made so that we get our money's worth when we put additional money in for modernization, or anything else.  If we do not get this fundamental reform, I think we still have to say, as good as our Armed Forces are, how much better they could be, how much more we would get for our investment of money if these reforms would really happen. We are talking about changing a basic culture. To do that, you need new ideas and new strategies. Most importantly, you need a disciplined management. You have to find ways to make reforms work--and work now, not later--not in the year 2001.  So I am suggesting in the amendment, which I will deposit at the desk shortly, a way of making sure that we get real modernization with the savings that we are supposed to get from infrastructure savings. We have already had four rounds of base closures. We have had a shrinking force. This should mean savings in infrastructure accounts. The Department of Defense has promised these savings, but the savings, as I have indicated, are not there. So promises do not match the reality.  My amendment would, hopefully, make the savings real. So this is what I propose to do would accomplish that goal. I will give you seven specific objectives of my amendment.  The first is to seek to establish a better balance between force structure and infrastructure costs. I will show you, eventually, how there is an imbalance there--an imbalance that does not make sense to me, but it is still an imbalance.  Second, this balance would be brought about and achieved by freezing the infrastructure budget at the fiscal year 1998 level of $145 billion. The freeze would save $10 billion in fiscal year 1998 to the year 2001.  Fourth, the Secretary of Defense would transfer the savings to the procurement accounts to pay for modernization. This is the key, then, to getting money from savings that we ought to be able to account for and get it into modernization, not into overhead. That ought to be going down; instead, it is going up.  The fifth point is that key readiness accounts would be protected. Thatwould be like for spare parts, training, and a lot of other things like that.  Sixth, the savings would be reflected in the future years' defense program submitted to Congress next year so that we would be able to know what it was and to see it and to have it accounted for.  Seventh, we would have the Comptroller General review and verify the savings, so we have somebody outside of the Defense Department, with no vested interest, verifying what Defense does, in the sense of just the accounting, or being accountable for the money, and not micromanaging anything that the Secretary of Defense might do.  Now, what is going to be strange to the managers of this bill--both Republican and Democrat--is that I see my goals being 100 percent consistent with the Department of Defense plans. So you take what they say they want to do, which, as I have indicated, is not being done, and make sure that it is done. It seems to me that if there is anyplace for the Congress of the United States to be involved in some detail of the Defense Department's work, it is nothing more than to make sure that they do what they say they are going to do, what they report to us they are going to do, to kind of make their performance in office commensurate with their rhetoric. That's making them accountable. That is perfectly consistent with constitutional oversight functions of the Congress of the United States.  This DOD plan was presented to the Armed Services Committee as recently as March 5, 1996. At that time, Secretary of Defense Perry testified that $10 billion in savings from base closings would be used to pay for modernization. A very distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee who was just here--and I suppose he is going to speak on my amendment. I am glad to have him engage in this debate. But we know this very distinguished member as a person who is a real hero for the defense of our country as well as being a very good Senator, John McCain. I am going to say he also agrees. He may stand up here shortly and say that he disagrees, but at least I want to give my version of that.  He has said that there is a gross imbalance between our military forces and the infrastructure. He says we need to eliminate excess infrastructure, we need to save money. He has a white paper on our national defense. That is the way I interpret it. There is just one minor problem on what the Secretary of Defense said on March 5 of this year when he was going to take this $10 billion in savings from the base closings and use it for modernization. The savings promised by Mr. Perry do not exist. The General Accounting Office just audited those accounts. You cannot find any savings. The savings have evaporated into thin air.  Mr. President, earlier this year, on April 25, I spoke about the General Accounting Office report on this subject. What I said then I am going to repeat now. Anybody can read that. It is entitled, ``Defense Infrastructure: Budget Estimates for 1996-2001 Offer Little Savings for Modernization.'' It was published on April 4, just 2 months ago. Unfortunately, it was based on the fiscal year 1996 future year defense program publication.  The fiscal year 1996 future year defense program was submitted to Congress over a year ago. So I suppose to some extent, as things move very rapidly, it is somewhat out of date. It is at least a year old. I thought I should have more current data. I thought that the Pentagon bureaucrats might have been able to get their act together since last year. Maybe they succeeded in getting infrastructure costs on the right track. I think we could legitimately surmise that they should have done that.  So not being able to get this information, I wrote to Mr. Bowsher on May 10 of this year asking him to provide me the updated information drawn from the fiscal year 1997 future year defense plan. I thank Mr. Bowsher and his expert staff, including Mr. Bill Crocker, for working so hard and to turn around my request in less than 2 weeks. That is pretty fast even for a responsible organization like the General Accounting Office. It must be a record.  I have the General Accounting Office's brandnew report right here with me. It is entitled, ``Defense Infrastructure: Cost Projected To Increase Between 1997 and 2001.'' This is dated May 1996.  Before I get started, I think it is important to define infrastructure cost. This is the money that DOD spends to house, train, and support the Armed Forces and keep them ready to go. The General Accounting Office has provided a brief description in this publication of each category of infrastructure costs. The General Accounting Office has also provided a table that shows how infrastructure costs are spread across the various appropriations accounts.  I ask unanimous consent to have that material printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Categories of Defense Infrastructure       Installation support consists of activities that furnish      funding, equipment, and personnel to provide facilities from      which defense forces operate. Activities include construction      planning and design, real property maintenance, base      operating support, real estate management for active and      reserve bases, family housing and bachelor housing, supply      operations, base closure activities, and environmental      programs.       Acquisition infrastructure consists of all program elements      that support program management, program offices, and      production support, including acquisition headquarters,      science and technology, and test and evaluation resources.      This category includes earlier levels of research and      development, including basic research, exploratory      development, and advanced development.       Central logistics consists of programs that provide support      to centrally managed logistics organizations, including the      management of material, operation of supply systems,      maintenance activities, material transportation, base      operations and support, communications, and minor      construction. This category also includes program elements      that provide resources for commissaries and military exchange      operations.       Central training consists of program elements that provide      resources for virtually all non-unit training, including      training for new personnel, aviation and flight training,      military academies, officer training corps, other college      commissioning programs, and officer and enlisted training      schools.       Central medical consists of programs that furnish funding,      equipment, and personnel that provide medical care to active      military personnel, dependents, and retirees. Activities      provide for all patient care, except for that provided by      medical units that are part of direct support units.      Activities include medical training, management of the      medical system, and support of medical installations.       Central personnel consists of all programs that provide for      the recruiting of new personnel and the management and      support of dependent schools, community, youth, and family      centers, and child development activities. Other programs      supporting personnel include permanent change of station      costs, personnel in transit, civilian disability      compensation, veterans education assistance, and other      miscellaneous personnel support activities.       Command, control, and communications consists of programs      that manage all aspects of the command, control, and      communications infrastructure for DOD facilities, information      support services, mapping and charting products, and security      support. This category includes program elements that provide      nontactical telephone services, the General Defense      Intelligence Program and cryptological activities, the Global      Positioning System, and support of air traffic control      facilities.       Force management consists of all programs that provide      funding, equipment, and personnel for the management and      operation of all the major military command headquarters      activities. Force management also includes program elements      that provide resources for defense-wide departmental      headquarters, management of international programs, support      to other defense organizations and federal government      agencies, security investigate services, public affairs      activities, and criminal and judicial activities.

In oral comments, DOD stated the data      were complete and accurate with the analysis.                         scope and methodology       To define and evaluate DOD's infrastructure activities in      the 1997 FYDP, we interviewed the acting Director, Force and      Infrastructure Analysis Division in the Office of the      Secretary of Defense, Program Analysis and Evaluation. Our      analyses are based on data contained in the fiscal year 1997      FYDP. In addition to the FYDP and associated annexes, we      reviewed DOD's Reference Manual for Defense Mission      Categories, Infrastructure Categories, and Program Elements,      prepared in conjunction with the Institute for Defense      Analysis. We also reviewed the President's fiscal year 1997      budget submission and our prior reports.       Our work was conducted during the month of May 1996 in      accordance with generally accepted government auditing      standards.
