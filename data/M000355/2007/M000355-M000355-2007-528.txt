 President, today Senate Republicans will agree to move to debate on an important question, and that question is this: Should a majority of Senators direct activities in the war in Iraq? Republicans are eager to engage in this debate on the Reid resolution because it is different in kind from any of the previous Democratic proposals--very, very different.  It is unprecedented in the powers it would arrogate to Congress in a time of war. It is a clear statement of retreat--a clear statement of retreat from the support that the Senate only recently gave to GEN David Petraeus, and its passage would be absolutely fatal to our mission in Iraq.  Previous resolutions proposed by the Democrats were a mere statement of opinion or of sentiment. This one has a binding quality. It would interfere with the President and General Petraeus's operational authority to conduct the war in Iraq as he and his commanders see fit. It would substitute for their judgment the judgment of 535 Members of Congress.
