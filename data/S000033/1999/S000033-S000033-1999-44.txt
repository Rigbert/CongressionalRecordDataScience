 Chairman, let me reiterate, this amendment is similar to an amendment that was passed in 1995 under which the United States government functioned quite well, functioned quite well. This amendment recognizes the historical and traditional role of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and allows the President to do what presidents have done since 1934.  But this amendment says that when we are going to spend more than $1 billion, come to the United States Congress for approval, so that the American people can be involved in that process.
