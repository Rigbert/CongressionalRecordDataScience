Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding time to me.  First of all, I want to take a moment to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) and all those Members who supported our efforts to provide higher funding for veterans benefits and services. It is important to note that the Nussle budget reflects an agreement on veterans spending that was reached before the House voted on the budget last March 21.  Chairman Nussle honored his commitment, and he delivered. The budget includes new budget authority for veterans in fiscal year 2004 of $63.8 billion, a $6.2 billion increase in budget authority over 2003. Of that, $3.4 billion, or 12.9 percent, will be devoted to discretionary spending, the bulk of which is for medical care.  It is important to note that every penny of that increase is justified by the compelling needs, the medical needs of our veterans.                              {time}  0130  I would point out to my friend that, in a hearing I chaired earlier this year, Dr. Robert Roswell, who is the Under Secretary for Health, testified that we needed about 13 percent to take care of our core veteran population. This budget hits that number right on the mark. My colleagues can laugh all they want. It hits it right on the mark.  I am also happy to point out that this budget, pursuant to the agreement before we voted on March 21, requires no cuts whatsoever in mandatory spending. Let me just remind my colleagues that the budget offered by my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) was $1.6 billion less in budget authority than the budget being presented on this floor today.  So when I hear about veterans, I have been on that committee for 23 years, and this budget is good for veterans. And I would hope that Members would look at this and stop the rhetoric that is distortion and misrepresentation.
