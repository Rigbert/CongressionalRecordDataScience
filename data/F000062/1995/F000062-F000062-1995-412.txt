 President, I rise today in support of a substitute amendment to House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment.  I support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and I would like to see this body pass such an amendment. However, as I have previously stated, I do not believe that the House-passed amendment, the amendment being considered by the Senate, is the right amendment for this country.  With Senators Ford, Hollings, McCain, Mikulski, Kohl, Harkin, Daschle, Dorgan, Reid, and Graham of Florida, I, therefore, offer my colleagues--both Republican and Democratic--a substitute.  The substitute I am offering today is a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that will permanently exempt Social Security from the calculations. It will protect this fund, holding in trust the money deducted from American workers' paychecks every week until they are ready to use them in retirement.  The amendment does not alter any other aspect of House Joint Resolution 1--not a single item. It merely exempts Social Security--it is an honest balanced budget amendment--a balanced budget amendment which can pass.  Unfortunately, this body has steadfastly refused to make any changes to the original balanced budget amendment submitted to the Senate despite hours of good debate--especially on the establishment of capital budgeting procedures, with which I agree, the removal of Social Security from the budget, and attempts by both Senators Johnston and Nunn to clarify the areas of legal redress under this amendment. The leadership has merely posed the same amendment which the House passed and asked that we rubberstamp it here in the Senate. I find this approach both unacceptable and puzzling.  This Senate has been involved in 1 month of detailed and incisive debate of this subject. Virtually all amendments have been defeated. No matter how salient or cogent points raised have been, they have been rejected. Apparently, the only acceptable amendment is the one presented. No changes can be made no matter how correct or compelling the criticism.  Now, while I believe a balanced budget is the correct policy decision for this country--I do not believe we must pass any amendment just because a few have ordained this to be the amendment. It is our duty in the Senate to weigh all legislative matters carefully. Amending the Constitution is a serious historical task which demands the thought and wisdom of all of us here in the Senate. I was elected by the people of California to represent their interests in the Senate. I was not elected to genuflect to a measure simply because it was passed by the House of Representatives.  At this point in our history, we should not be altering the legislative process. This body should not be simply a rubberstamp to a measure ramrodded through the other House. We should be examining all pieces of legislation independently from the House. This deliberation includes altering and amending legislation to fit the needs of Americans as we see them--I believe that the balanced budget amendment being offered by Republicans does not best serve as a correct methodology for balancing the budget.  Mr. President, I have stated previously my reasons for strongly supporting a constitutional balanced budget amendment. In the year that I was born, the Federal debt amounted to less than $25 billion. In the year my daughter was born, the Federal debt was about $225 billion--10 times greater. My granddaughter Eileen was born 2 years ago. At the time of her birth, the Federal debt was more than 150 times greater than it was when I was born--nearly $4 trillion.  In the last 35 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget exactly twice. Once in 1960, a surplus of $300 million and again in 1969, a surplus of $3.2 billion.  Yet, in the last quarter of a century, the Federal Government has run up more than $4 trillion in debt without once balancing the budget. During this time, this Nation has experienced war and peace and economic booms and recessions. Never did this Government balanced the Federal budget, let alone run a surplus.  One fact is inescapable--spending in this country has grown out of control, and we have let the Federal debt grow at a rate that is unacceptable. That is why I am a strong supporter of a constitutional balanced budget amendment. We do not have another generation to allow this problem to fester. The time for action is now. But equally important to the need for a solution is its workability in the future.  There are four important arguments for protecting Social Security:  First, this amendment would place Social Security off-budget, thereby enshrining into the Constitution congressional action and guaranteeing the integrity of the system.  Between its creation in 1935 and 1969, Social Security had always been off-budget. In an attempt to cover the [[Page S3237]] costs of the Vietnam war and later to mask growing deficits, Social Security was put on-budget. This was a misuse of the Social Security trust fund. In the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, Congress put an end to this practice by declaring Social Security funds off-budget. The amendment in the Senate to exclude Social Security from budget calculations was passed in the 101st Congress by a vote of 98-2. Every Member today who served in the 101st Congress voted to place Social Security off-budget.  Second, Social Security is not like other Government programs and should not be treated like other Government programs.  Social Security is a publicly administered, compulsory, contributory retirement system. Through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, known as FICA, workers are required to contribute 6.2 percent of their salaries to Social Security. Every worker does this. Employers are required to match that amount. Every employer does this. This combined 12.4-percent contribution funds the Social Security system. It is not meant to fund Interior, or Agriculture, or Defense, or HUD, or welfare, or anything else. By law these funds are required to be held by the Federal Government in trust. They are not the Federal Government's funds, but contributions that workers pay in and expect to get back.  Over 58 percent of working Americans pay more in FICA taxes, if you include the employers' share, than they pay in Federal income taxes. This is not a small amount, and it is not adjusted by salary.  Third, Social Security does not contribute to the Federal deficit. In fact, the Social Security trust fund surpluses are masking the true size of the deficit today. In 1995, Social Security will take in $69 billion more than it will pay out in benefits. By 2001, Social Security will be running surpluses of more than $100 billion a year. By the time this amendment goes in place, in 2002, the surplus in the Social Security System will be $705 billion.  Fourth, the failure to save Social Security surpluses could undermine the system's viability.  In the late 1970's and 1980's, Congress changed the way the Social Security System was financed. Recognizing the large demand on the system that would be created by the retirement of the baby boomer generation early next century, the Social Security System was changed from a pay-as-you-go system to a system that would accumulate large surpluses now to prepare for the vast increase in the number of retirees later.  The amendment being offered by the Republicans permits the collected funds to be used to finance the deficit. That means beginning in 2019, when Social Security is supposed to begin drawing down its accumulated surpluses to pay for the benefits of the vast numbers of retiring baby boomers, there will be no money saved to distribute.  Congress will be forced to either raise taxes, cut Social Security benefits, or further cut other spending programs to meet the obligations workers are paying for now. In short, the American workers will have to pay twice for the retirement of the baby boomers because we will not be saving what they contribute now.  The only way to save the Social Security surpluses to pay for future retirements is to balance the budget exclusive of these revenues, and that is what this amendment would do.  The impact of this, of course, would be that the Federal Government would run a unified budget surplus--a balanced Federal budget and a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. In this way, we would cut the Federal debt and save Social Security funds, not just watch the debt keep growing. The alternative balanced budget amendment being offered today will do just that.  On February 17, the Times Mirror released its latest public interest poll. I think every Senator here should be aware of the results. When asked what should be given a higher priority in 1995, cutting taxes or taking steps to reduce the budget deficit, 55 percent want to reduce the deficit while 37 percent want to cut taxes for the middle class. Now, this supports the argument which we all are making for the balanced budget amendment. The American public wants to reduce the deficit; balancing the budget is the best way to do just that.  But this question is only one part of the story. When asked if it was more important to reduce the budget or keep Social Security and Medicare benefits as they are, the respondents favored keeping Social Security benefits as they are by a 70 to 24 percent margin. Let me say that again, 70 percent of the American public favors protecting Social Security while only 24 percent want to reduce the deficit at the expense of Social Security. This amendment we are offering will satisfy both of these desires.  Just last week, on February 23, I received a letter from the AARP supporting the protection of Social Security. Let me quote some of it:       The Association believes that a specific exemption for      Social Security is required because anything less is      inadequate and nonbinding. Without an exemption the program      is at risk in several ways. First, benefits could be cut to      reach the balanced budget goal even though money from such      unwarranted reductions would remain in the Social Security      trust funds. This would have the affect of further masking      the deficit at the expense of Social Security beneficiaries.      Just as important the benefit promise to today's workers will      be jeopardized because the annual reserve will continue to be      used to hide the extent of the Federal deficit.  The letter concludes by stating:       During the most recent election, candidates and the      leadership of both political parties pledged to protect      Social Security. The American people have grown angry and      wary of promises from Washington. To tell the American public      that Social Security is protected--and then fail to address      the issue directly--will only lead to an increase in the      cynicism that is currently prevalent throughout the Nation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter, along with a letter I received on February 1 from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare supporting this amendment to protect the Social Security.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           American Association of                                               Retired Persons                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Association of Retired      Persons (AARP) appreciates your efforts to protect Social      Security from the proposed constitutional amendment to      require a balanced budget. Many members of Congress speak      about the importance of this program and the need to maintain      it for current and future beneficiaries. However, since      previous attempts to specifically shield Social Security from      the balanced budget amendment have been defeated, your      substitute represents the last opportunity to truly protect      this vital program before the amendment would be sent to the      states.       While AARP continues to believe that a requirement for a      balanced budget federal budget does not belong in the      Constitution, we believe that exempting Social Security is      warranted for the following reasons:       Social Security is a self sustaining program that is      financed by employer and employee contributions that are      credited to the Social Security trust funds in order to pay      benefits and run the program,       Social Security does not contribute one penny to the      federal deficit. It currently has over $400 billion in      reserve--an amount that is expected to increase by $70      billion this year alone; and       Raiding the trust funds would weaken our benefit promise to      today's worker, as well as undermine their confidence in our      nation's most important protection program.       The Association believes that a specific exemption for      Social Security is required because anything less is      inadequate and nonbinding. Without an exemption the program      is at risk in several ways. First, benefits could be cut to      reach the balanced budget goal even though the money from      such unwarranted reductions would remain in the Social      Security trust funds. This would have the affect of further      masking the deficit at the expense of Social Security      beneficiaries. Just as important, the benefit promise to      today's workers will be jeopardized because the annual      reserve will continue to be used to hide the extent of the      federal deficit. In addition, Section 2 of the proposed      amendment treats the Social Security trust funds' government      bonds differently than the rest of the debt held by the      public. This differentiation could lead to further attempts      to use the Social Security trust funds as a cash cow.       During the most recent election, candidates and the      leadership of both political parties pledged to protect      Social Security. The American people have grown angry and      wary of promises from Washington. To tell the American public      that Social Security is protected--and then fail to address      the issue      [[Page S3238]] directly--will only lead to an increase in the      cynicism that is currently prevalent throughout the nation.           Sincerely,                                                  Horace B. Deets.     Executive Director.                                                                    ____         National Committee to                        Preserve Social Security and Medicare,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the nearly six million      members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve      Social Security and Medicare, I offer our strong support for      your amendment to remove Social Security trust funds from      budget and deficit calculations under the pending balanced      budget constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1.       The National Committee agrees that the future economic      growth of this nation will be enhanced if the budget of the      United States is brought into balance. However, we strongly      disagree that balancing the budget requires putting Social      Security at risk by including it in the budget.       Balancing the budget requires reasoned decision making and      the courage to face up to hard choices. It also requires      recognizing the source of the problem. And that, by      definition, excludes Social Security. The Social Security      program is self-supporting and does not contribute one penny      to the deficit. To the contrary, it produces a substantial      surplus which Congress has been using to conceal the true      size of the deficit. Including Social Security in this      balanced budget constitutional amendment makes this budgetary      charade much worse by writing it into the Constitution.       Amending the Constitution of the United States to      legitimize this practice amounts to a breach of trust with      the American people. Social Security today is exactly what it      was established to be almost sixty years ago--a publicly      administered, compulsory, contributory retirement program.      Treating Social Security as just one more federal expenditure      alters the very character of the program in a way that will      ultimately undermine the program's great success.       Seniors support a balanced budget, but will strongly object      to a Constitutional amendment which includes Social Security      trust funds in budget and deficit calculations. On behalf of      our members, I offer our sincere thanks for your efforts to      protect Social Security.           Sincerely,                                                Martha A. McSteen,                                                        President.
