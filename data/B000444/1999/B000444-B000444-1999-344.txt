 President, it is with utmost respect and admiration that I rise today to acknowledge the contributions of a woman who, at the age of 99, has never tired of giving her all to her country and to the men and women of the Mill Creek Fire Company--Elma F. Brittingham of Marshallton, Delaware, affectionately known to everyone as ``Mom.'' On May 8, 1999, Mill Creek will honor her at its 72nd Annual Dinner for 72 years of unmatched volunteer service to the Mill Creek Fire Company. Yes, Elma is a charter member of the Mill Creek Fire Company and she remains an institution in the Fire Hall.  This well-deserved recognition is much less than I or anyone in Delaware could ever do to capture just how significant Elma's life has been to everyone with whom she has come in contact. Her legacy is etched in the memory of every fire service professional and volunteer in our State and her life continues to be an inspiration to all of us.  While many remember Elma for her 50 years of preparing turkey dinners for the Annual Volunteer Fire Conference, or her playing Yen Man in the company minstrel show, she is most remembered for her work on the front-line, fighting fires under the most dangerous circumstances. The one she most vividly remembers was during World War II when she helped put out a fire at an old prison farm on Duncan Road in Wilmington during a thunder and lightning storm. With this same energy and vigor, Elma is as spiritedtoday, five decades later, as she was more than a half-century ago.  I know that there may be someone like Elma Brittingham in other States, but none can be more important to a community than this totally committed, selfless woman that I honor today. She is what we, as Americans, should aspire to be--a loyal public servant, an example of excellence and achievement in everything she has committed to accomplishing, and a credit to her community and to her country. I am deeply privileged to know this woman and proud to call her a heroic Delawarean and an outstanding American.                          ____________________
