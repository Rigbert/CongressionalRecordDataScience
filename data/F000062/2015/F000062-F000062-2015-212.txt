 President, I rise today to introduce the Nepal Trade Preferences Act.  This legislation is simple and straightforward. It grants duty-free status to imports of Nepalese garments for a ten year period.  I have been a friend of Nepal and the Nepalese people for over 25 years. I have witnessed its political struggle and sadly the deterioration of its ready-made garment industry.  The Nepal Trade Preferences Act bill will promote much-needed economic development and contribute to lasting political stability in one of the world's poorest countries.  Allow me to go over some basic facts of everyday life in Nepal.  Nepal has a per capita income of $730.  Approximately 25 percent of the Nepal's 24 million people live in poverty.  The unemployment rate in Nepal stands at a staggering 47 percent; and most Nepalese live on $2 a day.  The 2005 phase-out of the Micro-Fiber Arrangement, which established export quotas from developing nations, has deeply damaged Nepal's apparel industry.  Instead of continuing to import garments from Nepal, U.S. importers have shifted their orders to China, Bangladesh and other low-cost labor markets.  In fact, the number of people employed by the Nepalese garment industry dropped from over 90,000 people to less than 5,000 today; textile and apparel exports from Nepal to the United States fell from approximately $95 million in 2005 to $45 million in 2013; and the number of garment factories plummeted from 212 to 30.  Despite Nepal's poverty and the near-collapse of the garment industry, Nepalese garment imports are still subject to an average U.S. tariff of 11.7 percent and can be as high as 32 percent.  In essence, we are unfairly taxing the imports of a highly impoverished country that cannot afford it. Taxing textile and apparel imports from Nepal, which constitute .01 percent of all U.S. imports, makes no sense.  I would point out that U.S. tariffs on Nepalese garments stand in contrast to the policies of the European Union, Canada, and Australia, which all allow Nepalese garments into their markets duty free.  It should come as no surprise, then, that while the U.S. share of Nepalese garment exports has fallen, the European Union's share has risen from 18.14 percent in 2006 to 46 percent in 2010.  The purpose of the ``Nepal Trade Preferences Act'' is to ensure that we provide Nepal with the same trade preferences afforded to it by other developed countries. No more, no less.  Humanitarian and development assistance programs should be critical components of our efforts to help Nepal. I was proud to support the President's budget request of $77 million for Nepal in fiscal year 2015.  But assistance is no substitute for organic economic development. We should help the Nepalese people help themselves by reopening the U.S. market to a once thriving export industry.  In the end, economic growth and prosperity can be best achieved when Nepal is given the chance to compete and grow in a free and open global marketplace.  With this legislation, the United States can make a real difference now to help revitalize the garment industry in Nepal and promote economic growth and higher living standards.  There is no doubt that Nepal has struggled to draft a new constitution and coalesce around a governing majority.  While only Nepal can chart its political course, passing this measure would undoubtedly help regenerate Nepal's stagnant economy.  Let us show our solidarity with the people of Nepal by passing this commonsense measure.  I urge my colleagues to support the Nepal Trade Preferences Act.                                 ______                                       By
