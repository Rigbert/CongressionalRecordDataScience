 President, I speak today in remembrance of an Iowa soldier who has fallen in service to his country. Specialist Dakotah L. Gooding, a member of the C Troop, 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, died on the 13th of February in Balad, Iraq when his vehicle overturned into a canal. He was 21 years old.  SPC Gooding grew up in Keokuk, IA and eventually moved to the Des Moines area. He attended the Scavo Alternative School and Lincoln High School. In the fall of 2000, at the age of 17, Dakotah fulfilled a life-long dream of joining the U.S. Army, following in the footsteps of many family members. He had served in the United States and Korea before going to Iraq. SPC Gooding came to Iraq as part of an Army Special Security Force that helped with voter protection in the recent historic democratic elections.  A cousin mentioned that SPC Gooding knew he had a mission to protect those around the world and those at home. SPC Gooding's mission was a noble one, and he carried it out with the courage and dignity that are so characteristic of our American soldiers. For his dedication and sacrifice, Dakotah deserves our respect and admiration. For family and friends who have felt this loss most deeply, I offer my sincere sympathy. My prayers go out to his wife, Angela, his mother, Judith, his two sisters, and his many other family and friends.  May we always remember with pride and appreciation Specialist Dakotah L. Gooding and all those Americans who have gone before him in service to their country.                          ____________________
