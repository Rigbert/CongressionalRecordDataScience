Mr. Speaker, I think the bottom line question we all need to ask, Mr. Speaker, is, is there anything that the dictatorship in Beijing can do that would lead to a loss of support for PNTR that Beijing so desperately wants? They needto know, as my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman), said, up front what the consequences will be.  If pervasive torture, religious persecution, Laogai labor, a lack of press freedom, and worker rights and other human rights abuses are not enough, I sincerely hope that war with Taiwan is sufficiently egregious to trigger a loss of support for PNTR.
