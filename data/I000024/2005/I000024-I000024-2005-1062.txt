This is the third day now we have been inviting them to come down. So far only Senator Thune has brought his amendment in. We did adopt that amendment. I encourage others to come down.  I think this could very well be considered by most people the most significant vote on a bill we will be considering on the floor this entire year. We want to make sure, while we have the time, that we give adequate consideration and time for the amendments that different Members may have. I invite them to come down at any time during this process. With that, I yield the floor.
