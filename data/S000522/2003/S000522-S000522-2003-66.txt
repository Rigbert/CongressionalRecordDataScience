Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) for his good work on this bill as well. This is a bipartisan bill, and he certainly did his part in making sure this legislation went forward, so I do want to thank him.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gerlach), the prime sponsor of this bill, who has broken a logjam; and now we will soon have a bill signing in this important legislation, not just for Pennsylvania but for other regions as well; it will go forward to the President and will become law.
