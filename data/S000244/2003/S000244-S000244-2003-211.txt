Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment I think can probably be referred to as the ``back-door erosion of the 14th amendment to the Constitution amendment'' to this bill because it erodes the concept of equal protection under the law, meaning everybody gets treated equally in court.  What the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) is trying to do is to say for certain types of corporations, they would be treated under a different law than other types of corporations. That poses some really profound problems as far as I am concerned.  The crux of this whole matter is that this is an attempt to establish tax policy in a civil litigation procedure bill. It mixes up apples and oranges. It is not going to have the effect that the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) is stating, and that is preventing corporations that wish to go offshore from going offshore. The amendment is not wrong, it just does not make any sense. It should be rejected.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
