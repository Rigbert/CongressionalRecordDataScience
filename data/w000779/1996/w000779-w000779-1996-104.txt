President, I will only say that the Senate on a bipartisan basis is formally on record with more than 80 Senators in support of this proposition. We have a choice, as the minority leader has said. We can let this go down once more or we can have a vote on a proposal that I offer to my colleagues that will impose real fiscal discipline and at the same time assure that Social Security is protected for both workers and retirees in the days ahead.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
