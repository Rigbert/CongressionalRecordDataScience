 President, I rise to introduce a bill, the SCAAP Reauthorization Act, on behalf of myself and Mr. Kyl, to assist with alleviating the costs of illegal immigration to State and local governments by reauthorizing the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, though 2015.  We are pleased to be joined today by Senators Schumer, Cornyn, Boxer, Hutchison, Bingaman, McCain, Durbin, and Crapo.  I believe that immigration policy and control of our borders is exclusively a Federal responsibility. Yet many undocumented criminal aliens are housed in our State prisons and our county jails at a cost that rises into the hundred of millions of dollars.  Understanding the expenses that States and localities bear, Congress enacted the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, (SCAAP), in 1994 as part of the Violent Crime Control Act. The program was designed to help reimburse States and localities for the costs of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. Under this program, States can be reimbursed for costs for housing undocumented aliens who are convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors in violation of State orlocal law and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days.  Over the years, Senator Kyl and I have worked to increase Congressional funding of SCAAP. Last year, Congress appropriated 393 million dollars to SCAAP. While this is only a fraction of the costs that States and localities bear for housing undocumented criminal aliens, even this level of funding is critical.  In 2009, undocumented aliens comprised approximately 11 percent of the inmates in California's State prison system. This year, the State of California is expected to spend 970.3 million dollars from the general fund on the incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens. However, it is expected that California will only receive reimbursement for 10 percent of its total costs. The State of California and its counties simply cannot afford to take on these costs, which stretch already thin budgets.  When the Federal Government does not reimburse States and localities for the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens, it is at the expense of our local educators, social services, and law enforcement. Insufficient SCAAP funding forces localities to engage in the ``early release'' of prisoners with misdemeanors as a cost saving measure and make cuts to other necessary public safety services. American communities simply cannot afford to shoulder the weight of our immigration policies.  I believe this legislation will reaffirm the Federal government's commitment to working with States and localities to address their financial concerns.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3376       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``SCAAP Reauthorization Act''.     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE                    STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.       Subparagraph (C) of section 241(i)(5) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)(5)) is amended by      striking ``2011.'' and inserting ``2015.''.                          ____________________
