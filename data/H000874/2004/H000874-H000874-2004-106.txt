Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and his very important contribution to this discussion.  In closing, let me say that we are committed to working, not only on our side of the aisle but working with our Republican colleagues as well, towards simplifying this code, making it fairer, reducing these 10,000 pages so that the anomalies of which the gentleman from Texas just spoke in terms of the deduction for the Hummer and for the Porsche will not make our tax code unfair so that the average working American who goes to work every day, and as Bill Clinton said, plays by the rules, will not have an undue tax burden placed upon them because so many others take advantage of one of the loopholes included in these 10,000 pages and do not pay their fair share.  That is not fair. That is not good tax policy. That is not good for America. So we are pledged as Democrats, as Americans, as Members of this House sent up by our neighbors here to represent them, to work unceasingly and tirelessly on making this code simpler, making it fairer, making it more efficient, making for a better code, a better America.                          ____________________
