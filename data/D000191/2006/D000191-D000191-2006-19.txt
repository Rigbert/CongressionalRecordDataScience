Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6233, a bill to make technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU.  I want to thank my colleagues on the committee and particularly the leadership on the committee, Chairman Young; subcommittee chairman, Mr. Petri; the ranking member, Mr. Oberstar; the staff who did tremendous work on this bill which became law just a little over a year ago.  It is a tremendous investment in the future of our Nation in terms of improving the infrastructure to mitigate for congestion, dealing with ongoing problems with maintenance of the existing structure. In particular in my State, a substantial amount of funds will be applied to fix cracked bridges on the Interstate 5 system, a life-blood system which serves the entire west coast of the United States.  The bill had, as any major bill does, a few inadvertent drafting errors, probably due to the Senate, and some legislative language that needed some minor change.  In particular, there was a problem with funding for the Service Transportation Research Development and Deployment Account, that the funding was oversubscribed. It meant that the Federal Highway Administration would not have been able to continue its legacy research program, which is an extraordinarily important program that looks at activities, including the Biannual Conditions and Performance Report, an objective appraisal of highway bridge, transit finance, physical condition, operational performance and future investment requirements, information that will be absolutely critical as we move forward toward the next major Surface Transportation Act in the not-too-distant future.  So the bill is otherwise a straightforward technical correction, without additions. I would recommend it to my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar).
