President, I will yield to the Senator from Maine.  But I do want to note, this involves not just the Congress and other governments. Diana, Princess of Wales is in Washington today to support the efforts of the American Red Cross in raising money to aid the victims of landmines. I commend Elizabeth Dole, President of the American Red Cross, and the Princess, for doing that. The Princess has done so much, since she went to Angola and saw the terrible effects of landmines there, to call attention to the plight of the victims and to speak out in support of a global ban. What we all want to do, of course, is do everything possible to make sure that someday there will be no such victims.  I yield to my good friend from Maine.
