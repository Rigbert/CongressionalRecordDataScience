President, it is fortuitous for the Presiding Officer to be presiding because I know of his background, and I am speaking today of a man who just passed away in Illinois who is a great friend of mine. His name is Tom Lyons, a former State senator and chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County. If you have ever attended an Irish wake--and I bet you have--there is a passionate combination of sadness and celebration.  In Chicago, such a wake is being held for a good and courageous man.  Thomas G. Lyons died last Friday at the age of 75 after a months-long struggle against serious illness.  Mr. Lyons served for the last 17 years as chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. That was only one small chapter in an otherwise long, interesting and amazing life story.  As a young man, he served as an Army Ranger and a Chicago police officer.  In 1957, he earned a law degree and spent the next several years working first in the Cook County assessor's office, and then in the Illinois Attorneys General office.  In 1964, a time of great change, Tom Lyons was elected to represent northwest Chicago in the Illinois General Assembly.  The following year, he was tapped to serve in the leadership of a State commission studying the need for a new Illinois State constitution. He later served as vice president of the convention that drafted Illinois's current State constitution.  The preamble to that document lays out a series of high and noble aims of government. It reads, and I quote:       We, the people of the state of Illinois--grateful to      Almighty God for the civil, political and religious liberty      which He has permitted us to enjoy and seeking his blessings      upon our endeavors--in order to provide for the health,      safety and welfare of the people; maintain a representative      and orderly government; eliminate poverty and inequality;      assure legal, social and economic justice; provide      opportunity for the fullest development of the individual;      insure domestic tranquility; provide for the common defense;      and secure the blessings of freedom and liberty for ourselves      and our posterity--do ordain and establish this constitution      for the state of Illinois.  Those same high and noble goals--``to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the people; . . . eliminate poverty and inequality; . . . assure legal, social and economic justice; . . . and secure the blessings of freedom and liberty for ourselves and our posterity''--were the standards to which Tom Lyons held himself in his public service.  A story in Sunday's Chicago Sun Times last Sunday says a lot about the kind of man he was.  In the 1950s, Tom Lyons was a young soldier on his way to Fort Benning, GA. It was his first trip to the South.  As he walked through a bus station, he was shocked to see one restroom for Whites and another for Blacks. His family said he decided to take a stand--and used the ``colored'' bathroom.  His son Frank said:       He got into it with the local law enforcement. But he      wanted to make a statement. It's who he was as a person.  His family and friends say it was that willingness to stand up for everyone--no matter their race, class or status--that best embodies Mr. Lyons' legacy.  It was also that willingness to treat everyone equally, with dignity, which nearly cost Tom Lyons his political career four decades ago.  In 1963, the year before Tom Lyons was elected to the Illinois State Senate, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance banning restrictive covenants and other discriminatory real estate practices that were used to maintain racial segregation in Chicago. But the ordinance was routinely ignored.  In January 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. moved to what he called a ``slum apartment'' on the West Side of Chicago. That summer, he held a series of ``open housing'' marches in all-White neighborhoods in the city and suburbs. The demonstrations produced a furor and focused national and international attention on the problem of housing discrimination, not just in Chicago, but in America.  By fall, the issue of housing discrimination became the most volatile issue of the campaign. It helped defeat one of the most courageous men who ever served in this Senate, a man Dr. King called ``the greatest of all senators,'' my mentor, Paul Douglas.  Family and friends warned Tom Lyons that his support for a State fair housing law that year could cost him his seat in the General Assembly. But he voted for the bill anyway--and lost his re-election bid.  Having lost, he didn't give up. He won his seat back 4 years later.  Chicago politics is famously rough and tumble, but Tom Lyons was famous for trying to calm tempers and soothe old wounds by gathering people around the piano to sing great old songs and World War II ballads. He loved politics, not because of what it could do for him but what it allowed him to do for others. That is why his wake this evening will be filled with sadness and with celebration and why Tom Lyons will also be missed in Chicago and throughout our State.  As a young attorney serving in the Illinois State Legislature as parliamentarian for 14 years, I came to know a lot of State senators. There remain many fine men and women who serve in that body. I was learning my earliest chapters of Illinois politics as I watched them in action.  I remember Tom Lyons, a good legislator, conscientious man, a man of principle, with a great sense of humor, who would put an arm around your shoulder and say: Let's go have a beer and sing a song. He was just that kind of guy. His life was a good life, a life of public service and a life of giving to many others. I was lucky to be one of his friends and lucky to be one of the beneficiaries of his good will.  I ask the Members of the Senate to join me in extending our condolences to Tom's wife Ruth; their sons, Thomas and Frank; their daughters, Alexandra and Rachel; and Tom's eight grandchildren.                          ____________________
