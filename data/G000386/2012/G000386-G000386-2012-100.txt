 President, earlier today, the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit was agreed to by voice vote. It is unclear whether or not a motion to reconsider was made, whether or not a motion to table a motion to reconsider was offered, and whether or not a request was made to notify the President was part of the order.  I object to any further proceedings, including those listed above, based on the fact that a rollcall vote was expected on this nomination.
