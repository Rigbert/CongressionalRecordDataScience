President, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Missing Children's Assistance Act that ensures the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can continue.  We cleared it a week ago here on the Democratic side. I understand that now it has cleared the Republican side.  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3092, which was received from the House and is at the desk.
