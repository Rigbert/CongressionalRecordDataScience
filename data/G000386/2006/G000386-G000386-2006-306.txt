 President, sadly, every year over 26,000 people die in this country from the effects of drug abuse. This is a staggering and sobering statistic. Still, millions more have been devastated by this tragic loss of life and promise. Ordinary people like you and I, are left to cope with the loss of a loved one senselessly taken at the hands of drugs.  Over the years, families and friends have individually found ways to remember and honor their memory. But to date, there has been no national event to bring people together to call attention to the nature and extent of the drug problem in this country.  Now, eight families who have personally suffered the loss of a loved one because of drugs have joined together to plan a remembrance. On June 8, 2006, the first annual Vigil for Lost Promise: Remembering Those Who Have Died From Drugs will be held in Washington, DC.  This national event finally gives these and other families the opportunity to remember and honor the memory of those who have died from drugs. This event will illuminate for everyone just how pervasive and dangerous this problem is in our society.  Others sharing similar stories of loss will be joined by leaders in the drug prevention, treatment and education fields, community leaders, clergy from all faith, educators, legislators and concerned citizens as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Partnership for a Drug Free America to raise public awareness about the terrible toll that drugs take on families, friends and society .  Today, I am pleased to submit along with my colleagues, Senator Biden and Senator Talent, a resolution to support the goals of the Vigil for Lost Promise and to designate June 8, 2006, as the day of a National Vigil for Lost Promise. It is important that these and other families who have lost of a loved one to drugs know that they are not alone. Many wonderful people have had to endure the same nightmare and this event lets everyone know that there is hope and there is help.  I encourage all my colleagues to visit www.nationalparentvigil.com to learn more about this very important event. I also want to urge my colleagues to join us in passing this resolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising awareness about drugs and to lend our support to those who have lost a loved one to drugs.                          ____________________
