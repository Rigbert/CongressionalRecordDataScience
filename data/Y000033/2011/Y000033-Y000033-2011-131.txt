Madam Chairman, the Americans suffering from $4 a gallon gas today, $5 a gallon gas next month must feel like they're experiencing a sense of deja vu. It was just three short years ago, in 2008, when gasoline prices reached a record high of $4.11 per gallon. Those high prices cut deep into the pockets of Americans that summer and generated enough public outcry to force Congress to act.  That fall, the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Republican President took bipartisan action to lift the offshore drilling ban that had been in place for decades. This monumental step opened up all of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to new offshore energy production. Three years later, most Americans would likely be shocked to learn that no energy development has happened in these new areas and that they have actually once again been placed off-limits.  The progress that was made in 2008 by lifting the drilling moratorium has been completely reversed by the Obama administration. The President says he wants to ``win the future,'' but his policies are taking us back to the past.  Now American families and businesses are once again facing $4 gasoline, as I said, $5 the first of June; and we're no further ahead in expanding American energy production than we were 3 years ago. That's outrageous and unacceptable.  The House has already passed two bills to increase offshore energy production, create jobs, and lower prices. Today, we will vote on a third offshore drilling bill, H.R. 1231, in order to reverse the moratorium that President Obama has single-handedly placed on new offshore drilling.  This bill requires the administration to move forward with offshore lease sales in areas containing the most oil and natural gas. For the 2012-2017 lease plan being written by the Obama administration, this would include areas containing at least 2.5 billion barrels of oil or 7.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Based on the government's own estimates of our oil and natural resources, this would open up areas in the north and central Atlantic coasts, the southern California coast, and offshore Alaska.  Even in the face of rising gasoline prices, the President wants to drill nowhere new. This bill says let's move forward with leasing and drilling in those areas where we know America has real and significant resources. In contrast to the President's drill nowhere new plan, this is a drill smart plan.  This bill requires the Secretary to set specific production goals for 5-year plans. For 2012-2017 it sets a goal of 3 million barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by the year 2027. By comparison to today's levels, this increase of oil equatesto a tripling of current American offshore production and would reduce foreign imports by nearly one-third.  This bill will not only significantly increase American energy production; it would also create good-paying American jobs. Economist Dr. Joseph Mason testified that this bill would create 250,000 jobs short term and 1.2 million jobs long term.  This bill will also generate hundreds of millions in new revenue to help strengthen our economy and pay down the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill will generate $800 million in revenue over the next 10 years.  Recent polls show that the majority of Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and independents--all support increased offshore drilling. They recognize that our national economic security should not be left in the hands of Iranian-led OPEC and that expanding American energy production will translate into more jobs, more revenue and lower gasoline prices.  Madam Chairman, the Obama administration is trying to lead us into a supposedly new era of time without understanding the importance of fossil fuels. It is the largest tax on every family. Approximately $1,100, Mr. and Mrs. America, you're paying to the Obama administration in taxes because of the high cost of oil, high cost of gas to you.  It's time America steps up and becomes independent from those that have been selling this oil for the past 25 years. It's not just this President. This has been going on for a while. But next year we're going to send $400 billion overseas to the countries that do not like us, that do not create one American job, not anything for America--send the money over and buy foreign oil.                              {time}  1540  I watched the President say this down in Brazil, We want to be your partner. You are developing new oil fields, and we want to buy your gasoline. So Mr. And Mrs. America, keep in mind, we have the fossil fuels, we have the opportunity, and it's time that we open the offshore for development of the good State of America.  I reserve the balance of my time.
