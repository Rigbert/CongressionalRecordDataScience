President, I rise today with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Tina Smith, to introduce the TICK Act. This stands for Ticks: Identify, Control, and Knockout Act. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Maine, Senator King, who is joining us as an original cosponsor.  Our bipartisan legislation would provide local communities and States with the resources needed to help prevent, detect early, and treat Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.  Tick-borne diseases like Lyme have become a major public health concern, with the incidence exploding over the past 15 years. The number of Americans with tick-borne diseases has been rising at an alarming rate. In 2003, Lyme disease infected approximately 30,000 Americans. Last year there were an estimated 450,000 cases--a staggering 1,400-percent increase.  In Maine, last year alone, there were 2,000 new cases of Lyme disease. That is a sharp increase from the 752 cases in 2010.  Other tick-borne diseases are also on the rise. Anaplasmosis, for example, has more than tripled.  Far too many Americans with Lyme disease experience a complex diagnostic odyssey that takes months or even years. One of my constituents, Paula Jackson Jones, from Damariscotta, ME, shared with me her harrowing tale that took 2 years, scores of tests, and 23 different physicians before she finally received the correct diagnosis that she had Lyme disease. Her journey started one afternoon 10 years ago after raking leaves in her backyard. A week later, unusual symptoms began to appear: anxiety attacks, pain, muscle spasms, and fatigue. These symptoms became debilitating.  Before receiving the correct diagnosis, Paula was diagnosed incorrectly with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and other diseases. Once she finally received the proper diagnosis and treatment, Paula founded Midcoast Lyme Disease Support & Education, a nonprofit that raises public awareness about Lyme disease.  She told me:       This has been a 10-year crusade for me with the first 5      years fighting for my life and the latter, fighting on behalf      of others.  In addition to the physical and emotional toll that Lyme disease takes, it is also expensive. Paula is still paying off more than $250,000 worth of medical bills that she has incurred. Medical costs of Lyme disease are estimated at $1.3 billion per year. When accounting for indirect medical costs, including the loss of work, the annual cost balloons to $75 billion per year.  A correct and early diagnosis can reduce costs, as well as improve the prognosis, but we have a long way to go. When HIV became a public health crisis, fortunately, a gold standard for identification and treatment was developed within 10 years. Lyme disease, by contrast, was identified more than 40 years ago; yet there still is no gold standard treatment, and existing prevention, education, and diagnostic efforts have proven to be inadequate.  The TICK Act would apply a three-pronged approach to addressing Lyme and other tick and vector-borne diseases. First, it would establish an office of oversight and coordination of vector-borne diseases at the Department of Health and Human Services. This office would develop a national strategy to prevent and treat Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. It would expand research and improve testing, treatment affordability, and public awareness. The office would also coordinate with key Federal agencies, including the CDC, the Department of Defense, USDA, and EPA to protect Americans from these diseases.  Second, our bill would reauthorize the Regional Centers for Excellence in Vector-Borne Disease, which Congress established in 2017 in response to the Zika outbreak. Since then, tick-borne diseases have accounted for three out of four vector-borne diseases in our country, and these centers have been effective in leading the scientific response. The Collins-Smith bill would reauthorize these centers for another 5 years at $10 million per year.  Finally, our bill would establish CDC grants, which would be awarded to State health departments to improve data collection and analysis, support early detection and diagnosis, improve treatment and heighten public awareness. The TICK Act takes a comprehensive approach to address tick-borne diseases.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks letters of support signed by more than 2 dozen organizations supporting our bill, including the Midcoast Lyme Disease and Support Education organization, the LivLyme Foundation, the Northeast Regional Center for Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and the Entomological Society of America.  I urge all of our colleagues to support this important legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 22, 2019.     Re: Stakeholder Support for Bill on Vector-Borne Disease          Management.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Vector-Borne Disease      Network and allied organizations, we the undersigned write to      articulate our support for the objectives of ``Ticks:      Identify, Control, and Knockout Act'' or the ``TICK Act,''      which aims to combat the escalating burden of VBD. The      Vector-Borne Disease Network is a new stakeholder group of      non-profit organizations led by the Entomological Society of      America (ESA) that aims to reduce human and animal suffering      caused by arthropod disease vectors.       Illnesses such as Lyme disease, Zika virus, Malaria, and      West Nile virus are transmitted by vector organisms,      primarily blood-feeding insects or arthropods. Vectors ingest      disease-causing germs when biting an infected human or animal      and later inject them into a new host during a subsequent      bite.       Between 2004 and 2016, reported human disease cases in the      U.S. resulting from bites from arthropods--primarily ticks      and mosquitoes--tripled, according to the U.S. Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Meanwhile, nine new      germs spread by ticks and mosquitoes were discovered or      introduced in that same timeframe. Disease vectors also pose      significant threats to both livestock and companion animals.      The underlying causes for these trends are varying and      complex, and so are the potential solutions.       Due to all the challenges mentioned above, and the growing      threat to American health and security posed by vector-borne      disease (VBD), the Vector-Borne Disease Network is pleased to      see new legislation that aims to establish an Office of      Oversight and Coordination for VBD within the Department of      Health and Human Services to promote interagency      coordination; develop and maintain a national plan for      responding to VBD; reauthorize the CDC Regional Centers of      Excellence in VBD for five years; and authorize a cooperative      agreement through CDC to support state health department      efforts to improve management, surveillance, diagnosis, and      education.       On behalf of this coalition of stakeholders invested in the      mission to reduce the public-health and economic risks posed      by ticks and mosquitoes, we thank you for your commitment to      this critical issue.           Sincerely,       Anastasia Mosquito Control District of St. Johns County      (FL); Associated Executives of Mosquito Control Work in New      Jersey; Drexel University, College of Medicine; Entomological      Society of America; Colorado Tick-Borne Disease Awareness      Association; College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,      University of Wisconsin-Madison; Hudson Valley Lyme Disease      Association; Lyme Association of Greater Kansas City, Inc.;      Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector Borne Disease;      National Association of Vector-Borne Disease Control      Officials; New Jersey Mosquito Control Association; North      Fork Deer Management Alliance;       Northeast Regional Center for Excellence in Vector Borne      Diseases; Pacific Southwest Center of Excellence in Vector-     Borne Diseases; School of Veterinary Medicine at UW-Madison;      Southeastern Regional Center of Excellence in Vector Borne      Diseases; University of Miami Miller School of Medicine;      University of Rhode Island Center for Vector-Borne Disease;      University of Rhode Island TickEncounter Resource Center; US      Biologic; Western Gulf Center of Excellence for Vector-borne      Disease.                                  ____            Letter of Support for the TICK Act--May 21, 2019       Please pass along my sincere gratitude to Senator Collins      for taking on this fight on our behalf. This has been a 10-     year crusade for me with the first 5 years fighting for my      life and the latter, fighting on behalf of others.       Bit by a tick in Oct 2009 while outside doing fall clean up      with my husband, I was misdiagnosed for the next 2.5 years by      23 doctors and specialist from panic attacks to chronic      fatigue to fibromyalgia. When a scan revealed lesions on my      brain appeared and my neurological symptoms intensified, I      was tested and diagnosed with MS. When my symptoms became      even more severe and I was not responding to treatment, I was      reevaluated and my diagnosis changed to Parkinson's. When I      began to have trouble swallowing and using my arms and legs      was a daily challenged, my medical providers wanted me tested      for ALS. I knew that was a death sentence for me and it was      at this point I knew that I needed to fight. This was when I      spoke out for the first time and advocated for myself.       Thanks to my sister in law who kept pressing me to be      checked for Lyme disease, even though I had 4 negative tests,      I demanded to see a provider who knew about Lyme. My primary      refused to give me a referral because that was not what they      thought I had. The intern gave me a scrap of paper with the      name of someone he knew saw Lyme patients and that doctor,      number 24, saved my life.       Shortly thereafter, with bloodwork and additional tests, I      was diagnosed with late stage neurological Lyme, Babesia,      Bartonella, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Erlichiosis.       These medical providers who knew more about Lyme and tick-     borne disease not only saved my life but gave my life back to      me.       Today, I am in full remission going on 5 years.       In April of 2014, I co-founded and became President of      Midcoast Lyme Disease Support & Education (MLDSE), a      charitable nonprofit 501c3 organization that travels      statewide, hosting year-round free educational and prevention      talks and event. We advocate for changes at state and federal      levels and provide support to those in Maine afflicted by      tick-borne disease by connecting them to medical providers      and financial assistance programs. We are the Maine partner      of the national Lyme Disease Association, members of Maine's      CDC Vector-borne Work Group and active in Maine's Lyme      legislation. In 2018, I wore a federal hat as the co-chair to      the HHS Tick-borne Disease Working Group's Access to Care      Services and Patient Support subcommittee. I honored to have      been selected for that role as it defines who I am these      days, sitting in the trenches alongside patients and their      families and connecting them with whatever services they need      as they journey back towards health and wellness. I am not a      victim but a survivor and one who advocates for those who      cannot advocate for themselves.       This is a fulltime job for and one that I do on a voluntary      basis without pay.       Sen Collins, your support is so greatly needed as funding      is crucial to our work here on the ground as well as on the      hill. You see, when people are personally touched by      something, they fight and they fight hard to make changes. We      will not stop fighting until the status quo changes. Until      the new science is embraced and patients are treated with      fairness and equality, irregardless of the disease that they      may have. We will fight to protect the doctors who put their      careers on the line each and every day to save their      patients.       When a cancer doctor thinks outside the box and heals their      patient, they are deemed a hero. When a Lyme provider does      it, they are brought up under medical scrutiny and      disciplined beyond belief.       The governing body that exists and controls all things to      do with disease (IDSA) wrote in their guidelines a foot note      that reads as follows:       These guidelines were developed and issued on behalf of the      Infectious Diseases Society of America.       It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always      account for individual variation among patients. They are not      intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to      particular patients or special clinical situations. The      Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to      these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate      determination regarding their application to be made by the      physician in the light of each patient's individual      circumstances.       In 2013, ILADS introduced another set of diagnostic and      treatment options and after passing a rigorous qualifying      process, it was introduced into the National Guidelines      Clearinghouse but ignored by IDSA and dismissed by mainstream      medicine.       In 2015 advocates, patients and medical providers were      forced to pushed through a bill of protection [Maine Public      law LD422] to protect those knowledgeable about tick-borne      disease who choose to do just that--focus on the individual      circumstances of each patient and treat accordingly       Sen Collins, Lyme and tick-borne disease is not a cookie      cutter disease and a cookie cutter approach has failed time      and time again. With your bill, a strong push and more      funding will help with provider and patient education and      access to better diagnostic and treatment services.       Thank You so much,       Paula Jackson Jones, President and Co-Founder, Midcoast      Lyme Disease Support & Education, Co-Chair of Access to Care      Services and Patient Support, subcommittee of the HHS Federal      Tick-borne Disease Working, Group; Maine partner of the      National Lyme Disease Association; Member of Maine CDC      Vector-Borne Workgroup; Active in Maine's Lyme Legislation      movement.
