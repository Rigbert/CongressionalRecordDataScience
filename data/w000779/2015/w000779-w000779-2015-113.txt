President, since World War I, military working dogs have worked side-by-side with our men and women in uniform in various roles and operations. Today military working dogs routinely assist U.S. troops on dangerous front-line assignments, helping to detect roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices, saving hundreds of American lives and preventing countless injuries. Moreover, both on and off the battlefield, these dogs represent critical partners, invaluable team members, and cherished companions.  Unlike traditional soldiers, a canine's service does not necessarily end when it reaches retirement. Instead, military working dogs often continue to support our nation by acting as service dogs for veterans suffering from mental and physical disabilities. Because of the close bond forged by their shared experiences in the military, these dogs can play a unique and important role in for our veterans--quite literally saving lives even once they return to the home front.  Unfortunately, it is not always so easy for former dog handlers to be reunited with their four-legged comrades-in-arms. Because of the way the law is currently written, the Department of Defense is not required to bring military working dogs back to the United States upon retirement. As such, most military working dogs end up being retired overseas wherever they end their service. As a result, former handlers, veterans, and other members of the military community wishing to adopt a dog may be forced to cover the cost of transporting the dog halfway across the world.  Our Nation's veterans deserve to be reunited with their canine counterparts and they should not have to shoulder the official costs and fees associated with doing so. To correct this situation, I am introducing the Military Working Dog Retirement Act. By requiring the Department of Defense to arrange and pay for the transportation of retiring military working dogs to the United States, this bill is a key step to ensuring former military dog handlers may benefit from the continued partnership and service of these loyal canines. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1498       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. REQUIREMENT FOR RETIREMENT OF MILITARY WORKING                    DOGS IN THE UNITED STATES.       (a) In General.--Section 2583 of title 10, United States      Code, is amended--       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections      (g) and (h), respectively;       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new      subsection (f):       ``(f) Retirement of Military Working Dogs Within the United      States.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the      retirement of a military working dog under this section shall      occur at a location within the United States.       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the retirement of a      military working dog abroad if a United States citizen living      abroad adopts the dog at the time of retirement.       ``(3) Amounts available to the military department      concerned shall be available for the costs of the transport      of military working dogs to the United States for retirement      in accordance with the requirement in paragraph (1).''; and       (3) in subsection (g), as redesignated by paragraph (1)--       (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking      ``the Secretary of the military department concerned'' and      all that follows through ``may'' and inserting ``a military      working dog is to be retired in accordance with the      requirement in subsection (f)(1) and no suitable adoption is      available at the military facility where the dog is located      at the time of retirement, the Secretary of the military      department concerned shall''; and       (B) by inserting ``within the United States'' after      ``another location''.
