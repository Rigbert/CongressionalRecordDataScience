Mr. Speaker, racism, ethnic hatred, and xenophobia are the bane of any civilized society. Our own country has had to battle with these phenomena in the past and continues to do so today.  In Europe, with the end of the Cold War, we have unfortunately seen a resurrection of racist attitudes and activities that had not been eradicated with the defeat of Nazism, just driven underground.  In Russia, a nation whose past has seen terrible instances of anti-Semitism both in the Tsarist and Communist eras, anti-Semitism had seemingly been exiled to the pages of rabidly nationalistic newspapers catering only to the political fringes. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism has now come in out of the cold into more comfortable confines--specifically into the halls of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament. In fairness, I should say that anti-Semitism has found refuge in the ranks of one particular political party in the Duma--the Communist Party. Last October, at two public rallies, a Communist Party member of the Duma, Albert Makashov, threatened ``the Yids'' and other ``reformers and democrats'' with physical retribution for allegedly causing Russia's current problems.  Incidentally, I have seen films of Mr. Makashov's performance. It is quite sobering.  When conscientious members of the Duma attempted to censure Mr. Makashov, the Communist Party majority voted down the resolution, and substituted a watered down resolution condemning ethnic hatred in general.  In early December, at hearings in the Duma, Communist Party member and chairman of the Defense Committee, Victor Ilyukhin blamed President Yeltsin's ``Jewish entourage'' for alleged ``genocide against the Russian people.'' In response to the public outcry, both in Russia and abroad, Communist Party chairman Zyuganov explained that the Party had nothing against ``Jews,'' just ``Zionism.''  Mr. Speaker, it would be hypocritical for me or any other member of this body to pretend that racism and anti-Semitism do not occasionally rear their ugly heads in our own political process. However, the leadership of the two major American political parties consistently rejects racist or anti-Semitic individuals as officeholders or candidates for office. For instance, the national Republican Party leadership has disassociated itself from a former member of the Ku Klux Klan running for office on the Republican Party ballot in Louisiana. Similarly, when a local Klan leader in California ran for Congress on the Democratic Party ticket a few years ago, the national party leadership repudiated his candidacy and refused to support him. That is why it is so disappointing to see the leadership of the Communist Party in Russia attempt to rationalize anti-Semitic statements made by its members.  Incidentally, I should add that since these incidents Mr. Makashov and Mr. Ilyukhin have stated that in the next parliamentary elections they will run on a ticket separate from the Communist Party.  In any event, I believe the Congress should unequivocally condemn the anti-Semitic statements made by members of the Russian Duma. With this in mind, today I am introducing, along with Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Wolf, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Porter, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Salmon, a resolution which condemns anti-Semitic statements made by members of the Russian Duma while commending actions taken by fair-minded members of the Duma to censure the purveyors of anti-Semitism within their ranks. In addition, this resolution commends President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian Government for their forceful rejection of such statements. Finally, this resolution reiterates the firm belief of the Congress that peace and justice cannot be achieved as long as governments and legislatures promote policies based upon anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join us in support of this resolution.                          ____________________
