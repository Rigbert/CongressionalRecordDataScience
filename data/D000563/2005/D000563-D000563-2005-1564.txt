President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is very discreet in how he explains his view of dealing with judges, that every judge should be allowed a majority up-or-down vote. That is not a bad concept if that really was what the Senator from Pennsylvania could point to in his own record. Under President Clinton's administration, nine of the President's judicial nominees to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were confirmed by the Senate, while eight were never even given hearings before the Judiciary Committee. So the Senators who are now begging for majority votes and majority rules thought nothing of closeting and burying these judicial nominees under the Clinton administration, to the point where they had no possibility of being confirmed.  Let me be specific. John Bingler was nominated by President Clinton. Senator Santorum exercised his discretion over nominations in his State and held up this nomination for 2 years, until Mr. Bingler withdrew.  Robert Freedberg, another nominee by President Clinton. Senator Santorum delayed the entire slate of judicial candidates, saying the President didn't honor an earlier agreement to nominate a particular Pittsburgh attorney whom he, Senator Santorum, wanted.  Lynette Norton. As was reported by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette on July 22, 2000:       Sen. Rick Santorum insisted yesterday the Senate will not      act on any nomination for the U.S. District Court here until      next presidential administration . . .  He was very clear on what his agenda was: it was to hold up nominations that were going to be filled by President Clinton until, hopefully, in hiseyes, a Republican President was elected.  Repeatedly, Senator Santorum used his own form of a filibuster to deny even a hearing or a vote in the Senate to these judicial nominees. Now he stands aghast, appalled, incredulous, that anyone would oppose a judicial nominee of President Bush.  We should stand by the traditions of the Senate. Let's not change the rules in the middle of the game. Let's not violate the time-honored principle of checks and balances which says the Senate as an institution will have the last word on lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.  Even though President Bush has been successful with over 95 percent of his nominees being approved by the Senate, mark my words, a few of them should not have been approved for lifetime appointments. Our view on our side of the aisle, both liberal and conservative, a handful went too far. Their positions on the role of Government in protecting our health and safety, the role of Government in protecting our environment, the rights of women, privacy under our Constitution, their views were so extreme and so radical they were not deserving, at least to the mind of many of my colleagues, to have a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.  It is best when in doubt to stick with the Constitution. It is best when in doubt to stick with the traditions of the Senate. It is best when in doubt to stick with the filibuster, which requires compromise, requires bipartisanship, and moves us to a point where we can and must work together to achieve goals of this Nation and to serve the people who were kind enough to give us this great opportunity.                          ____________________[Pages S4442-S4443]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           FILIBUSTER HISTORY
