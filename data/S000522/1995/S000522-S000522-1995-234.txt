Mr. Speaker, we are only days away from the 6th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre which was the Chinese Government's violent response to the peaceful prodemocracy demonstrations of students and other Chinese citizens in 1989.  As the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement approaches, the Chinese Government now turns its attention to prominent dissidents who have petitioned the Government for greater tolerance of dissent. Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 movement, is among those who have been detained.  The men and women who bravely stand up for human rights, democractic reform, and greater tolerance deserve our support and encouragement. They are the hope for the future of China. However, disturbing trends of abuse of human rights call us to realistic see the Chinese Government for what it is: butchers and despots who have no regard for human life and dignity.  In the course of the last 2 years we have watched as human rights have continued to deteriorate in China. New laws which restrict religious activity for both the underground and Government-sponsored Christian were issued in January 1994.  Recent reports confirm that the Chinese Government's attack on religious believers is increasing. During the Easter celebration the Public Security Bureau in Linchuan County arrested 40 pro-Vatican Catholics suspected of organizing a Mass attended by nearly 20,000 worshipers. Eleven of these people are still being detained.  A Protestant minister, Li Dexian, his wife, and several companions were arrested and detained in April while conducting a worship service. Pastor Li was beaten and kicked during this detention. This was the fourth time he was arrested in 4 months.  And citizens of two predominantly Catholic villages in Liangshou County have been forced to flee their homes and go into hiding to escape the brutal torture by the population control officials because they refuse to follow the one-child-per-couple policy. They refuse to bow to the new population slogan of ``Better to have more graves than more than one child.'' The villagers report that they have been subjected to being hanged upside down and having their tongues burned with electric wires.  The new law on maternal and infant health care enacted in October 1994 is in actuality a eugenic law, reminiscent of the Nazi eugenic policies of an earlier era. This law prohibits marriage between people if one of them has ``a serious hereditary disease, which is medically deemed unsuitable for reproduction'' unless the couple would agree to take long-lasting contraceptive measures or give up child bearing by undergoing ligation.'' The law further states that when a woman is determined to be carrying a child that may carry ``serious hereditary diseases * * * or have a serious deformity,'' the pregnancy should be terminated.  Dr. John Aird, former Chief of the China Branch at the U.S. Census Bureau, said ``Coercion in the Chinese family planning program has in the past 2 years reached its second extreme peak approaching or perhaps exceeding the levels of 1983.''  Couples have no right to determine the number and spacing of their children. Those that choose to violate the one-child-per-couple policy may be hunted down like animals. Women are forced to abort their babies, many are sterilized. Those that do have a second or third child are usually subjected to loss of jobs and property, harassment, and fines that far exceed their income.  Another area of concern is the extensive prison labor system which exists in China. No other system like it exists in the world today. It is the most extensive forced-labor system in the world, and this system has destroyed the lives of millions of people, and it continues to do so.  When I was in China last year I met with several people who bear the permanent scars of years in Chinese prison labor camps. I heard their stories of beating and torture and saw for myself the broken bodies which these camps create.  New, disturbing evidence that prisoners are being executed so their body parts can be sold for transplants is now coming to light. There are even reports that some prisoners are having their kidneys removed before they are dead. Harry Wu, himself a survivor of the prison labor system has documented this body trafficking practice on film. How much more do we need to see before we are convinced that the Chinese Government has no concern for human life whatsoever?  Concern for human rights in China has been virtually ignored by the Clinton administration since last year's renewal of MFN. Official after official has traveled to China and human rights has not been on their agenda.  Mr. Clinton has an opportunity to lessen the damage done by extending MFN at the cost of human rights when he attends the G-7 meeting in Nova Scotia on June 15. I join my colleagues in urging the President to raise the deterioration of human rights in China at this meeting.  But should he forget the dissidents, the prisoners, the tortured, the abused, the murdered, we Members of Congress will not. The Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, has held two hearings on human rights abuses in China. The first on the Laogai prison labor system, the second on the coercive population control policies. These were the first hearings of their kind to be held by a congressional committee. Future hearings will focus on other forms of human rights abuse in China.  The Chinese people who value freedom, democracy, and human rights deserve our support.                          ____________________
