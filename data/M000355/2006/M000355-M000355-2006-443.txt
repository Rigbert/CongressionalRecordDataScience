 President, today we made good progress on the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Tomorrow we will continue on it. It is the hope and expectation of the majority leader and Chairman Gregg that we will complete the bill by tomorrow evening. If Senators have amendments to offer, they should be working with the bill managers in order to get those amendments in the queue for consideration tomorrow. Obviously, we will have a busy day with votes throughout the day. Again, let me remind everyone it is the intention of the leader and the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee that we finish the bill tomorrow night. I have every confidence that with everyone's cooperation, we will be able to do that.                          ____________________[Page S7444]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
