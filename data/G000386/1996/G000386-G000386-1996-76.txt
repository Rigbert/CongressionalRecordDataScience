 President, I am going to offer my first amendment. I am going to explain the amendment before I send it to the desk, Mr. President.  Some people think that once we pay for the U.S.-flag companies, the $2 million of corporate welfare that we pay per year, per vessel, with this bill that we will not have to pay them again to carry actual war sustainment cargoes. I think the managers of the bill have, in speaking in opposition to some ofmy amendments, have suggested that we got this $2.1 billion corporate welfare subsidy per ship, per vessel; that that is all we ever have to pay.  But what we are paying for, if I can tell my colleagues, is the right and the obligation of those companies to have those ships available, or similar ships available, to do what the Department of Defense requires to meet our national security obligations.  But once those ships are brought in to meet our national security obligations--that is presumably when we have to deliver things during war--then we have additional costs, because we will have to pay again to carry the actual war sustainment cargoes. So the fact that we just paid $2.1 million of corporate welfare subsidy per year, per vessel, that that is the end of it, is simply not the case.  There are more charges. H.R. 1350 allows these carriers, even though they have already received this heavy corporate welfare subsidy, they will be able to charge to carry war sustainment materials at what is called ``fair and reasonable'' rates.  My amendment deals with the subject of fair and reasonable rates. Unfortunately, these rates are anything but fair and reasonable to the taxpayers. That is what this Government is all about, getting the taxpayers the most for their money, at least that is what it is supposed to do.  OK. Why is this way not fair and reasonable to the taxpayers? It is because Congress failed in its responsibilities to the taxpayers to define ``fair and reasonable'' and has left to the Maritime Administration the right to come up with its own definition of ``fair and reasonable.'' The problem with this is that the Maritime Administration views its primary responsibility, not to the American taxpayer, but instead to the welfare of U.S. maritime companies and seafarers.  Therefore, under the guise of ``fair and reasonable,'' taxpayers are forced to pay an extra $450 million a year above world market rates to ship defense cargoes. When you include other agencies that can be involved in paying part of this bill, the taxpayers' bill runs up to $600 million a year.  Price gouging is even worse when we need these U.S. flags for war. During the Persian Gulf effort, they charged taxpayers an extra $625 million. Again, I want to quote other authorities. You might recall on September 10, 1990, in U.S. News & World Report, an article entitled ``Unpatriotic Profits.''       The Pentagon is miffed at what it feels is profiteering by      the operators of two U.S. cargo ships. Because the Navy is      required to use American bottoms before contracting with      foreign-owned ships, it paid the two U.S. carriers $70,000 to      send war materiel to the gulf. The comparable foreign bid was      $6,000.  We paid $70,000, when a comparable bid could cost only $6,000. In other words, if our people had been on their toes, or if the Maritime Administration had been looking out for the taxpayers, we could have shipped that materiel for $64,000 less.  Before somebody tells me that the GAO concluded that neither U.S. flags nor foreign flags gouged taxpayers during the Persian Gulf war, I want to remind anybody who might refer to that of two things: First, the GAO auditing uses the liberal measure, such as ``fair and reasonable,'' not anything close to what the rate would be in a competitive market.  Second, the fact is, a U.S.-flag company did overcharge the Defense Department by $18 million for Persian Gulf war transport services. This matter is still pending before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeal. So the Defense Department is concerned about being overcharged $18 million.  The Defense Department has made no claims of overcharging by foreign-flag vessels. In fact, foreign flags typically cost one-half to one-third the cost of comparable U.S.-flag vessels during the gulf war. One-half to one-third less.  My amendment embraces taxpayers' protection similar to Buy-America laws. For instance, under buy America, agencies are required to buy products from U.S. companies, but if the same product can be purchased from a foreign company at 6 percent less than what the U.S. company charges, the Government can buy from foreign sources.  So you see, I am using definitions in law today. I am applying that definition in other sections of the code applying to other purchases of service to the maritime industry as it is used in our war efforts.  My amendment uses the very same Buy-America market test of 6 percent. So if my amendment were in place, then U.S.-flag companies, if they would charge more than 6 percent above what can be secured from a foreign-flag vessel, the Government has a right to hire the foreign-flag vessel. This amendment will also prohibit a new scheme that allows U.S.-flag carriers to charge the Defense Department what they would charge infrequent or spot customers.  Mr. President, let me confer here just a minute.  Mr. President, I am sorry. I was explaining my Buy-America amendment and saying we use the same 6 percent test. That would apply then to our maritime industry, like that 6 percent test applies to others. So we would prohibit, then, paying more than 6 percent above what competition would charge.  My amendment also has a second portion by prohibiting a new scheme that allows U.S.-flag carriers to charge the Defense Department what they would charge infrequent or spot customers. My amendment makes certain that this bill will require that U.S.-flag vessels give taxpayers the same rate that they gave their volume customers like the JC Penneys of the world.  This idea also comes from a lot of activity of other Members in this body to apply the same principle. For instance, in pharmaceuticals, you may remember a lot of debate we had in this body on the purchase of Medicare pharmaceuticals, that Medicare would not be charged any more than the largest volume price that the company would give to one of its other customers. We apply that principle here to this bill.  This amendment is not only essential for protecting the taxpayers, as these other amendments have been--some of this is even law in other provisions of the code--but, also, I offer this amendment because I think it is necessary that we slowly and gradually nudge our U.S. merchant marine into the competitive world.  We have done it with our railroads. We have done it with our airlines. We have done it with our truckers, my gosh, almost 20 years ago. It is about time we start doing it with the maritime.  Our deficit-riddled Government can no longer afford to allow the maritime lobby to block efforts to negotiate worldwide maritime reforms. There is another bill in this Congress sitting around here right now that has something to do with that. It may not pass because of the opposition of some, not all, of the maritime industry to competing in the real world out there. Then they will argue, won't they, that they need subsidies because foreign competition is unfair. So I say they cannot have it both ways.  Some time ago in a Journal of Commerce article entitled ``On the Evils of Maritime Subsidies,'' former Maritime Administrator, Adm. Harold E. Shear, stated--and I quote:       Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise      of the U.S. merchant marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more      than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive,      and dependence upon Uncle Sam.  That is the statement of a former maritime administrator. He has been there. He has seen the entire industry. He has watched it over a period of time. That is what he had to say.  I feel that time is running out on the U.S.-flag merchant marine. They must become competitive and give up government welfare. This legislation deals with that.  Once again, I want to speak about several grassroots organizations located here in town that speak for the American people on wasteful Government spending, who support my efforts on this amendment and on this bill. The Americans for Tax Reform ``strongly opposes the continuation of maritime subsidies in any form and strongly urges you to remove any such subsidies from the bill.''  We also have a letter from the Council of Citizens Against Government Waste, cosigned as well by the National Taxpayers Union. We also have a letter from Citizens for a Sound Economy.  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Americans for Tax Reform,                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.       Dear Senator: The ``Maritime Reform and Security Act of      1995'' is now pending in this Senate. Americans for Tax      Reform strongly opposes the continuation of commercial      maritime subsidies in any form and strongly urges you to      remove any such subsidies from the bill.       Numerous independent studies have illustrated the needless      and excessive cost of commercial maritime subsidies to the      U.S. taxpayer. For example, a 1989 Department of      Transportation report done by MIT entitled ``Competitive      Manning of U.S.-flag Vessels'' exposed serious waste in this      program and determined that maritime subsidies could be      reduced by half if there was, in fact a military need for      these ships. Even Al Gore has concluded that these subsidies      should be abolished.       Like many proponents of increased government intervention,      supporters of this legislation assert that it is necessary      for national security reasons. However, this legislation is      not likely to be at all effective in accomplishing that task.      In fact, the Department of Defense's Mobility Requirements      Study, Bottom Up Review Update concluded that even without      subsidies, the U.S. fleet would be adequate in the event it      was needed in time of conflict. If the United States military      can meets its requirements without these subsidies, why are      we asking the American taxpayer to foot the bill?       The subsidies contained in the Maritime Reform and Security      Act of 1995 are particularly egregious examples of a bloated      federal government spending taxpayers' money on a project      that is wholly unnecessary. This Congress has shown its      willingness to eliminate ridiculous pork-barrel spending. Why      is the Senate even considering extending a program that costs      American taxpayers more than $100,000 per job subsidized      annually?       Let's get rid of this wasteful and inefficient program once      and for all.           Sincerely,     Grover G. Norquist.                                                                    ____         Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, National            Taxpayers Union,                                               September 17, 1996.       Dear Senator: Most members of the 104th Congress have      prided themselves on ending welfare as we know it.      Unfortunately, the Senate may soon consider H.R. 1350, the      ``Maritime Security Act,'' which is nothing more than      corporate and labor union welfare. The Council for Citizens      Against Government Waste will key vote these votes for our      1996 Congressional Ratings. And because they do not key vote      per se, the National Taxpayers Union will weigh heavily these      votes for their analysis of the 104th Congress.       Taxpayer watchdog and public interest groups asked to      testify at public hearings to expose this welfare for      shipping companies, but were denied that opportunity.      Therefore, the undersigned organizations oppose this bill and      will key vote (or weigh heavily) final passage unless several      pro-taxpayer amendments to be offered by Sen. Grassley (R-     Iowa) and others are adopted.       According to an internal 1993 White House memo to President      Clinton from then-Assistant to the President for Economic      Policy Robert Rubin, the primary reason for this $1 billion      subsidy is to pay for the exorbitant salaries and benefits of      union seafarers.       In addition, this internal White House memo cited the      Defense Department's (DoD) argument that it needed as few as      20 U.S.-flag vessels. DoD also proposed a deficit-neutral      plan to pay for new subsidies. The DoD plan was supported by      the heads of 15 executive branch agencies. Only one-     Transportation Secretary Pena--opposed this deficit-neutral      plan because it ``provides less support than is sought by the      industry and its supporters.''       This is one of my reasons why we join opposition to this      bill, and will key vote final passage if the Senate fails to      pass Sen. Grassley's pro-taxpayer amendments, especially      those that provide protections to taxpayers from maritime      rate price gouging and prohibit subsidies from being used for      campaign and lobbying purposes.           Sincerely,     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.     National Taxpayers Union.                                                                    ____                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.       Dear Senator: On behalf of our 250,000 members across      America, I want to express our strong opposition to H.R.      1350, the so-called Maritime Security Act, and our strong      support for the amendments to this bill offered by Senator      Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). The amendments would limit the      cost to taxpayers from this proposal without weakening our      national defense.       The Act has less to do with maritime policy reform and      national security than with corporate welfare. Indeed, this      initiative would hand out a staggering $1 billion in      subsidies over the next decade to the private merchant marine      fleet, without any compelling national security interest or      other rationale. It would reward maritime special interests      that have been highly vocal on this issue--contributing some      $17 million to candidates for political office over the last      decade. For taxpayers and consumers, it is quite another      story. Assuming, conservatively, that the overall annual cost      of present maritime policies is $5 billion, the average cost      per seagoing job is no less than $375,000.       Yet, as Harold E. Shear, a retired navy admiral, concluded:      ``Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise      of the U.S. merchant marine. . . . Subsidies to nothing more      than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and      dependence on Uncle Sam.'' We believe that Mr. Shear, who has      overseen the administration of these subsidies as maritime      administrator, knows what he is talking about.       Supporter of maritime subsidies--and H.R. 1350 in      particular--maintain that only a U.S.-owned, U.S.-flagged,      U.S.-manned commercial fleet can support the military in      emergencies. This argument is a red herring. First, as      Admiral Shear points out, the impact of subsidies on the U.S.      commercial fleet has been questionable at best. Moreover,      there is an enormous amount of capacity available on the open      market that can deliver more services more reliably at lower      cost. The Military Sealift Command made heavy use of foreign      ships staffed by non-U.S. citizens in the Gulf War. Only 17      ships out of the 500 that went into the war zone during the      Gulf War were from the active U.S. flag commercial fleet--     only six of these had ever received the subsidies.       In 1993, 15 out of 16 government agencies supported an      option presented to President Clinton to limit these      subsidies. This is how now-Secretary of the Treasury Robert      Rubin described this option in his June 30, 1993 ``Decision      Memorandum on Maritime Issues.'':       ``Subsidies for the U.S. flag feet have always been      justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity for      use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War      DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's      bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense,      the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander      of the Transportation Command have already concluded that      future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels . . .      This opinion would meet DOD'S maximum military      requirements.'' [H.R. 1350 subsidizes 47 vessels.]       We strongly support Seanator Grassley's attempt to address      many of the more egregious problems with this bill. Senator      Grassley's seven amendments would:       Eliminate the provisions in H.R. 1350 that for the first      time would exempt U.S.-flag vessels from requisitioning, to      ensure that vessel operators who receive taxpayer funding      cannot escape their obligations in time of war;       Require that all subsidized U.S. vessels are utilized      before foreign-flag vessels may be hired;       Require subsidized seafarers to serve when needed or lose      their license to work on U.S.-flag vessels for five years;       Prohibit recipients of the handouts provided in the bill      from using the money to make contributions to political      campaigns. This would make it harder for the maritime lobby      to use taxpayer dollars to press Washington for more taxpayer      dollars;       Preclude subsidies from being used in so-called ``public      education'' efforts;       Require that war bonuses paid to seafarers be harmonized      with the war bonuses the Pentagon pays regular military      personnel. According to Persian Gulf War data, taxpayers can      be forced to pay seafarers war bonuses that are 50 times      greater than the war bonuses paid to active military      personnel;       Limit maximum vessel rates to no more than 6 percent above      world market rates. Currently, the Maritime Administration      appears to interpret ``fair and reasonable'' rates to mean      whatever rates cover the cost of operation plus a profit      margin of about 13 percent and keep as many seafarers in      business as possible.       The American taxpayer--who on average makes less than      $29,000 per year--is unlikely in the long term to reward      those politicians who grant a government subsidy of over      $50,000 a year to a commercial sailor who works no more than      six months per year.       We want to emphasize, that our endorsement of the Grassley      amendments should not, in any way, be construed as an      endorsement of the bill. We believe that, first, this bill      should be defeated. Should that prove impossible, we believe      the Grassley amendments must be passed in order to reduce      special interest subsidies and soften the blow to taxpayers.           Sincerely,                                                     Paul Beckner,                                                        President.
