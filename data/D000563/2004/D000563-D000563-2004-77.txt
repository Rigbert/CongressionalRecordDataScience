President, let me say in response to the Senator from Alaska before he leaves the floor--I want to let him know I want to respond to his comments so there will be no mistake about it.  First, the statement that Ambassador Bremer's comments had something to do with classified information, what I have said on the floor was based upon some front pages of the newspapers. Ambassador Bremer was reported to have said to a private organization in a speech that one of the problems we have in Iraq today stems from the fact that we had an inadequate number of troops in the field to bring stability, to stop the looting and violence immediately after the deposition of Saddam Hussein. That is not classified. It is on the front pages of the newspapers. Ambassador Bremer has now backed away from those comments. But the fact is he made them, and many believe the same thing--that we had an inadequate number of troops at the right and appropriate moment and are paying the price today because the insurgency has grown.  Second, last night Vice President Cheney, and this morning the Senator from Alaska, make a great deal about the so-called Ayman al-Zawahiri link, a ruthless terrorist who is affiliated with al-Qaida. The Vice President made the statement last night that the Senator made today--that there was a linkage between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Saddam Hussein and, therefore, proof positive al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein were working together justified the invasion.  I commend to my colleagues and those following the debate this morning's report from MSNBC.com from Washington:       A CIA report has found no conclusive evidence that former      Iraqi President Saddam Hussein harbored Ayman al-Zawahiri      which the Bush administration asserted before the invasion of      Iraq.  This is a fact. It comes from the President's own CIA. They continue to build these straw men to justify an invasion when the facts don't back them up--no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear arsenal, no evidence of bringing in yellowcake from Niger, no evidence of linkage with al-Qaida. And they cling tenaciously and stubbornly to these assertions even though the facts defeat them.  How can you trust an administration that will not accept the facts and reality to prepare a defense for America? Shouldn't the defense of our Nation be based on reality rather than theory? Shouldn't it be based on sound intelligence instead of political ideology? I would think so.  Any President who comes to this office with a predetermined set of ideas on what we need to do to protect America regardless of the facts is not serving our country well. I hope both political parties would acknowledge that.                           Amendment No. 3801  Let me also say we are about to consider in the early parts of the debate this morning an amendment by Senator Kyl to the underlying bill on intelligence reform. I oppose this amendment. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing it.  We have come together with a bipartisan agreement on the civil liberties board. It is a board which has been created by both sides of the aisle working to implement the recommendations in the 9/11 Commission report. What Senator Kyl is trying to do is take away some important powers and responsibilities of this board.  For example, he wants to eliminate the board's standard of review. This is the standard that the board uses to take a look at proposed expansions of the government's power and make sure they don't infringe on rights. What Senator Kyl suggests is we take away the standard of review from the civil liberties board. That would frankly create a ship above water.  We need to make sure this board has a standard of review so they can look at government actions and decide whether they go too far. That is what the 9/11 Commission suggested and that is what we should stick to.  Senator Kyl's amendment also would remove the Board's subpoena power. He said he would be concerned that this civil liberties board would be subpoenaing members of our Government, agents of our Government, to come in from all over the world and give them evidence. I hope the Senator from Arizona will read this provision more carefully and more closely because the subpoena authority in this bill is very narrow. It only applies to people outside of the Government.  The Kyl amendment would also eliminate the requirement of the board to inform the public about its activities in a manner consistent with protecting classified information. This directly contradicts the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. We are talking about protecting the American public's rights, liberties, and freedoms. It is essential that the work of the civil liberties board be made public so the American people can understand what they are doing and whether our Government has gone too far. Why the Senator from Arizona would want to keep secrecy and a veil over this activity, I don't understand.  I certainly hope we reject the Kyl amendment which would demolish the Collins-Lieberman civil liberties board, a bipartisan creation. It would upset the delicate balance between government powers and civil liberties this bill strikes. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
