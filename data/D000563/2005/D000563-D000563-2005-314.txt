But it is interesting, what a timely question. We are about to consider a tax bill. This tax bill will give a break to millionaires. If you happen to be a millionaire in America, we think you need a tax break of $35,000 a year. Poor souls. If you happen to be making between $50 and $200,000, the tax break turns into $112 dollars; under $50,000, $6. The point is, we are going to spend billions of dollars giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people and not giving a helping hand to the men and women in uniform and the employers who patriotically stand behind them.  I say to the Senator from Louisiana, she couldn't have a more timely observation.
