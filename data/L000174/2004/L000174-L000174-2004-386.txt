President, yesterday the Judiciary Committee met in public session to discuss how best to proceed with the investigation into the theft and dissemination of confidential Judiciary Committee computer files. Over the last several weeks and months Democratic Senators have shown great patience with the process.  Last week, the chairman of our committee made the report of the Sergeant at Arms into this matter publicly available. For days, Senators have been consulting about the follow-up investigation that is now needed. Over the last few weeks a number of Senators, Republicans and Democrats, have acknowledged that these matters, now documented in the report of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, warrant further consideration by law enforcement officials. Along with other Senators, I have reached across the aisle to urge all Senators to now join us in a request for a special counsel to conduct the investigation necessary to complete action and assure accountability for this unprecedented partisan espionage within the Senate. Yesterday I renewed that invitation to join in our request for the appointment of a special counsel of the highest integrity and independence to follow up on this matter.  I had hoped that we could move forward together, and yesterday we did achieve a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary, which has now joined in requesting a criminal investigation by an independent prosecutor.  On Wednesday, March 10, nine Senators on the committee sent a letter to the Justice Department seeking the appointment of special counsel in this matter. Thursday morning, March 11, nine Republican Senators wrote to Chairman Hatch and noted:       [W]e are now certain that only a determination by a      professional prosecutor as to whether any laws were violated      will bring this matter to a just and timely resolution.  Yesterday all members on the Judiciary Committee endorsed having a professional prosecutor free from politics consider these matters without regard to partisanship.  Last night Republicans and Democrats joined in another letter to the Justice Department to request ``appointment of a prosecutor of the highest integrity and independence to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute all potential crimes related to the access and dissemination of Judiciary Committee staff files'' outlined in the report by the Senate Sergeant at Arms.  Someone who is removed from politics is essential. As we outline in our March 10 letter, many of us are concerned that it be special counsel and that the Attorney General recuse himself from the process for a number of reasons. In the March 12 letter from Senators Schumer, Graham, Durbin, Chambliss, Kennedy and DeWine, they likewise note that the prosecutor handling the matter must be ``free from all conflicts and appearances of conflict.'' They suggest that Patrick Fitzgerald, who has been given responsibility for the investigation of the lead of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, would be an ``ideal candidate'' and that his mandate is a good model for that of the prosecutor to whom is assigned responsibility for investigation of the matter of the Judiciary Committee computer files.  With respect to the Sergeant at Arms' report, I, again, thank him and his staff for operating in a nonpartisan way and in the best tradition of the Senate. The report shows, without question, that the secret surveillance and stealing of confidential computer files was calculated, systematic and sweeping in its scope. After reading the report, there is a lot more that we do know: We know that more than 4,000 computer files were stolen. We know that the stealing of Democratic computer files occurred over an extended period of time, from at least 2001 into 2003. We know that numerous staff members of Republican Senators and Republican Senate leadership were aware of this activity. We know that what was done was improper, unethical and likely criminal.  However, after reading the report, there is still a lot that we do not know. We do not know how the computer files and the information contained therein were exploited. We do not know whether the stolen computer files or the information in them were shared with the Department of Justice directly or indirectly. We do not know whether they were shared with the White House directly or indirectly. We do not know whether they were shared with any of the nominees. We do not know what stolen files or information contained therein was shared with partisan advocacy groups on the right. Those are among the questions that a special counsel with the tools to conduct a criminal investigation and compel testimony and information may discern. Indeed, the Sergeant-at-Arms report acknowledges many of its limitations and those on the authority of that office to get all the facts.  I hope Senators who care about accountability and the rule of law, and those interested in repairing the damage by this unprecedented spying campaign will support our request for the prompt appointment of a special prosecutor to conduct the criminal investigation into the theft of our computer files that is still needed. I hope the Justice Department will move quickly, properly assign this matter, and conduct an investigation to get to the bottom of the unprecedented wrongdoing that we have suffered.  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the letters of March 10, March 11 and March 12 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2004.     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to request that      the Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into      the theft and use of Democratic computer files from the      Senate Judiciary Committee computer server and appoint a      special counsel to conduct that investigation.       A criminal investigation into the theft and use of these      files is warranted. In addition to press accounts since the      middle of November 2003 about the stolen computer files,      there has been an investigation by Senator Hatch of his staff      and a Senate Sergeant-at-Arms inquiry into this matter.      Neither of these investigations had the tools a federal      prosecutor has available to compel testimony or subpoena      evidence in order to investigate fully who stole or spied on      Democratic computer files and how the stolen files were used.       Based on the recent report of the Sergeant-at-Arms, it      appears that from some time in 2001 until at least the spring      of 2003, and possibly until November 2003, staff of      Republican Senators stole and used information from internal      and confidential Democratic office computer files, including      memoranda from counsel to Senators. Republican staff      knowingly exceeded authorized access and intentionally      accessed materials on government computers which they knew,      from the directory and subdirectory titles, they were not      entitled to access, and thereby obtained information used for      their advantage and possibly in violation of law. They read,      download, printed, and used such files for their own personal      and partisan purposes. Employees from Senator Hatch's      Judiciary Committee staff and from Majority Leader Frist's      Republican Senate leadership staff have resigned in      connection with these activities. We believe that the      unauthorized accessing, reading, downloading, printing, and      use of these files constitute violations of multiple federal      and local criminal laws and warrant criminal investigation.       It would be in the public interest to appoint an outside      special counsel to investigate these crimes because of the      conflict of interest these cases present to the Department.      We also respectfully suggest that it would be appropriate for      you to recuse yourself from the consideration of this request      for a special counsel. Your direct involvement in this matter      would present a conflict of interest due to your recent      service as a United States Senator and your close personal      and political relationships with some of the Senators whose      offices are subjects of the investigation and with other      Members of the Judiciary Committee. In addition, several      former Republican Judiciary Committee staff members,      including two with supervisory responsibilities during the      period in question, now serve in senior positions within the      Department of Justice and others have in the recent past.       Among the many outstanding questions is whether the stolen      computer files or information derived therefrom was shared      with the Department of Justice or White House directly or      indirectly. You and your staff were actively engaged in      issues relating to judicial nominations during the period      when the activities at issue here were being carried out. As      you know, a number of Senators recently wrote to ask about      your and the Department's knowledge of, or involvement in,      the matter of the stolen computer files and information      derived therefrom. Any thorough investigation would have to      address these issues as well.       Only a special counsel can investigate this matter in a      manner that will have credibility with the public. It is      plainly in the public interest to appoint a special counsel.      Political appointees should not investigate this matter when      the very purpose of the wrongdoing was to assist with      politically sensitive judicial confirmations sought by this      Administration and managed, in large part, by the Department.      We trust that you, or your designee, will agree that a      special counsel with a reputation for integrity and impartial      decisionmaking and with appropriate experience and resources      should be appointed to conduct such an inquiry. Among those      resources would be the expertise of the Computer Crimes and      Intellectual Property Section of the Criminal Division, which      has assisted in the investigation and prosecution of similar      federal crimes. We respectfully request that a special      counsel of the highest integrity and independence be      appointed and that the special counsel receive a broad and      clear mandate for independent action, including the      discretionary ability to report to Congress and to the public      and protection against termination unless the appointing      official finds and certifies to extraordinary improprieties.       Thank you for your prompt consideration and action in      response to this request.           Sincerely,         Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator; Herb Kohl, U.S. Senator;            Charles E. Schumer, U.S. Senator; Edward M. Kennedy,            U.S. Senator; Dianne Feinstein, U.S. Senator; Richard            J. Durbin, U.S. Senator; Joseph R. Biden, Jr., U.S.            Senator; Russell D. Feingold, U.S. Senator; John            Edwards, U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2004.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman,     Senate Committee on the Judiciary.       Dear Chairman Hatch: A week has passed since the public      release of the Report on the Investigation into Improper      Access to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Computer System      (Mar. 4, 2004) prepared by the Sergeant at Arms of the United      States Senate. The Sergeant at Arms' report sets forth in      great detail factual findings regarding the improper access      of computer files belonging to Democratic staff members of      the Senate Committee on the Judiciary (the committee) by two      former Republican committee staff members. As explained in      the Sergeant at Arms' report, this investigation was      initiated in November of last year, shortly after the Wall      Street Journal and Washington Times printed articles in which      they acknowledged receipt of Democratic staff memoranda.       While it is not our place as members of the committee to      decide whether any of the acts described in the Sergeant at      Arms' report constitute criminal violations of Federal law,      we nevertheless are convinced that this is a very serious      matter that needs to be reviewed and considered by the proper      authorities at the earliest opportunity. As you know, our      goal has always been to approach this investigation in the      least politicized manner possible. We had hoped that the      committee would debate the proper course of action and arrive      at a bipartisan agreement on how to proceed with the      information revealed in the Sergeant at Arms' report.      However, we are now certain that only a determination by a      prosecutor as to whether any laws were violated will bring      this matter to a just and timely resolution. We commend your      commitment to a thorough investigation of this matter as it      affects the very integrity of our committee.           Sincerely,         Jon Kyl, John Cornyn, Jeff Sessions, Larry E. Craig, Mike            DeWine, Arlen Specter, Lindsey O. Graham, Charles E.            Grassley, Saxby Chambliss.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2004.     Hon. John D. Ashcroft,     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: We write to request that      the Department of Justice appoint a prosecutor of the highest      integrity and independence to investigate, and, if      appropriate, prosecute all potential crimes related to the      access and dissemination of Judiciary Committee staff files      outlined in the attached Report from the Senate Sergeant at      Arms. We consider this breach of Senators' privacy to be a      matter of the utmost seriousness. While we very much      appreciate the fine work of the Sergeant at Arms, we note      that the attached Report itself suggests many avenues of      additional inquiry that have not been--and indeed could not      have been--pursued by this preliminary Senate investigation.       Because of the potential for perceived and actual conflicts      of interest, the undersigned members of the Judiciary      Committee agree that this matter must be handled by a      professional prosecutor who is free from all conflicts and      appearances of conflict--or, if appropriate, a special      counsel--who has full investigatory, charging and reporting      authority; who will conduct a thorough investigation; and who      will not be removable from this assignment except in case of      extraordinary improprieties. Patrick Fitzgerald, the U.S.      Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, has been      given such independence in the investigation of the leak of      CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, and we believe that      his mandate should be a model for the mandate of the      prosecutor in this case. Indeed, we agree that Mr. Fitzgerald      himself would be an ideal candidate for this investigation as      well. At a minimum, any special counsel or other prosecutor      appointed in this matter should be of Mr. Fitzgerald's      integrity and have the same degree of independence.           Sincerely,     Charles Schumer.     Richard J. Durbin.     Edward M. Kennedy.     ------ ------     Saxby Chambliss.     Mike DeWine.                          ____________________
