President, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who is an ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee and does extremely valuable work as we try to work in a commensurate fashion on national security.  I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by my good friend from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who is vice chairman of our committee.
