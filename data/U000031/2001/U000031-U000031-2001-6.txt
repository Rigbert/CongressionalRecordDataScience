Chairman, I would like to support the Boehlert amendment, but I cannot. The technology just is not ready yet.  One of the arguments presented here today is that the auto industry cried wolf in the 1970s on new CAFE standards and at the end of the day met the standards. But at what cost? More job loss and more market share loss. Can the auto industry meet this new standard called for in this amendment? Of course they can.                              {time}  1615  But at what expense? More market loss and more job loss.  Last year, this year, next year the auto industry will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on new technologies designed to improve efficiencies and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. One of them is the hydrogen fuel cell. Well, guess what? There is a limited supply of R dollars; and if they are forced to meet this new standard, there will not be the dollars to develop this new standard.  It is hoped that those cars will be in the showrooms in the next 8 to 10 years. If this amendment passes, it will not be 8 to 10 years; it will be more than 10 years away. Is that what we want? I do not think so.  Please join me in voting no. We have the technology to make this thing work. This amendment takes those dollars away and will hurt all consumers, period.
