 President, today along with Senator Specter, I present the findings of a joint investigation by the minority staffs of the Committees on Finance and the Judiciary. It will be posted today on the Finance Committee Web site. I urge all my colleagues to read this important report.  Together, our committees conducted an extensive investigation of allegations raised by former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Gary Aguirre concerning the SEC and insider trading at a major hedge fund.  During the course of this investigation, the staff reviewed roughly 10,000 pages of documents and conducted over 30 witness interviews. The Judiciary Committee held three related hearings. Our joint findings confirm a series of failures at the SEC: (1) Failures in its enforcement division, (2) failures in personnel practices, and (3) failures at the Office of Inspector General.  There was, however, one bright spot. The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission cooperated fully with our inquiry. I would like to take a moment to thank Chairman Christopher Cox for recognizing the value of congressional oversight instead of resisting it like most other agencies do. In my years in the Senate, I have overseen many investigations of Federal agencies. I am happy to say that Chairman Cox--who inherited these problems in 2005--was a model of transparency and accountability.  I also thank Senator Specter for his hard work on this issue, and for the way our committees were able to work together so effectively.  Our investigation focused on three allegations: (1) The SEC mishandled its investigation of a major hedge fund, Pequot Capital Management. (2) The SEC fired Gary Aguirre, the lead attorney in the Pequot investigation, after he reported evidence of political influence corrupting the investigation. (3) The SEC's Office of Inspector General failed to thoroughly investigate Aguirre's allegations.  In 2001, Pequot made about $18 million in just a few weeks of trading in advance of the public announcement that General Electric was acquiring Heller Financial. Pequot accomplished this by buying over a million shares of Heller Financial and shorting GE stock. The New York Stock Exchange highlighted these suspicious and highly profitable trades for the SEC.  When the SEC finally got around to investigating the matter 3 years later, the only full-time attorney working on it, Mr. Aguirre, was up against an army of lawyers from Pequot and Morgan Stanley.  Those lawyers could easily bypass the commission staff and go directly to the Director of Enforcement. In other words, attorneys from Wall Street law firms had better access to SEC management than the staff attorney working on the case, and they used it.  When Aguirre wanted to question Wall Street executive John Mack, his supervisors blocked his efforts and delayed the testimony as long as they could. Mack was about to be hired as the CEO of Morgan Stanley. This raised a critical question in our investigation: Did Mack get special treatment, and if so, why? Gary Aguirre was told by one of his supervisors that it was because of his ``political connections.''  Our investigation uncovered no evidence that Mack's special treatment was due to partisan politics. However, internal e-mails do show that SECmanagers cared about something else: prominence--not partisanship.  They put hurdles in the way of taking Mack's testimony because he was an ``industry captain'' and well-known on Wall Street. His lawyers would have ``juice,'' according to SEC management--meaning they could easily pick up the phone and talk to senior officials three and four layers above Aguirre. Mack's prominence protected him from the initial SEC inquiry, protection that would not have been afforded to him had he been from Main Street rather than Wall Street.  Our investigation also found that Mr. Aguirre's firing from the SEC was closely connected to his objections to the special treatment afforded to John Mack. Unfortunately, that was not the only retaliation we found at the SEC. Another employee was also penalized for objecting to problems similar to Aguirre's. This sort of retaliatory firing of a whistleblower is not acceptable, and must be stopped.  Finally, our investigation found failures at the SEC's Office of Inspector General. When Mr. Aguirre presented the Inspector General's office with serious allegations, there was no attempt to conduct a serious, credible investigation.  The Inspector General merely interviewed SEC management, accepted their side of the story, and closed the case. This is unacceptable. It is the role of the inspector general to be an independent finder of fact, not a rubberstamp for agency management. I understand that the current inspector general is retiring, and his last day is today. I hope Chairman Cox chooses the next inspector general very carefully.  Our investigation has uncovered real failures at the SEC, and fixing these problems will take real reform. We have proposed six recommendations. These recommendations include the creation of a uniform, comprehensive manual of procedures for conducting enforcement investigations along the lines of the U.S. Attorney's Manual. If the SEC had such a manual, there would have been clear guidance regarding the standard for issuing a subpoena to any suspected tipper, whether John Mack or John Q. Public.  Other recommendations include the reform of the SEC's Office of Inspector General, firmer ethics requirements, and standardized evaluation procedures to prevent the sort of retaliatory personnel practices that took place with Gary Aguirre. By implementing real reforms such as those our report outlines, the SEC can begin to regain public confidence, and I look forward to working with the SEC as these reforms are implemented.  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, the report's executive summary and list of recommendations.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         II. Executive Summary       Pequot's trades in advance of the GE acquisition of Heller      Financial were highly suspicious and deserved a thorough      investigation. In the weeks after a conversation with John      Mack and prior to the public announcement of GE's acquisition      of Heller, Pequot CEO Arthur Samberg purchased over one      million shares of Heller Financial stock, and also shorted GE      shares. On the day the deal was announced, Samberg sold all      of the Heller stock. He also covered the short positions in      GE shortly thereafter, for a total profit of about $18      million for Pequot in a matter of weeks.       The SEC examined only a fraction of the other suspicious      Pequot trading highlighted by Self-Regulatory Organizations      (SROs). GE-Heller represented just one of at least 17 sets of      suspicious transactions involving Pequot brought to the SEC's      attention by organizations like the NYSE and NASD. However,      SEC managers ordered the staff to focus on only a few      transactions. In addition to GE-Heller, the SEC investigated      trades involving (1) Microsoft, (2) Astra Zeneca and Par      Pharmaceutical, and (3) various ``wash sales.''       Staff Attorney Gary Aguirre said that his supervisor warned      him that it would be difficult to obtain approval for a      subpoena of John Mack due to his ``very powerful political      connections.'' Aguirre's claim is corroborated by internal      SEC e-mails, including one from his supervisor, Robert      Hanson. Hanson also told Aguirre that Mack's counsel would      have ``juice,'' meaning they could directly contact the      Director or an Associate Director of Enforcement.       Attorneys for Pequot and Morgan Stanley had direct access      to the Director and an Associate Director of the SEC's      Enforcement Division. In January 2005, Pequot's lead counsel      met with the SEC Director of Enforcement Stephen Cutler.      Shortly thereafter, SEC managers ordered the case to be      narrowed considerably. In June 2005, Morgan Stanley's Board      of Directors hired former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White to      determine whether prospective CEO John Mack had any exposure      in the Pequot investigation. White contacted Director of      Enforcement Linda Thomsen directly, and other Morgan Stanley      officials contacted Associate Director Paul Berger. Soon      afterward, SEC managers prohibited the staff from asking John      Mack about his communications with Arthur Samberg at Pequot.       Seeking John Mack's testimony was a reasonable next step in      the investigation. Several SEC staff wished to take Mack's      testimony because they believed he: (1) had close ties to      Samberg, (2) had potential access to advanced knowledge of      the deal, (3) had spoken to Samberg just before Pequot      started buying Heller and shorting GE, and (4) was an      investor in Pequot funds and was allowed to share in a      lucrative direct investment in a (5) start-up company      alongside Pequot, possibly as a reward for providing inside      information.       SEC management delayed Mack's testimony for over a year,      until days after the statute of limitations expired. After      Aguirre complained about his supervisor's reference to Mack's      ``political clout,'' SEC management offered conflicting and      shifting explanations for blocking Mack's testimony. Although      Paul Berger claimed that the SEC had always intended to take      Mack's testimony, Branch Chief Mark Kreitman said that      definitive proof that Mack knew about the GE-Heller deal was      the ``necessary prerequisite'' for taking his testimony. The      SEC eventually took Mack's testimony only after the Senate      Committees began investigating and after Aguirre's      allegations became public, even though it had not met      Kreitman's prerequisite.       The SEC fired Gary Aguirre after he reported his      supervisor's comments about Mack's ``political connections,''      despite positive performance reviews and a merit pay raise.      Just days after Aguirre sent an e-mail to Associate Director      Paul Berger detailing his allegations, his supervisors      prepared a negative re-evaluation outside the SEC's ordinary      performance appraisal process. They prepared a negative re-     evaluation of only one other employee. Like Aguirre, that      employee had recently sent an e-mail complaining about a      similar situation where he believed SEC managers limited an      investigation following contact between outside counsel and      the Director of Enforcement.       After being contacted by a friend in early September 2005,      Associate Director Paul Berger authorized the friend to      mention his interest in a job with Debevoise & Plimpton.      Although that was the same firm that contacted the SEC for      information about John Mack's exposure in the Pequot      investigation, Berger did not immediately recuse himself from      the Pequot probe. Berger ultimately left the SEC to join      Debevoise & Plimpton. When initially questioned, Berger's      answers concerning his employment search were less than      forthcoming.       The SEC's Office of Inspector General failed to conduct a      serious, credible investigation of Aguirre's claims. The OIG      did not attempt to contact Aguirre. It merely interviewed his      supervisors informally on the telephone, accepted their      statements at face-value, and closed the case without      obtaining key evidence. The OIG made no written document      requests of Aguirre's supervisors and failed to interview SEC      witnesses whom Aguirre had identified in his complaint as      likely to corroborate his allegations.                          III. Recommendations       The controversy over allegations of improper political      influence and the firing of SEC attorney Gary Aguirre      garnered considerable media attention. The public airing of      evidence in support of those allegations undoubtedly had an      adverse impact on public confidence in the SEC. The damage to      public confidence in the SEC as a fair and impartial      regulator must be repaired if the agency is to be effective      and able to fulfill its mission.       However, the controversy is more than merely an issue of      perception. Our investigation uncovered real failures that      need real solutions. Our recommendations focus on improving      the Commission's approach to the management of complex      securities investigations, personnel problems, the handling      of ethics issues, and the role of the Inspector General. A      more standardized, professional system for dealing with these      issues could have averted much of the controversy. It could      also improve employee morale and confidence in management by      ensuring more consistent, documented, transparent, and      careful internal deliberations.       For these reasons, we offer the following recommendations      for consideration:       1. Standardized Investigative Procedures: The SEC should      draft and maintain a uniform, comprehensive manual of      procedures for conducting enforcement investigations, along      the lines of the United States Attorney's Manual. The manual      should attempt to address situations or issues likely to      recur. It should set a consistent SEC policy where possible      and provide general guidance for complex issues that require      individual assessment on a case-by-case basis, so that      inquiries are handled as uniformly as possible throughout the      Enforcement Division.       2. Directing Resources to Significant and Complex Cases:      The SEC currently lacks a set of objective criteria for      setting staffing     levels and has no mechanism for designating a case as      critically important. The SEC should set standards for      assessing the size, complexity, and importance of cases to      ensure that significant cases receive more resources. The      Enforcement Division should develop and apply objective      criteria for determining how many attorneys, paralegals, and      support personnel should be assigned to a particular case.       3. Transparent and Uniform External Communications: The SEC      should issue written guidance requiring supervisors to keep      complete and reliable records of all outside communications      regarding any investigation. The need for a clear record and      transparency is especially acute regarding any communications      by supervisors that exclude the staff attorney assigned to      the case. The SEC's guidance should generally discourage      supervisors from engaging in such communications without the      knowledge or participation of the lead staff attorney. The      SEC needs to present one, consistent position to parties      involved in its investigations.       4. Greater Office of Inspector General (OIG) Independence      and More Thorough Investigative Procedures: The hallmarks of      any good Inspector General are independence and integrity.      However, the reputation of the Inspector General within the      SEC appears to be that of an office closely aligned with      management, lacking independence. In addition to the facts of      the Aguirre case, we received numerous complaints about the      OIG from both current and former SEC employees. The OIG      should develop a plan to ensure independence from SEC      management and the General Counsel's Office, and to ensure      that its future investigations of allegations against      management are thorough, fair, and credible. The SEC needs to      implement a directive requiring its Office of Information      Technology to provide thorough and timely responses to SEC/     OIG document requests. Since the purpose of the OIG is to      ensure integrity and efficiency, a document request in      connection with an SEC/OIG investigation should be among the      highest priorities.       5. Timely and Transparent Recusals: The SEC should review      its guidance to employees regarding their obligations to      recuse themselves immediately from any matter involving a      potential employer with whom the employee has had contact,      either directly or indirectly through an agent. Recusals      should be communicated in writing to all SEC staff who have      official contact with the recused individual, and a record of      the recusals should be centrally maintained by a designated      ethics officer. The appearance created by having undisclosed      contacts with potential employers while still participating      in an enforcement matter involving that potential employer      undermines public confidence in the fairness and impartiality      of the SEC.       6. Standardized Evaluation Procedures: Employee evaluations      should be submitted in a timely manner, according to an      established schedule. Evaluations should not be prepared      outside or apart from the established procedure. Although it      is appropriate to document performance issues and to discuss      them with the employee as the issues arise, submitting a re-     evaluation with substantive changes after the regularly      scheduled evaluation is submitted can raise questions. Where      the re-evaluation occurs just after an employee reports      alleged wrongdoing by a supervisor, it tends to suggest that      retaliation is driving the process rather than an honest      attempt to evaluate employee performance.
