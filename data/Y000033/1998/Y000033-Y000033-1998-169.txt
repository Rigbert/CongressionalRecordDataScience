Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind the gentleman we had the discussion on this issue in the committee last year and the year before. We had this discussion, and if I remember correctly, the gentleman at that time opposed any movement of any bill. Is that correct?  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?
