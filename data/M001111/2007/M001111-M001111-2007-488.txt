 President, I think it is important that, in response to the comments of my friend Senator Enzi, I set the record straight for the Senate and the American people regarding the practice of including unrequested emergency funding in war supplementals.  The emergency supplemental bills approved by Republican Congresses in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 included emergency funding for many of the same issues that are in the emergency supplemental, such as: agriculture disaster assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$500 million; border security--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$1.9 billion; pandemic flu--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$2.3 billion; wildland fire suppression--fiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations Act, which carried $25.8 billion war supplemental--$500 million; airline security--fiscal year 2003 war supplemental--$2.396 billion; and fisheries assistance--fiscal year 2006 war supplemental--$112 million.  The White House has complained about Democrats including agricultural disaster assistance in the war supplemental. Not only did the Republican Congress approve a targeted agriculture disaster package in 2006, but there is also precedent for including assistance to a sector in the economy that has been hard hit by a disaster. In 2003, Congress approved $515 million of relief for the aviation industry.  The White House has also complained about Democrats including other matter in a war supplemental, such as the minimum wage increase.  Yet under Republican control, war supplemental laws included such unrelated matters as the REAL ID Act, fiscal year 2005, a temporary worker program, fiscal year 2005, and budget process provisions, fiscal year 2006.  So I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify for my colleagues the real record when it comes to meeting the needs of the American people in emergency supplemental appropriation bills.
