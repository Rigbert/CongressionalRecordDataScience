 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to executive session for the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 400, the nomination of Charles Pickering to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. I ask my friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle, would his side be willing to enter into a time agreement on this nomination?
