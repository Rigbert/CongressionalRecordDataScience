 By doing this, I want to emphasize past Republican attempts at regulating and reforming these institutions, while also discussing their role in the financial crisis.  The government-sponsored enterprises that we call Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were key players in the collapse of the U.S. housing market. Their multitrillion dollar portfolios gave them the purchasing power to drive markets. In addition, false presumptions about their housing finance expertise and their connections to the government gave them further power to influence the housing market. And let us not forget the GSEs' nationwide lobbying and public affairs apparatus that was designed to keep reformers at bay and their supporters flush with cash.  When the GSEs began to buy subprime securities, other firms, including most of the Wall Street banks, took this as a signal that subprime mortgage securities were safe and worthwhile investments. In effect, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac placed the Good Housekeeping ``Seal of Approval'' on these risky instruments. As a result, the rest of the market engaged in this practice, and the race to the bottom began. Ultimately, the GSEs' collapse lit a wildfire that burned throughout the financial markets.  Due to their miscalculations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been placed in conservatorship and have already cost the taxpayers well over $100 billion. Just last week, we learned that the GSEs will need another $20 billion in taxpayer assistance for their losses during the previous quarter.  This did not have to happen. For years, the warning signs were flashing, and Republicans made multiple attempts to adopt the necessary reforms. Unfortunately, those efforts were opposed by Democrats in the Senate Banking Committee and ultimately caused the many efforts put forth by Republicans to stall in the Senate.  In 2003, as chairman of the Banking Committee at that time, I held multiple hearings on proposals for improving the regulation of the GSEs. I wish to read a portion of my opening statement from one of those hearings. I quote from that time:       The enterprises are large institutions. Collectively,      Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac carry $1.6 trillion in assets on      their balance sheets and have outstanding debt of almost $1.5      trillion. The Federal Home Loan Bank System is not far      behind, with combined assets of over $780 billion and      outstanding advances to member institutions of $495 billion.      Due to the importance of the housing GSEs' mission, and the      size of their assets, I believe that the enterprises require      a strong, credible regulator.  I further read from the statement then:       I remain concerned that the current regulatory structure      for housing the GSEs is neither strong nor credible.  At this same hearing, it became apparent that the two parties had very different perspectives regarding the need for reform. One of my Democratic colleagues noted--and it is in the record:       There is an old expression, if it ain't broke, don't fix      it. I think some of us here in the Senate believe that when      we try to fix things that aren't really broken, we can end up      doing more harm than good.  Notwithstanding the mindset on the other side of the aisle, my Republican colleagues and I persevered, and we remained engaged in the effort to reform the GSEs by holding numerous hearings and closely tracking the GSEs' activities at that time.  We decided those who believed ``things aren't really broken'' were wrong. In the face of strong Democratic opposition and a relentless lobbying campaign by the GSEs and their supporters, we proceeded with a markup of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2004.  I wish to again read portions of my brief opening statement from that markup which lays out the issues and the responses we crafted to address the problems of the GSEs then:       This afternoon the committee will consider S. 1508, a bill      to address regulation of the housing GSEs.       Today, we are faced with the most important decisions      considered by this committee in years--determining the      strength, independence and credibility of regulation of our      nation's Government Sponsored Housing Enterprises. The      strength, independence and credibility of this regulatory      system have tremendous implications for the future health and      vitality of our housing markets, our capital markets, and the      economy as a whole.  I continue to quote the statement:       Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently have $1.7 billion debt      outstanding. To provide some perspective, our nation's      Treasury debt in the hands of the public stands at just over      $4 trillion. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has also grown      significantly since the 1990s and has a vastly expanded      membership base.       Its current regulator is not up to the task of providing      adequate oversight of its significant role.  My statement continued:       Fannie Mae is the second largest financial institution in      the United States. Freddie Mac is fourth. Their debt is held      by foreign central banks, insurance companies, money center      banks and community banks. Because of the interest rate risk      these GSEs must manage, they have an extensive network of      derivative contracts. Should one of these institutions      encounter significant financial difficulty it could make the      S&L crisis pale by comparison.  I was here speaking as an early member of the Banking Committee, as was Senator Dodd, during the bailout of the S&Ls. And it was no pretty matter. It ended up costing the taxpayers at least $130 billion.  I continue:       This experience has only reaffirmed my resolve to ensure      such a debacle never revisits the taxpayer. And, quite      simply, the real truth is we cannot afford a crisis of the      magnitude a failing GSE would pose.       I approach this markup today with a firm appreciation of      the gravity and relevance of what we do here today. I state      again, as I have before--I support the housing missions of      the GSEs. Home ownership is the primary source of wealth for      many Americans. It fosters strong communities and promotes      stability for children and families.       But, and I believe there is consensus in this Committee on      this one point at least, they are not well-regulated and,      therefore, pose significant risk to the taxpayer and the      markets they serve.       To be clear: they are not well-regulated because the      regulatory structures and authorities that Congress created      are insufficient and weak by design.       And that is what the draft before us is all about.      Reaffirming the important mission of GSEs, creating a      regulator that has all the tools and independence that other      first class financial regulators require, and protecting the      taxpayer. These are the guiding principles that animate the      draft that I have put forth before the Banking Committee      today.  Unfortunately for the taxpayers of this country, politics got in the way of advancing credible public policy then. Apparently, the Democrats felt it was better to block necessary change, adhere to the status quo, and ignore the risk to the financial system, all while leaving the taxpayers fully exposed.  We, the same Republicans who have been characterized by Democrats as being pro-Wall Street and antiregulation throughout this process, were trying to create a stronger regulator, raise capital standards, reduce risk taking, and put in place a resolution regime that would limit taxpayer exposure in the event of a firm failure.  That was a number of years back. I wish to revisit the words of one of my then-Democratic colleagues who made the following statement--and it is in the record--as we debated the merits of the Republican GSE reform bill at that time:       Lord only knows where the economy would be today if it were      not for the stability of the housing market in the midst of      so much turbulence and the ability of Americans to draw down      some of their home equity to engage in consumer purchases.  Then, as we stood on the precipice of a housing and financial meltdown, my Democratic colleagues were opposing more regulation and promoting more consumer spending. As if that were not bad enough, we were encouraging homeowners to raid the home's equity to finance their purchases. And look where it brought us.  Another Democrat took issue with the fact that we attempted to give the regulator the power to place a GSE into receivership:       Receivership, first, it does not have to be in the bill,      but, second, to allow a regulator who may not like this      institution to then sort of dole out little pieces of it one      way or another and weaken the fundamental structure of Fannie      and Freddie easily leads to its demise.  I am not sure whether my colleagues then understood the basic concept behind establishing an orderly resolution process, but I hope the lesson has now been learned. Ironically, Democratic opposition to strong reform actually produced the exact outcome my colleague feared. When reform stalled in the face of Democratic objections, investors once again viewed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as ``too big to fail.'' They were confident that Congress and the U.S. Government would never allow them to go under. This, of course, gave the GSEs a significant financing cost advantage which led to their explosive growth and excessive risk taking.  Finally, and most telling, one of my Democratic colleagues was concerned about how Wall Street might interpret the regulatory changes that Republicans were advocating, stating:       It is a fact that just mere speculation about the prospects      of some provisions in the bill is sending shock waves through      Wall Street.  Really?  When Wall Street became concerned that our legislation at that time would provide a stronger regulator, require higher capital standards, mandate less risk taking, and establish a well-designed resolution regime, the Democrats came to Wall Street's rescue, not the Republicans.  When the choice was between Main Street and Wall Street, the Democrats made it absolutely clear whose side they were on. They chose Wall Street, and Wall Street ultimately paved the road that led to this collapse.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the recorded vote of the proceedings of that day in the Senate Banking Committee. That result was a party-line vote with all 12 Republicans voting for GSE reform and all Democrats opposing it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Markup of S. 1508, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act                                 of 2004       The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:10 p.m., in      room SD-538, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Richard      Shelby (Chairman of the Committee) presiding.
