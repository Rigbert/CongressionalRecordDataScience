Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Tom Bevill, who has honorably served the residents of Alabama's Fourth District for the past 30 years as their Representative in the United States Congress.  Mr. Bevill first served our country in the U.S. Army during World War II. A few years later, he began representing Alabama citizens in the Alabama House of Representatives, where he served for 8 years.  Beginning in 1967, Mr. Bevill has represented the northern region of Alabama in Congress. Through his years, Mr. Bevill has earned the respect of his congressional colleagues and the public alike. Thanks to his efforts, many water and energy project ideas became a reality.  Mr. Bevill's constituents appreciated his hard work and efforts, rewarding him with large reelection margins each times.  Over his years in Congress, Mr. Bevill has truly been the distinguished gentleman from Alabama.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's Ninth District, I thank Mr. Tom Bevill for his outstanding service to the United States.                          ____________________
