FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From      Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the      current system of privately financed campaigns for election      to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often      perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United      States by--       (1) creating a conflict of interest, perceived or real, by      encouraging Senators to accept large campaign contributions      from private interests that are directly affected by Federal      legislation;       (2) diminishing or giving the appearance of diminishing a      Senator's accountability to constituents by compelling      legislators to be accountable to the major contributors who      finance their election campaigns;       (3) violating the democratic principle of ``one person, one      vote'' and diminishing the meaning of the right to vote by      allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and      unfair influence within the political process;       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through      legislative and regulatory outcomes shaped by unequal access      to lawmakers for campaign contributors;       (5) driving up the cost of election campaigns, making it      difficult for qualified candidates without personal wealth or      access to campaign contributions from monied individuals and      interest groups to mount competitive Senate election      campaigns;       (6) disadvantaging challengers, because large campaign      contributors tend to donate their money to incumbent      Senators, thus causing Senate elections to be less      competitive; and       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with      fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry      out their public responsibilities.       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From      the Senate Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and      declares that providing the option of the replacement of      private campaign contributions with allocations from the      Senate Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and      general elections to the Senate would enhance American      democracy by--       (1) eliminating the potentially inherent conflict of      interest created by the private financing of the election      campaigns of public officials, thus restoring public      confidence in the integrity and fairness of the electoral and      legislative processes;       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the      accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect      them;       (3) helping to eliminate access to wealth as a determinant      of a citizen's influence within the political process and to      restore meaning to the principle of ``one person, one vote'';       (4) reversing the escalating cost of elections and saving      taxpayers billions of dollars that are (or that are perceived      to be) currently allocated based upon legislative and      regulatory agendas skewed by the influence of campaign      contributions;       (5) creating a more level playing field for incumbents and      challengers by creating genuine opportunities for all      Americans to run for the Senate and by encouraging more      competitive elections; and       (6) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with      raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their      public responsibilities.
