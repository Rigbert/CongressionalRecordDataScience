 The article was entitled ``A Warning from Putin and Schroeder.'' It describes how the current global predominance of the United States is being countered by constellations of countries, which include allies and less-friendly powers alike, and how American behavior is aiding and abetting this development.  Mr. Joffe is the co-editor of the prestigious German weekly Die Zeit. He received his university education in the United States and is well known and respected in American foreign policycircles. In short, his thoughts are advice from a friend, not hostile criticism from an embittered or jealous antagonist.  The take-off point of the article, from which its headline is derived, was the recent summit meeting in Berlin between German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir Putin during which Putin employed the classic Muscovite tactic of wooing Europe's key country in an effort to have it join Russia as a counterweight to us.  Fair enough, Joffe says. Whenever the international system has been dominated by one power, a natural movement to restore the balance has arisen. With regard to the United States, this is nothing new--the Chinese, as well as the Russians, have been decrying a ``unipolar world'' and ``hegemonism'' for years.  But Germany--the country the United States practically reinvented from the ashes of World War II, ushered back into the civilized family of nations, and then stood out as the only champion of re-unification only a decade ago? No matter how gushy a host he wished to be, how could the Chancellor of this Germany suddenly be calling for a ``strategic partnership'' with Russia?  One answer, according to Joffe, is the obvious and passionate hostility to the U.S. national missile defense project, known popularly as NMD, which the Russians and our German allies--for that matter, all of our European allies--share.  A second reason can be traced to the obvious shock at the overwhelming American military superiority shown in last year's Yugoslav air campaign. The manifest European military impotence impelled the European Union to launch its own security and defense policy, which NATO is now struggling to integrate into the alliance.  To some extent, then, the very fact of our current power--military, economic, and cultural--makes attempts at creating a countervailing force nearly inevitable.  But there is more. It is not only the policy that spawned NMD that irritates our European allies. What also irks them is the cavalier way in which we neglected to consult with them in our rush to formulate that policy. As Joffe trenchantly puts it, ``America is so far ahead of the crowd that it has forgotten to look back.''  In this, the second half of his explanation, I fear that Joffe is on to something: a new kind of American hubris. Again, his use of English is enviable. He describes the behavior of Congress these days as ``obliviousness with a dollop of yahooism'' (I assume he isn't talking about the search engine).  Mr. President, no one loves and respects this body more than I do. I believe that the American people is exceedingly well served by the one hundred Senators, all of whom are intelligent and hard-working.  Nevertheless, I note with dismay an increasing tendency in this chamber--I will leave judgments of the House of Representatives to others--for Members to advocate aspects of foreign policy with a conscious disregard, occasionally even disdain, for the opinions of our allies and the impact our policies have on them.  This kind of unilateralism was exhibited in the floor debate last fall on ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by one of my colleagues who, in responding to an article jointly authored by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, and German Chancellor Schroeder, declared: ``I don't care about our allies. I care about our enemies.''  No one, Mr. President, is advocating abandoning or compromising the national interest of the United States simply because our allies oppose this or that aspect of our foreign and security policy.  But power--in the current context, our unparalleled power--must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility.  Mr. Joffe alludes to this power-and-responsibility duality in recalling the golden age of bipartisan American foreign policy in the years immediately following the Second World War, when Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg and Democratic President Harry S. Truman collaborated on halting the spread of communism and on helping create the international institutions that remain the cornerstones of our world more than half a century later. As he puts it ``responsibility must defy short-term self-interest or the domestic fixation of the day.''  Mr. President, one does not have to agree with all of Joffe's arguments to admit that his assertions at least merit our serious consideration. For if we do not begin to realize that even the United States of America needs to factor in the opinions of its friends when formulating foreign policy, it may not have many friends to worry about in the future.  And if that development occurs, we will almost certainly no longer retain the sole superpower status that we now enjoy.                          ____________________
