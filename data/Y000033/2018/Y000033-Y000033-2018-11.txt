Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to thank Chairman Smith of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee; Chairman Thornberry of the Armed Services Committee; and Congressman  Steven Palazzo, who sponsored the House counterpart of this legislation, for their cooperation in getting S. 2511 to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2018.     Hon. Mac Thornberry,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     Washington, DC       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Majority Leader wishes to schedule      S. 2511, the Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology      Act of 2018, for consideration under suspension of the rules      this week. This bill was primarily referred to the Committee      on Natural Resources and additionally referred to the      Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Science,      Space and Technology.       I ask that the Committee on Armed Services not insist on      its referral of the bill so that it may be considered on the      Floor with an amendment requested by the Committee on      Science, Space and Technology. This concession in no way      affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the      bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future      referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be      necessary, I would support your request to have your      committee represented on the conference committee. Finally, I      would be pleased to include this letter and your response in      the Congressional Record during debate on the bill.       Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the      extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over      matters of shared jurisdiction.           Sincerely,                                                   Rob Bishop,                                                         Chairman,     Committee on Natural Resources.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Armed Services,                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2018.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning S. 2511,      the ``Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of      2018.'' There are certain provisions in the bill which fall      within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed      Services.       In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed      expeditiously to floor consideration of this important      legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further      consideration of S. 2511. I do so with the understanding that      by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed      Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over      the subject matters contained in the legislation which fall      within its Rule X jurisdiction. The committee also reserves      the right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference      on this legislation and requests your support if such a      request is made.       Please place this letter into the Congressional Record      during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank      you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked      regarding this matter and others between our respective      committees.           Sincerely,                                    William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                         Chairman.
