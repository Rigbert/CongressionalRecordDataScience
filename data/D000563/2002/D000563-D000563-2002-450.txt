The story documents the dilemma of Michelle Witte who was denied health insurance coverage because she was successfully treated for depression during her adolescence. In fact, more than 50 million Americans each year suffer from mental illness. About 19 percent of the Nation's adults and 21 percent of the youths aged 9 to 17 have a mental disorder at some time during a one-year period.  Last Congress I introduced legislation to address the barriers faced by Michelle Witte and thousands like her who have been treated for a mental condition. I plan to reintroduce this legislation this spring, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act limits the ability of health plansto redline individuals with a preexisting mental health condition. I undertook this initiative when I learned that some of my constituents were being turned away from health plans in the private non-group market due solely to a past history of treatment for mental conditions. Unfortunately, under the current system of care in the United States, individuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of treatment for mental illness may find it difficult to obtain private health insurance, especially if they must purchase it on their own and do not have an employer-sponsored group plan available to them. In part this is because while the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, protects millions of Americans in the group health insurance market, it affords few protections for individuals who apply for private non-group insurance. While the majority of Americans under age 65 have employer-sponsored group coverage, a significant minority, approximately 12.6 million individuals, rely on private, individual health insurance.  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act closes this loophole by limiting any preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition to not more than 12 months and reducing this exclusion period by the total amount of previous continuous coverage. It prohibits any health insurer that offers health coverage in the individual insurance market from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition unless a diagnosis, medical advice or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 months prior to the enrollment date. And it prohibits health plans in the individual market from charging higher premiums to individuals based solely on the determination that the individual has had a preexisting mental health condition. These provisions apply to all health plans in the individual market, regardless of whether a state has enacted an alternative mechanism, such as a risk pool, to cover individuals with preexisting health conditions.  The Mental Health Patients' Rights Act complements ongoing efforts to enhance parity between mental health services and other health benefits. This is because parity alone will not help individuals who do not have access to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting mental illness discrimination. The Patients' Rights Act does not mandate that insurers provide mental health services if they are not already offering such coverage. It simply prohibits plans in the private non-group market from redlining individuals who apply for general health insurance based solely on a past history of treatment for a mental condition.  I have also asked the General Accounting Office to examine the types of mental health conditions for which individual health insurers typically underwrite; the degree to which there is an actuarial basis for these carrier practices; the prevalence of medical underwriting for mental health conditions that results in denying coverage or raising premiums; and the extent of state laws that prevent or constrain insurers from denying coverage or raising premiums due to a history of mental health conditions, including consumer protections such as appeals procedures and access to information. This report is due out next month.  It simply does not make sense that a person is rendered uninsurable for all health needs simply because he or she seeks treatment for mental illness. I invite my colleagues to enlist in this important initiative to ensure that such individuals are not discriminated against when applying for health insurance coverage.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2002]               Second Opinion: The Perils of Doing Right                         (By Abigail Trafford)       Michelle Witte did everything right. She graduated from the      University of Maryland last June with a degree in English.      She got a job she loves with a Washington communications firm      that is too small to qualify for a group health plan. But her      employer will pay for an an individual policy, so she applied      to CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. In answer to questions on      the form, she stated that she has chronic asthma and had been      prescribed antidepressant medication for a short period when      she was in high school.       The health plan rejected her.       ``Upon review of the Individual Health Evaluation      Questionnaire, you have documented that you have been or are      currently being treated for depressive disorder,'' stated the      letter from the health plan. ``Based upon our medical      underwriting criteria, we are unable to approve this coverage      for you.''       ``I just think it's shocking,'' said Witte, 23. CareFirst      has refused to comment on the case. But in its official reply      to her application, the plan expressed no concern over her      ongoing problem of asthma. It was one episode of successfully      treated depression in adolescence that turned Witte into a      health plan pariah. ``It didn't occur to me that it could be      such a liability,'' she said.       This is how discrimination works against people with mental      diseases. For all the rhetoric about removing the stigma of      mental illness and treating disorders of the brain the same      way as disorders of the body, the bias persists. A physical      disease like asthma is okay; a mental disorder like      depression is not.       If anything, Witte ought to be a prized health plan client.      She has demonstrated that she knows how to take care of      herself. Six years ago, when she was in high school, she      developed anorexia, an eating disorder. Her parents promptly      took her to a psychiatrist at Children's National Medical      Center who diagnosed depression and prescribed a six-month      course of the antidepressant Zoloft. Witte responded well.      She overcame her eating problems. She has had no problems      with depression since that time.       How many teenage girls try to keep their destructive eating      habits secret? How many go for years without proper      treatment? They can end up needing hospitalization and may      suffer long-term complications. In the end, that is much more      expensive to a health plan than covering outpatient      psychotherapy and medications for six months.       In short, Witte and her parents--her father works for the      federal government, her mother for a health maintenance      organization--did everything right in getting prompt      treatment. ``It was a success story,'' said Witte. ``I'm a      proponent of drugs when they're used properly. They can      really help.''       Why should she be penalized for being a success story?       It's legal for health insurers to consider a person's      health status when they offer individual policies. Otherwise      some people might not buy insurance until they were diagnosed      with a major medical problem and needed coverage to get care.       But this is obviously not the case with Witte, a healthy      young woman who runs regularly and likes to take day-long      hikes. As a health insurance reject, she is eligible for      programs designed for high-risk individuals, but the costs of      coverage are generally higher and the benefits more limited      compared to a regular plan. That's a steep price to pay for      having had a six-month prescription for Zoloft.       In many parts of the country, the infrastructure of mental      health services is unraveling. Headlines have rightly focused      on the collapse of public programs for people who need      government-funded treatment.       But a much larger population with mental disorders remains      in the private sector. They are holding jobs and raising      families. They rely on private insurance and private      therapists for treatment. Support for them is eroding, too,      as insurance agencies stint on payment for mental health      services, managed care plans place limits on benefits, and      the burden of co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses      continues to increase.       Even people with good jobs and supposedly good health      coverage are hurting. One man who works for the federal      government has been treated for major depression since his      first episode at age 38. He has seen the same psychiatrist,      who monitors his medications and provides psychotherapy,      every week for 15 years.       This year his insurance plan has eliminated the more      generous high-option policy that covered 50 visits to the      doctor. His current plan, with a premium that is a few      dollars cheaper every month, covers only 25 sessions. His      psychiatrist charges $165 an hour; the plan now covers about      half the hourly fee, and only half the time. Bottom line: His      doctor bills come to $8,250 a year. His plan pays $1,800; he      pays the rest.       ``It's not fair,'' he said, ``it has to cost us so much      money when there's supposed to be parity'' in coverage of      mental and physical illnesses. ``Parity keeps slipping      away.''       The president last week came out in favor of patients'      rights. That ought to include the millions of Americans with      mental illness.                          ____________________
