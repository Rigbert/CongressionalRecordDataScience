Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to join with my friend, Ranking Member Conyers, in support of this resolution to honor the life of Ruth Brown, a pioneering rhythm and blues singer who passed away last month. Ruth Brown was a well-known performer who paved the road for other R&B artists. In the 1950s she topped the R&B charts with a series of hits that helped establish Atlantic Records as a leading recording label for pop singers.                              {time}  1545  The label became known as ``the house that Ruth built.'' That means Yankee Stadium is not the only ``house that Ruth built.''  Ruth Brown's style and singing ability influenced numerous other well-known musical artists, including Bonnie Raitt and Little Richard. Later in her career, she was awarded Tony and Grammy honors and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But Ruth Brown's most enduring contributions and her most remarkable qualities might have been her persistence and passionate desire for justice. During her last two decades, she devoted herself to the cause of collecting unpaid royalties for musicians, spending much of her time working with Congress to promote copyright royalty reform. She also helped establish a nonprofit foundation in Philadelphia to help finance medical care for needy musicians.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for introducing this resolution, and I join him in urging the Members of the House to support this resolution to honor the extraordinary life and accomplishments of Ruth Brown and to extend the House's deepest sympathy to her family and friends.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
