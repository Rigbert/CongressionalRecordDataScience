 President, I object to this amendment. Remember, all but two of our members of the Committee on Finance, Republican and Democrat, joined with Secretary Leavitt to go over the problems 2 weeks ago that this program is having. Secretary Leavitt took responsibility for those problems. He laid out seven problems. He laid out seven solutions to those problems that he has already inputted.  I asked him if he needed additional legislative authority to solve these problems. He did not need any additional legislative authority. He had plenty. We are going to pass legislation now that not only will take a while to get passed, but we will also have a period of time afterwards of having regulations to administer that legislation.
