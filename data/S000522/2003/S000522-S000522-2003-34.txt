Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, all of the staff who have worked for days, weeks and months on this legislation through the hearing process. There are seven titles and close to 40 provisions in this bill. It is a very comprehensive omnibus bill, and so many Members made a difference in its content.  I would like to say we break a lot of new ground in this legislation, including the legislation dealing with veterans' businesses so that set-asides, sole source procurements, and the benefits accruing thereon will go to veterans themselves. In the past, veterans have gotten so little of the Federal procurement dollars--only 0.13 of 1 percent--which is unconscionable. This legislation now gives discretionary authority government-wide so we can again facilitate these important businesses.  Let me also point out that provision, just like the whole bill which is backed by virtually every veteran service organization in the country--that particular provision--on veterans' businesses has 36 military and veterans organizations backing it from a broad spectrum. From the largest Hispanic organization to the Black Veterans for Social Justice, we have a good cross-spectrum of people backing this provision because our veterans who have served so ably and are disabled are absolutely deserving of this legislation.  I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) for his leadership on this particular provision. He actually introduced the bill which is incorporated here in our final product. Mr. Renzi has been a champion of veterans benefits, and I thank him.  Mr. Speaker, I also thank Senator Rockefeller, who was instrumental in encouraging a strong text for this provision. I also thank our counterparts in the Senate, Senator Graham and the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Specter, for their work on this legislation and their spirit of cooperation.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a joint explanatory statement describing all of the provisions including the compromise agreement that we have reached with the other body.Explanatory Statement on Senate Amendment to House Bill, H.R. 2297, as                                 Amended       H.R. 2297, as amended, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003,      reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the House and      Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs (``the Committees'')      on the following bills considered in the House and Senate      during the 108th Congress: H.R. 1257; H.R. 1460, as amended;      H.R. 2297, as amended (``House Bill''); and S. 1132, as      amended (``Senate Bill''). H.R. 1257 passed the House on May      22, 2003; H.R. 1460, as amended, passed the House on June 24,      2003; H.R. 2297, as amended, passed the House on October 8,      2003; S. 1132, as amended, passed the Senate on October 31,      2003.       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of H.R. 2297, as amended      (``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the      provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the      related provisions of H.R. 1257, H.R. 1460, as amended, H.R.      2297, as amended, and S. 1132, as amended, are noted in this      document, except for clerical corrections, conforming changes      made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor      drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.                       TITLE I: SURVIVOR BENEFITS RETENTION OF CERTAIN VETERANS SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES                         REMARRYING AFTER AGE 57     Current Law       Section 103(d) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits a      surviving spouse who has remarried from receiving dependency      and indemnity compensation (``DIC'') and related housing and      education benefits during the course of the remarriage. This      benefit may be reinstated in the event the subsequent      marriage is terminated. Public Law 107-330 extended to      surviving spouses who remarry after age 55 continuing      eligibility under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of      the Department of Veterans Affairs (``CHAMPVA'').     House Bill       Section 6 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would allow a surviving      spouse who remarries after attaining age 55 to retain the DIC      benefit. Spouses who remarry at age 55 or older prior to      enactment of the bill would have one year from the date of      enactment to apply for reinstatement of DIC benefits. The      amount of DIC would be paid with no reduction of certain      other Federal benefits to which the surviving spouse might be      entitled.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement would provide that      a surviving spouse upon remarriage after attaining age 57      would retain DIC, home loan, and educational benefits      eligibility. Surviving spouses who remarried after attaining      age 57 prior to enactment of the Compromise Agreement would      have one year to apply for reinstatement of these benefits.BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPINA BIFIDA OF VETERANS OF CERTAIN SERVICE                                 IN KOREA     Current Law       Chapter 18 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the      Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') to provide benefits      and services to those children born with spina bifida whose      natural parent (before the child was conceived) served in the      Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975.      Benefits and services are authorized due to the association      between exposure to dioxin and the incidence of spina bifida      in the children of those exposed. Children born with spina      bifida whose parent was exposed to dioxin and other      herbicides during military service in locations other than      the Republic of Vietnam do not qualify for VA benefits and      services.     House Bill       Section 12 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would permit children      born with spina bifida whose parent (before the child was      conceived) served in an area of Korea near the demilitarized      zone (``DMZ'') between October 1, 1967 and May 7, 1975, to      qualify for benefits in the same manner as children whose      parent served in the Republic of Vietnam.     Senate Bill       Section 101 of S. 1132, as amended, would permit children      with spina bifida whose parent (before the child was      conceived) served in or near the DMZ in Korea during the      period beginning on January 1, 1967, and ending on December      31, 1969, to qualify for benefits in the same manner as      children whose parent served in the Republic of Vietnam. The      Senate Bill would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs      to make determinations of exposure to herbicides in Korea in      consultation with the Secretary of Defense.     Compromise Agreement       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement would generally      follow the Senate language. However, under the Compromise      Agreement, the time period for qualifying service in or near      the DMZ is changed to service which occurred during the      period beginning on September 1, 1967, and ending on August      31, 1971. The Committees note that although use of herbicides      in Vietnam ceased in 1971, Vietnam-era veterans who served      until May 7, 1975, are presumed to have been exposed to      residuals. Similarly, even though herbicide use in or near      the Korean DMZ ended in 1969, the Committees believe it is      appropriate to extend the qualifying service period beyond      1969 to account for residual exposure.       The Committees also note that the Secretary of Defense has      identified the following units as those assigned or rotated      to areas near the DMZ where herbicides were used between 1968      and 1969: combat brigades of the 2nd Infantry Division (1-38      Infantry, 2-38 Infantry, 1-23 Infantry, 2-23 Infantry, 3-23      Infantry, 3-32 Infantry, 1-9 Infantry, 2-9 Infantry, 1-72      Armor, and 2-72 Armor); Division Reaction Force (4-7th      Cavalry, Counter Agent Company); 3rd Brigade of the 7th      Infantry Division (1-17th Infantry, 2-17 Infantry, 1-73 Armor      and 2-10th Cavalry); and Field Artillery, Signal and Engineer      support personnel.ALTERNATE BENEFICIARIES FOR NATIONAL SERVICE LIFE INSURANCE AND UNITED                     STATES GOVERNMENT LIFE INSURANCE     Current Law       Section 1917 of title 38, United States Code, gives      veterans insured under the VA's National Service Life      Insurance (``NSLI'') program the right to designate the      beneficiary or beneficiaries of insurance policies maturing      on or after August 1, 1946. It also specifies the modes of      payment to beneficiaries when an insured dies, and sets forth      the procedure to be followed when a beneficiary has not been      designated or dies before the insured.       Section 1949 of title 38, United States Code, gives      veterans insured under the United States Government Life      Insurance (``USGLI'') program the right to change      beneficiaries, and sections 1950 through 1952 of title 38 set      out the modes of payment to designated beneficiaries and sets      forth the procedure to be followed when a beneficiary either      has not been designated or dies before the insured.       For the NSLI and USGLI programs, the law does not specify      the course of action VA is to take when no beneficiary can be      found.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 102 of S. 1132, as amended, would authorize the      payment of NSLI and USGLI to alternate beneficiaries, in      order of precedence and as designated by the insured veteran,      if no claim is made by the primary beneficiary within two      years of the insured veteran's death. If four years have      elapsed since the death of the insured and no claim has been      filed by a person designated by the insured as a beneficiary,      section 102 would authorize VA to make payment to a person VA      determines to be equitably entitled to such payment.     Compromise Agreement       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.        PAYMENT OF BENEFITS ACCRUED AND UNPAID AT TIME OF DEATH     Current Law       Section 5121 of title 38, United States Code, restricts      specified classes of survivors to receiving no more than two      years of accrued benefits if a veteran dies while a claim for      VA periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and      servicemen's indemnity) is being adjudicated. Public Law 104-     275 extended the retroactive payment from one year to two      years.     House Bill       Section 6 of H.R. 1460, as amended, would repeal the two-     year limitation on accrued benefits so that a veteran's      survivor may receive the full amount of award for accrued      benefits.     Senate Bill       Section 105 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision.    TITLE II: BENEFITS FOR FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR AND FOR FILIPINO                                 VETERANS                  Subtitle A--Former Prisoners of War      PRESUMPTIONS OF SERVICE-CONNECTION RELATING TO DISEASES AND                 DISABILITIES OF FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR     Current Law       Section 1112(b) of title 38, United States Code, specifies      a list of 15 disabilities that VA presumes are related to      military service for former prisoners of war (``POWs'') who      were held captive for not less than 30 days. If a former POW      was interned for less than 30 days, he or she must establish      that the disability was incurred or aggravated during      military service in order for service connection to be      granted.       The list in section 1112(b) of title 38, United States      Code, does not include cirrhosis of the liver; however, on      July 18, 2003, VA published a regulation adding cirrhosis of      the liver to the list of conditions presumptively service-     connected for former POWs. (68 Fed. Reg. 42,602).     House Bill       Section 11 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would eliminate the      30-day requirement for psychosis, any anxiety states,      dysthymic disorders, organic residuals of frostbite and post-     traumatic arthritis. Section 11 would also codify cirrhosis      of the liver as a disability which is presumptively service-     connected for a former POW who was interned for at least 30      days.     Senate Bill       Section 302 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision.                     Subtitle B--Filipino Veterans  RATE OF PAYMENT OF BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN FILIPINO VETERANS AND THEIR                 SURVIVORS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES     Current Law       Section 107(a) of title 38, United States Code, generally      provides that service before July 1, 1946, in the organized      military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the      Philippines, including organized guerilla units      (``Commonwealth Army veterans''), may in some circumstances      be a basis for entitlement to disability compensation,      dependency and indemnity compensation, monetary burial      benefits, and certain other benefits under title 38, United      States Code, and that payment of such benefits will be at the      rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized. Section 107(b) of      title 38, United States Code, generally provides that service      in the Philippine Scouts under section 14 of the Armed Forces      Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 (i.e., service in the ``new      Philippine Scouts''), may be a basis for entitlement to      disability compensation, DIC, and certain other benefits      under title 38, United States Code, but payment of such      benefits will be at the rate of $0.50 for each dollar      authorized.     House Bill       Section 16 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would provide the full      amount of compensation and DIC to eligible members of the new      Philippine Scouts, as well as the full amount of DIC paid by      reason of service in the organized military forces of the      Commonwealth of the Philippines, including organized guerilla      units, if the individual to whom the benefit is payable      resides in the United States and is either a citizen of the      U.S. or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.     Senate Bill       Section 321 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 211 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision.BURIAL BENEFITS FOR NEW PHILIPPINE SCOUTS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES     Current Law       Section 107 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      persons who served in the organized military forces of the      Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, including      organized guerilla units (``Commonwealth Army veterans''),      who lawfully reside in the United States are eligible for      burial in a VA national cemetery and VA monetary burial      benefits at the full-dollar rate if, at the time of death,      they are receiving VA disability compensation or would have      been receiving VA pension but for their lack of qualifying      service.     House Bill       Section 17 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would extend      eligibility for burial in a national cemetery to new      Philippine Scouts, as well as eligibility for VA burial      benefits, to those who lawfully reside in the United States.     Senate Bill       Section 322 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 212 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL OFFICE IN THE REPUBLIC OF                             THE PHILIPPINES     Current Law       Section 315(b) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to operate a regional      office in the Republic of the Philippines until December 31,      2003. Congress last extended this authority in Public Law      106-117.     House Bill       Section 18 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would extend the      Secretary's authority to operate a regional office in the      Republic of the Philippines through December 31, 2009.     Senate Bill       Section 323 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the      Secretary's authority to operate a regional office in the      Republic of the Philippines through December 31, 2008.     Compromise Agreement       Section 213 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.   TITLE III: EDUCATION BENEFITS, EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS, AND RELATED                                 MATTERS  expansion of montgomery gi bill education benefits for certain self-                          employment training     Current Law       Section 3452(e) of title 38, United States Code, furnishes      various legal definitions used in the administration of VA's      educational assistance programs. Self-employment training is      not included among the current definitions.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would expand the      Montgomery GI Bill program by authorizing educational      assistance benefits for on-job training of less than six      months in certain self-employment training programs, to      include: (1) an establishment providing apprentice or other      on-job training, including programs under the supervision of      a college or university or any State department of education;      (2) an establishment providing self-employment training      consisting of full-time training for less than six months      that is needed for obtaining licensure to engage in a self-     employment occupation or required for ownership and operation      of a franchise; (3) a State board of vocational education;      (4) a Federal or State apprenticeship registration agency;      (5) a joint apprenticeship committee established pursuant to      the National Apprenticeship Act, title 29, United States      Code; or (6) an agency of the Federal Government authorized      to supervise such training.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. increase in rates of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance     Current Law       Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, specifies the      eligibility criteria, programs of education and training, and      payment amounts applicable under VA's Survivors' and      Dependents' Educational Assistance (``DEA'') benefits      program. Generally, those eligible for DEA benefits are the      spouses and dependents of: veterans with total and permanent      service-connected ratings; veterans who died as a result of      service-related injuries; or servicemembers who died while on      active duty. Currently, monthly benefit rates for eligible      DEA beneficiaries are $695 for full-time study, $522 for      three-quarter-time study, and $347 for half-time study.      Monthly DEA benefits are also available for beneficiaries      pursuing programs of education on a less-than-half-time      basis, through farm cooperative programs, correspondence      courses, special restorative training programs, or programs      of apprenticeship or other approved on-job training programs.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 104 of S. 1132, as amended, would raise monthly DEA      benefits by 13.4 percent over current levels. The new rates      would be set at $788 for full-time study, $592 for three-     quarter time study, and $394 for half-time study. A 13.4      percent increase would also be made to benefits paid to      eligible persons pursuing a program of education on a less      than half-time basis, through institutional courses, farm      cooperative programs, correspondence courses, special      restorative training programs, or programs of apprenticeship      or other approved on-job training programs. The increases      would take effect on July 1, 2004.     Compromise Agreement       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.    restoration of survivors' and dependents' education benefits of        individuals being ordered to full-time national guard duty     Current Law       Section 3512(h) of title 38, United States Code, provides      for an extension of Survivors' and Dependents' Educational      Assistance only to reservists called to active duty after      September 11, 2001, for an amount of time equal to that      period of full-time duty, plus 4 months.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would provide that      National Guard members who qualify for survivors' and      dependents' education benefits under chapter 35 of title 38,      United States Code, and are involuntarily ordered to full-     time duty under title 32, United States Code, after September      11, 2001, would have their eligibility extended by an amount      of time equal to that period of full-time duty, plus 4      months.     Senate Bill       Section 103 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision.  rounding down of certain cost-of-living adjustments on educational                                assistance     Current Law       Sections 3015(h) and 3564 of title 38, United States Code,      provide for annual cost-of-living adjustments to both the      Montgomery GI Bill and Survivors' and Dependents' Educational      Assistance programs. Each section specifies that percentage      increases be ``rounded to the nearest dollar.''     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 304 of S. 1132, as amended, would require annual      percentage adjustments under sections 3015(h) and 3564 to be      rounded down to the nearest dollar. This section would first      apply to adjustments made at the start of fiscal year 2005.     Compromise Agreement       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language. However, the     Compromise Agreement specifies that the changes made by the      Senate language shall be effective only through September 30,      2013.     authorization for state approving agencies to approve certain                         entrepreneurship courses     Current Law       Section 3675 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      requirements for approval of accredited courses offered by      educational institutions. Section 3452 of title 38, United      States Code, furnishes various legal definitions used in the      administration of VA educational assistance programs. Section      3471 of title 38, United States Code, establishes general      requirements which must be met by educational institutions      before VA may approve applications for educational assistance      from veterans or eligible persons. There is no provision in      current law authorizing the approval of entrepreneurship      courses.     House Bill       Section 2 of H.R 1460, as amended, would allow State      approving agencies to approve non-degree, non-credit      entrepreneurship courses offered by a Small Business      Development Center (``SBDC'') or the National Veterans      Business Development Corporation for the training of      veterans, disabled veterans, dependent spouses and children      of certain disabled or deceased veterans, and members of the      National Guard and Selected Reserve. VA would also be      prohibited from considering a beneficiary as already      qualified for the objective of a program of education offered      by a qualified provider of an entrepreneurship course solely      because he or she is the owner or operator of a small      business.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.    repeal of provisions relating to obsolete education loan program     Current Law       Subchapter III of chapter 36 of title 38, United States      Code, establishes VA's education loan program, states policy      regarding eligibility, amount, condition, and interest rates      of loans, and establishes a revolving fund and insurance      against defaults as part of its administration. This program      has been in effect since January 1, 1975.     House Bill       Section 5 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would, effective on the      date of enactment, repeal the VA education loan program and      waive any existing repayment obligations of a veteran,      including overpayments due to default on these loans.     Senate Bill       Section 305 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a comparable      provision, but terminates the program 90 days after date of      enactment.     Compromise Agreement       Section 306 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.    six-year extension of veterans' advisory committee on education     Current Law       Section 3692 of title 38, United States Code, requires the      Secretary of Veterans Affairs to administer a Veterans'      Advisory Committee on Education. It requires the Secretary to      consult with and seek the advice of the Advisory Committee      from time to time with respect to the administration of      chapters 30, 32, and 35 of title 38, United States Code, and      chapter 1606 of title 10, United States Code. The Advisory      Committee's authorization expires on December 31, 2003.     House Bill       Section 4 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would extend, through      December 31, 2009, the Veterans' Advisory Committee on      Education, as well as amend the language to eliminate the      requirement that veterans from certain periods--World War II,      Korean conflict era, or post-Korean conflict era--be required      to participate as members of the Advisory Committee.     Senate Bill       Section 342 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the      Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education through December      31, 2013, and maintain the existing membership requirements,      as practicable.     Compromise Agreement       Section 307 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language with regard to membership, and the House language      with regard to extending the Advisory Committee's      authorization date through December 31, 2009.procurement program for small business concerns owned and controlled by                   qualified service-disabled veterans     Current Law       Sections 631 through 657 of title 15, United States Code,      establish policies with respect to aid to small businesses.      Section 637 specifies Small Business Administration (``SBA'')      authorities regarding procurement matters. Section 637(a)      specifies SBA authorities with respect to procurement      contracts and subcontracts to disadvantaged small business      concerns. Section 637(d) establishes policies regarding      performance of contracts by small business concerns      (``SBC''), as described in title 15, United States Code.      Section 637(h) establishes policies regarding award of      contracts, procedures other than competitive ones, and      exceptions.     House Bill       Section 3 of H.R. 1460, as amended, would provide Federal      agencies discretionary authority to create ``sole-source''      contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned and controlled      small businesses, up to $5 million for manufacturing contract      awards and up to $3 million for non-manufacturing contract      awards.       This section would provide Federal agencies discretionary      authority to restrict certain contracts to service-disabled      veteran-owned and controlled small businesses if at least two      such concerns are qualified to bid on the contract.       Section 3 would establish a contracting priority that      places restricted and ``sole source'' contracts for service-     disabled veteran-owned and controlled small businesses      immediately below the priority for socially and economically      disadvantaged firms (known as ``8(a)'' program contracts) for      all Federal departments and agencies except VA. Such      priorities for service-disabled veteran-owned and controlled      small businesses would rank above priorities for HUBZone and      women-owned businesses. HUBZones are SBCs located in      historically underutilized business zones. However, a      contracting officer would procure from a source on the basis      of a preference provided under any provision of this      legislation unless the contracting officer had determined the      procurement could be made by a contracting authority having a      higher priority. Lastly, procurement could not be made from a      source on the basis of preference provided under this      legislation if the procurement could otherwise be made from a      different source under section 4124 or 4125 of title 18,      United States Code, or the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.       Section 3 would establish a four-year pilot program in the      Department of Veterans Affairs in which service-disabled      veteran-owned and controlled small businesses would have the      same contracting priority as the 8(a) program.       This section would define ``qualified service-disabled      veteran'' as any veteran who (1) has one or more disabilities      that are service-connected as defined in section 101(16) of      title 38, United States Code, and are rated at 10 percent or      more by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or (2) is entitled      to benefits under section 1151 of title 38, United States      Code.       Section 3 would define ``small business concerns owned and      controlled by qualified service-disabled veterans'' as (1)      one in which not less than 51 percent of which is owned by      one or more qualified service-disabled veterans or, in the      case of any publicly-owned businesses, not less than 51      percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more      qualified service-disabled veterans, and (2) the management      and daily business operations of which are controlled by one      or more qualified service-disabled veterans or, in the case      of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse      or permanent care giver of the veteran.       Section 3 would define the term ``certified small business      concerns owned and controlled any qualified service-disabled      veterans'' as any small business concern owned and controlled      by qualified service-disabled veterans that is certified by      the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as      being such a concern.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 308 of the Compromise Agreement would provide      Federal contracting officials the discretionary authority to      award sole source contracts (limited to contracts of up to $5      million for manufacturing and $3 million for non-     manufacturing) to SBCs owned and controlled by service-     disabled veterans. This section would also provide Federal      contracting officials, in certain circumstances, the      discretionary authority to award contracts on a restricted      competition basis to SBCs owned and controlled by service-     disabled veterans. This provision would not supercede any      existing procurement preference established under law.      Specifically, it would not accord service-disabled veteran      small business owners priority over procurement preferences      under the Federal Prison Industries, Javits-Wagner-O'Day, SBA      8(a), Women's, or HubZone programs. Rather, the Committees      intend the provision to provide Federal contracting      officials a means to improve their results with respect to      contracting with service-disabled veterans. The Committees      note that in 1999, Public Law 106-50 established a 3      percent government-wide goal for procurement from service-     disabled veteran-owned small businesses. To date, all      Federal agencies fall far short of reaching this      procurement goal.The Committees intend that a      determination of service-connection by the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs would be binding on the SBA for purposes      of participation in this program. The Committees also urge      the SBA and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to      expeditiously and transparently implement this program,      perform outreach, and provide the necessary resources to      improve results with respect to SBCs owned and operated by      service-disabled veterans.        OUTSTATIONING OF TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PERSONNEL     Current Law       Section 1144 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary of Labor to place     staff in veterans' assistance offices on military      installations, both foreign and domestic, to help      transitioning servicemembers obtain civilian jobs.     House Bill       Section 19 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would require the      Department of Labor to place staff in veterans' assistance      offices where VA staff are located at overseas military      installations 90 days after enactment. It would also      authorize the Department of Labor to exceed the number of VA      locations and place staff in additional locations abroad.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 309 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with a technical modification.             TITLE IV: HOUSING BENEFITS AND RELATED MATTERSAUTHORIZATION TO PROVIDE ADAPTED HOUSING ASSISTANCE TO CERTAIN DISABLED          MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO REMAIN ON ACTIVE DUTY     Current Law       Section 2101 of title 38, United States Code, provides for      grants to adapt or acquire suitable housing for certain      severely disabled veterans, including veterans who are unable      to ambulate without assistance. Severely disabled      servicemembers who have not yet been processed for discharge      from military service, but who will qualify for the benefit      upon discharge due to the severity of their disabilities, are      not allowed to apply for or receive the grant until they are      actually discharged from military service.     House Bill       Section 4 of H.R. 1460, as amended, would permit a member      of the Armed Forces to apply for and receive a grant prior to      actually being discharged from military service.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.INCREASE IN AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN ADAPTIVE BENEFITS FOR DISABLED VETERANS     Current Law       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized in chapter      21 of title 38, United States Code, to assist eligible      veterans in acquiring suitable housing and adaptations with      special fixtures made necessary by the nature of the      veteran's service-connected disability, and with the      necessary land. The maximum amount authorized for a severely      disabled veteran is $48,000. The maximum amount authorized      for less severely disabled veterans is $9,250.       Section 3902(a) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes      the Secretary to pay up to $9,000 to an eligible disabled      servicemember or veteran to purchase an automobile (including      all state, local, and other taxes).     House Bill       Section 10(a) of H.R. 2297, as amended, would increase the      specially adapted housing grants for the most severely      disabled veterans from $48,000 to $50,000, and from $9,250 to      $10,000 for less severely disabled veterans.       Section 10(b) would increase the specially adapted      automobile grant from $9,000 to $11,000.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.   PERMANENT AUTHORITY FOR HOUSING LOANS FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED                                 RESERVE     Current Law       Under section 3702(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States      Code, members of the Selected Reserve qualify for a VA home      loan if the reservist has served for a minimum of six years.      Eligibility for reservists under this program is scheduled to      expire on September 30, 2009.     House Bill       Section 13 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make the      Selected Reserve home loan program permanent.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 403 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language.     REINSTATEMENT OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SALE OF VENDEE LOANS     Current Law       Section 3733 of title 38, United States Code, generally      establishes property management policies for real property      acquired by the Department of Veterans Affairs as a result of      a default on a loan that VA has guaranteed.     House Bill       Section 15 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would reinstate the      vendee loan program which VA administratively terminated on      January 31, 2003. It would increase from 65 percent to 85      percent the maximum number of purchases of real property the      Secretary may finance in a fiscal year. It would change the      vendee loan program from a discretionary to a mandatory one.     Senate Bill       Section 308 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision. However, the Compromise Agreement specifies that      the changes made under this provision shall expire after      September 30, 2013.  ADJUSTMENT TO HOME LOAN FEES AND UNIFORMITY OF FEES FOR QUALIFYING            RESERVE MEMBERS WITH FEES FOR ACTIVE DUTY VETERANS     Current Law       Section 3729(a) of title 38, United States Code, requires      that a fee shall be collected from each person (1) obtaining      a housing loan guaranteed, insured, or made under chapter 37;      and (2) assuming a loan to which section 3714 (concerning      loan assumptions) applies. The fee may be included in the      loan.       Section 3729(b) of title 38, United States Code, determines      the amount of the home loan fees expressed as a percentage of      the total amount of the loan guaranteed, insured, or made,      or, in the case of a loan assumption, the unpaid principal      balance of the loan on the date of the transfer of the      property.       Section 3729(b)(2) requires that veterans who served in the      Selected Reserve pay 75 basis points more than veterans with      active duty service.     House Bill       Section 14 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make four      revisions to the Loan Fee Table. First, it would provide      uniformity in the funding fees for VA-guaranteed home loans      charged to those who served in the Selected Reserve and      veterans with active duty service. Second, beginning in      fiscal year 2004, it would increase the fee charged for loans      made with no down payment by 15 basis points. Third, it would      increase the fee charged for repeated use of the home loan      benefit, i.e., for a second or subsequent loan, by 30 basis      points for the fiscal year 2004-2011 period and by 90 basis      points in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Fourth, it would      replace the existing range of fees for hybrid adjustable rate      mortgages under the current pilot program with a flat fee of      1.25 percent.     Senate Bill       Section 307 of S. 1132, as amended, would increase the      funding fees for subsequent use of a guaranty by 50 basis      points, but only between fiscal years 2005 and 2011.     Compromise Agreement       Section 405 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the      House language, except that a funding fee for members of the      Selected Reserve would, for initial use of a guaranty, be set      25 basis points higher than applicable funding fees set for      veterans with active duty service. Further, for the period      January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004 only, in the case      of active-duty veterans making initial loans with zero      dollars down, the fee would be increased from 2.15 percent to      2.20 percent. In addition, the Compromise Agreement would not      effect a 1.25 percent flat fee for hybrid adjustable rate      mortgage loans.ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF PROCEDURES ON LIQUIDATION SALES OF DEFAULTED HOME          LOANS GUARANTEED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS     Current Law       Section 3732 of title 38, United States Code, defines the      procedures for a liquidation sale of a property acquired by      VA in the event of a default on a VA-guaranteed home loan.      The procedures direct VA to follow a formula, defined in      statute, which mandates VA consider losses it might incur      when selling properties acquired through foreclosure.      Ultimately, after considering the loss VA can make a      determination whether to, in fact, acquire the property or      simply pay the guaranty on the loan used to purchase the      property. The authority for these procedures is currently set      to expire on October 1, 2011.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 406 of the Compromise Agreement would extend the      application of the liquidation sale procedures through      October 1, 2012.                        TITLE V: BURIAL BENEFITS                         burial plot allowance     Current Law       Veterans who are discharged from active duty service as a      result of a service-connected disability, veterans who are      entitled to disability compensation or VA pension, and      veterans who die in a VA facility are eligible for a $300 VA      ``plot allowance'' if they are not buried in a national      cemetery. Section 2303(b)(1) of title 38, United States Code,      allows state cemeteries to receive the $300 plot allowance      payment for the interment of such veterans, and the interment      of veterans of any war, if the cemeteries are used solely for      the burial of veterans. However, states may not receive a      plot allowance for burial of veterans who die as a result of      a service-connected disability and whose survivors seek      reimbursement of funeral expenses under section 2307 of title      38, United States Code (which currently authorizes a $2,000      funeral expense benefit).     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 201 of S. 1132, as amended, would expand existing      law to allow states to receive the $300 plot allowance for      the interment of veterans who did not serve during a wartime      period and for the interment of veterans who died as a result      of service-connected disabilities and whose survivors sought      reimbursement of funeral expenses under section 2307 of title      38, United States Code.     Compromise Agreement       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.  eligibility of surviving spouses who remarry for burial in national                                cemeteries     Current Law       Section 2402(5) of title 38, United States Code, prohibits      a surviving spouse of a veteran who has remarried from being      buried with the veteran spouse in a national cemetery if the      remarriage is in effect when the veteran's surviving spouse      dies. Public Law 103-466 revised eligibility criteria for      burial in a national cemetery to reinstate burial eligibility      for a surviving spouse of an eligible veteran whose      subsequent remarriage was terminated by death or divorce.     House Bill       Section 7 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would allow the      surviving spouse of a veteran to be eligible for burial in a      VA national cemetery based on his or her marriage to the      veteran, regardless of the status of the subsequent marriage.      This eligibility revision would be effective January 1, 2000.     Senate Bill       Section 202 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a similar      provision, with the eligibility revision being effective on      date of enactment.     Compromise Agreement       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language. Despite the inclusion of an additional group of      persons (i.e., remarried spouses) eligible for national      cemetery burial under the Compromise Agreement, the Secretary      retains the authority under section 2402(6) of title 38,      United States Code, to grant or deny national cemetery burial      for other persons, or classes of persons, not explicitly      granted eligibility in statute. It has come to the      Committees' attention that VA's record-keeping system      concerning which persons are granted or denied waivers for      burial in national cemeteries is, at best, incomplete.      Adequate records on burial waivers are necessary to ensure      that the Secretary's judgment on waiver cases is being      applied uniformly to all applicants. The Committees direct VA      to rectify gaps in its waiver-accounting system so that basic      information, such as which persons are denied burial waivers      and the reasons for the denial, will be available.         permanent authority for state cemetery grants program     Current Law       Section 2408(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code,      authorizes appropriations, through fiscal year 2004, for VA      to make grants to States to assist them in establishing,      expanding, or improving state veterans' cemeteries.     House Bill       Section 8 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would make the State      Cemetery Grants Program permanent.     Senate Bill       Section 203 of S. 1132, as amended, contains a similar      provision with an additional technical change.     Compromise Agreement       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.               TITLE VI: EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES     radiation dose reconstruction program of department of defense     Current Law       Section 3.311 of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations,      sets out procedures for the adjudication of claims by VA for      benefits premised on a veteran's exposure to ionizing      radiation in service. For veterans who claim radiation      exposure due to participation in nuclear atmospheric testing      from 1945 through 1962, or due to occupation duty in      Hiroshima and Nagasaki prior to July 1, 1946, dose data are      requested from the Department of Defense (``DOD''). DOD's      Defense Threat Reduction Agency (``DTRA'') pays a private      contractor to estimate radiation exposure through a process      called radiation dose reconstruction.       There is no entity under existing law which provides      independent oversight of DTRA's radiation dose reconstruction      process.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 331 of S. 1132, as amended, would require VA and      DOD to review, and report on the mission, procedures, and      administration of the radiation dose reconstruction program.      It would also require VA and DOD to establish an advisory      board to oversee the program.     Compromise Agreement       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.             study on disposition of air force health study     Current Law       The Air Force Health Study (``AFHS'') was initiated by DOD      in 1982 to examine the effects of herbicide exposure and      health, mortality, and reproductive outcomes in veterans of      Operation Ranch Hand, the activity responsible for aerial      spraying of herbicides during the Vietnam Conflict. The study      will conclude in 2006.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 332 of S. 1132, as amended, would direct VA to      enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences      (``NAS'') under which NAS would report on the following: (1)      the scientific merit of retaining AFHS data after the Ranch      Hand study is terminated; (2) obstacles to retaining the AFHS      data which may exist; (3) the advisability of providing      independent oversight of the data; (4) the advisability and      prospective costs of extending the study and the identity of      an entity which would be suited to continue the study; and      (5) the advisability of making laboratory specimens from the      study available for independent research.     Compromise Agreement       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, but the reporting deadline is extended to 120 days.    funding of medical follow-up agency of institute of medicine of national academy of sciences for epidemiological research on members of                      the armed forces and veterans     Current Law       Public Law 102-585 requires that VA and DOD each contribute      $250,000 in annual core funding to the Medical Follow-Up      Agency (``MFUA'') for a period of 10 years. MFUA is a panel      of the Institute of Medicine which researches military health      issues.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 333 of S. 1132, as amended, would mandate VA and      DOD funding for MFUA, at current levels, from fiscal year      2004 through 2013.     Compromise Agreement       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.                        TITLE VII: OTHER MATTERS TIME LIMITATIONS ON RECEIPT OF CLAIM INFORMATION PURSUANT TO REQUESTS                    OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS     Current Law       Section 5102(b) of title 38, United States Code, requires      that VA, in cases where it receives an application for      benefits that is not complete, notify the applicant of the      information that is necessary to complete the application for      benefits. Similarly, section 5103(a) of title 38, United      States Code, requires that VA, when it receives a complete or      a substantially complete application for benefits, notify the      applicant of any information or evidence necessary to      substantiate the claim. Section 5103(b) of title 38, United      States Code, states that if information or evidence requested      under section 5103(a) is not received within one year of the      date of such notification, no benefit may be paid by reason      of that application for benefits.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 310 of S. 1132, as amended, would require that      claimants who have submitted an incomplete application under      section 5102(b) of title 38, United States Code, and who have      been notified that information is required to complete the      application, submit the information within one year of the      date of notification or else no benefit would be paid by      reason of the application. It would also clarify section      5103(b) by stating that that subsection would not be      construed to prohibit VA from making a decision on a claim      before the expiration of the one-year period. Section 310      would be effective as if enacted on November 9, 2000,      immediately after the enactment of the Veterans Claims      Assistance Act of 2000.     Compromise Agreement       Section 701 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the      Senate language, but would make a further amendment to      section 5103(b) of title 38, United States Code, to remove      the statutory bar to payment of benefits when information or      evidence, requested of the claimant by VA, is not submitted      within one year of the notification requesting such      information or evidence. If a matter is on appeal and      evidence is received beyond the one-year period relating to      the original claim, it should be considered.       Section 701(d)(1) of the Compromise Agreement would require      VA to readjudicate the original claim when a claimant      adequately asserts he or she was misled upon receiving      notification from VA of the information or evidence needed to      substantiate the claim. However, section 701(d)(4) specifies      that the Secretary is not required to identify or      readjudicate any claim based upon the authority given to the      Secretary under this section when information or evidence was      submitted during the one-year period following the      notification or when the claim has been the subject of a      timely appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals or the United      States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.CLARIFICATION OF APPLICABILITY OF PROHIBITION ON ASSIGNMENT OF VETERANS       BENEFITS TO AGREEMENTS ON FUTURE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN BENEFITS     Current Law       Section 5301 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits the      assignment of VA benefits and exempts such benefits from      taxation and from the claims of creditors.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 311 of S. 1132, as amended, would clarify current      statutory language prohibiting the assignment of benefits and      specify that any agreement under which a VA beneficiary might      purport to transfer to another person or entity the right to      receive direct or indirect payments of compensation, pension,      or DIC benefits shall be deemed to be a prohibited      assignment. Section 311 would also make it clear that such      prohibitory language would not bar loans to VA beneficiaries      which might be repaid with funds derived from VA, so long as      each periodic payment made under the loan is separately and      voluntarily executed by the beneficiary at the time the      payment is made.     Compromise Agreement       Section 702 of the Compromise Agreement would follow the      Senate language but would modify it to state that payments on      loans are explicitly allowed when made by preauthorized      electronic funds transfers pursuant to the Electronic Funds      Transfers Act (``EFTA''). The EFTA defines a characteristic      of these transfers as allowing the beneficiary to direct his      or her financial institution to cease payments upon the      beneficiary's notice. It is the Committees' intent to ensure      that methods of loan repayment would not be limited for      disabled veterans. The Compromise Agreement would also      eliminate the section that specifies the effective date of      the provision. It is the Committees' intent that prohibition      against assignment shall be enforced through coordination      with appropriate authorities.     SIX-YEAR EXTENSION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS     Current Law       Section 544 of title 38, United States Code, mandates that      VA establish an Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. The      Secretary of Veterans Affairs must, on a regular basis,      consult with and seek the advice of the Advisory Committee      with respect to issues relating to the administration of      benefits for minority group veterans. The Secretary must also      consult with and seek the advice of the Committee with      respect to reports and studies pertaining to such veterans,      and the needs of such veterans for compensation, health care,      rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and programs      administered by VA. The Advisory Committee is required to      submit an annual report providing its assessment of the needs      of minority veterans, VA programs designed to meet those      needs, and any recommendations the Advisory Committee      considers appropriate. The authorization for the Advisory      Committee expires on December 31, 2003.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 341 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the      authorization of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans      until December 31, 2007.     Compromise Agreement       Section 703 of the Compromise Agreement would extend the      authorization of the Advisory Committee until December 31,      2009.      TEMPORARY AUTHORITY FOR PERFORMANCE OF MEDICAL DISABILITIES                   EXAMINATIONS BY CONTRACT PHYSICIANS     Current Law       Section 504 of Public Law 104-275 authorized VA to carry      out a contract disability examination pilot program at 10 VA      regional offices. The law specifies that VA draw funds for      the program from amounts available to the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs for compensation and pensions.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 343 of S. 1132, as amended, would authorize VA,      using funds subject to appropriation, to contract for      disability examinations from non-VA providers at all VA      regional offices. Such examinations would be conducted      pursuant to contracts entered into and administered by the      Under Secretary for Benefits. The Secretary's authority under      this section would expire on December 31, 2009. No later than      four years after the section's enactment, the Secretary would      be required to submit a report assessing the cost,      timeliness, and thoroughness of disability examinations      performed under this section.     Compromise Agreement       Section 704 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language, but adds a technical modification that would      clarify that the authority granted the Secretary under      section 704 of the Compromise Agreement is in addition to the      authority already granted the Secretary under Section 504 of      Public Law 104-275. Thus, it is the Committees' intent that      VA's existing contract for disability examinations under the      authority of Public Law 104-275 remain in force. It is also      the Committees' intent that the Secretary's ability to enter      into contracts in the future under the strictures of Section      504 of Public Law 104-275 remain in force as well.            FORFEITURE OF BENEFITS FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES     Current Law       Section 6105 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      an individual convicted after September 1, 1959, of any of      several specified offenses involving subversive activities      shall have no right to gratuitous benefits (including the      right to burial in a national cemetery) under laws      administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. No other      person shall be entitled to such benefits on account of such      individual.     House Bill       Section 20 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would amend current      law to supplement the list of serious Federal criminal      offenses for which a veteran's conviction results in a bar to      VA benefits, including burial in a national cemetery. The      following criminal offenses from title 18, United States      Code, would be added: section 175, prohibited activities with      respect to biological weapons; section 229, prohibited      activities with respect to chemical weapons; section 831,      prohibited transactions involving nuclear materials; section      1091, genocide; section 2332a, use of certain weapons of mass      destruction; and section 2332b, acts of terrorism      transcending national boundaries. All of these offenses,      which involve serious threats to national security, were      added to title 18, United States Code, after the enactment of      the provisions in section 6105 of title 38, United States      Code.     Senate Bill       Section 313 of S. 1132, as amended, contains an identical      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 705 of the Compromise Agreement contains this      provision. TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF ROUND-DOWN REQUIREMENT FOR COMPENSATION COST-OF-                           LIVING ADJUSTMENTS     Current Law       Sections 1104(a) and 1303(a) of title 38, United States      Code, mandate that yearly cost-of-living adjustments made to      rates of compensation and dependency and indemnity      compensation be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar      amount. This authority expires on September 30, 2011.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 301 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend the round-     down authority under sections 1104(a) and 1303(a) through      fiscal year 2013.     Compromise Agreement       Section 706 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate      language.   CODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT FOR EXPEDITIOUS TREATMENT OF CASES ON                                  REMAND     Current Law       Section 302 of Public Law 103-446 requires the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs to provide for the expeditious treatment by      the Board of Veterans' Appeals and by regional offices of the      Veterans Benefits Administration of claims remanded by the      Board of Veterans' Appeals or the United States Court of      Appeals for Veterans Claims.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 707 of the Compromise Agreement would codify the      provisions of section 302 of Public Law 103-446. Expedited      treatment of decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals      would be codified in chapter 51 of title 38, United States      Code. Expedited treatment of decisions of the United States      Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims would be codified in      chapter 71 of title 38, United States Code.                   LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED    CLARIFICATION OF NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT FOR APPELLATE REVIEW OF                DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ACTIVITIES     Current Law       Claimants for VA benefits who disagree with an initial      decision rendered by VA may initiate an appeals process by      submitting a written notice of disagreement (``NOD'') within      one year after the claimant was notified of the initial      decision. Section 7105(b) of title 38, United States Code,      states that an NOD ``must be in writing and filed with the      activity which entered the determination with which      disagreement is expressed.'' Upon the timely filing of an      NOD, VA is required to provide appellate review of its      initial benefits rating decision.       VA has promulgated regulations to implement section 7105 of      title 38, United States Code, which state that ``while      special wording is not required, the Notice of Disagreement      must be in terms which can be reasonably construed as      disagreement with the determination and [expressing a] desire      for appellate review.'' 38 CFR Sec. 20.201 (2002).     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 314 of S. 1132, as amended, would clarify section      7105(b) of title 38, United     States Code, by requiring that VA deem any written document      which expresses disagreement with a VA decision to be an NOD      unless VA finds that the claimant has disavowed a desire for      appellate review. This section would be effective with      respect to documents filed on or after the date of enactment,      and with respect to documents filed before the date of      enactment and not treated by VA as an NOD pursuant to part      20.201 of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations. Furthermore,      a document filed as an NOD after March 15, 2002, and rejected      by the Secretary as insufficient would, at VA motion or at      the request of a claimant within one year of enactment, be      deemed to be an NOD if the document expresses disagreement      with a decision and VA finds that the claimant has not      disavowed a desire for appellate review.            PROVISION OF MARKERS FOR PRIVATELY MARKED GRAVES     Current Law       Section 502 of Public Law 107-103, the Veterans Education      and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001, authorizes VA to furnish      a government headstone or marker for the grave of an eligible      veteran buried in a non-veterans' cemetery irrespective of      whether the grave was already marked with a private marker.      The law applies to veterans whose deaths occurred on or after      December 27, 2001. Public Law 107-330 extended this      authority to include deaths occurring on or after      September 11, 2001.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 204 of S. 1132, as amended, would amend the      Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 to      authorize VA to furnish a government headstone or marker for      the grave of an eligible veteran buried in a private      cemetery, irrespective of whether the grave was already      marked with a private marker, for deaths occurring on or      after November 1, 1990. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY TO GUARANTEE LOANS TO PURCHASE MANUFACTURED                              HOMES AND LOTS     Current Law       Section 3712 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA      to guarantee loans for the purchase of a manufactured home      and a lot on which it is sited.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 306 of S. 1132, as amended, would eliminate VA's      authority to guarantee loans to purchase a manufactured home      and the lot on which it is sited.   REINSTATEMENT OF VETERANS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN                            PENSION RECIPIENTS     Current Law       Section 1524 of title 38, United States Code, authorized a      pilot program of vocational training to certain nonservice-     connected pension recipients. The initial pilot program was      in place from February 1, 1985, through January 31, 1992.      Public Law 102-562 extended the program through December 31,      1995.     House Bill       Section 9 of H.R. 2297, as amended, would reinstate the VA      pilot program for five years beginning on the date of      enactment to provide vocational training to newly eligible VA      nonservice-connected pension recipients. The program would be      open to those veterans age 45 years or younger. The      Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to ensure      that the availability of vocational training is made known      through various outreach methods. Not later than two years      after the date of enactment, and each year thereafter, the      Secretary would be required to submit to the Committees on      Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of      Representatives a report on the operation of the pilot      program. The report would include an evaluation of the      vocational training provided, an analysis of the cost-     effectiveness of the training provided, and data on the      entered-employment rate of veterans participating in the      program.     Senate Bill       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.         THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF INCOME VERIFICATION AUTHORITY     Current Law       Section 5317 of title 38, United States Code, directs VA to      notify applicants for needs-based VA benefits that      information collected from the applicants may be compared      with income-related information obtained by VA from the      Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and      Human Services. The authority of the Secretary of Veterans      Affairs to obtain such information expires on September 30,      2008.       Section 6103(l)(7)(D)(viii) of the Internal Revenue Code      authorizes the release of income information by the Internal      Revenue Service to VA. This authority expires on September      30, 2008.     House Bill       The House Bill contains no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 312 of S. 1132, as amended, would extend until      September 30, 2011, the authority of the Secretary to obtain      income information under section 5317 of title 38, United      States Code, and the authority of the Internal Revenue      Service to share income information under section      6103(l)(7)(D)(viii) of the Internal Revenue Code.
