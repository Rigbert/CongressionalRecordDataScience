 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate convenes on Thursday, April 23, following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Lynch nomination under the previous order.
