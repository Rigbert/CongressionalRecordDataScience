 President, I rise to make some observations about a matter that occurred in the Senate earlier this afternoon.  The plain language of the Senate precedent, the manual that governs Senate procedure, is that unanimous consent of all Members was required before the Senator from Vermont could withdraw his amendment while it was being read--unanimous consent.  Earlier today, the majority somehow convinced the Parliamentarian to break with the longstanding precedent and practice of the Senate in the reading of the amendment.  Senate procedure clearly states:       Under rule 15, paragraph 1, and Senate precedents, an      amendment shall be read by the clerk before it is up for      consideration or before the same shall be debated unless a      request to waive the reading is granted.  It goes on to state that:       . . . the reading of which may not be dispensed with,      except by unanimous consent, and if the request is denied,      the amendment must be read and further interruptions are not      in order.  Nothing could be more clear.  You may have heard that the majority cites an example in 1992 when the Chair made a mistake and allowed something similar to happen. But one mistake does not a precedent make.  For example, there is precedent for a Senator being beaten with a cane in the Senate. If mistakes were the rule, then the caning of Senators would be in order. Fortunately for all of us, it is not.  It is now perfectly clear that the majority is willing to do anything--anything--to jam through a 2,000-page bill before the American people or any of us have had a chance to read it, including changing the rules in the middle of the game.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
