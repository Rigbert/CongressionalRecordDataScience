I am deeply disappointed in the lady from Connecticut. This is a program that has been in existence since 1994, and you voted for it every time. This is not an earmark. This is an existing program. And I've heard you rail all night about restoring money, which are all earmarks. You're dead wrong.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chair, doesn't the gentleman have to address the Chair?
