 President, the amendment I submitted would reduce the capital gains holding period for horses from 24 months to 12 months and would correct an inequity in the tax code that has discriminated against the horse industry since 1969. Currently, all capital assets--with the exception of horses and cattle--qualify for the lowest capital gains tax rate if held for 12 months. This discrepancy in the tax code is simply not fair to the horse industry and must be changed.  The horse industry is extremely important to our economy, and accounts for thousands of jobs. Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along a trail--one in thirty-five Americans is touched by the horse industry. In Kentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees.  What supports this industry is the investment in the horses themselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are essential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to remain competitive. The 2-year holding period ultimately discourages investment, putting this industry--and the 1.4 million jobs it supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic policy and must be changed.  The two-year holding period for horses is sorely outdated. It was established in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter provision. Since then, there have been a number of changes in the tax code. Specifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, putting an end to these previous tax loopholes.  Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely different function than other animals, like cattle. While both are livestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. Beef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. However, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or working--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their longer life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. Additionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they continue to enhance their value through breeding.  The cost of my amendment will be completely offset by postponing for one year the 7.5 percent Air Passenger Ticket Tax that has been proposed on the frequent flier miles for persons with foreign addresses. Changes to the capital gains holding period for horses would go into effect in 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Tax would also go into effect in 2001.  There is no sound argument for distinguishing horses from other capital assets. The two-year holding period discriminates against the horse industry and must be reduced. I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting this unfair tax policy.                          Veterans Health Care
