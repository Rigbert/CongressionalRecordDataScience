President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Department of Justice grant program for Boys & Girls Clubs. I thank Senator Hatch, Senator Kohl and Senator Sessions for joining me in this effort.  I have partnered with Senator Hatch for many years on issues concerning the Boys & Girls Clubs, and this bipartisan bill shows the commitment of both Democrats and Republicans to the good work done by Boys & Girls Clubs across the Nation.  Children are the future of our country, and we have a responsibility to make sure they are safe and secure. I know firsthand how well Boys & Girls Clubs work, and the real impact they have in our communities. In my home State of Vermont, we are fortunate to have 6 Boys & Girls Clubs operating in 25 locations. These clubs serve more than 14,000 youth in the State. I often hear from parents, educators, law enforcement officers and others in Vermont about just how successful these Clubs are, and how they inspire youth to reach their full potential.  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have pushed for more Federal funding for Boys & Girls Clubs. This year, I recommended additional funding for youth mentoring programs, so that youth-serving organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs of America are able to continue making a substantial and real difference in the lives of vulnerable children. I was pleased that Congress included $100 million for competitive youth mentoring grants in the recently passed consolidated appropriations bill.  The current recession has hit many organizations around the country, threatening their financial health, and the Boys & Girls Clubs are no different. At the same time, participation in these clubs has never been higher, and it continues to increase. I believe funding is well spent at the community level, however, where the positive impact on our youth is felt most directly.  In the 108th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass a bill to reauthorize and extend the programs of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America through fiscal year 2009. Due in part to the support of Congress, there now exist over 4,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 states, serving more than 4.8 million young people. The bill we introduce today will help us continue to support these important programs by authorizing Justice Department grants through 2015.  We need safe havens where our youth--the future of our country--can learn and grow up free from the influences of drugs, gangs and crime. That is why Boys & Girls Clubs are so important to our children.  I hope all Senators will support this bipartisan bill to provide Federal support for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Our greatest responsibility is to our children, and supporting Boys & Girls Clubs is just one way in which we can show our commitment to their future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimour consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2924       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
