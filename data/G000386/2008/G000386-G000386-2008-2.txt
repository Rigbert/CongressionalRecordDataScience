 We have had a close working relationship for 8 years as either chairman and ranking member, and those changed from time to time. Part of our effort of working together has been to close down abusive tax shelters. So I am here to support what he said and to say, in my own words, my reasons for wanting this provision out of the bill. The bottom line of what I am saying is the bottom line of what Senator Baucus has already said. This tax provision has no business being in this bill.  There is a provision in this auto bailout bill that deals with a number of transit agencies that assisted corporations in tax shelters. This provision in the auto bailout bill has nothing to do with automakers. It would prop up a tax shelter that Senator Baucus and I shut down in the year 2004. Shutting down that tax shelter saved American taxpayers $26.56 billion, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. That is real money. So we should be very protective of making sure money that by subterfuge was not going to come into the Federal Treasury comes back to the Federal Treasury and is not used in the future. This tax shelter is commonly referred to as sale-in, lease-out, or by the acronym SILO, or another program lease-in, lease-out that we refer to by the acronym LILO. This tax shelter bailout within the automaker bailout bill would have the Federal Government guarantee obligations that public transit agencies now face because they entered into shady deals with corporations, including foreign corporations, where they sold things such as the transit agencies' own train cars and then magically leased them back from these corporations to do what they were doing all the time anyway, hauling people.  This was not done to change the way the transit agency operated but, instead, to collect a fee for assisting the tax shelter, where the corporations could take advantage of the tax deduction for depreciation of things such as these train cars.  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 2004, I worked hard to shut down these tax shelters as a matter of tax fairness, and Senator Baucus was there working closely with me to do that. The Internal Revenue Service has been working to recover money from these deals. If this tax shelter bailout were to pass, it would interfere with the working of the IRS in these efforts to collect money that should never have been deducted in the first place.  This tax shelter bailout can change the cost-benefit analysis for those tax shelter corporations that are considering settling their disputes with the IRS over the SILO/LILO tax shelters. It is wrong for the auto bailout bill to bail out transit agencies from participating in these shady tax shelters. The Federal Government should not guarantee the transit agencies' obligations to corporations, including foreign corporations, when doing so allows the tax shelter to continue as it did before 2004, and these corporations, including foreign corporations, to continue taking tax shelter deductions for things such as transit agencies' train cars.  If the Federal Government is called upon to pay the guarantees of the transit agencies' obligations to these tax shelter corporations, including foreign tax shelter corporations, then the hardworking U.S. taxpayer will be sending money directly to these foreign corporations and others. I don't know how many, but we know foreign corporations are very much involved.  These tax shelters were, in fact, set up so corporations were able to take large depreciation deductions. However, the tax shelter needed a nontaxpaying entity that had large amounts of assets that could be depreciated. So that is where the transit agencies come in. The transit agencies were paid millions of dollars to do nothing, simply sign papers and go about business as usual of transiting people within cities or between cities, as they were doing before this tax shelter was ever thought up. The transit agencies are called accommodation parties in tax shelter lingo. They are called this because, in exchange for their fee, they helped make tax shelters work for corporations that were bilking the U.S. taxpayers out of billions of dollars, and those billions of dollars were lost revenue to the Federal Treasury.  This auto bailout bill proposes to bail out the transit agencies from the consequences of their bad judgment of entering into tax shelters. I say ``bad judgment'' because they ought to know this doesn't make sense. Some lawyer might tell you: We can get by with this because we found this loophole in the tax laws. But, in fact, lawyers can find anything. The English language is not so perfect that we write perfect pieces of legislation that somebody who is wise can't find a way around. That is what happened prior to 2004, before Senator Baucus and I shut it down.  As the transit agencies have found out--and that is why they are coming to the bailout bill for some help--whenyou lie down with dogs, you get fleas. Now that the transit agencies have fleas due to their participation in this tax shelter scheme, they want the Federal Government to be their flea remover. If this provision is enacted and if the Federal Government guarantees the transit agencies' tax shelter obligations, it will actually help these shady tax shelter deals stay alive longer and, who knows, encourage more of this in the future. We are trying to shut down a business I consider illicit, people going through the Tax Code and seeing where they can find a tax loophole and writing a program and go out and sell it. They go out and sell it to somebody else, then flee to the woods, and some corporation or individual has to defend it themselves, and they can't. They get stuck with the tax bill from the IRS. We want to shut down the tax shelter-writing business.  I will not help the transit agencies avoid the consequences of their participation in these tax shelters. I do not want to put U.S. taxpayer money on the line to support tax shelters that have been stealing from these same taxpayers.  I am aware that as early as February 2000, we had a Federal initiative from the executive branch. In the year 2000, the Federal Transit Administration, under the Clinton administration, used to advocate these tax shelter deals to transit agencies as innovative financing. The Federal Transit Administration's promotion of these tax shelters was shameful, and it gave a legitimacy to it. I suppose it even encouraged further tax shelter people to write. But in 2004, Senator Baucus and I said: Enough is enough. That is why the legislation was passed in 2004, shutting down these and saving the taxpayers that $25 billion the Joint Committee on Taxation said could be saved; in other words, paid into the Federal Treasury, instead of some sharp lawyer finding a way to keep it out of the Federal Treasury.  Going back to when these were first being instituted by the Federal agency or encouraged by the Federal agency, we did have the IRS responding to that. So you had one agency promoting something. You had the IRS issue a revenue ruling that came out against these tax shelters. But between that 1999 March 1 date and the time Senator Baucus and I finally concluded this needed to stop in 2004, we still had a bunch of these deals consummated. Even if the transit agencies were not aware of the IRS's position, the transit agencies should have realized that getting money for essentially doing nothing ought to be too good to be true. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is not the right thing to do. That is common advocacy to any consumer in America met by some snake oil salesman who comes along to sell a product. If it sounds too good to be true, you ought to raise questions about it.  We even have a situation where every court that has considered these transactions has ruled they are abusive tax shelters and has not allowed the tax breaks claimed by the corporation that engaged in the tax shelters. Three of these court cases are BB Corporation, the Fifth Third Bancorp, and AWG Leasing Trust. In a recent court opinion involving John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Chief Judge David Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana wrote that the SILO deal at issue was ``pure, abusive tax shelter,'' was ``rotten to the core'' and was ``a sham without economic substance.''  Additionally, in February 2004, Senator Baucus and this Senator sent letters to Washington, DC, New York City, and Chicago transit agencies asking for their assistance in an investigation of these abusive tax shelters.  I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 12, 2004.     Richard A. White,     CEO, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 600          Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. White: We are writing to enlist the assistance of      the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in our      ongoing investigation of abusive tax shelters. On October 21,      2003, the Committee on Finance held a hearing regarding the      continuing proliferation of abusive tax shelters. During that      hearing, we learned that shelter promoters are engaging in      transactions with U.S. municipalities and other state and      local governmental units, which allow major U.S. corporations      to depreciate state and local infrastructure assets, such as      railways, subways, dams, water lines, and air traffic control      systems. Our subsequent investigations have disclosed that      federal agencies have endorsed these transactions, even      though the Department of the Treasury had classified them as      abusive tax shelters.       Under this scheme, municipalities are paid an up-front cash      fee to enter into a long-term lease of their infrastructure      to the tax shelter promoters. The cash received by the      municipality, however, pales in comparison to the federal tax      benefits received by the corporations, which will be able to      depreciate taxpayer-funded bridges, subways, and rail systems      as a result of the lease. As part of the same agreement, the      promoters will agree to simultaneously lease the assets back      to the municipality. The obligations of the promoters and      municipalities are prepaid through ``phantom'' debt, and      neither the tax promoters nor the municipality assumes any      credit or ownership risk. At the end of the lease term, the      infrastructure assets revert back to the municipality. In      reality, nothing changes regarding the ownership or use of      the infrastructure. One municipal manager described these      transactions as ``People giving him money which he never had      to pay back, for doing something that he was already doing.''       In March 1999, the Department of the Treasury under the      Clinton Administration initiated enforcement actions against      these transactions, which are called LILOs--an abbreviation      of their industry name ``lease-in-lease-out'' transactions.      We have further learned that these transactions have      continued, albeit in a different form, and that other federal      agencies may be approving these transactions. The LILO      transactions have now been replicated through service      agreement contracts and transactions called SILOs--``sales-     in-lease-out.'' Other variations on these transactions have      involved qualified technology equipment (QTEs).       We are certain that you share my concern that subway      systems, water lines, waste treatment plants, and air traffic      control systems constructed with taxpayer dollars are being      used by big corporations to shelter billions of dollars in      taxes through bogus depreciation deductions. In order to      assist us in assessing the scope and scale of this problem, I      request that the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority      submit to the Committee on Finance copies of all LILOs,      SILOS, QTEs, and similar transactions that have been      approved, funded, or otherwise reviewed by the Washington      Metropolitan Area Transit Authority from the year 1995 to      present. If you have any questions regarding this request,      please contact Ed McClellan or Matt Genasci of the Senate      Finance Committee at (202) 224-4515.       We appreciate your cooperation in our ongoing efforts to      combat abusive tax shelters, and look forward to receiving      these materials as soon as possible.           With best personal regards,     Charles E. Grassley,       Chairman.

Reuter,     President, New York City Transit,     Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY.
