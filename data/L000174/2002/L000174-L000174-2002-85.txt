President, I thank Senators for this overwhelming vote in bringing this debate to a close. This is a piece of legislation that passed in the other body 400 to 4. This vote shows overwhelming support in this body.  Senator Hatch, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, is necessarily absent. I know he supports this bill, too. And I thank, also on his behalf, those Senators who joined in this vote.  I do not know what the pleasure of the body is, Mr. President, but I am perfectly willing to move forward. I am not going to request a rollcall vote. I don't know if anyone else wishes to have one. I think to have had such an overwhelming vote--93 to 5--gives a pretty good understanding of where the body is on a piece of legislation such as this that covers everything from drug abuse in juvenile areas, to creating 20 new judges, to protecting our FBI in dangerous situations.  So, Mr. President, I am about to yield the floor, but I am perfectly willing to just go forward on the legislation. Obviously, if anybody else wants to speak on it or ask for a rollcall vote, that is their prerogative.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
