 President, last week the Washington Post ran an opinion piece authored by Michael McFaul, a professor of political science at Stanford University, entitled ``The Other Half of the Job.''  Professor McFaul's thesis is that while the budget presented by the President last week contained a significant, and needed, increase in resources for the Department of Defense, it failed to provide a significant, and needed, increase for ``the other means for winning the war on terrorism.'' The budget, Professor McFaul writes, ``builds[] greater American capacity to destroy bad states, but it adds hardly any new capacity to construct good states.''  I share Professor McFaul's concerns about the inadequacy of the international affairs budget, that is, the funds for the State Department and foreign assistance. The President's budget request for foreign affairs for Fiscal Year 2003 is actually less than the amount provided in Fiscal Year 2002, if the funds provided in the emergency supplemental after September 11 are included in the calculation. America's armed forces are doing a brilliant job in the military campaign in Afghanistan. But it will take American diplomats, and our assistance agencies, working with other partners, to win the peace. We cannot win the peace there, or prevent other failed states from becoming havens for terrorism, without giving our people the tools they need.  I commend Professor McFaul's article to my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2002]                       The Other Half of the Job                          (By Michael McFaul)       The United States is at war. President Bush therefore has      correctly asked for Congress to approve additional resources      to fight this war. The new sums requested--$48 billion for      next year alone--are appropriately large. Bush and his      administration have astutely defined this new campaign as a      battle for civilization itself, and have wisely cautioned      that the battle lines will be multifaceted and untraditional.       So why are the new supplemental funds earmarked to fight      this new war largely conventional and single-faceted--i.e.,      money for the armed forces? Without question, the Department      of Defense needs and deserves new resources to conduct the      next phase of the war on terrorism. The Department of Defense      may even need $48 billion for next year.       What is disburbing about President Bush's new budget,      though, is how little creative attention or new resources      have been devoted to the other means for winning the war on      terrorism. The Bush budget is building greater American      capacity to destroy bad states, but it adds hardly any new      capacity to construct new good states.       We should have learned the importance of following state      destruction with state construction, since the 20th century      offers up both positive and negative lessons. Many have      commented that our current war is new and unprecedented, but      it is not. Throughout the 20th century, the central purpose      of American power was to defend against and, when possible,      destroy tyranny.       American presidents have been at their best when they have      embraced the mission of defending liberty at home and      spreading liberty abroad. This was the task during World War      II. This was the objective (or should have been the mission)      during the Cold War. It must be our mission again.       The process of defeating the enemies of liberty is twofold:      Crush their regimes that harbor them and then build new      democratic, pro-Western regimes in the vacuum.       In the first half of the last century, imperial Japan and      fascist Germany constituted the greatest threats to American      national security. The destruction of these dictatorships,      followed by the imposition of democratic regimes in Germany      and Japan, helped make these two countries American allies.       In the second half of the last century, Soviet communism      and its supporters represented the greatest threat to      American national security. The collapse of Communist      autocracies in Europe and then the Soviet Union greatly      improved American national security. The emergency of      democracies in east Central Europe a decade ago and the fall      of dictators in southeast Europe more recently have radically      improved the European security climate, and therefore U.S.      national security interests. Democratic consolidation in      Russia, still an unfinished project, is the best antidote to      a return of U.S.-Russian rivalry.       The Cold War, however, also offers sad lessons of what can      happen when the United States carries out state destruction      of anti-Western, autocratic regimes without following through      with state construction of pro-Western, democratic regimes.      President Reagan rightly understood that the United States      had an interest in overthrowing Communist regimes around the      world. The Reagan doctrine channeled major resources to this      aim and achieved some successes, including most notably in      Afghanistan. State construction there, however, did not      follow state destruction. The consequences were tragic for      American national security.       So why is the Bush administration not devoting greater      capacity for state construction in parallel to increasing      resources for state destruction? Bush's pledge of $297      million for Afghanistan for next year is commendable, but      this one-time earmark does not constitute a serious,      comprehensive strategy for state construction in Afghanistan      or the rest of the despotic world that currently threatens      the United States.       On the contrary, in the same year that the Department of      Defense is receiving an extra $48 billion, many U.S. aid      agencies will suffer budget cuts. Moreover, the experience of      the past decade of assistance in the post-Communist world      shows that aid works best in democratic regimes. Yet budgets      for democracy assistance in South Asia and the Middle East      are still minuscle. Strikingly, the theme of democracy      promotion was absent in President Bush's otherwise brilliant      State of the Union speech.       It is absolutely vital that the new regime in Afghanistan      succeed. Afghanistan is our new West Germany. The new regime      there must stand as a positive example to the rest of the      region of how rejection of tyranny and alliance with the West      can translate into democratic governance and economic growth.      And the United States must demonstrate to the rest of the      Muslim world that we take state construction--democratic      construction--as seriously as we do state destruction. Beyond      Afghanistan, the Bush administration must develop additional,      non-military tools for fighting the new war. To succeed, the      United States will need its full arsenal of political,      diplomatic, economic and military weapons. Bush's statements      suggest that he understands this imperative. Bush's budget,      however, suggests a divide between rhetoric and policy.                          ____________________
