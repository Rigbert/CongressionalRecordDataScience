 President, I understand. The Senator is correct; I was under a misimpression.  As I understand it, for our colleagues here--and I say to my colleague from Michigan, the chairman, I understand it would accommodate other Senators if we were to set a time certain to vote tomorrow morning on this amendment and, I guess, I don't know, the Lieberman amendment--Lieberman/Kyl. I don't know that. But if it is at all possible, I know it should not be a consideration of the Senate and obviously whatever the Senate's will I would abide by it, but it would be very helpful to me as a practical matter--there are these pesky little Presidential debates that intervene and there is one tomorrow in New Hampshire. If it accommodates the body I would be delighted to do it this evening, but if we could consider doing it at 10 o'clock in the morning, it would be very much appreciated by the Senator from Delaware--if that is possible.
