 There is no more important strategic alliance for liberty and with our military than America's membership with European allies in NATO, our dependable transatlantic allies who stood at our side through so many battles for the values we share. The blood lands of Europe directly influence the very founding of our Republic, our fundamental ideals of democracy. NATO, today, stands ready every hour of every day to defend our liberty.  Ukraine, today, is the scrimmage line for liberty for its defense on the European Continent. Thus, when a U.S. President holds back military assistance to Ukraine through NATO and other instrumentalities, Congress must insist on transparency on any conversations that relate to our cooperation with the nation of Ukraine.  Please let me remind, after the collapse of communist Russia in 1991, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Ukraine became a free nation. At least it had a chance to be. Ukraine had been occupied for all of modern history by Russia and began its jagged path forward to the free world, a path that has been tortuous and fraught with danger and setbacks.  It will be a permanent blot on American history that certain Americans, including President Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and several other Trump operatives were actually involved in supporting the corrupt pro-Russian political operatives in Ukraine and doing it to earn money, millions and millions of dollars from Kremlin allies. What an abomination to liberty.  Since Ukraine's Euromaidan Revolution of Dignity 5 years ago, the Ukrainian people have bravely demonstrated their resolute commitment to their nation's democratic future.  The latest example is the recent historic Presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine, which international observers lauded as free and fair. What progress.  Ukraine has managed to make critical reforms, despite the immense pressure of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in which 13,000 poorly equipped Ukrainian troops and many civilians who were in the pathway lost their lives; 30,000 have been injured; and 1.5 million Ukrainians have been dispossessed of their properties and are displaced.  Tragically, Ukraine is at war and must fight a two-front war: one against Russia and one against the enemy from within, the scourge of corruption aided by Kremlin allies every minute of every day.  While Ukraine has sought to shake off the vestiges of Soviet repression, Ukraine's oligarch class has subverted this progress in order to steal and plunder from the people of that nation to advance their own sick, insatiable, and corrupt moneyed interests.  In fact, it might surprise people to hear that, in the State of Ohio, the Ukrainian oligarch who owned the television station that made the current President of Ukraine famous is the largest commercial real estate owner in Cleveland, Ohio. With a net worth of over $1.2 billion, Ihor Kolomoisky is one of the richest oligarchs in Ukraine. But he travels between Ukraine, Cyprus, Israel, and here. His own son was on the basketball team at Cleveland State University.  But this oligarch ran the show, servant of the people, who propelled President Zelensky to stardom. And so the question for history is: Will President Zelensky be his own man, or will he be beholden to oligarchs? Will he stand for liberty, and will the people of this country and this House, who are the Representatives, stand for liberty against repression?  Madam Speaker, I include in the Record material related to my remarks this morning.                    [From Clevescene, June 11, 2019]How Ukrainian Oligarchs Secretly Became the Largest Real Estate Owners                          in Downtown Cleveland                            (By Sam Allard)       In an explosive legal complaint filed last month in      Delaware, attorneys for a major Ukrainian bank alleged that      two oligarchs who founded the bank and controlled it from      2006 to 2016 laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in      fraudulent corporate loans to purchase assets in the United      States and unjustly enrich themselves and their associates.       Dubbed the ``Optima Schemes'' in the 104-page document,      these ``brazen fraudulent schemes'' were successful, among      other things, in making the oligarchs and their co-defendants      the largest commercial real estate holders in Cleveland.       With money siphoned from public bonds and 20 million      private Ukrainian citizens who'd opened accounts with      PrivatBank, the oligarchs Igor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy      Bogolyubov doled out corporate loans to shell companies that      they controlled. They used PrivatBank ``as their own personal      piggy bank,'' in the words of the complaint.       Those loans were then laundered in multiple digital      transactions, sent through dozens of other shell companies      that had been created exclusively for the purpose of      laundering. These accounts were managed by coconspirators at      PrivatBank's branch in Cyprus.       The true origin of the money thus concealed, funds were      then shipped to LLCs in Delaware (hence the legal filing      there). Those LLCs--``One Cleveland Center, LLC,'' to take      just one example--were used to acquire properties and      metalworking facilities in the U.S. Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov      are mineral magnates and own mining factories and      metalworking plants in Ukraine.       The men on the ground in the United States, according to      the complaint, were a Miami-based trio: Mordechai ``Motti''      Korf, his brother-in-law Chaim Schochet, and Uriel Laber.      These three men managed the ``Optima'' companies: Optima      International, Optima Ventures and Optima Acquisitions, all      of which were created and ultimately controlled by Kolomoisky      and Bogolyubov.       ``Optima Ventures'' should be a familiar local name. It was      the company, launched in 2007, used to acquire properties in      the U.S. for Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov. The majority of these      properties were in Cleveland.       Chaim Schochet was Optima's ``front man'' in Northeast      Ohio. He told the Plain Dealer in 2012 that his local goals      were twofold: ``making money for investors betting on the      upside of a Midwestern city, and contributing to the      betterment of a downtown that more high-profile buyers ha[d]      passed by.''       But his investors' funds were ill-gotten, according to the      complaint, proceeds from ``massive, systematic and fraudulent      loan misappropriation and recycling schemes. (In the 2012 PD      piece referenced above, Schochet was reportedly ``circumspect      about discussing how [Optima Ventures] is structured or who      the major investors are.'')       The loan recycling schemes were functionally identical to a      ponzi scheme, except instead of paying purported profits to      early investors with funds from more recent investors, the      Ukrainian oligarchs and their cronies within PrivatBank paid      off early fraudulent corporate loans with money from new      fraudulent corporate loans.       ``On paper, this appeared to be a repayment,'' the      complaint explains. ``But in reality, it was a sham and      fraud, as PrivatBank was repaying itself and increasing its      outstanding liabilities in the process. This process was      carried out over and over again, over a period of many      years.''       In December 2016, the Ukrainian state was forced to      nationalize PrivatBank as a result of the oligarchs' conduct.      The state injected more than $5.5 billion into the bank to      prevent its collapse, and ``preserve the stability of the      [Ukrainian] financial system.'' In 2018, the bank reverted to      private ownership.       The complaint alleges that Korf, Schochet and Laber were in      on the racket, aware of the systematic corruption because      they were under direct supervision from Kolomoisky and      Bogolyubov (or their trusted lieutenant inside PrivatBank,      Timur Novikov), and because they were enriched in the      process. Korf, Schochet and Laber received ``substantial      financial remuneration,'' according to the complaint, which      they used to acquire     millions of dollars worth of property in Florida.       Using the laundered loan proceeds, Optima acquired the      following Cleveland buildings:       One Cleveland Center: 1375 E. 9th St. Acquired for $86.3      million in May, 2008.       55 Public Square. Acquired for $34 million in July, 2008.       Huntington Building: 925 Euclid Ave. Acquired for $18.5      million in June, 2010.       AECOM/Penton Media Building: 1300 E. 9th St. Acquired for      $46.5 million in August, 2010.       Crowne Plaza Building: 777 St. Clair Ave. Acquired in a      joint venture with Denver-based Sage Hospitality Group.       Here's an example of exactly how the properties were      acquired, via the complaint:       On April 29 and 30, 2008 . . . two Ukrainian [metal plants]      owned or controlled by [Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov] drew down      $2.7 million and $4.3 million in loan proceeds from      PrivatBank Ukraine. The purpose of the loans was ``financing      of current business activities of the entity.'' On April 30,      2008, Bocatoro Enterprises Ltd. (``Bocatoro Enterprises''), a      Cypriot entity owned or controlled by [Kolomoisky and      Bogolyubov] drew down $40 million in loan proceeds from      PrivatBank Cyprus for ``replenishment of floating assets for      payments according to contracts, including purchase of      shares.''       However, the loan proceeds were not used for their stated      purposes. Instead, the loan proceeds were combined with funds      from other sources linked to [Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov] and      laundered in forty-two transactions through fifteen      Laundering Accounts, including the accounts of Defendant      Kolomoisky's Divot Enterprises, Ralkon Commercial, and      Pavanti Enterprises, as well as Defendant Bogolyubov's      Bonique, and [K&B's] Blisont Capital and Brotstone accounts.       On information and belief, [K&B] and their co-conspirators      used Pavanti Enterprises to misappropriate and transfer a      combined $36.1 million into the U.S. to the Multi-State Title      Agency Ltd. to fund the acquisition of One Cleveland [Center]      through Optima One Cleveland Center LLC for Optima Ventures.       At its height, Optima Ventures controlled 2.8 million      square feet of downtown Cleveland commercial real estate.      This was a larger footprint than even Forest City Enterprises      at the time.       In recent years, Optima has been selling off its Cleveland      properties, most of which have fallen into disrepair and      suffer from high vacancy rates.       The AECOM building, for example, which Optima acquired in      $46.5 million in 2010, was sold to New-Jersey based Rugy      Realty last summer for $38 million. When Optima bought AECOM      (the former Penton Media Building), it was 90-percent      occupied. But when Rugby purchased it last year, it had      dropped to only 57-percent occupancy and was in need of      significant renovations.       ``We'll fully renovate the lobby so it fits the 21st      century and doesn't look like the 1980s,'' Rugby principal      Robert Ades said at the time of purchase. Rugby's plans also      included updating the elevators, the mechanical components of      which reportedly dated back to 1972.       The Huntington Building (The 925 Building) was sold to      Frank Sinito's Millennia Companies last year for $40 million.      A full overhaul of the building was projected to cost $300      million. The property was characterized by the PD at the time      of sale as a ``gaping hole in the heart of a revitalizing      downtown.''       A situation of disrepair and vacancy can also be found at      55 Public Square, the only building other than One Cleveland      Center that remains in Optima's local ownership portfolio.       A sale was in the works with K&D development last year, but      K&D pulled out, calling the project ``unworkable.'' Though      Optima had purchased it for $34 million in 2008, it was      appraised for only about $20 million last year. The Plain      Dealer reported that the building was ``in dire need of a      makeover'' and that ``only a smattering'' of businesses      occupied the 2nd through 11th floors of the 22-story      structure. The John Q Steakhouse space on the ground floor      has been vacant for years.       Optima retains a management stake in what is now the      downtown Westin Hotel (formerly the Crowne Plaza) and owns      One Cleveland Center, which it refinanced in 2010. Optima      Management Group, the management company affiliated with      Optima Ventures, also works out of One Cleveland Center.       Scene spoke with a representative there by phone, who asked      that questions for Chaim Schochet about the so-called      ``Optima Schemes'' be submitted via email. Shochet provided      the following via Optima Management Group late Tuesday      afternoon:       The allegations in this lawsuit--part of an orchestrated      political attack by a Ukrainian bank against investors in our      thriving businesses--are false, defamatory and utterly      without merit. We intend not only to contest but to disprove      these reckless allegations, and to demonstrate that they are      part of a smear campaign driven by a Ukrainian political      agenda that we have nothing to do with. We are immensely      proud of our extensive track record building a vibrant real      estate portfolio in Cleveland, and we will not let a      frivolous lawsuit tarnish our hard-earned reputation or      distract us from our mission to continue to serve the      interests of the Cleveland community.       Filed on behalf of the current PrivatBank shareholders, the      Delaware complaint seeks damages which could include all of      Optima's U.S. assets. Those include properties in Dallas and      Louisville and metallurgical assets in addition to the      Cleveland portfolio. Among the metallurgical assets that      Optima Acquisitions acquired was a steelmaking plant in      Warren, Ohio, called Warren Steel Holdings LLC. Warren Steel      shuttered permanently in 2016 and laid off 162 workers due to      ``unforeseeable business circumstances.''       Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov are now back in Ukraine after      having fled from their residences in Switzerland to Israel in      2018. Both oligarchs reportedly have Ukrainian, Israeli and      Cypriot citizenship.       The Daily Beast reported in April that Kolomoisky is under      FBI investigation and that the U.S. Attorney's Office in the      Northern District of Ohio was involved in a wide-ranging      probe. Kolomoisky's lawyer said that his client      ``categorically denied'' laundering any money into the United      States.       Kolomoisky has reportedly returned to Ukraine, however,      with the tacit protection of new president Volodymyr      Zelenskiy, a comedian who played the Ukrainian President on      the TV show Servant of the People (now streaming on Netflix).       That show, immensely popular in Ukraine, aired on a network      owned by Kolomoisky.                          ____________________
