 President, I would like to ask my friend one question on my time, if he is willing.  Does the Senator believe that if we defeat this treaty and allow for continued testing, there will be the consensus in this Congress, or in any future Congress, to spend $4.5 billion a year for the next 10 years to fund the Stockpile Stewardship Program?
