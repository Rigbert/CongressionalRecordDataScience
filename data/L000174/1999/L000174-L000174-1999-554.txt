President, I have to oppose this. I have to oppose this, because, one, it would help only two States in the country, Kentucky and Mississippi. It conditions the juvenile accountability block grant in the bill to the other 48 States only if their legislatures did something that they have all refused to do.  We are telling these other States that their legislatures are totally irrelevant; they must change their law because we know better here. I really don't think that is the way to go. I come from a State that has probably the toughest juvenile laws in the country, but I am not going to tell my State how they must do. Frankly, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I hope the 48 States that would be cut out by this would listen to what the National Governors' Association said when they, Republicans and Democrats alike, urged the Senate not to go forward with this.
