When Senator Harkin suggested that we change the number of votes necessary for a filibuster, he used the rules of the Senate, he followed the rules of the Senate. He understood it would take 67 votes for him to succeed and he pressed forward.  If the Republican majority today did exactly as Senator Harkin did, there would be no discussion of a nuclear option. We would move to that point in the calendar, we would take the vote according to the rules, and no one would be paying much attention because that is the routine of the Senate. We would be following the rules of the Senate.
