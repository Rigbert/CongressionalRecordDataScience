Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Orange County, California are exceptional. Orange County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. John Schatz is one of these individuals. On Friday, June 29, 2012, Schatz will end his tenure as the General Manager of the Santa Margarita Water District (SMWD) after 35 years of service to the community.  Schatz graduated from the University of Redlands with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration and received a Juris Doctor from Western State University College of Law in Fullerton in 1989. In 1998 Schatz was appointed by the State Legislature to the Commission on Local Governance for the 21st Century. From 2000 to 2004, he served as an instructor on ``Water Policy in Southern California'' at the University of California at Irvine. He was also a member of Association of California Water Agency's State Legislative Committee for several years.  Prior to becoming General Manager of Santa Margarita Water District, Schatz was the General Manager of Jurupa Community Services District (JCSD) in western Riverside County from 1984 to 1994. Before joining JCSD, he worked in a variety of positions, including Administrative Manager, for the Rancho California Water District in Temecula from 1977 to 1984.  At SMWD, Schatz established a culture of efficiency. Among his accomplishments were doubling the number of connections while reducing staffing from 163 to 122 employees by emphasizing cross-training and expanding the use of technology. During his tenure, Schatz helped keep SMWD's services affordable by holding the line on rate increases while finding cost-saving solutions. In the last 15 years, the District has raised rates only twice and decreased its rates six times. It has reaped an additional $1 million in annual revenues and saved ratepayers $6.9 million. Under Mr. Schatz's leadership, SMWD recently partnered with four other water agencies to complete the $54 million Upper Chiquita Reservoir, creating the largest domestic water reservoir built in south Orange County in 45 years while helping to preserve the county's open space.  In light of all John Schatz has done for the community of Orange County, it is only fitting that he be honored for his many years of dedicated service. John Schatz's tireless passion for conservation and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
