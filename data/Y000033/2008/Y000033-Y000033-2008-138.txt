Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Bill Number: H.R. 5658: Army, RDT, Line 177, PE #0305208A (Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems).  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Battle Command Battle Lab, Mr. Jason Denno, Deputy Director, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: The Constant Look system is a prototype biometric sensing capability developed for the U.S. Army to support MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain). Its unique stand-off capability gives users an ability to support surveillance and special operations remotely. User comments from several demonstration tests included requests for enhancements to improve usability and extend the capability of the system in terms of what can be collected. The Constant Look Operational Support Environment (CLOSE) will provide that additional functionality by leveraging several proven off-the-shelf technologies--a stand-off digital collection system and additional digital signal processing (DSP) to extract other types of biometric signatures.  The U.S. Army's ISR Battle Command Battle Lab at Fort Huachuca (BCBL-H)--responding to user requests--has developed and tested a stand-off biometric sensor system that allows traditional and special operations units to conduct surveillance and identify potential hostiles from a safe distance with a low probability of detection. To date, the majority of the effort on Constant Look has focused on the core collection system technology and the user interface has not kept pace with available commercial technology. CLOSE will remedy that by leveraging millions of dollars in commercial investment and integrating that investment into the Constant Look baseline.  CLOSE will provide CL users with a rapid capability to collect and model surveillance target facilities, including ingress and egress, from the same stand-off range as the CL collection system itself. Secondly, it will extend the DSP capability resident within the CL baseline to extract other types of Indications and Warning (I) data.  Description of matching funds: Not applicable.  Authorized Amount: $4,000,000.  Project Name: Constant Look Operational Support Environment (CLOSE).  Funding Source: Army, RDT, Line 177, PE #0305208A (Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems).  Detailed Financial Plan for Earmark: $200,000, System Engineering; $500,000, Immersive Camera System; $900,000, Interior Tactical Blue Force Tracking, Sense-Thru-The-Wall Radar; $1,500,000, Improvements; $650,000, Biometric Databasing; $250,000, Training, Testing, Delivery. Total: $4,000,000.                          ____________________
