President, I have been in a lot of discussions today by phone, with my staff, and elsewhere, on H.R. 5107, something referred to as the innocent protection act and by others as the DNA act.  I think we are close. In some ways, it is like the perils of Pauline, you are up the hill, down the hill, if we can excuse, at 10 minutes of 8 in the evening, mixed metaphors.  But this is a bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the other body, from the most conservative to the most liberal Members of the other body. Then there is just a little difference, or at the last moment the Department of Justice comes up with some little thing they just thought of.  After a while, one wonders if even with the proven, overwhelming support--polls show overwhelming support for it; the other body has passed it overwhelmingly. I would guess if we actually had a vote in this body, 80 to 90 Members would vote for it. There are always a couple of Members who have some reason for holding it up. I hope we get rid of that. I hope we are coming closer.  I only wanted to say this for my colleagues both in the House and in the Senate who have been working with me and my staff today and working with people everywhere, from church groups to prosecutors' groups throughout yesterday and late last night and throughout today, I am hoping we can settle. That is why I asked the question of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, to make sure we reach such an agreement at some point and we can move forward.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
