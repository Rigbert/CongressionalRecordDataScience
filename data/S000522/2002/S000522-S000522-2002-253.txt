Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues about a very special event that will take place this Monday, May 27th, Memorial Day, in Cooperstown, New York. In a special ceremony, on the day in which we honor America's fallen heroes, the National Baseball Hall of Fame will take time out to honor the 64 members of Baseball's Hall of Fame who served honorably in our nation's armed forces.  Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we remember and honor the dedicated service of all veterans who have worn the uniform of the United States, including those without the famous sobriquets or the notoriety of our baseball legends.  As a fan and amateur player, I have long cherished baseball and those who played the game. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, I have the privilege of working every day on behalf of America's veterans. That is why I am so pleased that the Hall of Fame has chosen to hold this remembrance. During a special ceremony on Monday at Cooperstown, a plaque will be erected in the Hall of Fame Gallery to permanently honor these veterans who earned baseball's highest recognition.  In announcing this event, Dale Petroskey, president of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, explained its purpose:  ``Since the first pitch was thrown, baseball history has been intertwined with American history . . . during World War II, some 95 percent of all major leaguers registered for active duty, including its biggest stars. Hall of Fame members who put themselves in harm's way and sacrificed some of their most productive baseball years join a special category we call true national heroes. This plaque represents their sacrifice and bravery and reminds us of all Americans who have fought--and are continuing to fight--for freedom.''  Mr. Speaker, among the 64 veterans being honored this coming Monday are five veterans of World War II who will be in attendance: Warren Spahn, Bobby Doerr, Bob Feller, Ralph Kiner, and Phil Rizzuto.  Warren Spahn, of Buffalo, New York, was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1973. A left handed batter and pitcher for the Boston-Milwaukee Braves, Mr. Spahn had 363 career wins, led the National League in wins eight times, and was awarded the Cy Young award in 1957 as baseball's most outstanding pitcher. In his 21-year long career, he was voted an all-star 14 times, pitched two no-hitters, and holds the National League record for total number of innings pitched. Mr. Spahn missed the 1943, 1944, and 1945 major league seasons while serving courageously in the United States Army. During his service, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.  Bobby Doerr, known as ``the silent captain of the Red Sox'', played second base for Boston. He held the American League record for handling 414 plays without errors and was also a prominent leader among second basemen in double plays, putouts, and assists. Following his service in the United States Army, Mr. Doerr returned to baseball in 1946, leading the Red Sox to the World Series where he batted a remarkable .406.  Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians was known as ``Rapid Robert'' during his 18 years of professional baseball. In 1940, Mr. Feller led the American League with 27 games won, a 2.61 earned run average, 261 strikeouts, and 31 complete games. Despite the loss of four years in his career due to his time spent serving his country in World War II, Mr. Feller had 2,581 strikeouts and pitched three no-hitters. During his service in the United States Navy, Mr. Feller was awarded five campaign ribbons studded with eight battle stars.  Ralph Kiner played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1946 after his service with the United States Navy. In his 10-year career, Mr. Kiner had 369 homeruns and averaged 7.1 homeruns per 100 at-bats, which places him directly behind Babe Ruth, the all-time leader in this statistical category. In 1951, Mr. Kiner led the National League with a .452 on-base percentage and a .627 slugging percentage. Elected into the Hall of Fame in 1975, Mr. Kiner was known as a true powerhitter who envisioned a home run each time he stepped up to the plate. Following his playing career, he became an announcer for the New York Mets, where he has remained for 40 years, still hosting a popular post-game show called ``Kiner's Corner.''  And finally, Phil Rizzuto, of Brooklyn, New York, played for the Yankees for 13 seasons. Known as ``The Scooter'', Rizzuto was a slick fielding shortstop and incredible base runner who ended his baseball career with a .273 batting average. He was named an All-Star five times and was the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1950. As a member of the United States Navy, Phil Rizzuto fought in World War II for three years and missed the 1943, 1944 and 1945 seasons.  As you can see, Mr. Speaker, these gentlemen were extraordinary ball players who earned the title of American heroes on the diamond. More importantly, they were soldiers, sailors and marine, audacious and brave-hearted, who answered their country's call. Like the other 59 members of the Hall of Fame, including one Civil War veteran, they interrupted successful careers to defend the freedom and liberties that each of us are privileged to enjoy today.  On a day when we celebrate the heroism and honor the memory of millions of men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country, I am pleased to see that these Hall of Famers also honored for their service. It is both fitting and appropriate to pay homage to these special veterans who answered the call to duty when their nation needed them.  Mr. Speaker, I call on all Americans who cherish liberty and freedom to join us thisweekend in respectful recognition of all the brave men and women who have worn the uniform, fought and died for our country. God Bless them all.                          ____________________
