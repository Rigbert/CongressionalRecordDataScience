Mr. Chairman, I want to assure my colleagues from Hawaii that pertaining to section 1812, I continue to be willing to work with them to find an alternative resolution of the issues addressed in that section.  We worked on legislative language last fall that would have transferred the dry-dock back to the Federal Government and compensated TDX for its costs and that would have ended all lawsuits. I am still interested in this framework for a legislative solution to these debilitating lawsuits.  Once again, I remain committed to working out a mutually acceptable solution to this problem with my friends from Hawaii and others, in conference or elsewhere.
