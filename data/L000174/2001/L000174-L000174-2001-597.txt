 Let me talk about what this does: 5 percent to the small feed and grain store could be the difference for them for the year and whether they make it or don't make it.  Dean Witter said this bill gives just one credit card company alone, MBNA, an increase in net profits of 5 percent. That is $75 million. With most of these small businesses we are talking about, 5 percent is not 5 percent of MBNA.  What we want to do--we carve out a special exemption for credit card companies but leave small business owners fending for themselves--is put the small business owners on at least an equal footing.  The credit card companies say they need an exemption because their debts are typically unsecured. Most of these small businesses are exactly the same.  I yield the floor.
