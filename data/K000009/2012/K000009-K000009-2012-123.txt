Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. Albert Ratner of Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Ratner celebrates his 85th birthday on December 27 of this year. In celebration of this milestone, his family and friends are honoring him on December 26, 2012.  Albert Ratner was born in 1927 in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in 1946 and from Michigan State University in 1951. Due to his extensive civic, philanthropic and business history, Albert Ratner also holds an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Long Island University and an Honorary Doctor of Engineering Degree from Polytechnic University, both in Brooklyn, New York. He served in the United State Army. Together, he and his wife Fayeraised two children, Deborah and Brian. Though Faye passed, he and his wife Audrey have been married since 1980.  Al developed Forest City Enterprises, Inc. into a cornerstone company and currently serves as Co-Chairman of the Board Emeritus. He has guided his company throughout the decades to become a respected and well-known corporation. At the same time, Al has served on more than two dozen boards and commissions, where his leadership is legendary.  His philanthropy, civic-mindedness and business acumen have earned Al Ratner numerous accolades. Some of these include Downtown Cleveland Recognition Away, Builders' Magazine 20th Gold Nugget Award, the Charles Eisenman Award, the U.S. Department of HUD's Agora Award, Harvard Business Club of Cleveland's Business Statesman of the Year, Financial World Magazine's CEO of the Year and Bronze Medal, Cleveland Business Hall of Fame, Urban Land Institute's J.C. Nichols Prize for Visionaries in Urban Development, and Michigan State University's Distinguished Alumni Award.  I have been privileged to work with Al Ratner on several initiatives and have appreciated his wise counsel. He epitomizes ``a life well-lived.'' He is a corporate and community leader with boundless energy who has made an indelible contribution to the greater Cleveland community. Not known to mince words, his insights, advice and counsel are sought broadly. He is always willing to assist, to lead and to care. I join his family and friends, his employees and the residents of Cleveland in wishing Al Ratner the happiest of birthdays, with a wish for many more. Onward!                          ____________________
