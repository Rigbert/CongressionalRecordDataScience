He was a member for many years and never came to me to raise this issue. It has not been considered and its potential consequences of cutting 20 percent of Federal assistance grants to states that help law enforcement and encourage arrests in sexual assault and domestic violence cases could be disastrous. It is the wrong way to go.  I think we all agree that victims of sexual assault should receive testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The Leahy-Crapo bill already adds new coverage for HIV testing and services for sexual assault victims. There is also already a five percent penalty in the law for those who don't provide HIV testing.  However, the amendment would mandate that states force tests on defendants, those accused of crimes but not tried or convicted. To require such testing within 48 hours of information or indictment is practically difficult or impossible for many states and violates the state constitution in others. This amendment sets up requirements that many state and local governments cannot comply with and will cause states to lose millions in assistance that helps victims of rape and domestic violence.  The Senator from Oklahoma has consistently voted against VAWA. That is his right. But we should not make the programs more difficult for law enforcement and victims because he does not support them. This is not the right way to reduce government--by setting up government mandates that law enforcement cannot meet and then cutting their assistance funding when they cannot. I do not believe this one-size-fits-all mandate from Washington to our states is the right way to go.  A large majority of states are not in compliance with this provision and would lose crucial funds for preventing rape and domestic violence and helping victims. These funds are particularly important in difficult economic times, and cutting them would be devastating for victims. The amendment's mandate is overly proscriptive and intrusive and would result in a loss of crucial services to many victims. That is why the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women strongly opposes this amendment.  I am willing to work on even more ways to ensure that rape victims receive all needed treatment. But doing so with measures that will punish the rape victims themselves by denying them access to needed services is inhumane and counter-productive. I urge Senators to oppose this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in opposition to amendment No. 16 to S. 47, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: The National Task Force to End Sexual      and Domestic Violence is comprised of national, tribal,      state, territorial and local organizations, as well as      individuals, committed to securing an end to violence against      women, and we are urging Senators to oppose Amendment No. 16      to S. 47, proposed by Senator Coburn. The National Task Force      strongly supports the increased availability of treatment      options for victims of sexual violence who have acquired a      sexually transmitted infection as a result     of an assault. While ostensibly this amendment addresses that      issue, it in fact fundamentally alters the purpose and      approach of one of VAWA's key grant programs and severely      penalizes grant recipients for compliance failures that may      be impossible for them to meet.       The National Task Force would welcome the addition of      treatment to the existing language in S. 47 related to victim      testing and counseling and the expansion of this purpose area      to include all sexually transmitted infections.       However, amendment 16 goes well beyond this recommendation.      The amendment would require all recipients one of VAWA's      grant programs to pay for sexual assault victims' treatment      for sexually transmitted infections. Amendment 16 is overly      prescriptive and fails to allow states and local governments      to address other pressing violence against women priorities      in their communities. Additionally, it is administratively      unworkable because grantees will have no way to budget for      unanticipated costs of treatment.       Additionally, amendment 16 goes far beyond current law to      require grantees to certify that state law requires testing      offenders for all sexually transmitted infections or risk      lose 20% of their grant funding. Many states are already      losing 5% of certain grants for failure to comply with      existing law requiring HIV testing of offenders. Amendment 16      would result in 20% grant penalties for many local      governments who would have no way to comply. It is a one size      fits all approach to a grant program that was designed      specifically to meet critical community priorities as      identified by those communities.           Sincerely,                                    National Task Force to End                                      Sexual and Domestic Violence                                                    Against Women.
