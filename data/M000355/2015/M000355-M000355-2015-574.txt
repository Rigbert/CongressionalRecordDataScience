 President, this morning I said the American people are ready to see Democrats start supporting, not blocking, the very bipartisan funding legislation they previously voted for and actually bragged about. I also said we would give our colleagues a chance to do so this week. So I have just set up a vote that will give them that opportunity.  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill is one of the 12 pieces of appropriations legislation we must pass to properly fund our government. It is a bipartisan bill that does a lot of important things for our country, but here is the headline: It supports our veterans.  This bipartisan bill passed committee with support from both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have said nice things about it in press releases that were sent out to their various States. Now it is time to cooperate across the aisle to finally pass it and support our veterans.
