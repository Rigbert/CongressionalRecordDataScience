President, allowing consumers access to their home state consumer protection laws is the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.                               Exhibit 1         Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Consumer Federation of            America, U.S. PIRG,                                                     June 8, 1999.       Dear Senator: As the full Senate prepares to consider S.      96, The McCain-Wyden-Dodd legislation limiting the liability      of companies responsible for Y2K computer processing      failures, the undersigned consumer groups remain concerned      about the negative effects this legislation will have on      consumers with legitimate Y2K claims. While we would support      legislation to provide incentives to companies to evaluate      and address Y2K problems and product defects, we believe that      S. 96 will have the opposite consequences.       Insulating companies from Y2K liability will only serve to      protect those who have done the least to address their      problems and will render consumers far more vulnerable as a      result. We ask that you support the Leahy amendment, which      would exempt consumer cases from this legislation. Most      experts expect Y2K litigation to be brought primarily by      businesses against other businesses. These litigants will      have contracts with one another that have been drafted to      protect their individual interests. Consumers will not have      benefit of these protections in the marketplace.       In addition, there is federal precedent for a consumer      carve-out in Y2K legislation. The language of the Leahy      amendment is the same language that appears in the law passed      last year, the Y2K Readiness and disclosure Act. Among the      provisions of S. 96 that are most harmful to consumers:       Elimination of Joint and Several Liability. The sweeping      change in this longstanding tort concept will likely leave      consumers uncompensated for damages if one or more defendants      cannot be held liable for the full amount of loss suffered.      The two narrow exceptions to this provision will be of little      benefit to most plaintiffs, and many could be left without      full compensation, even for their economic losses.       Class Actions Removed to Federal Court. Any class action      with aggregated damages of $1 million or more could be      removed to federal court, where cases are likely to face a      large backlog of cases and thus long delays and additional      expense. S. 96 also requires notification by return mail to      each potential plaintiff in a class action, a provision that      may well make bringing these cases financially and      practically impossible--leaving class members without a      remedy.       Caps on Punitive Damages. S. 96 caps punitive damage at      $250,000 or three times compensatory damages, whichever is      less, for defendants with a net worth less than $500,000 or      businesses with fewer than 50 employees, unless plaintiffs      can prove the defendant specifically intended to injure them.      Caps on punitive damages send the wrong signals to the most      irresponsible companies, acting as a disincentive to fix      problems before they occur.       Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. In most states, products      are warranted to be fit for the purpose for which they are      sold. Under S. 96, warranty disclaimers on the packaging or      software--the fine print that consumers rarely read--may keep      consumers from recovering for defective products and the      losses they cause, unless they are proven to manifestly      contradict state law, a difficult standard to meet.       For these reasons, we ask you to support Senator Leahy's      consumer protection/consumer carve-out amendment.                                  ____    Examples of How Senate Y2K Liability Bill is Unfair to Consumers       The examples below demonstrate the ways in which S. 96      would make it difficult, if not impossible, for consumers      with legitimate claims to get full compensation from      responsible parties. This legislation will have a direct      effect on consumers and will likely result in many consumers      being left without a remedy for Y2K problems.                 the case of the non-compliant software       In 1998, Mrs. Betty Barnes purchases a new home computer,      paying an extra $500 for special software that will allow her      to pay her bills and manage her household finances using the      system. One year later, Mrs. Barnes finds that the software      is not Y2K compliant and will not work after the Year 2000.      She calls the store where she bought the software to get a      version of the software that will work. The store tells her a      ``patch'' to correct the problem is available but will cost      an additional $250. Mrs. Barnes then writes to the software      manufacturer asking for a fix for the defective program. The      manufacturer writes back within 30 days telling her that she      will have to pay $250 for the Y2K compliant version of the      program.       Under the bill, Mrs. Barnes must wait an additional 60 days      before she can bring any legal action against the software      manufacturer. The manufacturer has met its obligation by      responding to the letter even though the company did not      agree to fix the problem for a reasonable price. Mrs. Barnes      has no right to a free fix or a reasonably priced upgrade      under S. 96. She must wait 60 days even if the manufacturer      has proposed an unfair solution to the problem. Mrs. Barnes      has no bargaining power to force the manufacturer to offer a      more fair solution.       S. 96 does have an exception to the 60-day waiting period:      Mrs. Barnes can sue for injunctive relief. She speaks to a      lawyer and finds out this will not help her in her case.      Injunctive relief is difficult to obtain; it requires proof      of (1) irreparable injury if the problem is not dealt with      immediately, (2) a strong likelihood of winning on the merits      and (3) no adequate remedy at law. Mrs. Barnes is unlikely to      be able to prove irreparable injury. Even if she could, her      likelihood of prevailing on the merits is diminished by the      federal law that makes it harder for plaintiffs in Y2K cases      to win. (She could show that she has no adequate remedy at      law because she cannot sue at this stage.)       Mrs. Barnes is forced to wait for two months before she can      file suit. During this time, she is unable to use the      software for which she paid $500.00--she can't balance her      checkbook, she can't pay her insurance or mortgage, she can't      do her taxes.       After the 60-day period expires, Mrs. Barnes lawyer files      suit against the software manufacturer. under S. 96, she has      to plead her case with specificity, even though she knows      little at this point about her case except that her software      isn't Y2K compliant and she has been barred from conducting      any discovery while the 60 day period ran out. The      manufacturer moves to dismiss the case, arguing that S. 96      protects them from Mrs. Barnes' suit. The software package      has a disclaimer that says, in fine print, ``there are no      warranties, express or implied, that apply to the sale of      this product.'' Under S. 96, the terms of a contract--     including a warranty--prevail over any consumer protection      statutes in state law unless the language in the contract is      deemed to ``manifest and directly'' contradict state law. The      software company argues that the state law that disfavors      this kind of disclaimer does not ``manifestly and directly''      contradict state law. Since this is an issue of first      impression, each side must present legal arguments on this      issue, adding much cost and delay to the suit. If Mrs. Barnes      loses, she will have no legal recourse, even if the      manufacturer knowingly sold her defective software.       Luckily, Mrs. Barnes survives the motion to dismiss. She      and her lawyer now have the chance to conduct discovery. They      learn that there are a number of companies involved      in manufacturing of her particular software, and they move      to add them as defendants. The companies based in the      United States claim little or no responsibility for the      Y2K failure. They all point to a Japanese software maker      as the source of the problem. Mrs. Barnes can't sue the      Japanese software maker since it does not do business in      the U.S. If the jury finds that the Japanese company is      the defendant most at fault, S. 96's limitations on joint      and several liability will mean Mrs. Barnes can never      recover fully for her damages.       Without evidence of specific intent to injure nor knowing      commission of fraud, as required under S. 96, Mrs. Barnes      cannot hold all defendants jointly and severally liable. Mrs.      Barnes learns that the U.S. manufacturer recklessly placed      this software on the market without bothering to check that      is was Y2K compliant. But ``reckless conduct'' isn't enough      under S. 96 to allow the court to hold the U.S. manufacturer      liable for the entire injury, even though the injury could      not have occurred without its participation. Since Mrs.      Barnes damages are not equal to 10% of her net worth as      required under S. 96, she is not eligible to use that      provision to bring the case for an ``uncollectible'' share.      Mrs. Barnes can get only that percentage the jury says the      U.S. manufacturer is responsible for causing.       If the Japanese company is judgment-proof, the U.S.      manufacturer could be responsible for up to 50% more of its      initial share. If the jury finds the U.S. manufacturer was      20% liable and the Japanese company was 80% liable, and Mrs.      Barnes can't collect from the Japanese company, the U.S.      manufacturer is responsible for 50% more than its original      share, a total of 30%. Mrs. Barnes can never recover the      other 70% damages she is owned.                 the case of the consumer class action       S. 96 provisions on class actions will result in      meritorious cases being dismissed, leaving consumers with no      practical means for collecting damages.       Assume the same facts as above, but this time Mrs. Barnes      learns that a number of other consumers have bought the same      software and are having the same problems. Together they file      a class action suit in Mrs. Barnes' home state against the      manufacturer. They are able to meet the material defect      requirement imposed on those filing class actions as well as      the heightened pleading standards. The manufacturer, noting      that there are plaintiffs from a number of different states,      under the rules of S. 96 would be entitled to file a motion      to remove the case to federal court. The federal court,      required to resolve differences between and among state laws,      decides there are not enough common issues of law among the      various state laws, and the class action is returned to the      state. The class is disbanded there. While individuals are      free to bring suit on their own, each case is for such small      monetary value, few consumers or lawyers are interested or      willing to pursue the case individually. Mrs. Barnes can't      find a lawyer to take her case and she is left without a      remedy.                   the case of the chemical disaster       Mrs. Jacqueline Jensen owns a home several streets away      from the Acme Chemical Company. Like 85 million other      Americans, she lives and works within 5 miles of the one or      more of the nation's 66,000 facilities that handle or store      high hazard chemicals.       On January 1, 2000 Acme's safety system fails and hazardous      chemicals are released into the air and onto the land in the      neighborhoods, forcing Mrs. Jensen and others to evacuate      their homes. People are allowed back to their homes after 2      days, but Mrs. Jensen's property is contaminated, including      her well. Mrs. Jensen retains an attorney and files a tort      claim to recover for the damage to her property.       Acme Chemical claims that a Y2K computer failure was      partially at fault for the safety system malfunction. Mrs.      Jensen did not know Y2K was a defense, so she and her lawyer      did not look up the new statute or file a per-litigation      notice before filing suit. Under S. 96, Acme treats      the complaint as the notice, even though it does not      contain all of the required information because Mrs.      Jensen and her lawyer initially had no idea this was a Y2K      case and there was a new law to follow in addition to the      requirements of filing a civil suit under state law.       Under S. 96, even when consumers' homes and surrounding      properly is contaminated, they cannot file suit right away,      even though they aren't waiting for a computer malfunction to      be fixed. The waiting period applies to all cases, even those      where it is not relevant. Mrs. Jensen must wait 30 days for      Acme to respond to her notice/complaint. In 30 days Acme      responds by saying it cannot pay for the cleanup and lost      value of Mrs. Jensen's home. Nonetheless, Mrs. Jensen still      must wait an additional 60 days to refile her lawsuit. S. 96      only requires defendants to state what steps, if any, they      will take within 60 days for the additional waiting period to      commence. All discovery is stayed during this period, so Mrs.      Jensen and her attorney have no way to gather additional      information about the events surrounding the chemical spill.       In two months, Mrs. Jensen refiles her suits against Acme      and Safety Systems, Inc., the company that installed its      computers. Under S. 96, she must plead her case with      particularity in the complaint. While she can state her      damages as required, she has difficulty specifying the      material defect that caused the accident and specific      evidence of the defendants' state of mind since she has still      not been able to do discovery in the case. The defendants      move to dismiss the complaint for failure to meet the      pleading requirements. After briefs back and forth debating      what the new law requires, the judge does dismiss the case      but without prejudice, allowing Mrs. Jensen an opportunity to      file an amended complaint (now her third).       Somehow, Mrs. Jensen finds enough information to survive      another motion to dismiss     and finally has her day in court. After hearing the case, the      jury finds that both defendants acted recklessly and      outrageously for not identifying and fixing the Y2K problems      at the plant, and awards Mrs. Jensen $300,000 to compensate      her for her property damages and the need to replace her      water supply. The jury finds that Acme is 70 percent      responsible and Safety Systems 30% liable. The jury also      finds by clear and convincing evidence that Acme's conduct is      so outrageous as to warrant punitive damages and assesses a      one million-dollar punitive damage award. The jury also finds      substantial evidence that Safety Systems knew the system it      installed might not work and that it should have fixed the      Y2K problem, which is enough for them to be assessed punitive      damages under state law, but Mrs. Jensen could not make that      showing by clear and convincing evidence as required by S.      96.       Under S. 96, a consumer who suffers harm limited in amount      of punitive damages she can collect. The total amount of Mrs.      Jensen's award from the jury is $1.3 million dollars--     $1,210,000 against Acme ($210,000 compensatory and $1,000,000      punitive) and $90,000 against Safety Systems. Acme employes      40 people, so the punitive damages awarded against them is      reduced by the judge according to the cap under S. 96 to      $250,000. The adjusted award is now $550,000 against Acme and      Safety Systems.       Acme cannot pay for all of the damage caused by the      accicent to Mrs. Jensen and her neighbors and files for      bankruptcy. Safety Systems pays Jensen $90,000, but this is      not nearly enough to let her clean up her property and get a      new water supply--especially after she pays her legal costs.      She tries to collect from Acme, but without success. After 3      months, she applies to the court to require Safety Systems to      pay the rest of the compensatory damage award. Under state      law, they could be required to pay the full amount, but under      S. 96, the maximum they would have to pay is 30% of the      uncollectible share but no more than 50% over Safety Systems'      own contribution. Under this formula, Mrs. Jensen is able to      collect an additional $45,000 from Safety Systems, leaving      her with a actual unrecoverable damages to her property--i.e.      direct economic loss--of $165,000 exclusive of legal fees and      costs.       Although the jury found that Safety Systems acted      recklessly, they do not have to pay the full amount of the      compensatory award--even if they could afford to do so.       Under her state's law, Mrs. Jensen would have received      $1,300,000, that is, full compensation for her losses from      the responsible parties. Because of S. 96, Mrs. Jensen will      be left with only $135,000, not nearly enough to compensate      for her loss and pay her legal fees and costs.               the case of the disclosed medical records       Mrs. Sally Sargent lives in a small town. Her physician is      treating her for HIV. She has been seen at the local hospital      during bouts of pneumonia, but more recently has been on      drugs that have improved her overall health and enabled her      to work. Her biggest fear is that her employer will learn of      her HIV status, which will surely mean the loss of her job in      a rather straight-laced company and that her children will be      ostracized at school. She has been assured by the hospital      that all of her records will be kept confidential.       The hospital records department ignored its potential Y2K      problem, though they were warned by hospital administrators      to check the record system for Y2K bugs. As a result, the      hospital's computer records are mistakenly distributed to      abroad group of hospital personnel. One of those hospital      employees has a child who attends school with Mrs. Sargent's      daughter. This mother becomes very agitated, calls the school      with the information, and before long the rumor about Mrs.      Sargent's medical condition gets around to the whole      community. Mrs. Sargent's daughter is ostracized from her      classmates, and she herself suffers great emotional distress.      When her employer discovers she has HIV, she is fired from      her job.       Under S. 96, her emotional distress and mental suffering      claim is not exempted from the bill, as are personal injury      cases involving physical injuries. Failing to exempt cases      brought for emotional distress and mental suffering, if they      happen to occur unaccompanied by physical injury, is grossly      unfair to individuals who have suffered real harm. In this      case, Mrs. Sargent would have to meet all of the procedural      hurdles and substantive legal limitations if she tried to sue      the hospital for negligent or intentional infliction of      emotional distress and her lost wages and related damages.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment, for all intents and purposes, will emasculate the bill. It will deny consumers, those least able to pay for attorneys, to hire attorneys to solve any Y2K problems, the average consumer the ability to resolve a problem quickly, within a maximum of 90 days, without litigation.  It also allows more of the Tom Johnson-type lawsuits: No requirement that there be an actual injury, no requirement that there be a real problem. This would negate the attempt by S. 96 to limit frivolous lawsuits.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
