I will, however, make the observation that the gentleman mentions that going back to 1977 there was a bill on this floor. Of course, in 1993 there was a bill for which 218 Democrats voted and no Republicans voted that I will remind the gentleman cut over $250 billion of spending.  I know you would want to be reminded of that and not forget that. I am prepared to get into a debate, but I wanted to correct that observation because very frankly your side tends to ignore the cuts that were effected in 1993 and look only to the revenue which was raised in 1993 which, of course, ultimately from our perspective, and I think accurately, created significant surpluses in this country for 4 years in a row.  I will yield to my friend.
