 Speaker, the process that we are dealing with this evening is nothing less than an outrage. The idea that on an issue of this great importance those of us in the minority are not being allowed to offer a resolution of our own is an insult to the democratic process and tells us why we have to end one party government in America.  The Republican resolution talks about democracy in Iraq. I am all for that. But I would also like to see some democracy on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Three and a half years ago, when we were asked to give the President the authority to go to war in Iraq, I voted against that resolution, and I think history will indicate that that was the right vote.  Three and a half years ago President Bush told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq was likely to attack us, and that it was necessary to wage a preemptive war against them. President Bush was wrong.  Three and a half years ago, we were told that there was a link between Iraq and al Qaeda. That was wrong.  Three and a half years ago, we were shown all of those aluminum tubes which allegedly told us about a nuclear weapons program in Iraq. That was wrong.  Three and a half years ago, we were told that Iraq was importing depleted uranium from Niger. That was wrong.  Mr. Speaker, terrorism is a major problem for our country and the world. Unfortunately, in many respects, the war in Iraq has created more terrorists than it has stopped, and has deflected our attention away from the fight against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.  Mr. Speaker, let us bring our troops home as soon as possible. Let us mount a focused campaign against terrorism with military force, with improved intelligence capabilities and with an understanding that we need to work with the entire world.
