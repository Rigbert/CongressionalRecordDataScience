Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. William C. Richardson, who for the past ten years has shown great leadership and vision as the President and CEO of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Throughout his lustrous career, Bill has tirelessly worked for the betterment of his community and has significantly impacted countless individuals both professionally and personally. Although he will be retiring at the end of this year, the dedication and mission to promote and improve philanthropy that Bill has set forth will no-doubt continue long into the future.  Dr. Richardson has been exceedingly active within the public, private, and non-profit sectors of society. He has served as president of the Johns Hopkins University, executive vice president and provost of Pennsylvania State University, and dean of the graduate school and vice provost for research of the University of Washington.  In addition to his great work with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and our institutions of higher education, Bill is a trustee of the Council of Michigan Foundations, a former chair and board member of the Council on Foundations, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Public Health Association.  Dr. Richardson has received numerous honors throughout his distinguished career, and I am pleased to call him a friend. I have known Bill for a long time and have often looked towards his leadership for guidance. The great work that Bill and the Foundation have accomplished over the past 10 years has stretched throughout our country and world. The impact that Bill has had on countless communities throughout his career is truly awe inspiring. The folks of southwest Michigan are fortunate to call Bill a neighbor. On behalf of the Sixth District, I wish Bill and his family all the best in retirement--we are all better off because of his service.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2466]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE TO DR.
