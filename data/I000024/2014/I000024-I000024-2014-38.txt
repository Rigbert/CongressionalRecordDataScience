President, it is my privilege also to honor the life and sacrifice of Army SGT Ryan M. Wood, of Oklahoma City, OK who died with two other servicemembers on June 21, 2007, of wounds suffered from a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq.  Born June 11, 1984 in Oklahoma City, OK, Ryan graduated from Putnam City North High School in 2002 and signed up for the Army after the September 11 terrorist attacks. ``The war gave Ryan a mission,'' said his sister, Candice Bunce. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany. ``He accomplished his mission and left this world with dignity and honor.''  Ryan was an accomplished artist who had received an acceptance letter from the University of Central Oklahoma to study art and political science. On his second tour to Iraq, he had the names of two other soldiers who died in combat tattooed on his chest.  His stepfather Scott Vincent said he hoped Wood's death will remind others that American soldiers are dying for their country in Iraq. ``The majority of them are proud to be there,'' he said. ``They don't want to be forgotten. They want to have the tools to do their job.''  Funeral services were held at the Church of the Servant in northwest Oklahoma City, OK.  Speaking at the funeral, Ryan's uncle Army Maj. John Litchfield said his nephew had a noble spirit that his men could sense. He spent 607 days in combat, his uncle said. ``Even as a teenager, that noble spirit would not allow you to sit by and accept the injustices of the world,'' he said.  ``Ryan felt Iraq was a job we had to finish. It wasn't something we could walk away from,'' Scott Vincent said. ``He was dedicated to being there, and he was extremely well-loved by all his men.''  Ryan is survived by his mother Renee Wood-Vincent; father Bonner Wood; stepfather Scott Vincent; sister Candice Bunce; and numerous other relatives and friends.  Today we remember Army SGT Ryan M. Wood, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
