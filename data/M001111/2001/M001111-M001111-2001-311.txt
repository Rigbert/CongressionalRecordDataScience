 President, we began the discussion this morning about the very important issue of reducing class sizes in first, second, and third grades. To me, this is one of the most important issues facing us as we debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act: whether or not we are going to continue our commitment to first, second, and third grade classrooms across this country to ensure students are in a class small enough for them to learn the basic skills that all of us want them to learn: reading, writing, and math.  I see the Senator from Iowa is on the floor. He has been a very strong supporter of reducing class size in early grades.  I yield for him.
