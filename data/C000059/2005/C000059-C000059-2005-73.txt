Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a man who will long be remembered for his innumerable contributions and the tremendous leadership he displayed in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. Harley Knox was an entrepreneur, farmer, developer, and all-around community leader. Personally, he was a loyal and dear friend. Last week, Harley lost a five-month battle with bone cancer and our region collectively mourns his passing, while remembering his lifelong contributions to the Inland Empire.  Harley discovered his entrepreneurial spirit at the early age of twelve, when after WWII, demand from farmers and gardeners prompted a need for fertilizer. For a fee, Harley would clean chicken coups and then sell the fertilizer to large farms and gardeners. His modest, yet successful business soon became more than he could handle alone, so he employed neighborhood kids to help him out.  Later on, Harley capitalized on the increased popularity of Dichondra lawns in front of ranch-style homes and soon began harvesting his family's front yard and selling flats of Dichondra. The popularity of the grass continued, so Harley persuaded neighbors to let him buy portions of their lawns for resale. By the age of 20, he was selling Dichondra across Southern California and the family was buying land for farming the grass. A second business was born when he then began developing farming equipment to collect and process Dichondra seed.  By the 1950s, Harley was president of Knox Seed Company, Inc. and moved operations to farmland adjacent to what is now March Air Reserve Base. The company expanded into producing seed for grain crops, turf grass and sod. After eventually selling the seed business, Harley focused on developing farming tools and was president of Knox Manufacturing Co. of Moreno Valley from 1977 to 1986. The firm developed high-speed produce harvesters and held patents that soon became the industry standard.  In 1983 he founded the land development and consulting firm Harley Knox & Associates, which still develops industrial projects, assists with land-use regulation and attaining government entitlements. More recently, Harley was a partner in March Global Port, an industrial development on 400 acres on the south side of March Air Reserve Base. The project lists Philips Electronics and DHL as tenants and provided the region with a significant economic contribution in the wake of the downsizing of the military base.  In addition to his entrepreneurial efforts, Harley served as an active member of numerous community organizations, such as the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, The Valley Group, the Riverside County Building Industry Association, the Western Riverside County Council of Governments, the Riverside Community College Foundation, and the Riverside Community Hospital Foundation. Following an appointment by former Gov. Pete Wilson, Harley served as commissioner of the California Boating and Waterways Commission.  The Inland Empire is a better place to live today because of Harley's extraordinary contributions and his selfless dedication to his community. On behalf of the Inland Empire I want to convey our appreciation for all of Harley's efforts and express our heartfelt condolences to the Knox family, including his wife Donna, daughter Victoria and sons Bryan and Aaron, as well as his four grandchildren.                          ____________________
