 President, in February my State lost one of its great citizens and the father of the Washington State wine industry, Walter Clore.  My colleagues in the Senate may not know a fact that many wine drinkers around the globe have learned the last few years: Washington state produces some of the highest quality wine in the world. In 2001, Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Washington state as ``Wine Region of the Year'' in recognition of its fast emergence as a global leader in producing quality wines.  I am very pleased that Walter Clore lived to see this honor--and so many other honors--bestowed on Washington wine. These honors reflect just how far the Washington wine industry has come. They are also an outstanding tribute to the legacy of Walter Clore and his vision, hard work, and dedication.  I had the great privilege to meet Walter Clore in August 2002. That month, I spent two days traveling through Washington wine country--from Yakima to Prosser to the Tri-Cities to Walla Walla. I toured wineries and vineyards and visited with wine grape growers, vintners, and researchers.  Walter Clore was himself a researcher. He spent 40 years at the Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center in Prosser, Washington, an institution that has helped lead Washington agriculture forward in so many ways. During his career, Walter developed and tested wine grape varieties throughout Washington State.  Walter Clore retired in 1976, but he was not content to relax and watch from the sidelines. Using his 40 years of experience and knowledge, he connected emerging vintners with promising varieties and pointed them to ideal sites for growing wine grapes.  I am deeply saddened by the loss of Walter Clore. But I take solace in the fact that he pursued his passion with unrelenting determination and transformed his vision of a vibrant Washington wine industry into a reality. We need more pioneers like Walter Clore.  Today, Washington state's $2.4 billion wine industry is the Nation's second largest producer of premium wines. The industry boasts more than 200 wineries and 300 wine grape growers. More important to consumers than the size of the industry, my State continues to earn respect for its quality, affordable wines.  I believe the best way to pay tribute to Walter Clore is to continue his legacy. As a U.S. Senator, that means funding research through USDA and institutions like Washington State University to keep the industry healthy and on the cutting edge. It means investing in trade promotion initiatives like the Market Access Program so that Washington wine can earn the markets and worldwide recognition it deserves. And it means creating opportunities for Washington wine country to become a destination spot for wine lovers who live in the Pacific Northwest and around the Nation.  As Washingtonians, we are so proud to call Walter Clore our own. On behalf of the Washington wine industry, I want to express my condolences to Walter's family. I also want to let them know that we will continue to build on his great legacy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Wine Press Northwest about Walter Clore be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wine Press Northwest, Feb. 3, 2003]           Walter Clore, ``Father of Washington Wine,'' Dies       Yakima, Wash.--Dr. Walter Clore, the man known as the      ``Father of Washington Wine,'' passed away this morning. He      was 91.       Clore, who in 1972 predicted wine consumption would triple      in the U.S. by 1999, died in a Yakima-area convalescent home.      Considered the father of Washington wines, Clore came up with      the idea of growing wine grapes in the Columbia Valley after      arriving in Prosser soon after Prohibition was repealed.       Clore retired from the Washington State University      Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Station in 1976,      four years after he commented on the future of wine in this      country at a chamber of commerce meeting. His involvement      remained strong well into retirement. Last summer, he visited      with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray when she toured the region's wine      country.       Clore literally helped write the book on the Washington      wine industry. In fact, The Wine Project, co-authored by Ron      Irvine, serves as a biography of sorts for the man some view      as the Johnny Appleseed of vinifera grapes in the state.       He spent 40 years at the Prosser Experiment Station. During      his tenure, Clore, more than any other individual, is      responsible for convincing Eastern Washington farmers they      could grow world-class wine grapes.       Clore was born July 1, 1911, and grew up in Oklahoma during      Prohibition and was raised a teetotaling Methodist. He came      to Washington State College in 1934 on a $500 fellowship. In      1937, Clore was appointed assistant horticulturist. He was      the third faculty member on staff at the center and began      working with tree fruits and small fruits--including grapes.       One of Clore's primary contributions to the industry was      figuring out where premium wine grapes could be grown in the      state. He grew vinifera varieties throughout the state and      collected volumes of data on how they fared. He retired in      1976.       Soon after, the Washington wine industry began to grow in      earnest and Clore began consulting. Stimson Lane Vineyards      and Estates, which owns Columbia Crest and Chateau Ste.      Michelle, sought Clore's advice. He pointed them to several      sites that have turned out of be among best in the state,      including Horse Heaven Hills and Cold Creek.       ``The industry got a running start because he planted      scores of varieties throughout the Columbia Valley and      collected the data necessary for vintners to make reasonable      decisions about where to site a vineyard or winery,'' said      Ted Baseler, president of Stimson Lane. ``Prior to that,      many people decided it was a foregone conclusion that      premium wine grapes could not be grown in Washington.''       Last fall, Columbia Crest honored Clore by naming its      Bordeaux-style red blend the Walter Clore Private Reserve.      It's an honor Clore, 91, appreciated on a couple of levels.       ``I read in a recent Wine Spectator that Opus One earned a      93 point rating (out of 100) and was priced at $150,'' Clore      said during an Oct. 16 ceremony at the Paterson, Wash.,      winery. ``I also read that the Columbia Crest Walter Clore      Reserve received a 92 rating and was priced at $30.''       Several of those grape growers, along with Clore's friends      and company officials, came out to help Columbia Crest and      Clore toast the 1999 vintage. Special guests included     George Carter--Clore's longtime assistant--and Les Fleming,      pioneer Grandview winery and vineyard manager.       Doug Gore, vice president and head winemaker at Columbia      Crest, said part of the honor includes naming the room where      the reserve wine is aged as the Walter Clore Barrel Room.       ``There are a lot of legends in the Washington wine      industry, but it was Walter Clore who first dreamed it was      possible,'' Gore said. ``The modern-day legends are a      validation that he was right.''       Gore likes to tell the story about when he was a brand-new      assistant winemaker at Chateau Ste. Michelle's Grandview      winery and was told by his boss Kay Simon that if any grower      comes to the back door wanting an analysis of their grapes to      shoo them around to the front.       ``There was this kindly looking gentleman who came to the      back door wanting a sample run on some grapes, and I told him      to go around front. However he was persistent, so I asked who      he was and he told me, Walt Clore. I apologized for trying to      get rid of him. That was the beginning of a long association      with the man who I consider the Johnny Appleseed of      Washington's wine grape industry,'' Gore said.       In the preface to The Wine Project, Clore wrote: ``I grew      up during Prohibition in a teetotaler, nonsmoking Methodist      family. My mother was a staunch Women's Christian Temperance      Union Member.''       It was an interest aside to the man who grew up to be      called the father of the Washington's wine industry, which      today is vigorous, flourishing and much in debt to Clore's      visionary research.       It was Clore, a horticulturist at WSU's Prosser research      station, who was asked more than 40 years ago to look at the      potential of growing vinifera wine grapes in Eastern      Washington.       ``I was intrigued and was given the research task of      determine the best adaptable varieties for making premium      wines,'' he said.''This was not a difficult task, as I found      the interest of co-workers high including not only those in      Washington but Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia'' he wrote.       Clore also helped develop the rare Lemberger red variety      and found some willing disciples. One of these was Kiona      Vineyards Winery in the Red Mountain AVA, which has made      Lemberger for more than 20 vintages.       John Williams, who with grower Jim Holmes was one of the      original partners at Kiona, said, ``Dr. Clore was the man in      the state's wine industry as far as I'm concerned. If it      hadn't been for him, both Jim and I probably would not have      gotten into making wine.'' I remember in the late 1970s when      he called me saying that since Kiona was the only one      interested in the Lemberger variety we would be first to get      the plants released by WSU,'' Williams said.       Bob Woehler, longtime Tri-City Herald and Wine Press      Northwest wine writer, whose association with Clore traces      back to the 1970s, said, ``His homespun dignity and overall      nice-guy friendliness was as impressive as the knowledge he      gave to the Washington wine industry.       ``Interestingly, Dr. Clore's association with wine led to      developing a taste for it himself despite his upbringing. He      often liked to relate at gatherings that he got his mother      eventually to try a sip or two,'' Woehler said.       James Zuiches, dean of WSU's College of Agriculture and      Home Economics, said in a press release, ``From my point of      view, Walter Clore was a true pioneer in agricultural      research. He took leadership without anyone telling him to,      to evaluate wine grape varieties for Washington's      environment. He laid the basis for a multimillion dollar      industry. He was a role model for faculty and many people      have benefitted from his research and extension work. He      never lost his love for the industry. He didn't teach      formally in a classroom, but he taught thousands of people      through his publications, extension programs and training of      students in field work.''       Clore's death came as plans were being made to build a $6      million Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser.       In 1993, the WSU Foundation established the Walter J. Clore      Scholarship Endowment to provide scholarships to full-time      undergraduate students at WSU who are interested in studying      grape production, processing or marketing.       Shaw and Sons Funeral Directors, Yakima, is in charge of      arrangements.       Anyone who wishes to make a memorial gift may contact      Patrick Kramer, WSU College of Agriculture and Home Economics      development director, who has a list of four charities the      family has suggested.
