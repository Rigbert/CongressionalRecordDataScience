Chairman, I also want to add that Mr. McCrery wanted to cosponsor H.R. 5252, but was unable to do so because the bill already had been reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. I certainly appreciate his interest in cosponsoring the bill nonetheless.                          ____________________
