 President, I rise to reintroduce private relief legislation for Robert Kuan Liang and his wife, Chun-Mei, ``Alice'', Hsu-Liang.  I first introduced a private bill for Robert and Alice in 2003. Since then this family has only further demonstrated their hard work ethic and commitment to realizing the American dream. I continue to believe that Robert and Alice merit Congress' special consideration and the extraordinary relief provided by private legislation.  Robert and Alice have been living in San Bruno, CA, for the last 27 years. Robert is a national and refugee from Laos, and Alice is originally from Taiwan. They have three children who are all United States citizens. I am concerned that forcing Robert and Alice to return to their home countries would tear this family apart and cause immense and unwarranted hardship to them and their children.  Robert and Alice have called California their home since they first entered the United States in 1983. They came here legally on tourist visas. They face deportation today because they remained in the United States past the terms of their visas, and because their attorney failed to handle their immigration case on a timely basis before federal immigration laws changed in 1996.  In many ways, the Liang family represents a uniquely American success story. Robert was born in Laos, but fled the country as a teenager after his mother was killed by Communists. He witnessed many traumatic experiences in his youth, including the attack that killed his mother and frequent episodes of wartime violence. He routinely witnessed the brutal persecution and deaths of others in his village in Laos. In 1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.  Robert and his wife risked everything to come to the United States. Despite the challenges of their past, they built a family in California and established a place for themselves in the local community. They are homeowners. They own a successful business, Fong Yong Restaurant. They file annual income taxes and are financially stable.  Robert and Alice support their three children, Wesley, Bruce, and Eva, who are all American citizens. Wesley is now 21 years old and studying at City College of San Francisco. The younger children, Bruce and Eva, attend schools in the San Bruno area and continue to do well in their classes.  There are many reasons to believe that deporting Robert and Alice would have a harmful impact on the children, who have all of their ties to the United States. Deportation would either break this family apart or force them to relocate to a country entirely foreign to the one they know to be home.  The Immigration Judge who presided over Robert and Alice's case in 1997also concluded that Robert and Alice's deportation would adversely impact the Liang children.  Moreover, Robert would face significant hurdles if deported, having fled Laos as a refugee more than 27 years ago. The emotional impact of the wartime violence Robert experienced at a young age was traumatic and continues to strain him. He battles severe clinical depression here in the United States. Robert fears that if he is deported and moves to his wife's home country, Taiwan, he will face discrimination on account of his nationality. Robert does not speak Taiwanese, and he worries about how he would pursue mental health treatment in a foreign country.  Robert and Alice have worked since 1993 to resolve their immigration status. They filed for relief from deportation; however, it took nearly five years for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, to act on the case. By the time their case went through in 1997, the immigration laws had changed and the Liangs were no longer eligible for relief. I supported these changes, set forth in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. But, I also believe there may be situations worthy of special consideration.  Robert and Alice Liang represent one such example. They are long-term residents of the United States. Their children are all U.S. citizens. The Immigration Judge that presided over the appeal of this case determined that Robert and Alice would have qualified for relief from deportation, in light of these positive factors, had the INS given their case timely consideration. Unfortunately, their immigration case took nearly five years to move forward.  A private bill is the only way for both Robert and Alice to remain in the United States together with their family. They have worked extraordinarily hard to make the United States their home. I believe Robert and Alice deserve the relief provided by a private bill.  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of the Liangs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 588       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law      or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Robert Liang and      Alice Liang shall be deemed to have been lawfully admitted      to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible      for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status      under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1255).       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall      apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant      visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed      with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the date      of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting      of immigrant visas to Robert Liang and Alice Liang, the      Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to      reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent fiscal year,      the total number of immigrant visas that are made available      to natives of the country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice      Liang under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality      Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if applicable, the total number      of immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the      country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice Liang under      section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).       (d) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the      purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of      2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest      statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''      for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional      Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,      provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the      vote on passage.                                 ______                                       By
