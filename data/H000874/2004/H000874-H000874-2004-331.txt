Leader, the last question I would ask you with respect to these tax bills, is it your expectation that the minority will be given the ability to offer a substitute on the bill coming up this week, the marriage penalty, but as well on the subsequent bills?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding further.  Of course, I obviously would defer for a final decision to the Committee on Rules, but I imagine, as is our long-standing tradition and custom of the House procedures, particularly in regard to tax measures, I would believe that they would prefer to limit the number of amendments, if any, to limit those amendments to germane substitutes.                              {time}  1630
