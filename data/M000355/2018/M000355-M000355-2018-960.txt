 Yesterday, the Senate voted to proceed to conference with the House on the first three of this year's appropriations bills. I understand the conferees are planning to meet as soon as today. The day before, we voted to go to conference on this year's Defense authorization bill. Soon, we will do the same with respect to the farm bill.  I am proud that we are continuing to deliver on our commitment to bring regular order back to the appropriations process, along with attending to the needs of our Armed Forces and confirming more of the President's nominees. Let's keep this momentum going. I hope the collaborative, bipartisan approach that Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and our subcommittee chairmen have brought to the appropriations process will continue to characterize our progress on the floor as well. With continued hard work and steady cooperation, we can achieve our shared goal of funding our government through the regular appropriations process.                          ____________________
