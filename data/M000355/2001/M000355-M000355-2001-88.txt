 President, the illegitimate regime in Rangoon has once again shown its true colors. On this bright, sunny morning in Washington, I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to gathering storm clouds in Southeast Asia.  According to Jane's Defence Weekly, Burma's State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, has signed a contract to purchase 10 MiG-29 fighter aircraft from the Russian Aircraft-building Corporation. These fighters were built in the early 1990s and are being stored at the Lukhovitsy machine-building plant. The total cost of the 10 MiGs to the SPDC is $130 million, 30 percent of which will be paid up front and the balance settled over the next decade.  This purchase is troubling for several reasons, and underscores that despite its name the SPDC is neither committed to peace nor the development of Burma. Thailand--and the United States--should be concerned with the acquisition of these aircraft, which boosts the junta's capabilities well beyond the 42 Chengdu F-7M and Nanchang A-5C currently sitting on Burmese runways. Tensions between the Thais and the junta have already spilled over into exchanges of gunfire and mortars; an escalation to an air war would be destabilizing to the entire region. China may be the only country to view the sale in a positive light, as it strengthens the military capability of one its staunchest allies in the region.  From drug dealing to the forced use of child soldiers, the Burmese military has distinguished itself as a world's leading violator of human rights and dignity. This purchase serves as evidence that the regime is committed to remaining in power at any and all costs. The international community must now double its efforts to ensure that even greater human rights abuses are not waged against the innocent people of Burma by the military, which is corrupt to the core.  The acquisition of MiG fighters adds 10 more reasons why the United States should view skeptically the discussions between Rangoon's thugs and thieves and Burma's legitimate leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The contract with Russia sends a signal that despite all the rhetoric and few prisoner releases, the talks may be hollow. What meaningful concessions can the generals make to Suu Kyi if they are arming themselves?  The $130 million contract--and where is that money coming from, Mr. President?--demonstrates yet again that the junta has not made the welfare of the people of Burma a priority. From an escalating HIV/AIDS crisis to forced labor practices, the junta has yet to demonstrate the political will to tackle the hardships the Burmese face every day.  Finally, the sale is an indication that the Russians are willing to sell military hardware to anyone, anywhere. We can add Burma to the growing list, which includes Iran and North Korea, of Russian client countries.                          ____________________
