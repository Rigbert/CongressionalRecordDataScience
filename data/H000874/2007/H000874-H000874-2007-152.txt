There will be nothing, I think, in the bill that was not in the House or Senate bills so, to that extent, it will be like a conference.  We haven't gone to conference. We are having great difficulty, I'll tell my friend, in getting the minority party in the Senate to vote to go to conference. I regret that, but that's the fact of life; and we can either stop doing business until they agree to do so, or we can try to move forward and try to reach some agreement.  I will tell my friend that there were Republican Senators involved in the discussions, as he may know, and he is correct that there will probably be a new bill on the floor, but I tell my friend that that bill will incorporate items that were either in the Senate or House bill and will be items that we believe and hope, as I said, are now agreed between what we hope to be a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate. To that extent, it will be like a conference report because the expectation is it would not be amended in the Senate because, of course, we're facing the September 30 deadline.  I thank my friend for yielding.
