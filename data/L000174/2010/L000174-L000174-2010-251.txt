President, I am honored once again to submit this resolution to the Senate commemorating our Nation's law enforcement officers and National Peace Officers Memorial Day. The Senate's official recognition of National Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week is a tradition I amproud to carry out each year, and I look forward to the Senate taking up and passing this resolution.  In 2009, 116 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line of duty. We honor their memory. Though this is a decrease from 2008, it is no less tragic a loss to our Federal and State law enforcement community and to their families and friends. Each year we commemorate the bravery of so many in law enforcement, and our Nation's peace officers deserve our commitment to provide them with the tools they need to stay safe and to do their jobs as effectively as they can.  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women work tirelessly to protect our communities, our schools, and our children. They investigate and apprehend the most violent criminals and strive to keep our communities safe and secure. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, the names of 18,983 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice have been added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.  I also take this opportunity to recognize that the names of 324 fallen officers will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on May 13 during a candlelight vigil held in their honor. These are officers from the past and present whose memory will be preserved for all time at the memorial, ensuring that their bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten. I especially want to recognize two brave Vermonters who gave their lives in the line of duty, and whose names will be added to the Memorial this year: John Henry Collette of the Addison County Sheriff's Office, died July 17, 1932, and Robert Daniel Rossier of the Vermont Highway Patrol, died September 9, 1935.  National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides the people of the United States, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in the Nation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by those members of our police forces. More than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington in the days leading up to May 15, to join with the families of their fallen comrades. It is right that the Senate show its respect on this occasion, and I am proud to honor their service and their memory. I urge all Senators to join me in approving this resolution.                          ____________________
