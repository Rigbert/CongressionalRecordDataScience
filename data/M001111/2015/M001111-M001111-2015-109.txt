 President, this amendment would retreat on our fundamental commitment to make sure that every child has access to a quality education, and it would do it by consolidating almost every K-12 education program we have and turning that funding into a public or private school voucher. It would cut programs for STEM, for literacy, for afterschool--priorities that are important to Members across the aisle, and it would dismantle the important bipartisan work we have done to fix this badly broken No Child Left Behind law in a way that works for parents, teachers, and students. It ignores the research on the impact of concentrated poverty on student achievement and allows States to move Federal resources from our highest needs schools and districts to more affluent ones and to unaccountable private schools.  I know my colleague from Tennessee understands this is a nonstarter for me, and I really urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
