President, if I might just take a moment of time here to thank the Senator from West Virginia. His kind words are high praise indeed.  This Washington, DC, has many museums which contain many national treasures, but the Senate has its own treasure in the Senator from West Virginia, and his dedication to this institution is just unparalleled. The fact that he would praise us for staying after 9 o'clock to do our job of course is belied by the fact that he is still here, prepared to say a few words as well, doing his job, as he always does, for the people of West Virginia.  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, as well as my colleague from Texas, for their kindnesses during consideration of this bill.
