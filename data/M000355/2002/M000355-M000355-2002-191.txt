 LOTT. I am glad to yield, Mr. President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me concur with what the leader said. As a Senator who has fought for many years to defeat that bill, I believe it is clear that position is not going to prevail.  We had good negotiations over a technicals correction to the bill. The consent request to which the Republican leader has asked that we agree gives Senator McCain and myself, who have been on opposite sides of this issue, a chance to review a subsequent technicals bill that passes the House. Either one of us would have the right to veto it. We are very close to an agreement.  I agree with the Republican leader that there is certainly no necessity to have any all-night sessions or any of these other scenarios we hear have been suggested to the press, since the opponents of this bill are ready to move on with it. That is what this consent agreement makes clear.  I commend the Republican leader for offering it.
