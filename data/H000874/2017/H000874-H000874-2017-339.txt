Speaker, I rise to offer my thanks to Kevin Chambers for over thirty-five years of dedicated service to the United States House of Representatives. Kevin will be retiring this Friday, September 29. He is a constituent in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, living in Calvert County, and I am proud to represent him and his family in Congress.  Kevin has been the very definition of exceptional customer service that all Chief Administrative Office (CAO) employees strive to provide to the House community. His thorough leadership and oversight in assisting Members with setting up their offices and with relocations during numerous Congressional transitions has provided a template for success for many years to come. Kevin's extensive knowledge of House furniture and its history and his mastery of building and sustaining relationships with Members and staff has resulted in cohesiveness and joint partnerships throughout the House campus. He has also maintained strong relationships over the years with colleagues from the CAO and Architect of the Capitol offices. For all who have had the pleasure of working with him, Kevin has been an invaluable asset and will be greatly missed.  Kevin began his career with the House CAO on December 12, 1980 as a Laborer. In March 1987 he advanced to Assistant Warehouse Manager and became Warehouse Manager in 1990. In that capacity, he served as a point of contact between CAO staff and Members of Congress regarding service orders for office furnishings. In 2001, the CAO called upon Kevin to offer his expertise to the newly developed First Call customer service center as a Senior Customer Solutions Consultant. There, he provided guidance, advice, and assistance to House offices regarding the selection and purchase of office furniture, equipment, and supplies. Later, Kevin became a Senior Team Lead with the Modular-Transition office. In 2016, Kevin moved to the Manager role and led the team on House-wide projects, including the Cannon House Office Building Renewal Relocations effort. Over many years, Kevin has provided guidance to management as a subject-matter expert on House operations, and he has been an integral part of the CAO.  Among his many accomplishments over the years, Kevin supervised the CAO's Transition Office staff over the past eight Congressional transitions. He was always the first to arrive and last to leave. He provided the transitional move coordinators with the knowledge and support necessary to assist incoming freshman Members and participating returning Members effectively and efficiently. Not only has Kevin been thoroughly involved with Congressional Transitions, his extensive CAO and House knowledge put him in a position to become the Clerk's Office's main point of contact for all Congressional special elections.  Furthermore, Kevin has dedicated his career to making the CAO and the House of Representatives a better place to work and a place that runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible. He has passed along his many years of project management and customer service experience to staff and coworkers so they can continue the extremely high standards of quality service expected by the CAO. On behalf of the entire House, I extend congratulations to Kevin for his many years of dedication and outstanding contributions. I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing him and his wife Cynthia many happy years together in retirement.                          ____________________
