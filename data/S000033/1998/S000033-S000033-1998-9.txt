 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, home health care agencies that do a terrific job in serving some of the most vulnerable and frail people in the State of Vermont have lost substantial funding because of an absurd formula that was put in place last year.  This bill begins to address the inequities of that unfair formula and would increase funding for home care, home health care agencies in Vermont and throughout this country that are cost effective and efficient.  Unfortunately, the funding approach for improving this formula is not adequate; and my hope is that, in conference committee, it can be changed. But, most importantly, this is a step forward to addressing a real crisis in home health care funding that exists in Vermont and other States where agencies have been cost effective and efficient. I urge support for this legislation.
