Throughout his years of service at Temple Israel, Rabbi Halpern has been one of northwest Indiana's most dedicated and distinguished citizens. The people of northwest Indiana have certainly been rewarded by the service and uncompromising loyalty he has displayed to the parish and the entire community, and for his outstanding efforts, he was recognized at a dinner in his honor at Sand Creek Country Club in Chesterton, IN, on September 6, 2008. As part of the celebration, a very special Shabbat service also took place the previous night.  Stanley Halpern was born and raised in Spokane, WA, where he received an intensive Jewish education at Keneseth Israel Synagogue. Following his graduation from Lewis & Clark High School, he went on to receive his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of Washington, where his studies were focused on Philosophy and Near Eastern Languages and Literature. He also served as Scholar in Residence at Dropsie College in Philadelphia, PA. Following his ordination, Rabbi Halpern spent the next ten years focusing on fundraising and Jewish educational work as the Executive Director of the Bureau of Jewish Education in Sacramento. Finally, in 1988, Rabbi Halpern settled into his first pulpit, Temple Israel in Gary, IN, where he has served since 1988.  Temple Israel's long tradition of dedication to social justice and active involvement in the life of northwest Indiana was a perfect fit for Rabbi Halpern's commitment to Tikkun Olan, the obligation in Judaism of each individual to do all they can for the healing of the world.  Under Rabbi Halpern's leadership, the people of Temple Israel have involved themselves in a myriad of social and community projects, including: the Open Housing Center of Northwest Indiana, the Interfaith Clergy Council of Gary, and Muslim/Jewish Dialogue--Breaking Down Barriers by Breaking Bread Together. Temple Israel has also played a major role in assisting local veterans by teaching skills to prepare them for re-entry into the workforce. Through Rabbi Halpern's involvement with Hospice, the Bio-Ethics Committee of Community Hospital, and AIDS awareness, they have also been very active in Northwest Indiana's health care community, and they have been outstanding advocates in the fight against domestic abuse through their efforts with the Domestic Relations Counseling Bureau of Lake County. With a focus on doing what is right, Rabbi Halpern and Temple Israel have remained active in these causes, all while continuing to prosper in the building of a vibrant Jewish community in northwest Indiana.  Rabbi Halpern and his wife, Carol, reside in Portage, IN. They are the proud parents of one daughter, who also resides in Portage, and Carol's son, who resides in the Boston, MA, area.  Madam Speaker, northwest Indiana is a better place because of the tireless service of people like Rabbi Halpern. He is a man who has dedicated himself to serving others. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Rabbi Halpern for his many years of enduring service and the unforgettable effect he has had on the people of Temple Israel, as well as the entire northwest Indiana community, and I ask that you join me in congratulating him on this impressive milestone.                          ____________________
