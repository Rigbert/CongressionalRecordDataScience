Chair, I want to thank my colleague from California, Representative Huffman for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Wolf and Ranking Member Fattah for working with us on this important amendment.  West Coast fishermen are in a tough spot, and in a very unique spot. Unlike other regions of the country where fishermen had their buyouts funded by taxpayers, our fishermen took on the loan willingly and knowing they would have to pay it back. And they are paying it back--but at an interest rate that is two points above prime and therefore costing them 5 percent of their landings.  Representative Huffman, Representative Herrera Beutler, and I are working to legislatively refinance this loan. In fact, today, that refinance bill passed out of the House Committee on Natural Resources and it has already passed the Senate Committee. But it's going to take some time to implement.  West Coast fishermen are facing increased observer costs. We are transitioning to electronic monitoring, but that's going to take time--too much time in my opinion. But until electronic monitoring is adopted by the Council and NOAA, fishermen will have to pay for 100 percent observer coverage--which can be as high as $350-$450 per day.  And now, fishermen are bearing an additional cost--$2.4 million this year to help pay for the management of the fishery--known as the ``cost recovery fee.'' West Coast fishermen are willing to pay this fee. They knew the fee was coming. But, right now, with the mounting costs of the buyback loan, the observer costs, and pending trailing amendments that will make the fishery more economically viable--this additional financial burden is too much.  This amendment would provide one year of relief to West Coast fishermen. It would mean the difference for many fishermen of selling their boats and trying to find a different livelihood in already distressed coastal communities, or staying in business.  This amendment is bipartisan. It does not score. And it might not seem like a lot of money to people in this body, but it's a huge deal for my fishermen, their families, and small businesses that depend on the fleet to make a living. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.                          ____________________
