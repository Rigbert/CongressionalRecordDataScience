I am sad for the Haitian people. Once again, their leaders and the international community have failed them, and the poorest and the most vulnerable are enduring the greatest suffering.  I am also deeply disappointed with the Bush administration. Over the past several years, this administration ignored the simmering problems in Haiti and hoped they would somehow resolve themselves. That approach obviously backfired. Things have spiraled out of control. We now have a full-blown crisis on our hands, accusations that the administration helped to engineer acoup of President Aristide, and the deployment of thousands of U.S. Marines into a difficult situation. Bringing change to Haiti will now be a far more dangerous and costly undertaking. Moreover, the U.N. or some other impartial organization will have to conduct an investigation to answer nagging questions about Aristide's departure.   I recognize that many administration officials did not support President Aristide. I can understand that view, as I also lost confidence in him. There is no question that serious allegations of corruption and abuse surround President Aristide and his associates and that these issues should have been dealt with. President Aristide and other Haitian leaders should be held accountable for their actions. Having said that, we should not forget the courage that President Aristide displayed when he first spoke out against the excesses of the brutal and corrupt dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier.  But this administration did not want to make the effort to help clean up the Haitian Government, build a reform-minded opposition, and restructure the economy.  Instead, the Bush administration simply disengaged. During his first year in office, President Bush reduced aid to Haiti by about 25 percent. Concerned with the growing problems in Haiti, Senator Dodd and I sent a letter to USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios in February 2002, urging an overhaul of our foreign aid program to Haiti. The response to our letter was essentially: ``Thanks for writing. We have a limited budget, but we will remain `flexible' in our approach.'' The results of this flexible approach speak for themselves.  To be fair, USAID was under heady pressure to absorb activities that the State Department should have funded. USAID does not deserve the blame for an administration-wide policy failure.  During the last month, United States policy toward Haiti crystallized around the goal of getting rid of President Aristide. For all the administration's tough talk aimed at President Aristide, this White House has embraced corrupt leaders with far less democratic credentials than President Aristide when it has suited its purpose. This episode is yet another reminder of how the contradictory policies and rhetoric of this administration are damaging U.S. credibility around the world.  In some respects, President Aristide's departure begins a new chapter for Haiti. In other ways, it is not clear just how new it is. For the third time in 20 years, a Haitian leader has been forced into exile, and at least for the third time in 90 years, the U.S. military has intervened in Haiti.  What is to show for years of interventions and hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. assistance? Haiti remains one of the poorest and most corrupt countries on Earth, facing a myriad of complex problems. Removing President Aristide will not solve these entrenched problems, but it may provide a way forward.  The United States has compelling reasons to help. Haiti is just a few hundred miles away from our shores, and the social turmoil there could easily spread to the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, and elsewhere in our neighborhood. The United States has a long relationship with Haiti and many Haitian Americans live in the United States. Perhaps most importantly, we have a moral responsibility to help a nation where so many have been suffering for so long.  The United States, France, and others must work with the United Nations, the Organization of American States to help fill the power vacuum in Port-au-Prince. The international community must also come up with a substantial aid package to help the Haitian people get back on their feet.  This will be a long, slow process. If we are to succeed in meeting the challenge of recovery and rebuilding in Haiti, the United States and the international community must stay engaged. Most of all, the Haitians themselves must take responsibility, especially the religious and political leaders. But we must take care not to overlook a key group that must be involved in this process--middle-class Haitians who have left the country over the past few decades.  As Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor in chief of the Haitian Times, points out in Monday's Wall Street Journal, involving Haiti's middle class is essential. He writes:       The international community has to bring the country's      middle class not merely to the table, but back to Haiti. This      middle class has been fleeing Haiti for the U.S., where it      has consolidated itself, for the last 30 years. We should      look to that group, the Haitian diaspora, educated at the      best schools in the U.S. and Canada, to help lead the country      out of its perpetual cycle of violence and misery.  I agree with Mr. Pierre-Pierre, and believe that the administration should heed his advice.  We have missed one opportunity after another in Haiti. It is time for us to make the most of this unfortunate situation.  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letters in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2002.     Hon. Andrew Natsios,     Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Natsios: We are deeply concerned with the      deteriorating humanitarian situation in Haiti. The political      impasse between the Haitian Government and the political      opposition has only made a serious situation more dire. As a      matter of U.S. policy Haiti is being denied access to monies      from the multilateral development banks until the government      and opposition resolve their differences. For that reason,      the humanitarian needs of Haiti must be met solely from      bilateral donations through non-governmental organizations      such as CARE, Catholic Relief Services and World Vision.       Violence, poverty, and disease are rampant throughout      Haiti. Since the United States is opposing access for Haiti      to multilateral monies to address these problems, we believe      the U.S. has a moral obligation to ensure, to the maximum      extent feasible, that U.S. bilateral humanitarian assistance      allocations be maintained at adequate levels. However, that      does not appear to be the case. As you know annual USAID/     Haiti allocations have been cut in half since FY1999 to $50      million for the current fiscal year. Moreover, the      Administration's FY 2003 request is only $45 million. At      these levels we are very skeptical that USAID will be able to      continue many critical programs, including school feeding      programs, public health programs for Haitian children ages 0      to 5, and AIDS treatment and prevention programs.       We strongly urge you to review the overall FY 2003 USAID      budget to determine whether additional funds can be found for      USAID FY 2003 programs in Haiti. Moreover, we do not support      efforts to obligate FY 2002 Haiti monies for purposes other      than humanitarian assistance programs.       Thank you for your attention to our concerns. We look      forward to working with you in addressing the humanitarian      needs of Haiti's seven million people.           Sincerely yours,     Patrick J. Leahy,     Christopher J. Dodd,       U.S. Senators.                                  ____                                                   U.S. Agency for                                    International Development,                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Mr. Natsios has asked me to respond to      your letter of February 15, 2002, concerning the current      situation in Haiti and declining U.S. assistance levels. We      regret the delay in responding.       We share your concern about deteriorating conditions in      Haiti, and are doing our best to help ease the situation      within the constraints of current budget realities. Since      September 11, 2001, worldwide pressures on overall resources      limit our ability to maintain prior year levels for Haiti. We      have made up most of the difference using Development      Assistance and the Child Survival and Health Programs fund;      however, these accounts are heavily subscribed.       Our programs will continue to have a meaningful impact in      Haiti through the provision of primarily humanitarian      assistance. Approximately 80 percent of the FY 2002 budget      and FY 2003 request will go toward health, food aid, and      education activities. These programs will still provide      health and family planning services to approximately 2.7      million Haitians--mostly women and children--including HIV/     AIDS prevention. They will also target food resources in      Haiti to children under five and pregnant/lactating women,      and will continue to make marked improvements in math and      reading achievement test scores for 150,000 Haitian children.       In closing, we are watching the situation very closely and      remain flexible on funding options for FY 2002. We welcome a      continuing dialogue with Congress on appropriate assistance      levels for Haiti as events unfold.       Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Please      let us know when this office can be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                J. Edward Fox,                                          Assistant Administrator,                        Bureau for Legislative and Public Affairs.                          ____________________
