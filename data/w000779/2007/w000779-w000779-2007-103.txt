President, today Senator Bennett and I are reintroducing legislation to provide a significant financial incentive for automakers to produce, and for their customers to buy, more fuel efficient cars and light trucks in the form of consumer tax credits. Reducing our Nation's dependence on oil should not be a partisan issue and Senator Bennett and I have worked together to come up with a plan that will encourage consumers to buy more energy efficient vehicles even if those vehicles employ technologies, such as electric hybrid drive trains or clean diesels, that cost more to produce.  Under our bipartisan, market-oriented bill, consumers who buy vehicles that are at least 25 percent more fuel efficient than the current corporate fuel economy standards, called CAFE, would get a rebate of at least $630 and as much as $1,860 for the most fuel-efficient cars. We have separate standards for cars and trucks so consumers can choose the type of vehicle they want and still get the credit as long as they choose a fuel-efficient model. Similarly, our bill is technology neutral. We don't provide a credit based on the kind of engine or drive train that a car or truck has. We provide a credit based on the level of fuel economy the vehicle achieves. So, manufacturers are free to pursue whichever efficiency technology they want and consumers have a greater choice of vehicles to purchase.  In the past, the automobile industry has said that increasing fuel economy standards is hard to achieve because car buyers place little value on fuel economy, especially if that fuel efficiency comes with added cost.
