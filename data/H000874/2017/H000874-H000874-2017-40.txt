Speaker, I want to say to my friend, the majority leader, with all due respect we raise a lot of heat in this town. Unfortunately, on the cusp of a meeting that was convened to try to reach some agreements on very important issues to the American people, the heat was raised very, very substantially by the President of the United States. That was unfortunate.  Anybody who thinks that the heat wasn't raised and was saying that there was not going to be a deal I think is incorrect.  But that is not why I asked for the 1 minute. Why I asked for the 1 minute is, Mr. Speaker, the American people are relying on us to come together and agree on things they know are very important to them: their families, their community, and their country.  Let us not accuse one another back and forth of bad faith, and let's lower the heat and let's try to get that work done.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
