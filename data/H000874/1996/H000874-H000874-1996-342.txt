Speaker, on April 30, 1996, the Congressional Fire Services Caucus will pay tribute to the champions of public safety at the Eighth Annual National Fire and Emergency Services Dinner. Over 3 million citizens throughout our great Nation dedicate their lives to preserving our communities against the threat of fire and other types of disasters. They include firefighters, EMS providers, search and rescue teams, arson investigators, and instructors. The list goes on for somewhere, in each of our communities, we can name an acquaintance of ours who is prepared to respond when the alarm sounds.  Our understanding in Congress of the many challenges facing first responders has been enhanced throughout the years primarily because of one individual. Curt Weldon, our firefighting Congressman, is unique to Washington politics. Very few individuals who have served in this institution have been able to unite members from both sides of the aisle behind one cause.  Today, the Congressional Fire Services Caucus is the largest caucus in Congress. With an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, the Fire Caucus is a tribute to the relentless efforts of Curt Weldon to achieve greater recognition for first responders on Capitol Hill. Throughout the 8-year history of the Caucus, our dear colleague has traveled to the scenes of our country's worst disasters in recent memory. He was in New York City to witness the horrible aftermath of the World Trade Center bombing, in Dade County, FL, following Hurricane Andrew, and southern California after the Northridge earthquake. And each time he would return from these incidents, Curt would share his findings with fellow members to help us better understand the significance of these events and what Congress can learn from them.  On issues of great significance to the fire service and EMS, my colleagues and I often defer judgment so that we can follow Congressman Weldon's lead. When casting his vote on fire service issues, Curt is guided by his years of experience as a firefighter, where he rose through the ranks to become chief of the Marcus Hook Fire Department in Marcus Hook, PA. Each of the seven major fire service organizations, despite their differences on issues, can all come to an agreement when the issue is the benefits they have derived from one man's belief in their respective missions. That man being Curt Weldon.  When my fellow Fire Caucus cochairmen and I join the 2,000 national fire service leaders at the forthcoming dinner, we do so in thanks and appreciation to our dear friend, Curt Weldon. This past year, he has endured some setbacks, most recently the passing of his mother, Catherine Weldon. A volunteer for charitable causes throughout her lifetime, Mrs. Weldon leaves behind a legacy supporting the fire service, American Red Cross, and other local causes. Her attributes touched many, most importantly her nine children.  What amazes me most about Curt is despite these setbacks, he continues to perform as if he were still a fire chief for Marcus Hook. Whenever the alarm sounds on Capitol Hill, Curt takes expedient action, always working in cooperation with his colleagues, to resolve whatever the emergency might be.  A friend first, and colleague second Curt Weldon represents the best in public service.                          ____________________
