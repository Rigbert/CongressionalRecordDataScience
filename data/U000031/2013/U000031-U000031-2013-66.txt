Speaker, at this point, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Washington, Mrs. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a leading advocate of this legislation and the chairman of the Republican Conference.  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act.  Every 3 minutes, somewhere in the world, a child is diagnosed with cancer. In the United States, approximately 150,000 children have diabetes. I believe that medical research is the best investment we can make to change these statistics and find new cures for these diseases.  In working with my colleague from California, Representative Lois Capps, we introduced the Pediatric Research Network Act, which is included in the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act.  In supporting this legislation, the Coalition for Pediatric Medical Research, which includes Children's Hospital in Seattle--in my home State--said that this legislation is critical to strengthening our Nation's pediatric research enterprise. In addition, the Pediatric Research Network Act will authorize the establishment of a well-proven and evidence-based approach for addressing pediatric research. It will enable the National Institutes of Health to support multi-institution research in order to coordinate and streamline this important research. Most importantly, it will help to speed cures to the youngest patients. I urge its support.  Thank you, everyone, for your leadership.
