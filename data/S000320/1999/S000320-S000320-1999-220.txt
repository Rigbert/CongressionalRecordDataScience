 President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator from New York for offering these amendments. They make sense to me. We have reviewed them. I think Senator Kerrey has reviewed them.  I also commend the senior Senator from New York for his past work, not only in the Senate but specifically on the Intelligence Committee, where he spent a lot of time--a lot of hours, and a lot of years--and understands what we are going through--and what we need to do. Hopefully, this is one of those little steps.
