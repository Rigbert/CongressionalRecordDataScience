President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Thomas W. Thrash, Jr., to be a United States District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia. Mr. Thrash is a well-qualified nominee.  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on May 22, 1997. The Northern District of Georgia Sixth Circuit desperately needs Thomas Thrash to help manage its growing backlog of cases.  We first received Thomas Thrash's nomination in May 1996. He was accorded a hearing last Congress on July 31, 1996, but his nomination fell victim to the Presidential election year confirmation shutdown of 1996. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, which vacancy has existed since March 1996. He had a confirmation hearing on May 7 where he was supported by both Senator Cleland and Senator Coverdell and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks later. This is another of the nominations that has languished on the Senate Executive Calendar since long before the July 4 recess. I am glad that the Republican leadership has allowed this nomination to go forward. I congratulate Mr. Thrash and his family on his confirmation.
