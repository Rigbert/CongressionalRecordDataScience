 President, I rise today in honor of a young man from Kentucky who was lost in the performance of his duty. CPL Christopher Tyler Warndorf, of Burlington, KY, was tragically killed on August 29, 2006, in Iraq's Al Anbar Province, after an explosion set by terrorists went off.  A U.S. marine, he was 23 years old. Corporal Warndorf's mother Tina explains the circumstances of her son's death and how he died a hero.
