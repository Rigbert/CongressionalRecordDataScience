On September 18, 2019, Kodi Lee from Lake Elsinore, California was named as the winner of the NBC talent show competition ``America's Got Talent.''  Kodi's voice is amazing. His life story is even more extraordinary. Kodi was born legally blind and diagnosed with autism when he was four years old. Yet, when he was just two years old, Kodi's musical talents began to shine after his father tapped out ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' on a toy piano and he immediately played it back. At the age of three, Kodi was already replicating tunes he heard on a real piano. Throughout his childhood, music became an essential form of therapy for Kodi and provided a unique form of treatment for his autism. It was determined that Kodi has an audio photographic memory, in which he can recall music he hears after just one listen. Incredibly, Kodi started to perform publicly at the age of six and has sung and played the piano at over 200 charity events and in Korea, China and Japan.  As a contestant in the America's Got Talent competition, Kodi drew instant attention in May by singing the Donny Hathaway version of ``A Song For You.'' Later in the competition, Kodi earned a spot in the semi-finals with a memorable rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over Troubled Water.'' During the competition's finale, Kodi earned the top prize thanks to an inspired performance of Freya Riding's ``Lost Without You,'' that drew a standing ovation from both the fans and judges.  It's hard to think of anyone who has represented our region as well as Kodi Lee has on an worldwide stage. To say Lake Elsinore and Riverside County is proud of Kodi and all that he has accomplished is a tremendous understatement. To conclude, Madam Speaker I want to thank Kodi for inspiring us and congratulate him on winning the America's Got Talent competition.                          ____________________
