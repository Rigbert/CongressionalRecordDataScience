Speaker, the first thing I want to say is to my good friend, John Boehner, congratulations on his election as majority leader. It is a great honor to be selected by your colleagues in the House, of course, but of your own party to be one of its leaders.  John Boehner has, of course, been a leader in his party for many years now, chairman of a major committee, sponsor of one of the hallmark pieces of legislation the Bush administration points to as a great success. He worked in a bipartisan fashion on that bill.  I look forward to working with him. I know our side of the aisle looks forward to working with him. I want to congratulate him on his election.  Mr. Leader, let me ask you about a couple of things, and I will mention the PATRIOT Act. I know you are not sure what that status is. There are a couple of pieces of legislation, three pieces of legislation, that we do anticipate in the relatively near future. I wonder if you might comment on them.  I know we are not meeting next week and will not be back until the 28th of February. The tax reconciliation conference report, I talked to Mr. Rangel about that this morning. His understanding is the conference is ongoing. Might you have any idea of when the tax reconciliation conference report, assuming it is approved, might come to the floor?  I yield to my friend.
