President, I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa wishes to speak on this amendment, and we will soon have a rollcall vote. I ask the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Iowa if we could withhold for 2 minutes in order for the Senator from Wisconsin to speak on an amendment of his, and then we will go back to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.
