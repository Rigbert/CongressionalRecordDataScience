 President, I rise today to note the loss of an honored and distinguished Kentuckian. Mr. Tracy T. Arflin of Radcliff, KY, passed away this June 18. He was 74 years old.  Mr. Arflin went by ``Tom,'' but was also known to generations of Radcliff-area youth as ``Coach.'' Tom Arflin dedicated the last 32 years of his life to volunteering on behalf of youth sports in his hometown. He was the manager of the Rangers in the Radcliff Baseball/Softball Association, and coached two teams, the Eagles and the Jaguars, in the North Hardin Youth Football League. He had both a football and a baseball field named after him, and was the North Hardin Youth Football League president for the past 21 years.  Mr. Arflin's job as coach included the roles of mentor, leader, and league developer. He not only inspired many kids who may not have thought they were cut out for sports to stick with it, he also encouraged many parents to volunteer their time as coaches. Some of them are still at it even after their children have grown out of youth league play because of Tom Arflin's example.  Tom Arflin was also a U.S. Army veteran who proudly served for 27 years, including two tours in Vietnam. For the past 42 years he was a member of Mill Creek Baptist Church in Radcliff.  This May Tom was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent radiation treatments. A few weeks before his passing, Tom's son Tracy T. Arflin II organized a grand community celebration for his father, and more than 100 family members, friends, and former and current coaches and players gathered to honor Tom Arflin for his many decades of service.  Tom was preceded in death by his wife of 49 years, Louise C. Arflin, and by his sister, Anna. Surviving members of his family who are mourning Tom's loss include his son and daughter-in-law, Tracy T. Arflin II and Sharon; his grandson, Matthew T. Arflin; his sister, Lucy Webb; and his brother, Billy Arflin. I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Tracy T. ``Tom'' Arflin for the loss of this wonderful man.  Mr. President, the Hardin County News-Enterprise recently published an article about Tom Arflin and the community celebration thrown in his honor. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed, as follows:                [From the News-Enterprise, June 5, 2011]          Youth Sports: Arflin Receives Community Celebration                            (By John Groth)       Tracy Arflin wanted to give his father, Tom, one more major      recognition.       His dad has spent decades building up the North Hardin      Youth Football League. And now as his father's coaching      career winds down, he wanted to hold a special community      celebration.       ``We're celebrating a lifetime of him serving several      generations of children, not just serving a community, which      could be argued, but serving several generations of      children,'' Tracy Arflin said. ``I like to think of my father      like that.''       That's why around 100 family members, friends, current and      former NHYFL coaches, players and officials gathered Sunday      at Mill Creek Baptist Church in Radcliff to honor Tom Arflin      for more than three decades of service.       In May, Tom Arflin was diagnosed with brain cancer and has      undergone radiation treatments.       They made sure the Jaguars coach felt right at home--with      Jaguars items and colors everywhere. Each table was covered      in a teal tablecloth with a Jaguar youth helmet, with a white      pom-pom attached to each facemask, smack dab in the middle.       Tom Arflin has spent 32 years helping develop the NHYFL.      He's coached in the league since 1980 and served as its      president since 1991. Arflin's grandson, Matt, remembers      playing football for him years ago, and the 26-year-old      remains amazed at how much the league has grown with his      grandfather at the helm.       ``It's kind of like the Madden video game where you create      your own league. He kind of did that,'' Matt Arflin said.       Two weeks ago, Tracy stopped by to talk to Tom after a      NHYFL meeting. That's when he told his father about the      reception.       ``I had tears in my eyes. That surprised me,'' Tom Arflin      said. ``He announced it after the meeting. I thought he was      going to say something about the reason why he was there. It      came out different.''       The celebration ended up being special.       Radcliff Mayor J.J. Duvall grew up playing youth sports in      Radcliff. He knows how much of a fixture Tom Arflin, who      still is referred to as just ``Coach,'' has become in the      community. And he knows his dedication is unmatched.       ``We're here to honor Coach's attention to detail, sense of      humor, the smiles he brings to others, and the overall caring      he has for kids and our youth,'' Duvall said. ``He set the      bar very high.''       Trying to come up with a gift to honor him with was just as      tough.       Tom Arflin already has two fields--the NHYFL and Radcliff      Senior League Field--named in his honor. He has football      memorabilia galore. So Duvall picked out another unique      item--an engraved Louisville Slugger baseball bat. Tom Arflin      actually began working with Radcliff youth in 1979 when he      took over the Rangers' team in the Radcliff Major League.       ``The Louisville Slugger is an icon, and you're an icon of      the community,'' Duvall said.       Arflin influenced coaches as much as he did the players.       Just ask Vine Grove resident Travis McNair.       McNair has been with the NHYFL since 2008. He originally      only intended to have his son, Tavius, sign up to play. But      Tom Arflin convinced him to coach.       ``He said we always need coaches. Now I am and I'm addicted      to it,'' McNair said. ``He said, `We need coaches and people      out to help.' ''       McNair has coached his son on the Rams each of the past      three years. This year, Tavius will enter high school at      North Hardin. But McNair will still lead the Rams because      he's having so much fun.       So is Isaac Bankhead.       The Radcliff resident will coach his third team--the newly      formed Chiefs--in nine seasons. He coached the Vikings for      the first two years and the Titans, too.       Bankhead's children, 12-year-old Isaiah and 10-year-old      Jeremiah, have each played for the past seven years. And Tom      Arflin helped him get into coaching.       ``He's good-hearted, tries to make sure every kid in the      league has an opportunity to play. He tells us how to deal      with parents and what to do to help the league run better,''      Bankhead said. ``He's been an inspiration. He's been a good      guy. You can't help but to like him.''       Former players agreed.       One of those players Tom Arflin influenced is Jeremy Brown.       The 17-year-old North Hardin senior wide receiver shared      his unique experience on how Arflin helped him develop foot      coordination.       ``I didn't want to do football. My parents kind of forced      me into it. I remember the first day of practice and they got      out the tires for a tire drill. I stepped up, and I was like,      `I really didn't want to do it,' and I went through and hit      every single tire. As I went and got done, Coach was like,      `Dadgumit, Jeremy! Dadgumit!' It went on like that for about      a week,'' Brown said. ``That was in the back of my mind. I      did it perfect a week later. Since then, any type of drill I      have that involves my feet, I don't mess up.''                          ____________________
