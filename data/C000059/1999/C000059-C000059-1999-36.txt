Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I certainly support the intent of this amendment. It is a good amendment. There is some language that I would like to work with the gentleman from Illinois prior to going to conference. There are some concerns regarding fines and how it affects the taxpayers of California because the University of California and other public institutions.  I would like the assurance of the gentleman that we will work together to come to some agreeable language that will work for everyone concerned.
