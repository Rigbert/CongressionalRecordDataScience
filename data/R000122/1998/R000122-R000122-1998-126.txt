President, I rise to commemorate the 177th Anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that won Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire. I was proud to join with fifty-one of my colleagues in sponsoring Senate Resolution 171 which designates today ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''  The strong ties between the United States and Greece extend back to the birth of this nation. Indeed, the Founding Fathers looked to the principles formulated by the Greek philosophers when composing the governing documents of the United States. As Thomas Jefferson stated, ``to the ancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' America owes much to the Greeks for all they have given us, then and now.  The Greeks have been members of my state's communities for over one hundred years. Over 6,000 residents of Rhode Island claimed Greek heritage in the last Census. When they first came to the state they worked in the factories and on the shores. Today, the descendants of these first immigrants continue to prosper and enrich the state and rest of the country through their contributions to banking, medicine, the tourism industry and the arts.  Although today we commemorate the Greek victory over 400 years of domination by the Ottoman Empire, we must also remember that Greece is still not able to celebrate complete peace and freedom. Almost twenty-four years ago, Turkey invaded Cyprus and today 35,000 troops continue to occupy over 40% of the island and inflict human rights abuses on the 660,000 Cypriots. Recently, I was proud to sign on as a cosponsor of a concurrent resolution which calls for the U.S. to encourage the end of restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus. We must continue to work to resolve the Cyprus problem and reduce the tensions that exist between Greece and Turkey.  But, for today, let us celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence, the richness of the Greek heritage and the legacy of democracy that country gave to the world.                          ____________________
