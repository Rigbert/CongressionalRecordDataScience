 President, this is a noncontroversial amendment which, according to the CBO, has zero costs. It is supported by the National Wildlife Federation, the American Forest Foundation, the Biomass Thermal Energy Council, and the Trust for Public Land.  This amendment would simply allow, under the Community Wood Energy Program, a new category of small grants to be created which would provide seed capital for biomass cooperatives through grants of up to $50,000. These cooperatives would have the opportunity to work with local wood pellet or wood chip manufacturers to supply bulk purchases that provide consumers with modest discounts.  This amendment can help our Nation move forward to more locally produced renewable biomass heating. Again, according to the CBO, it has zero costs, and I would ask for the support of my colleagues.
