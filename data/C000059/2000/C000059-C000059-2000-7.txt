Speaker, I rise to present legislation that has been carefully crafted through the tireless work and effort of many individuals. This bill, H.R. 4281, the ICCVAM Authorization Act, enjoys support from an overwhelming coalition of companies and groups that span the political spectrum.  We have animal rights groups, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, industry associations and the current administration among the bill's supporters. We even have Republican and Democrats that agree on this bill. Many people have worked and worked to ensure that this bill would receive a consensus agreement, and I am proud to say, that we have a document here that has achieved this goal.  This legislation is a testament to what can be done when different groups come together for an important cause. This legislation reaches an important outcome; reducing the number of needless animal deaths and so much more. This legislation will save the American taxpayers money by ensuring a streamlined approach to the approval of toxicological test methods. It will save chemical and pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars by eliminating duplicative, time-consuming and costly test method validation at several government agencies. Everyone wins with this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by thanking the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. Bliley, the Ranking Member Mr. Dingell, Health Subcommittee Chair Mr. Bilirakis and of course Mr. Lantos who have worked with me from the beginning to ensure this bill's passage.  I encourage all of my colleagues to join in this effort and overwhelmingly pass H.R. 4281.
