Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate Galilee Missionary Baptist Church as they join together in celebration of the 5th Pastoral anniversary of their esteemed Pastor Reverend Charles M. Morgan. They will be celebrating this very momentous and special occasion November 18-20, 2005.  Reverend Morgan was born to the late James and Lillie Morgan in Kansas City, Missouri. He completed his undergraduate studies at Ottawa University and Calvary Seminary. He is presently matriculating in the McCormick Theological Seminary. Reverend Morgan is an active member of the Baptist Minister's Conference of Gary and Vicinity, and he is the 2nd Vice Moderator of the Northern Indiana Missionary Baptist District Association. He is a regular participant at the Stephen Olford School for Expository Preaching in Memphis, Tennessee. Reverend Morgan has also been an instructor for the Baptist Minister's Seminar for the past two years.  From its modest beginning, Galilee Missionary Baptist Church has emerged as a cornerstone of the community. Under Pastor Morgan's guidance, Galilee continues to thrive, both in terms of spiritual growth as well as practical improvements. The proud members of the church are thankful for the spiritual and emotional leadership he and the previous pastors have provided during the years.  Though Reverend Morgan is dedicated to the Galilee Family, he has never limited his time and love for his family. Reverend Charles Morgan and his wife Francine have three daughters, Natasha (deceased), LaRonda Lindsey, and Rasheeda; one son, Johan; and two grandchildren, Manuel and Jackson.  The celebration weekend begins on Friday, November 18, 2005, with the Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church Family and Pastor Charles L. Emery. On Saturday, November 19, 2005, there will be an evening of love and appreciation at the Turkey Creek Country Club Banquet in Merrillville, Indiana. The celebration banquet will conclude the festivities on Sunday, November 20, 2005, when the church honors Pastor Morgan and his family with special guests, including Pastor Mike Nicholson and the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Family of Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Reverend and Mrs. Charles M. Morgan and the Galilee Missionary Baptist Church on their 5th Pastoral anniversary. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2253]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          CONGRATULATIONS TO GALILEE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH                                 ______                                                         HON.
