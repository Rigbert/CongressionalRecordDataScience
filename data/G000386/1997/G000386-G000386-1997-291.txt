 President, I would also like to point out that D.M.E. has received approximately $30 million in contracts with the Transportation Department. Roughly one-half of those contracts were entered into after the Coast Guard audit detected financial irregularities. Did the questionable practices of D.M.E. at least cause concern within the Transportation Department?  Now these concerns shouldn't necessarily prevent Secretary Pena's nomination from going forward at this time, but there are serious questions about public integrity which require serious answers--not politically expedient ones.
