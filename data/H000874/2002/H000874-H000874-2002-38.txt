Speaker.  We have heard much about the budget and the fact we have not passed the budget in the same form through two Houses. But as I recall, we passed a deeming resolution budget, which means the House numbers are the numbers we are supposed to adhere to. Am I not correct that we used that deeming resolution to pass the five bills to which the gentleman previously referred that have passed the House? Is that correct?
