 President, I thank the Senator from Texas very much for letting me make a brief statement about the amendment I am about to offer, and apologize for interrupting her comments.  What we have today is an opportunity--an opportunity--for the majority to reevaluate what it has done on the issue of health care and to take another path. It is no secret the American people don't like the health care bill that was passed last year. If you have talked with doctors or nurses or anybody else involved in health care over the last year, most of them will tell you they do not like it either. Employers, big and small, have been desperately trying to get the message across of how damaging this bill will be to their ability to create jobs. They tell us the impact of the bill is severe--higher taxes, penalties for hiring workers, new regulations that have already run to more than 6,000 pages, and mountains of new paperwork all at a time when businesses want to create jobs and millions of Americans are looking for one.  Don't take it from me. Here is how the National Federation of Independent Business puts it:       Small business owners everywhere are rightfully concerned      that the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and      new taxes in the health care law will devastate their      businesses and their ability to create jobs.  Yesterday, a Federal court in Florida found the crux of the law to be unconstitutional. So we have an opportunity today--an opportunity for all those who supported the health law--to reevaluate your vote and to listen to your constituents, who are desperately trying to get your attention. You can say, perhaps, this was a mistake, we can do this better or you can continue to dismiss the majority of the people in this country as not knowing what they are talking about.  It is not every day that you get a second chance on a big decision after you know all the facts. Today is one of those days. For all of us who opposed the health care bill, today we reaffirm our commitment to work a little harder to get it right. We can't afford to get it wrong.  I urge my colleagues to move beyond party affiliation. Look at the facts before us. If everyone in this Chamber evaluated this bill for what it is, we would repeal it right now, and then we would begin to work on achieving our mutual goal of delivering health care at a higher quality for lower cost. Let us not miss this opportunity.                            Amendment No. 13  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.
