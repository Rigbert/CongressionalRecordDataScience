President, the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania has worked as hard on this issue as anybody here. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the original PATRIOT Act was written by myself, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and others. It was the distinguished Republican leader from Texas, Dick Armey, and I who put in the sunset provisions so we would be forced to come back and look at different parts of it. Much of the PATRIOT Act is permanent law, but we should look at certain parts. Those are the parts that are now most in contention because they will expire.
