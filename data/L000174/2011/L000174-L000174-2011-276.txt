I am glad that the Senate is now being permitted to proceed to pass the bill. The holds have finally been lifted.  I worked with Senator Grassley to respond to the President's May 12 request, and the Judiciary Committee reported a bill to do that more than one month ago. I am pleased that a bill finally passed the Senate today. I hope the House will take up and pass the bill so that it can be signed by the President, and the Senate can confirm Director Mueller's renomination prior to August 3, 2011.  This important legislation, S. 1103, would fulfill the President's request that Congress create a one-time exception to the statutory 10-year term of the FBI Director, in order to extend the term of the incumbent FBI Director for 2 additional years. Given the continuing threat to our Nation, especially with the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks approaching, and the need to provide continuity and stability on the President's national security team, it is important that we respond to the President's request and enact this necessary legislation swiftly. The incumbent FBI Director's term otherwise expires on August 3, 2011.
