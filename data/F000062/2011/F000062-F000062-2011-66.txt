 President, I am very pleased to rise in support of the fiscal year 2012 energy and water development appropriations bill with my ranking member, the distinguished Senator Alexander, with whom I have had the great pleasure of working. I want to say this up front: It has been a pleasure to work with this particular ranking member. He is respected, he is credible, he is direct, and he is reasonable, which I have learned is an endangered species around here. So I very much appreciate that.  This Energy and Water bill has an allocation of $31.625 billion, which is $57 million or .1 percent below last year's enacted levels and nearly $3 billion or 9.4 percent below the President's request.
