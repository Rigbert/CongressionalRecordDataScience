Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1894, an act to provide for the conveyance of 190 acres of Bureau of Reclamation-administered public lands to Park County, Wyoming, for the appraised fair market value. In the other body, the amendment in the nature of a substitute was adopted to meet the concerns the administration had with the original text.  The General Services Administration will manage the sale of this property, known as the Cody Industrial Area. The Bureau of Reclamation determined in 1996 this parcel is no longer needed for bureau purposes and is suitable for disposal.  Park County is 82 percent federally owned land. Mr. Speaker, S. 1894 will allow the county to encourage economic development by expanding a current industrial park which lies adjacent to this parcel.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1894 is supported by the administration, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
