 President, I rise today to honor my good friend and fellow Kentuckian Oran Little on the occasion of his retirement as dean of the University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture.  Oran taught at UK for 25 years, and served as a highly-respected and well-liked leader for UK's students and faculty for 12 years as Dean of the College of Agriculture. Under his tenure, new facilities were built, old facilities were renovated, and innovative educational programs were launched. An Agricultural Engineering Building, Regulatory Services Building, Animal Research Center, and Plant Science Building all took root during Oran's 12 years as dean. He also facilitated the creation of international exchange programs, faculty and student councils, and numerous agricultural development programs. Oran may be leaving UK in body, but the school will benefit from his enterprising spirit and the tangible improvements he made as the College of Agriculture's dean for years to come.  Oran's long list of awards is as impressive as his lengthy list of accomplishments. His knowledge and experience have not gone unnoticed by other Kentucky agricultural institutions. Oran has received awards from the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association, Bowling Green/Warren County Chamber of Commerce, Greater Lexington Convention & Visitors Bureau, Soil and Water Conservation Society, UK Alumni Association, Kentucky 4-H, Kentucky Pork Producers Association, and the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association.  Oran has a long history with UK, serving as assistant professor, associate professor, professor, coordinator of animal nutrition research and teaching, associate dean for research, director of the Kentucky agricultural experiment station, coordinator of graduate programs in agriculture, and finally as dean of the College of Agriculture. Oran earned respect the old-fashioned way, through years of hard-work and a sincere concern for students, teachers and faculty at the University of Kentucky.  Over the years, Oran and I have worked together on many projects at UK. With Oran's wealth of knowledge about the University, he has been an essential resource in targeting the needs of UK and communicating how Congress can help meet those needs. It has always been a pleasure to work with Oran and I will miss him a great deal. I have no doubt, however, that he will stay involved with UK's College of Agriculture and that we will continue to hear from him in the future.  Oran, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, I wish you all the best as you enter retirement and I thank you for your many successful efforts to make UK a better place to work and learn.                          ____________________
