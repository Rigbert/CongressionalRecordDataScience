President, I rise today to voice my strong support for a provision included by Senator Gregg in the Commerce-Justice-State portion of the emergency supplemental which provides $2 million for rewards to anyone who brings Charles Taylor before the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  I commend the senior Senator from New Hampshire for his strong leadership on this issue. Just a few months ago, when the Special Prosecutor for Special Court unsealed his indictment against Charles Taylor, he and I came to the Senate floor together to commend this strong and decisive action.  In that colloquy and in other floor statements, I described why it is so important for West Africa, as well as the cause of international justice, to bring Charles Taylor before the Special Court, I will not repeat all of that here today, but I just want to make a couple of additional points. Since his exile to Nigeria, press reports have revealed that Charles Taylor continues to try to foment chaos and instability in Liberia. There is no doubt that he wants to return, and will do so if given the opportunity.  Charles Taylor needs to come before the Special Court. This needs to happen immediately. Allowing him to remain in Nigeria is wrong. It is impeding peace and prosperity in a region that has endured tremendous suffering over the past decade.  The provision included in the supplemental can help get him before the Special Court. I look forward to working with Senators Gregg and Hollingsto keep this provision in the final version of the supplemental conference report.  I also want to point out that a humanitarian disaster continues to exist in Liberia, where thousands are without food, shelter, or basic medical care. Even after emergency needs are addressed, Liberia will require substantial amounts of additional assistance, as three-fourths of its citizens are impoverished, the unemployment rate is 85 percent, and seven out of ten of combatants involved in recent fighting in Liberia are child soldiers.  I am worried that the world's attention is focused elsewhere and we will simply forget about the plight of Liberia's people. In the coming weeks, I hope that we can find some money in this supplemental to address these critical needs. Even a tiny percentage of the more than $87 billion in this bill would save many lives.                          ____________________
