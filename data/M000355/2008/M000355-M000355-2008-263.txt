 President, I notified the other side that I am going to propound a unanimous consent request to which I think they will object. I didn't want to blindside them. I don't know who on the other side is available.  I see both leaders here. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume consideration of S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill; that the motion to commit be withdrawn and the pending amendment be temporarily set aside so that I may offer an amendment related to gas prices.
