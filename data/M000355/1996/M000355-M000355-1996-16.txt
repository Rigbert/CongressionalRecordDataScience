David Novak assumed responsibility of KFC Corp. in 1994. In 1995, the chain generated over $3.7 billion in retail sales. The company now claims more than a 40 percent share of the U.S. fried chicken market and an 82 percent share of the Canadian market.  Before attaining his current position, novak was chief operating officer for Pepsi-Cola North America. He also held positions as executive vice president of Pepsi-Cola Marketing/Sales and senior vice president of Marketing for Pizza Hut. He and his wife, Wendy, have a daughter, Ashley.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in congratulating David Novak on receiving this distinguished award.                          ____________________
