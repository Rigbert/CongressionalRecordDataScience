President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to help commercial fishermen navigate the often choppy waters of the Internal Revenue Code.  The legislation I am introducing would make two commonsense changes to our tax laws. First, my legislation would extend a $1,500 tax credit to commercial fishermen to assist them in the purchase of important safety equipment.  Commercial fishermen engage in one of the most dangerous professions in America. They have a higher fatality rate than even firefighters, police officers, truck or taxi drivers. From 1994 to 1998, 396 commercial fishermen lost their lives while fishing. Last year, in the wake of catastrophic events that killed 11 fishermen over the course of only 1 month, the Coast Guard Fishing Vessel Casualty Task Force was convened. The task force issued a report that draws several conclusions about current fishing vessel safety. Despite the grim safety statistics surrounding the profession of fishing, the report concludes that most fishing deaths are preventable. One significant way to prevent these tragic deaths is to make safety equipment on commercial fishing vessels more widely available.  As those of us who represent States with commercial fishing industries may recall, in 1988, Congress passed the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act. This act required lifesaving and firefighting equipment to be placed on board all fishing boats. Unfortunately, the cost of some of the safety equipment has proven to be a serious practical impediment for many commercial fishermen. The margin of profit for some commercial fishermen is simply too narrow and they simply lack the funds required to purchase the expensive safety equipment they require.  Moreover, as the fishing industry has come under increasingly heavy Federal regulation, fishermen have often felt compelled to greatly increase their productivity on those days when they are permitted to fish. As a result, too many take dangerous risks in order to earn a living.  Just this last January, in my home State of Maine, a terrible and tragic incident highlighted the critical importance of safety equipment. Two very experienced fishermen tragically drowned off Cape Neddick when their commercial fishing vessel capsized during a storm. The sole survivor of this tragedy was the fisherman who was able to correctly put on an immersion suit, a safety suit that the Coast Guard has required on cold water commercial fishing boats since the early 1990s.  In fact, immersion suits, liferafts, and emergency locater devices have been credited with saving more than 200 lives since 1993. By providing a $1,500 tax credit for fishermen to purchase safety equipment, my legislation would encourage the wider availability and use of safety equipment on our Nation's commercial fishing boats. We should take this sensible step to help ensure that fishermen do not set off without essential safety gear.  The second provision of my bill would eliminate some of the perils that the Tax Code has that particularly affect commercial fishermen. I propose to allow fishermen to use income-averaging tax provisions that are now available to our Nation's farmers. For tax purposes, income averaging allows individuals to carry back income from a boom year to a prior less prosperous year. This tax treatment assists individuals who must adapt to wide fluctuations in their income from year to year by preventing them from being pushed into higher tax brackets in random good years.  Until 1986, both farmers and fishermen were covered under the Tax Code's income-averaging provisions. However, income averaging disappeared as part of the tax restructuring undertaken in 1986. In 1997, income-averaging provisions were again reintroduced into our Tax Code, but unfortunately, under the changes in the 1997 law, only farmers were permitted to benefit from this tax relief. The Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 permanently extended this tax relief provision, but again only for our farmers.  Although I am very pleased that Congress has restored income averaging for our Nation's farmers, I do not believe our fishermen should be left out in thecold and excluded from using income averaging. The legislation that I introduce today would restore fairness by extending income averaging to our fishermen as well as our farmers.  Parallel tax treatment for fishermen and farmers is appropriate for many reasons. Currently, unlike farmers, fishermen's sole tax protection to handle fluctuations in income are found in the Tax Code's net operating loss provisions. These provisions do not provide the tax benefits of income averaging and are so complex in their computation that it often defies the ability of any individual without a CPA after his or her name.  Most importantly, both farm and fishing income can fluctuate widely from year to year due to a wide range of uncontrollable circumstances, including market prices, the weather and, in the case of fishing, Government restrictions.  I urge my colleagues to help our fishermen cope with the fluctuations in their income by restoring this important tax provision and by extending a safety tax credit to help protect them from the hazards that their fishing profession entails.                                 ______                                       By
