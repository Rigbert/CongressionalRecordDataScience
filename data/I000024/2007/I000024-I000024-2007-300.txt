President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. A lot of people don't know it, but his family has made a personal sacrifice in their efforts in this war. We appreciate that very much. The Senator from Missouri outlined the consequences of surrender in a very articulate way.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum calls during the debate on the Iraq resolutions be equally divided.
