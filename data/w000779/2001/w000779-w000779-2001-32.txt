I do not know how many hours we have put in over the last 18 months trying to do this. My question was designed really to get a sense of the thinking of the Senator on a particular point that may help us move this issue along.  What I and many others are concerned about is sticking it to sellers who are located thousands of miles away from a local jurisdiction and that seller has no presence in the local jurisdiction other than a Web site. That is the only presence they have today. Of course, the Supreme Court has said there has to be physical presence, under a current Court decision, in order to do that.  In the view of the Senator from Florida, what is the case for imposing these various taxes--of course, anything that is already owed can be collected under the current Internet tax freedom bill, so we are talking about something new. What is the case in the mind of the Senator for having changed treatment of that particular seller who is located thousands of miles from a local jurisdiction and who has no presence in that jurisdiction other than a Web site?  Again, I do not ask this question for any other reason than I think it would be helpful for me and others who spent a significant amount of time to get the thinking of colleagues as we try to figure out a way to move forward on it.
