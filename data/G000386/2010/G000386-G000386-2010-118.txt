 I think he referred to maybe 10 years that we have been struggling to get to what we are finally getting to today.  In the past, we thought we had victories and they turned out to be hollow victories--maybe a little more openness but largely ineffective. So maybe now we will finally be able to accomplish an effective openness in the Senate on one of the most powerful tools a Senator has.  I think it gives hope to the fact that if you are right, eventually right wins out, even in the Senate. Long struggle does pay. I think we are bringing simply common sense to a process in the Senate. It is, as my friend from Oregon said, transparency, and with transparency we have accountability.
