 Because at the same time as we are losing jobs to Mexico, and our people's wages are not going up, art would be one of the major exports from the United States to Mexico. In 1991 there were only two billionaires in Mexico. Today there are over two dozen.  At the same time as the average Mexican citizen has lost buying power, if they were lucky enough to have $100 in savings in a local institution there, it has just been cut to $60. but somebody down there, and I have a hunch who it is, has been purchasing very expensive items, and I would guess it is those families that traditionally have owned everything in that country and command the wealth and the real political power inside that nation  One of the questions we are asking, in fact, we are sending a letter today to the U.S. Treasury Department in the Clinton administration asking them about this $18 billion bailout of Mexico. Some of the questions I would just like to read, because I think the American people should be thinking about these as well:  The first one is that in view of the fact that our banks in this country are earning historic profits, and they have been for several months now, why is our Government's intervention in the form of this currency swap and special Government loans necessary? If the private sector gambles and loses in a country like Mexico, why should those losses not be borne by the private sector? Why do we allow these people who are buying art to get off scot-free and then run right up to the door of our treasury and ask the American taxpayers to back up loans to bail them out?  Back years ago this happened again when the Brady bonds were created, if people have long memories back in the late 1980's. That debt that was accrued by Latin American nations in those days, what happened to it?                              {time}  1450  Well, folks, it is still out there. It is now in the form of Brady bonds, and in 1990 Mexico had to convert $33 billion of its debt to Brady bonds, and guess that the interest rate is on those bonds? Forty percent.  When Mexico pays or is supposed to be paying off all of these debts, who is earning the 40 percent? One of the questions we are asking the Treasury is we would like to know does anybody on my street have a right to buy those 40 percent bonds?  [[Page H213]] Mr. DeFAZIO. Would it not be nice if some of these interest earnings, extended with the backing of the U.S. Government, went to help defray our own deficit here in the United States? Would it not be refreshing if for once the American taxpayers did not just extend guarantees and send taxpayers' dollars but in effect they were getting a return?  I know that is not the case. The 40 percent interest is going to private investors, the largest banks in the country who are now desperately knocking at the doors; actually they are inside. We are not allowed in, but they are inside saying we would like another $10 billion for Mexico. Please send it now because we are worried out our investments and our payments. They are not worried about the American taxpayers.
