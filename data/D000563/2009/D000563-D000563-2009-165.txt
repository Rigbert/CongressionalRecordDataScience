Here is what I understood happened. I know Senator Dodd came to the HELP Committee with a base bill to start with, but it is my understanding, in the process, 100 Republican amendments were accepted on that bill. If I am mistaken, I know the Senator will correct me, but----  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to correct the Senator from Illinois. Senator Enzi is here. None of those amendments were of any significant substance that would have a significant impact on the legislation, I have to say to the Senator from Illinois. For example, medical malpractice, we proposed several amendments that would address what we all know, what the Congressional Budget Office says is $54 billion--other estimates as much as $100 billion--in savings.
