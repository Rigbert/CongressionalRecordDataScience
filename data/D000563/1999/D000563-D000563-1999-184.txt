President.  I first acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, who has called the attention of this Congress and this Senate to this important issue. I hope his efforts will prevail in bringing this issue to the floor of the Senate.  In my lifetime, it is interesting to look back and reflect on things which were so commonplace and now are so rare. I can recall, as a child in the 1950's, in my classroom when we were being instructed about the need to ``duck and cover,'' the possibility that there might be an attack on the United States of America. That was generated by the fact that the Soviets had detonated a nuclear weapon. We were technically emerging into a cold war, and there was a belief that we had to be prepared for the possibility of an attack.  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, when my wife and I bought a little house, the first house we ever owned--1600 South Lincoln Avenue; an appropriate name in Springfield, IL--we moved into the house and went in the basement and were startled to find a fallout shelter that had been built to specifications. Someone had believed in the 1960s this was an appropriate thing to put in a house in Springfield, IL, because of the possibility that we may face some sort of attack, a nuclear attack on the United States.  You can remember the monthly air raid sirens that used to call our attention to the fact that we had a system to warn all of America of a potential attack. You may remember, not that many years ago, movies on television and long debates about a ``nuclear winter,'' what would happen with a nuclear holocaust.  That conversation was part of daily life in America for decades. Then with the end of the cold war, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact nations not only leaving the Soviet domination but gravitating toward the West--with countries such as Poland and Hungary and Czechoslovakia coming to join NATO--many of us have been lulled into a false sense of security that the threat of nuclear weapons is no longer something we should take seriously. In fact, we should.  In fact, we are reminded, from time to time, that the so-called nuclear club--the nations which have nuclear capability--continues to grow. That is why this particular treaty and this debate are so important.  One of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Threat assessments regularly warn us of the possibility that North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or some other nation may acquire or develop nuclear weapons. Our most basic interest in relations with Russia today is to see that it controls its nuclear weapons and technology and that Russian scientists do not come to the aid of would-be nuclear proliferators. In other words, in a desperate state of affairs, with the Russian economy, we are concerned that some people will decide they have a marketable idea, that they can go to some rogue nation and sell the idea of developing a nuclear weapon, adding another member to the nuclear club, increasing the instability in this world.  Congress spends millions of dollars to fight nuclear proliferation, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide, and to support the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.  For the past several years, I have been involved in an Aspen Institute exchange, which has opened my eyes to the need for our concern in this area. Senator Lugar is a regular participant as well, and Senator Nunn has been there in the past, when we have met with members of the Russian Duma and leaders from that country and have learned of the very real concern they have of the stockpile of nuclear weapons still sitting in the old Soviet Union, a stockpile of weapons which, unfortunately for us, has to be minded all the time for fear that the surveillance, the inspection, and the safety would degrade to the point that there might be an accidental detonation. Those are the very real problems we face, and we vote on these regularly.  Yet we in the Senate, despite all of these realities, have had languished in the committee one of the most effective tools for fighting nuclear proliferation--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty which, as the Senator from North Dakota indicated, has been ratified by over 130 nations but not by the United States of America.  The idea of banning nuclear tests is not a new one. It is one of the oldest items on the nuclear arms control agenda. Test bans were called for by both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Steps were taken toward a ban in the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, but other incremental steps were eschewed in favor of a comprehensive treaty.  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a key piece of the broader picture of nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. Consider this: When nonnuclear countries--those that don't have nuclear weapons--agree they are not going to have a nuclear arsenal and sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an essential part of that bargain for the smaller nations, the nonnuclear powers, and those that have it, was that nuclear countries were going to control and reduce the number of nuclear weapons.  An integral part of that effort is this treaty. It is virtually impossible to make qualitative improvements in nuclear weapons or develop them for the first time without testing. Just a few months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to reorganize the Department of Energy because of our deep concern about what secrets may have been stolen from our nuclear labs. The potential damage from this espionage is disturbing.  In the case of China, the entry into force of this treaty could help mitigate the effect of the loss of our nuclear secrets. More than old computer codes and blueprints would be needed to deploy more advanced nuclear weapons. Extensive testing would be required. In the cases of India and Pakistan, U.S. ratification of this treaty would pressure both countries to sign the treaty, as they pledged to do following their nuclear test last year.  In fact, the leadership role of the United States is essential to encourage the ratification of the treaty by many other nations. If the leading nuclear power in the world, the United States of America, fails to ratify this treaty to stop nuclear testing, why should any other country? The United States has a responsibility of moral leadership. Many who take such pride in our Nation and its role and voice in the world tremble when faced with the burden of leadership. The burden of leadership comes down to our facing squarely the need to ratify this treaty.  The United States has declared that its own nuclear testing program has been discontinued, but it is still absolutely in our national interest to be part of a multinational monitoring and verification regime. That way we can shape and benefit from that same regime. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty says if the treaty has not been entered into force 3 years after its being open for signing, the states that have ratified it may convene a special conference to decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law can be taken to facilitate its entry into force.  Only those states that have ratified it would be given full voting privileges. The special conference is going to take place this fall. It will set up monitoring and verification of nuclear testing worldwide so the components willbe operating by the time the treaty does enter into force. This regime will include the International Data Center and many other elements that are important for success.  The United States should be part of that process, but it will not be, because the Senate has not voted on this treaty. This country certainly conducts its own monitoring for nuclear tests, but if we participate in an international regime, our country can benefit from a comprehensive international system. It is important to recall that if China or Russia were to resume testing, the United States, under this treaty, would have the right to withdraw and resume our own, if that is necessary for our national defense.  If the United States does not ratify the treaty in the first place, however, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may never enter into force. We would be faced with the prospect, once again, of a major nuclear power's resuming nuclear testing. When President Eisenhower and President Kennedy called for a nuclear test ban, a major impetus was the public outcry over environmental damage caused by these tests.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Congressional Record at this point a letter I received from major national environmental organizations supporting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and decrying the environmental damage to both our national security and our planet if the treaty is not ratified.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.     Hon. Richard Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Re: Major national environmental organizations' support of                      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty       Dear Senator Durbin: We urge the Senate to give its consent      to ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty this year. The      timing is critical so that the United States can participate      in this fall's special international conference of Treaty      ratifiers.       We support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) because      it is a valuable instrument in stemming the proliferation of      nuclear weapons and reducing the environmental and security      threats posed by nuclear arms races. Under the CTBT, non-     nuclear weapons states will be barred from carrying out the      nuclear explosions needed to develop compact, high-yield      nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles and confidently      certify nuclear explosive performance. The Treaty is      therefore vital to preventing the spread of nuclear missile      capability to additional states. In addition, the Treaty will      limit the ability of the existing nuclear weapons states to      build new and destabilizing types of nuclear weapons.       Since 1945, seven nations have conducted over 2,050 nuclear      test explosions--an average of one test every 10 days.      Atmospheric tests spread dangerous levels of radioactive      fallout downwind and into the global atmosphere. Underground      nuclear blasts spread highly radioactive material into the      earth and each one creates a permanent nuclear waste site.      This contamination presents long-term hazards to nearby water      sources and surrounding communities. Also, many underground      tests have vented radioactive gases into the atmosphere,      including some of those conducted by the United States. Of      course, the ultimate threat to the environment posed by      nuclear testing is the continuing and possibly increasing      risk of nuclear war posed by proliferating nuclear arsenals.       In addition to protecting the environment, the CTBT will      enhance U.S. security with its extensive monitoring system      and short-notice, on-site inspections. These will improve our      ability to discourage all states from engaging in the testing      of nuclear weapons.       Ending nuclear testing has been a goal of governments,      scientists, and ordinary citizens from all walks of life for      over forty years. The CTBT has already been ratified by many      other nations, including France, the United Kingdom, and      Japan. The vast majority of Americans support approval of the      CTBT. The effort in this country to stop nuclear testing that      began with public outrage about nuclear fallout and has been      pursued by American Presidents since Dwight Eisenhower can      now be achieved. With U.S. leadership on the CTBT, entry into      force is within reach. It is vital that the U.S. set the      example on this important environmental and security issue;      with your leadership and support, the CTBT can finally be      realized.           Yours sincerely,         Rodger Schlickeisen, President, Defenders of Wildlife;            Mike Casey, Vice-President for Public Affairs,            Environmental Working Group; Matt Petersen, Executive            Director, Global Green USA; John Adams, Executive            Director, Natural Resources Defense Counsel; Amy Coen,            President Population Action International; James K.            Wyerman, Executive Director, 20/20 Vision; Brian Dixon,            Director of Government Relations, Zero Population            Growth; Fred D. Krupp, Executive Director,            Environmental Defense Fund; Brent Blackwelder,            President, Friends of the Earth; Phil Clapp, President,            National Environmental Trust; Robert K. Musil,            Executive Director, Physicians for Social            Responsibility; Carl Pope, Executive Director, Sierra            Club; Bud Ris, Executive Director, Union of Concerned            Scientists.  This is a letter that has been circulated and signed by the leaders of at least a dozen major environmental groups. I note in the letter it states that since 1945, the last 54 years, seven nations in this world have conducted 2,050 nuclear test explosions, an average of 1 test every 10 days, leaving nuclear fallout, radioactive gases, in many instances, in our atmosphere. We certainly never want to return to that day again. Unless the United States is a full partner in this international effort to reduce nuclear testing, that is a possibility looming on the horizon.  Senator Helms, who spoke on the floor earlier, has said he puts this treaty in line behind amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. convention on global climate change, both of which the President has not yet submitted to the Senate. My colleague says that ABM changes are essential for the national missile defense to move forward, which is true. But national missile defense does not yet work. We don't have this technology to build an umbrella of protection over the United States so that any nuclear missile fired on us can somehow be stopped in the atmosphere without danger to the people living in this country.  If we decide to deploy such a defense, we will need to negotiate more ABM Treaty changes. That is something in the future. We have time to address that. But we also need to accept the immediate responsibility of ratifying this treaty. Not too many months ago in this Chamber, we passed a resolution which says if the national missile defense system or so-called star wars system should become technologically possible, we will spend whatever it takes to build it. I have to tell you that I voted against it. I thought it was not wise policy.  Quite honestly, the idea that we are somehow going to insulate the United States by building this umbrella and therefore don't have to deal with the world and its problems in nuclear proliferation, in my mind, is the wrong way to go. We should be working diplomatically as well as militarily for the defense of the United States. When we have the support of the commanders of the Nation, of course, and those who are in charge, the Joint Chiefs, time and again for this treaty, it is evidence to me that it is sound military policy.  In short, Mr. President, I conclude by saying, we must not delay any longer. We must ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I yield the floor.
