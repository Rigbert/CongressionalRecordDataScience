Speaker, if the gentleman would continue to yield, I understand his premise. We have, for instance, billions of dollars in our bill for Head Start. Is it the gentleman's position that we ought to make that flexible so that if a community locally decides that they do not need a Head Start program in that community, they can use those dollars for something else?
