 As I have said before on the floor with respect to scheduling, I agree with him on both items. I think the budget is very important, and clearly the supplemental is very important, and I hope to be able to move those as soon as possible.                              {time}  1900  We are working on both. I know the Appropriations Committee is working on the supplemental. I know Mr. Spratt is working on budget. So I tell my friend that I share his view of their importance, and that we hope to be able to move those to the floor within the near future. I cannot give him a date, but within the near future.
