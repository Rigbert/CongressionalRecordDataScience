President, I have worked to expedite the Senate's passage of Congresswoman Giffords' legislation. This action today shows what we can do when we work together. The Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act, H.R. 3801, is intended to help ensure that smugglers who use ultralight aircraft along the United States border are held accountable for their actions. Its passage today is an appropriate tribute to the courage and outstanding work of Congresswoman Giffords.  Congresswoman Giffords has long been committed to securing the border against drug smugglers. This legislation is intended to keep Americans who live and work along the border safe.  I was part of the tribute to Congresswoman Giffords at the joint session of Congress to hear the President's State of the Union address earlier this week. I was saddened to learn of Gabrielle Giffords' decision to resign from Congress. I know that her commitment to the citizens of Arizona is unwavering. I look forward to working with her in the future, and wish her a continued speedy recovery. She is an inspiration to all.
