Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my heartfelt congratulations to the Republic of China (Taiwan) on their upcoming centennial anniversary of becoming the first democracy in Asia on October 10, 1911. The annual celebration of this event is known as ``Double Ten Day,'' and celebrates the start of the Wuchang Uprising which established the Republic of China.  Since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Taiwan has been a true friend and long term ally with the United States. Both the U.S. and Taiwan have maintained strong trade ties stemming from our close friendship; I hope these ties continue to advance and expand in the future.  Alaskan and Taiwanese relations are also close as Taiwan is the only country with whom Alaska has a codified relationship agreement. In 2004, leaders from both Alaska and Taiwan established the Taiwan-Alaska Trade and Investment Cooperation Council to further extend collaboration between Alaska and Taiwan. Because of this collaboration, both Alaska and Taiwan have greatly benefitted from the many cultural exchanges, and improved trade and transport relations. In fact, in 2010, Taiwan was Alaska's 16th largest export power and received $23 million in exports including forest products, energy, and machinery. However, since 2008, Alaska has exported $143 million to Taiwan making it Alaska's 9th largest trading partner over the last 3 years.  I would like to congratulate Taiwan on its 100th anniversary and thank them for their role as an important strategic ally of the United States.                          ____________________
