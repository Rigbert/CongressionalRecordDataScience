President, the international provisions of the tobacco legislation have been the subject of many hours of discussion and negotiation. The current provisions serve as a strong platform that I hope this body will continue to build upon in the years to come as we seek to protect all children from the diseases and the economic costs brought about by tobacco use. I received letters which demonstrate the breadth of support and the importance the public health community places on maintaining the international tobacco control provisions in the tobacco legislation.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Effective National Action                                            to Control tobacco                                                     May 20, 1998.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Hart Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Senator Wyden: Last summer's agreement between the tobacco      industry and the Attorneys General was flawed because of its      failure to consider international tobacco and health issues.      We commend you for your strong leadership on this issue and      support your efforts to ensure the greatest level of      protection possible from tobacco for all children.       The international provisions in S. 1415 represent a good      start. It is vital, however, that they not be weakened at all      and that serious consideration be given to strengthening      them.       Thank you for your tremendous leadership in protecting      people from tobacco. We look forward to working with you on      this issue.           Sincerely,         American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin;            American Cancer Society; American College of Preventive            Medicine; American Heart Association; Association of            Teachers of Preventive Medicine; Campaign for Tobacco-           Free Kids; Interreligious Coalition on Smoking OR            Health; Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco; National            Association of County and City Officials; Partnership            for Prevention; Summit Health Coalition.                                  ____                                                 Latino Council on                                          Alcohol and Tobacco,                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1998.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: The Latino Council on Alcohol and      Tobacco (LCAT), members of the Hispanic Health and Education      Working Group and other Latino professionals want to thank      you and your staff for your hard work in supporting      international provisions for tobacco control. You and your      colleagues are putting forth a signal, a good beginning, a      starting point for assuring that the children of the world      will be protected from the unacceptable practices of the      tobacco giants.       Latino parents, educators and public health experts believe      that US standards should be upheld worldwide. Federal workers      should not support tobacco companies or their subsidiaries      abroad. International agencies such as the World Health      Organization and the Pan American Health Organizations and      non-profit organization should receive funding for their      efforts to prevent, treat and stop the spread of smoking      related diseases. Anti-smuggling provisions should be      strengthened. The US should be a leader in the fight against      the spread of tobacco related diseases. You have made it      clear through your efforts that public health has no      boundaries.       We trust that you will continue to work on international      tobacco control. We thank you for your leadership and      commitment to these issues.           Sincerely,     Jeannette Noltenius.                                  ____                                    American Lung Association,                                                     May 19, 1998.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your commitment to      protect the world's children from tobacco. The American Lung      Association shares your concern that children around the      world are prime targets for the tobacco industry. The      international provisions of S. 1415, as amended, represent a      strong first step toward curbing the worldwide tobacco      problem that the World Health Organization calls a global      epidemic.       The result of tobacco legislation should not be to redirect      the tobacco industry's focus from America's children to      children elsewhere around the world. Because of your efforts,      the bill's international measures will     fund a public health effort around the world, require      cigarette labeling and permanently stop the U.S. government      from marketing and promoting the export of cigarettes. We      cannot allow this progress to be rolled back by weakening      amendments on the Senate floor.       Strong international tobacco control measures are part of      the sound tobacco control policy outlined by the public      health community and leaders like Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler.      This approach also includes a significant increase in the      cigarette excise tax, full authority for the Food and Drug      Administration, complete document disclosure, strict      penalties on the industry for marketing to children,      protection from environmental tobacco smoke, potent public      health programs and, of course, no special protections, like      immunity or caps, for the tobacco industry.           Sincerely,                                                 John R. Garrison,                                        CEO and Managing Director.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
