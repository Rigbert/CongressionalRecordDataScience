Speaker, I rise to recognize Melwood, Maryland's second-largest non-profit agency focusing on people with differing abilities, as it marks its fiftieth anniversary.  In 1963, a small group of parents and supporters decided to teach plant care to young adults who were considered by most to be unemployable. It was then that Melwood was launched as a place where people with differing abilities learned new skills with the goal of employment. For 50 years, Melwood has been advocating on behalf of individuals with differing abilities by providing support services, helping them with critical skills, and placing them in jobs that provide independence and dignity.  Today, Melwood continues to provide job opportunities and support services to nearly 1,900 individuals with differing abilities. With 38 AbilityOne contracts at 43 locations, Melwood is the second-largest agency of its kind in Maryland and the largest AbilityOne employer in the Eastern Region. Additionally, it operates the Melwood Recreation Center for nearly 900 adults and children with and without special needs. Melwood's great work has even earned it an international reputation, and Melwood's ``social entrepreneurial'' model has been copied elsewhere in America and in other countries as well.  Every American who wants to contribute to building our country and strengthening our communities ought not to be held back because of a differing ability, and for a half a century Melwood has empowered people with differing abilities to transform their own lives through opportunities of employment, job training, life-skill improvement, and supportive and recreational services.  Much of Melwood's work helped lay the foundation for the enactment of the Americanswith Disabilities Act, bipartisan legislation I was proud to lead to passage in the House in 1990 and witness signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. As advocates for people with differing abilities celebrate this milestone anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to Melwood's mission to empower and inspire. I look forward to continuing to work with Melwood for many years to come, and I am confident that it will continue to carry out its mission for another fifty years and beyond.  I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating co-founder, President, and CEO emeritus, Earl Copus, Jr., current President and CEO, Cari DeSantis, and the rest of the outstanding Melwood staff, who will continue carrying this outstanding organization into the future.                          ____________________
