 Yesterday, our colleague Senator Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, came forward and said that his State of Texas and other States are showing that they can reduce recidivism--in other words, committing another crime after you are released--by treating prisoners differently in their State prisons. As I said on the floor, you may be shocked to think that Texas would be a leader in this, but they have been, and they have seen a reduction in the incidence of crime and a reduction in the incidence of incarceration--things we like to see happen. Reduce the cost to taxpayers of the prisons, but reduce crime on the streets too. Make sure you do both.  He believes they have achieved it. What they did was they looked at programs that work. So what we did was the same thing. Senator Grassley and I, as well as, as you mentioned, Senator Cornyn and Senator Whitehouse, looked at these prison reform programs in the States and said: What can we learn from them?  What we did was to establish the obligation of the Attorney General--thisis not the obligation of social workers but the obligation of the Attorney General of the United States to take a hard look at the programs that work for prisoners. What can we do to make sure they don't commit another crime, create another victim, and come back to prison?  We spell out exactly what we are looking for: the most effective and efficient, evidence-based recidivism-reduction programs. That is a long title. What that basically means is that we don't want to waste any more time here. We want to focus tax dollars on programs that have proven results, and unless they commit one of the crimes that make them ineligible, we offer these to prisoners. By participating in them, they can reduce the time they serve or be released to a halfway house or something similar to that. That is what this is all about, start to finish, and we believe this will work.  What if they mess up in the course of being enrolled in the program? We have a provision in here that says: You are done. You are either going to do this in good faith, positively, without any violations of your responsibilities as a Federal prisoner--we will give you a chance for less time but no nonsense.  Good program. Good participation. We hope good results, and we are going to measure it. We are going to come back. The General Accounting Office is going to give us a report on our success--of those who are released, how many turned around and committed another crime? So we are going to take a hard look at this--an honest look, I might say. I believe this is the best way to do it. Make sure it is evidence-based. Make sure it is a fair opportunity for those who want to participate and turn their lives around to do just that.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).
