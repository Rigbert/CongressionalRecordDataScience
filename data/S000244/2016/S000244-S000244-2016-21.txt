Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to offer a statement of my support for the region of Tibet. I have, during my tenure in the House of Representatives, been a strong supporter of the region of Tibet. There should be no divisiveness between political parties on the issue of Tibet and protecting their citizens from the repressions that they face around the world. Tibet is a unique region, and I hope that future actions in the House of Representatives will continue to support the Tibetan community in finding sustainable peaceful solutions.  The repression of Tibetans around the world has prompted the United States to take action to protect Tibetan citizens in their constant struggle for religious and cultural freedom. That is why in June of last year, Representative Lofgren and I introduced the Tibetan Refugee Assistance Act, which would provide visas to Tibetan refugees.  Our bill would address the plight of Tibetan citizens who have been displaced from their homes for a multitude of reasons, and would be an incredibly useful step in the right direction for future relations between Tibet and the United States. The bill would provide 3,000 immigrant visas over a three-year period to Tibetan citizens who have been displaced.  I first traveled to India and met His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2008, and it is an experience that I surely will never forget. The unique privilege of meeting with the head of state and spiritual leader of Tibet was one that led me to an even greater appreciation of Tibet, and brought me to first introduce legislation in 2008 supporting Tibetan refugees.  Eight years later we look at the same issue. This is not a new problem, as the epidemic has been occurring for years. We hope to make significant progress to aid many of these displaced Tibetans who have yet to free themselves from the rule of the Chinese government.  On behalf of the 5th District of Wisconsin, I welcome His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the United States and ask for continued perseverance from my colleagues on this issue. I hope to find a peaceful and manageable solution for the region of Tibet.                          ____________________
