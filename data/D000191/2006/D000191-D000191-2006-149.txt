Speaker, today I rise in support of America's craft brewers. Our culture, our economy, and our communities have all benefited from the contributions craft brewers have made. The craft beer segment includes more than 1,300 small, traditional and independent breweries.  We have seen a boost in sales and growth for these small business entrepreneurs in recent years. This consumer appeal has created thousands of quality jobs in our country, helped stimulate a demand for American beer exports, and promoted our agricultural economy.  In recent years, breweries and brew pubs have flourished across the Nation. And, as the Representative from Oregon's fourth district, I have enjoyed seeing the diversity that craft brewery has fueled across the Nation. They bring with their craft a healthy dose of friendly competition and a loyal clientele base that appreciates their craft-made lagers and ales.  The pioneering spirit of Oregon lives on with its craft brewers. Oregon continues to enjoy more breweries per capita than any other State in the Nation. Even with Oregon having only 1 percent of the Nation's population, it is home to 7 percent of America's breweries and brew pubs. Five of those breweries are among the 50 biggest in the Nation.  In addition to their sales success, many of these small businesses support innumerable community-based charities, public institutions, local events and charities. Small craft brewers successfully balance that dedication between the quality of their beer and the quality of their community.  I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 753 in recognition of America's Craft Brewers.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1088]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   COMMENDING AMERICAN CRAFT BREWERS                                 ______                                                                speech of                         HON.
