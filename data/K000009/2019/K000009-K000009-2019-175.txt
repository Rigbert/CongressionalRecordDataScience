Unexpectedly passed from this life on February 15, his colleagues and community eulogized him on Saturday April 13 in a special ceremony at the new home of Toledo's Mott Branch Library.  Friend and mentor to thousands of people of all ages, he worked creatively and tirelessly to advance our library system in Toledo and Lucas County to be the heartbeat of learning for people of all ages and backgrounds regardless of income or circumstance. His gentlemanly and learned demeanor drew people to him and he advanced the cause of learning for everyone across our region. What a privilege it has been to know him and to work with him as he drove learning and community down to the neighborhood level.  The Columbus Dispatch, Mr. Scoles' hometown newspaper, and the Toledo Blade, his adopted home's newspaper, encapsulated his life thusly:       ``Clyde Scoles, passed away, unexpectedly on Friday,      February 15, 2019 at the age of 69. Originally from Columbus,      Ohio, he and his family have lived in the Toledo area since      1978. Hard working and conscientious, Clyde focused his      energies on serving the people of Lucas County, Ohio.      Tirelessly, first as Associate Director and then as the      Director of TLCPL, he continued the work of previous      visionary Library directors to broaden consensus and build      community outreach. By renovating the Main Library, his goal      was to bring 21st Century function and capabilities to an      already outstanding resource. Mr. Scoles was a distinguished      leader of the community and well known throughout the area,      accumulating many awards for his contributions and service to      the Lucas County public. He was also a well known and      respected professional throughout the Library world. His      experience and participation in local, state and national      Library events will be missed. But it is by his family that      he will be most missed. His love for them was foremost always      in his mind and heart and will remain with them forever. He      is survived by numerous family and friends.''  Clyde Scoles was a library champion, guardian of literacy, passionate leader, friend and mentor to many. The premiere Toledo Lucas County Library system is his legacy to our community and the world, opening up dreams and pathways to people young and old. In this time of rebirth and new beginnings, we celebrate this remarkable man and the catalogue of his life. To his family and friends carrying forward following his unexpected passing, we wish peace and comfort as we remember Clyde Scoles' extraordinary gifts.  As the new Mott Branch Library is dedicated I cannot help but think that future generations will wonder and admire the structure and think about those who dedicated their lives to the advancement of a free people.                          ____________________
