President, I rise to commend the service of Steve Adams, who is ending his term on the Board of Directors for the Northeast-Midwest Institute. Steve has offered exceptional service to the Institute, and in the process helped to improve our region's economic development and environmental quality. The Northeast-Midwest Institute provides policy analysis for the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I co-chair with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Steve Adams, whom I met when he directed the Maine State Planning Office, is now with the Pioneer Institute in Boston. He was formerly a vice president with the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, debt management assistant in the Office of the Treasurer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and a senior policy analyst with the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.  I want to thank Steve Adams for his leadership on the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. He has provided valued service and helped increase that organization's reputation and effectiveness.                          ____________________
