Speaker, my colleague just used a bad word. Protect. We should protect the American standard of living? We do not want to become protectionists. That is what this administration would say.  I agree with my colleague. There is something at risk here. I think we are in an economic war, as I said earlier. I think we need to protect ourselves and maybe fight back. And this administration is choosing not to do that because there are a few people here in this country who are accumulating just fabulous wealth by outsourcing, by moving jobs and production overseas, producing goods much more cheaply. They are selling them at roughly the same price back here in the United States, but the profit margin is a lot larger.  I noticed a number of years ago when we could still buy shirts made in America. I think that is probably something we cannot do any more. But I used to go through the labels looking for them, and 5 or 8 years ago I could still find some. I would notice they were right on the rack next to shirts made in Bangladesh or somewhere else, and they were all the same price.  The Bangladesh shirt did not sell for 15 cents. It sold for $25. The U.S.-made shirt sold for $25. The person who made the U.S. shirt made enough money to raise a family, buy a home, be a productive citizen in our economy and live a good life. The Bangladeshi was earning less than a dollar a day, very often child labor or whatever else, but they sold for the same price.  That is what is going on now, except now there is this new spin where the Bush people say they want a level playing field. And if their level playing field does not bring other people up, which they are indicating they have no intention of forcing, then what they are saying is they are expecting Americans to come down, as the CEO of Intel said. If people want to compete, they have to look at competing with engineers from Russia who earn $5,000 a year.
