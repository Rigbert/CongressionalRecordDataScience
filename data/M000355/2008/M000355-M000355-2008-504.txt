 President, I ask my colleagues to pause for a moment so I may share with them the story of a soldier lost in battle. On January 5, 2007, MAJ Michael L. Mundell of Brandenburg, KY, and his unit were sent to secure a combat area in Fallujah, Iraq, after an American tank reported being struck by an improvised explosive device.  En route to the scene, a second explosive device went off near Major Mundell's vehicle, tragically taking his life. He was 47 years old.   Major Mundell served in the U.S. Army for over a decade before leaving active service to work as a civilian contractor to the armed forces. In November of 2005 he again volunteered for active duty. His wife Audrey tells us that Mike once told a friend ``he was going over there to fight them so they couldn't come over here and hurt his children.''  For his bravery in service, Major Mundell received numerous medals and awards, including two Meritorious Service Medals, the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.  Mr. President, Major Mundell was one of those who may have been born in one of the other 49 States but became Kentuckian by choice. Born in Pittsburgh, he grew up in Canonsburg, PA.  As a child, Mike developed a passion for military service. He wanted to grow up and drive tanks. When he was three, he handed his father an encyclopedia and asked him to read it to him.  His family says this began his lifelong love of reading. As an adult, he enjoyed Civil War history, and would often read more than a book a day. He also enjoyed mysteries and thrillers, and read through the Bible three times.   In 1977, Mike graduated from Canon-McMillan High School, home of the Big Macs. His wife Audrey liked to tease him that his high-school mascot was named after a hamburger, but Mike made his school proud on the football field.  Mike went on to graduate from Washington-Jefferson College in 1981 where he majored in history, participated in ROTC and played soccer.  After graduation, Mike realized his lifelong goal of becoming an Army officer when he received his commission as a second lieutenant. Assigned to FortKnox, KY, for officer's basic training, Mike became a Kentuckian--that is, when he was not spending 3 years in Germany working as a tank officer.  In 1984, while stationed at Fort Knox, Mike met Audrey, a student at Elizabethtown Community College, through a mutual friend. He was attracted to her red hair; she liked that he was handsome and intelligent. They were married in 1985 and had four children: daughter Erica and sons Ryan, Zach, and Dale. Mike had a special relationship with all of his children and made each one feel as if he or she was his favorite.  Mike raised his family in Brandenburg and was a devoted fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He liked to watch historical documentaries, and his favorite movies were the war films ``Glory'' and ``Patton.'' As a soldier, ``strategy and tactics--that was his thing, and he was extremely good at it,'' says Audrey. ``He was so intelligent.''  After over 11 years of service, Mike left active duty in 1992 and went on to become a private contractor to the Armed Forces working at Fort Knox. Then in November 2005, he volunteered to again don the uniform.  ``Mike was offered the chance to go to Iraq and do administrative work, but he said he would refuse to go if they were going to simply stick him behind a desk,'' said Audrey.  Assigned to the 1st Brigade, 108th Division, based out of Spartanburg, SC, Major Mundell was tasked with training the Iraqi Army. His tour of duty started on Father's Day of 2006.  Mike wrote e-mails often to his friends and family, sometimes exhibiting his robust sense of humor. In an e-mail dated June 23, 2006, he tried to describe the Kuwaiti heat.  This is what he said: ``Turn on a blow dryer, point it at yourself and stand there,'' he wrote. ``And stand there. And stand there. Throw some dust from the vacuum in the air every once in a while. Voila! You are experiencing Kuwait.''  Other e-mails described tenser times. Take the one he wrote on July 24, 2006, about one of the first times he found himself under fire. ``All of the sudden . . . BOOM! . . . our radios were filled with shouts of `incoming!' '' he wrote. ``We took three mortars in close.''  Later in that same e-mail, however, Major Mundell made clear that despite the danger, he was committed to his duty. He wrote:       This is the most intense, most REAL thing I have ever done      in my life.  My thoughts and prayers are with Major Mundell's loved ones today, including his wife, Audrey; his daughter, Erica; his sons Ryan, Zach and Dale; his sister and brother-in-law, Deanna and Ken Sofranko; his nephew, Kenny Sofranko; his niece, Taylor Sofranko; his grandmother-in-law, Jesse Edge; his mother-in-law, Carolyn Cundiff; his brother-in-law, Steve Cundiff; his sisters-in-law Angie Allen and Sandi Stout; and many other beloved family members and friends.  Major Mundell's funeral service was held January 14, 2007, at the chapel in Fort Knox. The funeral procession was a mile and a half long, and the Mundell family was overwhelmed at the outpouring of support from the community for their lost husband, father, brother, and friend.  Recalling a conversation with her youngest child, Audrey tells us what his son Dale said upon seeing the crowds. ``Dale asked me, `All of this for my dad?' '' Audrey says. ``And I told him, `Yes, all of this for your dad.' ''  Mr. President, like the hundreds in Fort Knox that day, this Senate wishes to express its deepest gratitude to MAJ Michael L. Mundell for his service. This man, who his wife Audrey describes as ``a soldier through and through,'' gave everything he had to protect his family and his country. Our Nation will forever honor that sacrifice.                     Staff Sergeant John E. Cooper  Mr. President, I wish today to pause in memory of a fallen soldier, SSG John E. Cooper of Flemingsburg, KY. Staff Sergeant Cooper was lost on January 15, 2007, in Mosul, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device set by terrorists went off near his humvee. He was 29 years old.  This was Staff Sergeant Cooper's second tour of duty in Iraq. For his bravery in uniform, he received numerous medals and awards, including the Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart.  Staff Sergeant Cooper, an Army veteran of over a decade, knew from an early age that he wanted to dedicate himself to serving his country. ``He wanted to be a soldier from the third grade on,'' says his mother, Janice Botkin. ``And he was strong enough to pursue his dream of being in the military.''  As a child, John had many interests. In middle school, he became fascinated with Native American culture and found it to be a part of his own family. ``He learned about the Trail of Tears and this sparked his interest in Native Americans,'' says his mother Janice, who is herself of Native American heritage. John later went to several family reunions at Serpent Mound, a Native American site in Adams County, OH.  In high school, John was active in Future Farmers of America and the drama club. He enjoyed being outdoors. The youngest of four children, he loved to spend time with his brother Terrance and his sisters Sherri and Susie.  Because he was the youngest, John got teased a lot, but as the baby of the family, his siblings also spoiled him quite a bit. For instance, every year the Cooper family would travel to Kings Island, an amusement park in nearby Cincinnati.  John graduated from Fleming County High School in 1995, and that September at age 18, fulfilled his childhood aspirations by enlisting in the Army.  ``I remember that he would go running along the country roads to build himself and be ready to pass his physical training when he went into basic,'' says his sister Sherri Springate. ``We're all so proud of him.''  As a soldier, he could ``go places and do things he wouldn't be able to do if he stayed around here,'' says his mother Janice.  A skilled marksman, John served in the Army for 11 years and dedicated himself to making it a career. ``He really liked being a military person,'' says Janice.  Over those 11 years, Staff Sergeant Cooper was deployed to Afghanistan, Korea and the Sinai Peninsula. He had his first tour of duty in Iraq and went to London.  By the time of his second deployment to Iraq, he was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division based out of Fort Bliss, TX. John enhanced his leadership skills by attending the Primary Leadership Development Course and Air Assault School.  Staff Sergeant Cooper's family is in my thoughts and prayers now as I share his story with the Senate. He will be forever loved and remembered by his mother, Janice Botkin; his father, Michael Cooper; his stepfather, Roger Botkin; his sisters, Sherri Springate and Susie West; his stepbrothers Roger Botkin, Jr., and Robert McMillan; his stepsisters Bonita Botkin and Sherry Hilterbrandt; his aunt, Teresa Gates; his grandparents James and Lillian Burke; and many other friends and family members.  On January 28 of last year, Staff Sergeant Cooper's family held a memorial service for John at his alma mater, Fleming County High School. People came from as far away as Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia to pay their respects to this fallen infantryman, and they lined the entrance to the school with American flags in hand.  The example John set for the other soldiers was so remarkable that when the ``History Channel'' joined his unit to capture documentary footage, they selected John's story to follow out of 4,000 men and women. ``They were impressed with his leadership qualities and caring for the men that served under him,'' says his mother Janice.  The ``History Channel'' is still working on the documentary, but they screened some of its footage at a memorial service for Staff Sergeant Cooper in Texas. I am glad they recognized and were able to capture on film the character and abilities of the soldier called ``Coop'' by his Army buddies.  I am sure John's family feels the same way. They and everyone who was lucky enough to know John already realize he was a true hero who was dedicated to his country. Now his heroismhas been documented and preserved for all to see.  ``We're very proud of John, what he did, and who he was,'' says John's mother.  I want her to know that this Senate expresses its deepest gratitude for SSG John E. Cooper's life of service. And we express our deepest gratitude for the Cooper family, for raising a soldier and patriot who answered the call in his country's time of need.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
