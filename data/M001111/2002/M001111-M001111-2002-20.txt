 REID. Senators Chafee, Hutchinson, and Thompson would be before you, and Senator Chafee has 7 minutes. Senator Hutchinson has 25, and Senator Thompson has 20. I would say to my friend from Washington, you have been here for at least 4 hours that I know of. But the point is, we are using up a lot of time with Senator Levin and Senator Sarbanes. They are really entitled to that time only from an equitable standpoint, not from the fact that anyone could object to it.
