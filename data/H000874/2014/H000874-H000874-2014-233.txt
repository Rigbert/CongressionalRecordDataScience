Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the important role that the Boys & Girls Clubs of America play in communities across the country. This week, in celebration of National Boys & Girls Club Week and to highlight their successes in the areas of academic achievement, good character, citizenship, and healthy lifestyles, representatives from Boys & Girls Clubs will be here in Washington for their first annual Boys & Girls Clubs Day of Advocacy.  Mr. Speaker, I was a member of the local Boys Club in my youth, as were many others who have served in government and as leaders in our economy, the law, the arts, the sciences, education, and the military. Like mine, their Boys & Girls Clubs experiences instilled lessons about citizenship, character, and both personal and social responsibility that continue to guide them today in their careers and in their service to our country. Those who participate in the Clubs today are given the opportunity to learn about their country, community, and the world, to develop positive behaviors that nurture a healthy life and outlook, and to challenge themselves as future leaders.  Every year, I am proud to join the Boys & Girls Clubs for their annual gathering, where I have the opportunity to meet those who are named Youth of the Year finalists and hear about their service projects and their aspirations for the future. I look forward to joining them again this year to reflect on my own experiences as a Boys & Girls Club alumnus and to meet the next generation of leaders for our country.  Frederick Douglass, from my State of Maryland, once said: ``It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.'' This continues to be the guiding principle behind the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. It is more than an organization; it is a movement to inspire young people to recognize the potential in themselves and the contributions they can make as members of their communities, as citizens of our country, and as citizens of the world.  I join once again in saluting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America for the extraordinary work they do across our country every day. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking the organization and in sending a strong message of support for our Nation's youth.                          ____________________
