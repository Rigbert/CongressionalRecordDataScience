Mr. Speaker, I want to bring the attention of my colleagues to a new study. The study details the effect of modern logging techniques under the State of Alaska's Forest Practices Act on fish streams throughout Alaska.  This is a significant study. It shows that Alaska can handle forest management to protect fish and fish streams. It shows that logging under State standards does not have an adverse impact on fish habitat and stream conditions. It shows that logging on State and private land in Alaska is compatible with fisheries protection.  The study is one more reason why Alaskans should be given a chance to elect to own and manage the Tongass National Forest, which is what my bill, H.R. 2413, proposes. If Alaskan policies and rules are achieving these results, the State ownership of the Tongass will more than protect fish streams when timber harvesting is involved. And Washington, DC policies and programs can stay where they originate--inside the Washington, DC beltway.  The study was conducted by an Alaska Native corporation, Sealaska, on land managed under State law. Alaska State law requires 66-foot or 100-foot no timber harvest buffer zones around fish streams.  What distinguishes this study from many others is that it relies on actual stream surveys taken over a 3-year period, 1992-94, in timber harvest areas and unlogged areas. The group conducting the study actually went out and collected real data, something that our Federal researchers in the Forest Service should note.  Stream health was analyzed in 10 basins and the conclusion was that the changes comparing logged and unlogged basins was not discernible. Where disturbances have occurred, they have not resulted in fish stream productivity.  The article from this month's Resource Review that discusses the study follows my remarks. What this teaches is that States can effectively manage resources within their boarders. In my view Alaskans should be given the chance to manage the Tongass and other States or local governments should be given lands within their boarders.  Management decisions and policies made by the people and closest to the people--outside of the influence of Washington, DC--are the best management decisions and policies.Multi-year Study Concludes Alaska's Forest Practices Act Protects Fish,                              Stream Habitat       A recent multi-year study has concluded that modern logging      operations adhering to the guidelines of the Alaska Forest      Practices Act (FPA) do not have an adverse impact on fish      habitat and stream channel conditions.       Prepared by Pentec Environmental for Sealaska Corporation      and the Alaska Forest Association, the report evaluates the      effectiveness of the FPA in protecting fish habitat and      channel conditions. The report consolidates the findings of      1992, 1993 and 1994 monitoring studies and is part of a      continuing investigation that will provide information on FPA      effectiveness in both the short and long term.       The FPA specifies best management practices (BMP) for      loggers to follow in preventing significant adverse effects      from timber harvest activities on habitat and water quality.      In 1992, Pentec was contracted to develop and implement a      monitoring program to collect data on fish habitat and      channel conditions from streams in forested lands of coastal      Alaska. The objectives of the monitoring program were to      determine whether fish habitat conditions have changed as a      result of forest practices and whether habitat quality has      been significantly affected by timber operations.       From 1992 and 1994, stream surveys were conducted in      selected timber management areas of Southeast Alaska, the      Kenai Peninsula and Afognak Island. Stream basins with      varying levels of timber harvest were surveyed during each      year, and annual surveys were repeated on several streams.       The results of the Pentec study are based on three years of      data that was collected within one of seven years following      initiation of timber harvest activities. The data was      collected from over 27 miles of streams in 10 different      basins.       The report finds the only change that is certain is the      increase in large woody debris (LWD) from the riparian buffer      in some logged streams as a result of blowdown. The increased      LWD is not expected to have a negative effect on fish habitat      because the channel changes are local and the amount of      stream length affected in small.       The study found that other habitat conditions have changed      in stream reaches of both logged and unlogged basins, but the      magnitude and direction of these changes are not discernible      at this time. The monitoring results suggest no large habitat      disturbances have occurred to date and that any disturbances      that may have occurred are relatively subtle. None of the      changes have occurred at a level large enough to affect fish      productivity.                          ____________________
