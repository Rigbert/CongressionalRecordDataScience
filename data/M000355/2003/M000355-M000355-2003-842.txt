 President, let me also say that had Senator Dole not recruited my wife to come into government, I never would have met her. So in addition to all of her substantial accomplishments, she also has made extraordinarily good hiring decisions over the years and brought outstandingpeople to Washington, and particularly outstanding women.  We are here today to listen to her maiden speech. She enters the Senate with an extraordinary record, as the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, that goes far beyond what most of us did when we came here. She has already made an important contribution to this body.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
