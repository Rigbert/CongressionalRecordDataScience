 The Deal substitute does not represent real food stamp reform. Rather than allowing States to harmonize AFDC and food stamp rules for those families receiving assistance from both programs, the substitute clings to the waiver system. Rather than taking the food stamp program off of automatic pilot, the Deal substitute continues the pattern of ever escalating runaway costs. Rather than demanding workfare for able-bodied people, the substitute simply mandates that States do provide the make-work jobs and training, but provides, really, less than half the money. It is an unfunded mandate.  But here is the real deal, I did not know this, I read the CBO report: The Deal substitute would count:  Benefit payments from the AFDC and food stamp programs would be included in income subject to income tax. You are taxing food stamps? That is a mean deal.
