The Senate had full knowledge of CBO's interpretation and cost estimate when it negotiated a bipartisan amendment that became the text of the final bill. We chose not to modify the provisions relating to the application of benefits under PRWORA, thus retaining the language that permits coverage under ICHIA of individuals with RPI, Blue Card, or V-visa status.  During the negotiations, the Senate did accept an amendment which states that ``No officer or employee of the Federal Government may waive'' compliance with PRWORA, or the bill's prohibition on accessing benefits that are defined and implemented in PRWORA. But these provisions, too, are inapplicable to a State's option under ICHIA. As my colleague Senator Rockefeller mentioned before, the ICHIA option is not a product of PRWORA. It exists as an independent right under the Social Security Act and is therefore unaffected by this section.
