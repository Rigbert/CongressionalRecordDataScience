Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1670 will expand the boundary of Fort Matanzas National Monument in the State of Florida by approximately 70 acres. The monument was established by Presidential Proclamation in 1924 under the Antiquities Act. The two tracts of land, which are adjacent to the monument boundary, were donated to the United States in the mid-1960s. A third tract of land comprising 1.6 acres was erroneously omitted from the legal description of the monument at the time of its creation. However, it has been managed as part of the monument despite the fact that the United States does not hold title, although the local tax assessor regards it as Federal property. S. 1670 will expand the monument boundaries to include these three parcels. I urge support of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
