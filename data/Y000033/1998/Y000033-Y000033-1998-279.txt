Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Endangered Species Consolidation Act which is a very simple, good government bill. This bill will reduce the number of federal agencies with direct responsibility for implementing and enforcing the Endangered Species Act.  The Endangered Species Act was originally enacted in 1973 to provide a federal program to insure that our plant and wildlife resources were protected from extinction. The Endangered Species Act or ESA as it is more commonly called, divides responsibility for its implementation and enforcement between two different federal agencies in two separate federal Departments. The Fish and Wildlife Service within the Department of the Interior is the primary federal agency with responsibility for enforcing the law. The 1997 budget for direct endangered species enforcement within the Fish and Wildlife Service is approximately $80 million. The Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for listing and developing rules to protect all land based endangered or threatened species and all fresh water fish.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce has responsibility to implement and enforce the Endangered Species Act when it involves fish in the oceans or which migrate to the oceans, as well as marine mammals and sea turtles. Their annual buget is approximately $20 million.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has approximately 800 employees assigned to protect endangered species, while the National Marine Fisheries Service has approximately 270 employees assigned to protect endangered species.  With the listing of various species of salmon which can migrate hundreds of miles inland to spawn, the jurisdictional reach of the National Marine Fisheries Service now overlaps that of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Many companies and individuals are being required to obtain permits for land based activities from both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service for the same activities because of the presence of species that are under the regulation of both agencies. In addition, federal agencies that impact endangered species must conduct consultations with both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service in many cases. For example, a timber company in Washington with land adjacent to a stream where salmon migrate and with spotted owl habitat will have to obtain a permit from both agencies to conduct its business.  Having two agencies with overlapping responsibility is a waste of taxpayer funding and takes away resources that can be spent directly on species recovery.  This bill would simply transfer authority for enforcement of the Endangered Species Act to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Marine Fisheries Service would continue to regulate all other fishing activities and fisheries management, as well as continuing to protect all marine mammals.  Under the ESA, all federal agencies are required to use their resources and authorities to protect endangered species. Whenever the actions of any federal agencies are likely to impact an endangered speices, that federal agency is required to enter into a consultation with the federal agency that has primary responsibility for endangered species--The Fish and Wildlife Service, except when the species is one under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service. In that case, the agency must consult with NMFS. This duplication of effort and overlapping of responsibility has become very burdensome, expensive, and time consuming, not just for private citizens but for federal agencies as well.  It is time for us to consolidate the ESA functions of these two agencies into one primary agency. This means that when the NMFS will conduct an activity that affects an endangered species, such as issuing fishing permits, it will also be required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service, to insure that its activities do not harm those species.  This bill will save time and money for everyone involved in protecting endangered species and most of all will give the taxpayers the most and best conservation for our taxpayer dollars.                          ____________________
