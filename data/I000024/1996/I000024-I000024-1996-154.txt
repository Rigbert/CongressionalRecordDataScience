I cannot think of anything more valuable when you are talking about tradeoffs than defending the lives of Americans.  The reason I brought up the thing in Oklahoma City was I was there for the 168 people who were killed, and many were dear friends of mine. The point there is that the smallest warhead known could kill 1,000 times that many. That is a real threat to Americans.
