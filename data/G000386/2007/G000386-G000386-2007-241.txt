''  Now, when they use the term the ``nation's wealthiest households,'' remember that was the whole concept of the alternative minimum tax in the first place, in 1969, to tax a few thousand people with this tax, and now they are not even being hit by it.  I will bet you, you could have this surtax, and you are still going to find people who can hire the best lawyers to avoid paying that tax. When I say ``avoid paying that tax,'' I mean avoid paying that tax in a legal way, not in a way that is extralegal.  There are two basic proposals that have been laid out in that Washington Post article. One of them, put forward by a member of the Ways and Means Committee of the other body, would use a 4.3 percent surtax on income over $500,000 to offset the elimination of the alternative minimum tax for people earning less than $250,000 a year.  Now, it is estimated in the article that the surtax of 4.3 percent would affect about 1 million families. It is also suggested the alternative minimum tax bills would be decreased for families earning between $250,000 and $500,000 yearly as part of this option. Now, I am not sure how individuals would be treated in this plan.  Interestingly, immediately after the insistence that this option enjoys a great deal of support, the article notes that details of the plan have yet to be released. In the tax world, the devil, of course, is in the details. So I am curious as to exactly what it is that is enjoying this broad political support.  I will note that Ways and Means members have now denounced--now denounced--this label they have applied to this 4.3 percent tax. They have denied the ``surtax'' label.  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to prove what I said, that an article from Tax Notes Today be printed in the Record. That is a publication dated June 13, 2007.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From Tax Analysts, Tax Notes Today, June 13, 2007]       Ways and Means Democrats Take Offense to Notion of Surtax       Both House Ways and Means Committee Chair Charles B.      Rangel, D-N.Y., and committee member Richard E. Neal, D-Mass.      have said that while their plan to reform the alternative      minimum tax will likely be paid for by increasing taxes on      the wealthiest taxpayers, claims that they plan to create a      ``surtax'' on the rich are unfounded.       ``We have not agreed to any surtax,'' Rangel told reporters      June 12. ``But that might be another way to say that we're      going to adjust the rates to make up for what we don't raise      in terms of all the loopholes and knocking out credits and      looking for this $340 billion [in the tax gap].''       Neal also objected to the notion of a surtax in comments to      Tax Analysts on June 11, although he did not completely rule      out the possibility of using the proposal when his plan is      finally introduced.       ``Obviously we're going to ask 1 million people to help pay      for tax relief for 92 million people,'' Neal said.       The idea of a surtax to pay for the Democrats' AMT reform      proposal was first proposed in a May 23 Urban-Brookings Tax      Policy Center paper in which Len Burman and Greg Leiserson      argued that the AMT should be repealed and replaced with a      surtax of 4 percent on adjusted gross incomes above $100,000      for singles and above $200,000 for married couples. That      change would lead to a more progressive tax system and would      be approximately revenue neutral over 10 years, they said.      (For the paper, see Doc 2007-12677 or 2007 TNT 102-36.)       Although the details of the Democratic AMT plan have not      been released, subsequent media reports have claimed that      Ways and Means Democrats plan to employ a surtax in their      effort to comply with House ``pay as you go'' budget rules.       House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., acknowledged      that the idea of a surtax is under consideration by the Ways      and Means leaders, but said he was unwilling to ``prejudge''      whether Democrats in the chamber would ultimately support      that proposal. He added.that pay-go rules will require      lawmakers to make difficult choices when it comes to      offsetting the costs of any AMT reform legislation.       ``What we want to do is fix the AMT permanently and fix it      in a way that does not add to the deficit,'' Hoyer said. ``We      adopted pay-go. We believe in pay-go.''       Rangel and Neal have also repeatedly said that they are      committed to complying with pay-go rules, and Rangel said all      revenue-raising options are on the table.       ``There's nothing we're not considering in terms of raising      revenue to take care of the AMT and expand the child      credits,'' said Rangel.       Rangel's committee is expected to mark up its AMT reform      legislation in July, with House floor consideration likely to      come the same month. The committee's AMT plan is expected to      exempt from the AMT taxpayers earning less than $250,000.      Those earning above $500,000 would see an increase in their      AMT liability, while taxpayers earning between $250,000 and      $500,000 would see a reduced AMT liability. Several other      proposals to benefit lower-income taxpayers--including      expansion of the earned income and child tax credits--are      also expected to be part of that proposal.
