This significant milestone is a testament to the highly skilled, top notch workforce marking this accomplishment today at the Naval EOD Technology Division.  The MTRS is a two-man portable robotic system used in both peacetime and wartime operations by EOD technicians to perform remote reconnaissance of unexploded ordnance and improvised explosive device, IED, incident sites. These EOD Robots are keeping EOD technicians alive and are mitigating the effects of emplaced IEDs and unexploded ordnance encountered in a wide variety of operational environments around the world. By using replaceable robots, EOD operators can effectively conduct and complete highly hazardous missions while remaining in a protected position, minimizing human exposure and time-on-target.  While no machine can replace a trained EOD technician, EOD personnel have embraced the ability of these robots to assist them in carrying out their important mission. Indeed, because of these robots, many of our EOD technicians have significantly reduced or avoided serious risk to themselves and their colleagues in military service.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to the brave men and women willing to risk their own lives for this Nation by serving in our active military forces. While we can never fully repay that debt, we can demonstrate our gratitude by providing our military forces with advanced technology to ensure their safe return to their loved ones. Those responsible for delivering MTRS have been working to do just this.  Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members join me in congratulating this outstanding Navy team as they celebrate the successful delivery of the 1000th Man Transportable Robot System to our deployed military forces.                          ____________________
