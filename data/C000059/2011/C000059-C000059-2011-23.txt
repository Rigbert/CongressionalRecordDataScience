Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a recent article in the Riverside Press Enterprise about E-Verify and the new California state law that will prevent cities and counties from requiring businesses to use E-Verify. It is disappointing that when so many other states are moving towards mandating E-Verify, California is going in the opposite direction. With unemployment at 12.1 percent in California, preventing cities and counties from using E-Verify to ensure local residents have an opportunity to work makes no sense. Instead, the state is protecting illegal immigrants who are employed illegally. Furthermore, federal law already requires businesses to hire a legal work force; allowing the use of E-Verify simply gives employers the tool to ensure they can comply with existing law.  Again, many of us in California are outraged by Governor Jerry Brown's decision to sign this bill and deny cities and counties their right to require use of the E-Verify program. It is telling that the Governor decided not to issue a statement announcing the signing of the legislation. The E-Verify program is overwhelmingly popular, with over 80 percent of Americans supporting its mandatory enactment. The Governor is wrong on this issue and I support local cities and counties that choose to challenge the constitutionality of this law.               [From the Press Enterprise, Oct. 20, 2011]            Region: Cities Scramble in Wake of E-Verify Bill                           (By Kevin Pearson)       A number of Inland cities may be forced to repeal      ordinances requiring businesses to verify that employees are      not undocumented immigrants, now that the state has      prohibited cities from mandating use of the federally run E-     Verify system.       The law that was signed this month and goes into effect      Jan. 1 left cities with few other options, but it has stoked      the debate on both sides of the issue about the state's role      in immigration issues.       E-Verify, created in 1996 by Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Corona, is      operated by the Department of Homeland Security. It can be      used to ensure that an employee has the legal right to work      in the United States.       The new state legislation does not prohibit businesses or      government entities, including cities and counties, from      using E-Verify; it does prohibit making E-Verify's use a      requirement to do business within those cities our counties.       In the past year and a half, Temecula, Murrieta, Lake      Elsinore, Hemet, Menifee, Wildomar, Norco and San Bernardino      County have passed ordinances requiring businesses to use the      system, to varying degrees. The Inland area is home to the      majority of municipalities in the state with such ordinances.       The state law comes as a bill is making its way through      Congress that would require every business in the nation to      use E-Verify, signaling that the issue between cities, states      and the federal government may just be getting started.       ``Right now, across America, various states and local      governments are enacting mandatory E-Verify,'' Calvert said      in a statement. ``Meanwhile, California is going the other      way . . . and in fact the Governor is signing laws to preempt      the use of E-Verify. This is an outrage.''                            CITIES AFFECTED       When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill last week, he      released no signing statement and the move largely flew under      the radar. But the text of the bill cited the costs that      businesses incur to implement the system, and concern about      the accuracy of the system.       Though E-Verify is free to use, the bill noted that there      could be a significant cost to businesses in staff time and      other resources. And while Calvert's office boasts that E-     Verify is 99.5 percent accurate, other studies have      questioned that figure.       As word spread about the new bill, cities in Riverside      County began working on how to react. Officials in some of      those cities said     they are still having internal discussions among city and      legal staff.       City leaders said it is likely that most of the city      councils will be asked to repeal the ordinance. Another      option is a legal battle, but officials said that would be an      unlikely choice because of costs.       In Temecula and Murrieta, there have been no reports of      immigration violations since the E-Verify ordinances went      into place. Staff for both southwest Riverside County cities      said they did not view illegal immigration as a major issue      in their towns.       ``When you look at the whole issue, it's a federal issue,''      Temecula Deputy City Manager Grant Yates said. ``When you      look at actions across the country . . . the frustration is      that at the federal level we don't have clear direction.''       In Hemet, the city passed its ordinance in June and just      recently got new business license paperwork with the E-Verify      information on it. Staff members are now instructing      applicants to ignore that language.       ``California is a dysfunctional state and therefore it      makes it difficult on local governments to implement this and      a host of other issues,'' said Brian Ambrose, a Senior      Management Analyst with the city of Murrieta. ``Does this      surprise me? No.       ``The state legislature passed this bill, and if that's the      legislature and governor's desire, we are content to do what      they wish. (But) this is absolutely far from over.''                             FEDERAL ISSUE?       Many local city officials said they will keep a close eye      on the federal push for the E-Verify system because they      believe the federal government should be the one making the      final decision on immigration issues.       Kathleen Kim, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los      Angeles who specializes in immigration issues, said E-Verify      should be dealt with on the national level and that asking      private businesses to run immigration checks blurs the line      between the public and private sector.       ``I think the workplace should not be the location for      immigration enforcement,'' Kim said. ``E-Verify and the      controversy over it is an example of why immigration      enforcement should be taken out of the workplace and put in      the hands of trained officers.       ``This attempt to privatize immigration enforcement in the      workplace can never find a comfortable solution.''       Republican State Sen. Bill Emmerson said he opposed the      state bill and that it goes against Brown's campaign for      governor, during which he said he wanted to shift power to      local agencies. Emmerson, whose 37th District includes Hemet,      Menifee, Lake Elsinore, Moreno Valley and Corona, said he was      surprised by the bill.       ``It's another case of the state stepping in and not      allowing local governments to use the tools available to      them,'' Emmerson said. ``To say they can't use a federal      program seems not fair.       ``The federal government has to be the level of government      that steps up and makes the fix so states have a clearer      policy of what to do.''
