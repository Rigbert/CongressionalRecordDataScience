President, I want to take a moment to recognize the achievements and contributions of a remarkable educator, a personal friend, and a celebrated leader in my home State of Vermont.  For decades, David Wolk has successfully distinguished himself as an educator and public servant to the people of Vermont. Now in his 11th year as president of Castleton University, formally known as Castleton State College, David likes to call Castleton ``the small college with a big heart.'' As the longest serving president in its history, he has increased the college's involvement in the community and has expanded the university's commitment to civic engagement and service among students and faculty alike. His personal commitment to his hometown of Rutland, VT, is evidenced through his service as a former State senator and current role as a local justice of the peace.  As David has emboldened Castleton's primary mission to serve Vermonters, the institution has forged new partnerships and expanded its opportunities to reach far beyond its footprint in Rutland County. David's leadership is currently enabling the Castleton Polling Institute, which conducts surveys for Vermont politicians and media outlets, to expand to a national audience. Meanwhile, the Castleton Center for Schools continues to serve hundreds of Vermont educators by offering advanced continuing education opportunities each summer. Under his leadership, Castleton athletics has expanded from 12 sports at his inauguration to 27 varsity offerings, enabling Vermont students to play Division III sports. Most recently, David has provided the vision and guidance for Castleton to undergo its own transformation as the college seeks to grow its prestige and opportunities as newly named Castleton University.  David held a distinguished career in education even before stepping foot at Castleton. He served as chief of policy for former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and as the Vermont commissioner of education. Dedication to his native community of Rutland may also be witnessed by his impressive resume as a school principal, superintendent of the Rutland City Public Schools, a guidance counselor and teacher, and a college instructor. He has also served as a member of numerous boards, including the Vermont Business Roundtable, the Vermont Public Education Partnership, and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation. In recognition of these achievements, he received the 2009 Eleanor M. McMahon Award for Lifetime Achievement from the New England Board of Higher Education.  If his career is not inspiration enough, David's commitment to family surely is. The proud father of four children, David led his family through the celebration of the life and legacy of his wife, Diane, when she passed away this summer, nearly a decade after being diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. A lifelong educator herself, Diane and David, together, gave more to their community than most. And David's compassion and commitment to Diane leaves a lasting impression on those of us who call him a friend. Marcelle and I admire him.  In recognition of David Wolk's service and resiliency, I ask unanimous consent that Terri Hallenbeck's article from the August 26, 2015, edition of Seven Days be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From Seven Days, Aug. 26, 2015]          Resilient David Wolk Champions Castleton University       Between the playing fields that serve the Castleton      Spartans, a marble monument tells the story of the Greek king      Leonidas and how he bravely resisted an army of invaders.       David Wolk chose the 22,000-pound stone from a Rochester      quarry and had it polished and engraved in Barre. As      Castleton's longest-serving president and its cheerleader-in-     chief, he hoped the monument's message, titled ``Spartan      Pride,'' would inspire students. He installed it six years      ago, just after the college football team's inaugural season      in a brand-new stadium.       Players quickly made the monument the focus of a new      Castleton tradition, stopping to touch it on their way to      practices and games. It offers no guarantees of victory on      the field but is an apt symbol for the little college's      fighting spirit to survive--and make a name for itself--in      the increasingly competitive world of higher education.       For the past 14 years, Wolk has labored to transform      Castleton from a tiny, isolated college into a growing      university with adequate funding, marketable programs and      satisfied students. Last month, it got a new name: Castleton      State College became Castleton University.       ``Not a lot of colleges are planning on increasing their      enrollment these days,'' said Vermont State Colleges      chancellor Jeb Spaulding, who oversees Castleton and four      other state colleges. ``Dave's different. His plan is, `I'm      building something that's attractive.' ''       ``He's the pied piper of Castleton and Rutland County.''       Just as impressive is the fact that 62-year-old Wolk      managed to remake Castleton while he waged another, personal      battle. Beneath the engraved tale of the Spartan king,      there's a hint at that story, too. In small type at the      bottom of the rock, it reads, ``In honor of Dr. Diane Wolk.''       Wolk's life is so intertwined with his work at Castleton      that he brought in this monument, at his own expense, not      just to create a Castleton tradition, but as a tribute to his      wife. Diane Wolk was a longtime teacher, school principal,      chair of the State Board of Education and one-time director      of student teaching at Castleton. She was diagnosed with      early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 2007, on her 57th      birthday, four years after she first started noticing      symptoms.       David Wolk watched in awe as his wife accepted her fate and      even strove to demystify     the cruel disease. In 2008, she rallied 400 friends to take      part in a ``Walk With Wolk'' Alzheimer's fundraiser, and,      while the disease had already started to affect her mind, she      addressed the crowd. Quoting Lou Gehrig, she said she felt      like the luckiest person in the world.       ``She just stood up and was very brave,'' Wolk recalled.      ``The monument is a testament to a woman who had a lot of      courage.'' Diane Wolk died last month.                         ``The Castleton Way''       Tony Volpone was the football coach for opposing Endicott      College when his team visited Castleton State College in      2013. Endicott defeated Castleton 43-7 that day, but the      ``losing'' side left an indelible impression on Volpone.       He saw a stately new stadium filled with an enthusiastic      crowd, a marching band, fans holding tailgate parties in the      parking lot, a bouncy house for kids. And at the end of the      game, the team locked arms and led the crowd in the singing      of the alma mater.       ``I was so impressed with what I saw,'' Volpone said. ``It      made me go, `Wow, I could really see myself here.' '' A year      later, he became Castleton's head coach. Volpone credits Wolk      for the scene that sold him.       For most of those home-game Saturdays, Wolk is in the      crowd, beaming, with his soon-to-be-96-year-old father,      Arthur. ``It's a beautiful thing,'' he said. It's what Wolk      envisioned when he became Castleton president in 2001 and set      in place a 10-year plan to boost the college's profile.       Wolk was uniquely positioned when he took the job running      the public college in his native Rutland County. The son of a      local pediatrician, he graduated from Rutland High School and      Middlebury College and went on to a career as a teacher,      principal and school superintendent. Wolk also represented      Rutland County for four years in the state Senate, made an      unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 1992 and served      as chief of policy for governor Howard Dean before becoming      state education commissioner.       By the time he took over at Castleton, he had experience      navigating educational and political waters. Wolk also      brought boundless optimism and salesmanship to the job.       Zachary Devoid of St. Albans, a senior computer information      systems major and lacrosse player at Castleton, remembered      meeting Wolk at the start of his freshman year. The president      hosts a barbecue for new students every year at his on-campus      house. Later, when Devoid's lacrosse team was holding an all-     night fundraiser in memory of a student, Wolk came by with      pizza.       ``He eats in the dining halls. He goes to sporting      events,'' Devoid said. ``He's very personable.''       ``At orientation last year, he shook everybody's hand and      introduced himself. It was really cool,'' said Cassie      Papandrea, a senior English major from Orwell who was on      campus last month getting ready for this year's orientation.       Spaulding said he visited Wolk at Castleton recently and      went off on his own to the gym. When he returned to Wolk's      house, he said, ``I asked him, `How come all these students      look me in the eye and open the door for me?' He said, `It's      the Castleton way. They have to open doors for people, and      they have to pick up trash.' ''       In fact, there's no rule about acting responsibly, but      Devoid said the campus is so close-knit that people just do.       Wolk has created a campus atmosphere that makes students      want to stay, said Scott Giles, president of Vermont Student      Assistance Corp., whose organization administers college      loans and interacts with a wide variety of colleges. Although      its student-retention rate hasn't budged much in the last      decade--it's average, at 73 percent--Castleton's six-year      graduation rate has climbed by nearly 10 percent. Enrollment      has grown from 1,598 in 2000 to 2,183 last year. The goal is      to reach 2,500 by 2023.       Students, faculty and outsiders have noticed a difference.       ``Castleton has been one of the real success stories,''      Giles said, likening its emergence to Champlain College's      transformation from a two-year to a four-year school a decade      and a half ago.       ``Dave has been really, really successful in taking an      institution that had a reputation as something of a suitcase      college--where you can get a solid degree but you leave to do      other things on the weekend,'' Giles said. ``What he's really      done is transform the campus. It's a community that meets a      student's full range of needs.''                              Double Duty       Not every faculty member was convinced Castleton needed      football, according to Louis ``Tersh'' Palmer, a union rep      and English professor. Some ``would like to see more emphasis      on academics,'' he said, and ``throw all the rest of that      stuff out.''       The football program has had some problems. In 2011, its      first coach was forced to resign after allegedly violating      National Collegiate Athletic Association rules by arranging      loans for an athlete. In 2013, six players were suspended      from the team following a scheme to steal sporting goods from      a store.       In both cases, Wolk publicly acknowledged the fumbles and      recovered the ball. ``We will stay positive and upbeat as we      move forward together as a family,'' he said in response to      the 2013 case.       He took the same approach to his wife's illness. Diane      Wolk, who'd been named the state's teacher of the year in      1984, was the popular principal of Rutland's Northeast      Primary School when Alzheimer's began to manifest itself. In      his Woodruff Hall office, Wolk keeps a photo of her 2006      retirement; it shows his wife surrounded by smiling      children--a happy spin on a somber moment.       Wolk likes to focus on the positive. He hands out cards      printed in Castleton green that say, ``Keep smiling.'' And,      amazingly, it works.       He tried to follow his own advice during the nine-year      ordeal that Wolk calls the ``long goodbye.'' But he also      acknowledged it's been a roller-coaster ride. Asked how he      managed the double duties of handling his wife's illness and      raising the college's profile--two long but very different      journeys--Wolk said candidly, ``I didn't.''       He relied on his team at Castleton, he said, and there were      times he considered quitting to become his wife's full-time      nurse. But as the disease progressed, Wolk realized she      needed professional care. Diane had chosen to move to      Florida, where she could participate in Alzheimer's research      and access different levels of specialized care. Wolk said      his wife actually preferred being far away because it spared      her friends and colleagues the pain of watching her decline.      ``She didn't want to make them sad,'' he said with      admiration. But for Wolk, who visited many weekends, it was a      long haul.       ``I think it's been very difficult,'' said Spaulding, who      served in the state Senate with Wolk in the 1980s. ``But I      think Castleton University is part of his family. It's part      of what's enabled him to continue.''       Wolk confirmed that Castleton was his salvation during that      decade of decline. ``I was able to dive into the college,''      he said. ``It gave new meaning to my life.''       Castleton had 12 athletic teams when Wolk arrived on      campus. It now has 27, which is more than any other Vermont      state college or the University of Vermont. The school is      providing Vermont students with an opportunity to play      college sports in their home state. And they're tuition-     paying students. Because it is Division III, Castleton      doesn't offer athletic scholarships.       The school has added a lot more than sports teams. It has      invested more than $75 million in new construction and      renovations to every building on campus. The college has gone      from offering one master's degree to 10, with plans to add      doctorates in education and nursing practice.       While some Vermont state colleges have endured layoffs,      Castleton has avoided them, according to Wolk. The college      does plan to cut one program next year, though: its      associate's degree in nursing, a program that Vermont      Technical College offers.       Wolk has also launched a variety of branded initiatives      that are generating revenue: The Castleton Polling Institute,      which conducts paid surveys for Vermont politicians and media      outlets, is expanding and going national; the Castleton      Center for Schools brought 800 Vermont teachers to campus      this summer for continuing education; the Castleton Downtown      Gallery showcases art--and the Castleton name--in downtown      Rutland. The university also owns the Spartan Arena at      Rutland's Diamond Run Mall, a public operation that gives      students real-world business experience. The college bought      the building to accommodate its men's and women's hockey      teams, which Wolk started in 2003. When they aren't      practicing or playing there, it's a rental rink and fitness      center.       The income-generating programs have been developed in      response to a shrinking pool of college-age students and      declining state funding. Vermont routinely ranks near the      bottom in state support for its public colleges. This year,      Vermont State Colleges will receive $24.4 million from the      state, which is split equally among the five colleges.      Castleton's allotment pays just 10 percent of its budget.       ``We're getting less money from the state this year than we      got in 2008 or '09,'' Wolk said, and he knows enough about      Vermont politics to realize that is unlikely to change      anytime soon.       The name change is also intended to counteract the lack of      state funding. Wolk said he hopes Castleton University will      attract more out-of-state students, who pay higher tuition.      Currently, 74 percent of its students are in-staters. By      2023, Castleton's goal is to have a 60-40 in-state versus      out-of-state split. Wolk said Castleton's main mission      remains to serve Vermonters but will reflect the reality that      there are fewer college-age students in the state.      Castleton's other programs within the community, including      the polling institute and the Spartan Arena, are examples of      other ways it's contributing to the public good.       Particularly for international students who equate the word      ``college'' with high school, the ``university'' designation      should send a clearer message. Castleton had 25 students from      other countries last year and expects 50 this year, Wolk      said. The college upped its overseas admissions efforts by      hiring a Chinese-American recruitment coordinator and making      two trips to China last year, he said. As part of a      residency, 13 Chinese scholars are due on campus this fall.       During the 15 years he's taught at Castleton, English prof      Palmer has seen enrollment and programs expand and the      quality of students grow. ``There really has been an      improvement in morale, in offerings,'' he said. Football, he      acknowledged, helped.                        What's in a Name Change?       As Vermont's colleges struggle with dwindling resources and      occasional layoffs, can     the state afford to keep all five alive--plus the University      of Vermont? In a recent commentary, Hinesburg author Bill      Schubart took on the issue, arguing, ``Vermonters can't      adequately fund six colleges in a time of declining      enrollments.'' He contended that renaming Castleton was not      the answer.       ``I really doubt that their new name will do much to solve      the enrollment and cost challenges facing all our small state      colleges, to say nothing of our students,'' he said.       Spaulding, who took over as chancellor last year, said he's      heard all of those arguments before, but he sees no reason to      consolidate. ``We actually need the colleges we have,'' he      said.       Spaulding argued that Castleton's name change will be good      for all of them, adding that none of the other college      administrators objected.       Each of the state colleges has--and should have--its own      identity, Spaulding said. Lyndon has the largest percentage      of out-of-staters, a strong meteorology program and an      innovative electronic journalism program. Johnson is known      for external degrees for nontraditional students, social      service programs and the performing arts. The bread and      butter of Vermont Technical College is its two-year      engineering degree. Community College of Vermont offers an      affordable start for students of all ethnicities and      socioeconomic backgrounds.       Castleton's specialty is being less specialized. ``It's a      small university that has a robust graduate program combined      with broad academic programs,'' Spaulding said. ``It's the      only public higher ed institution in Vermont with a football      team, and it's got a very lively campus.''       Wolk acknowledged that the name change is really about      perception.       When Richard Stockton College of New Jersey became Stockton      University this year, the goal was to ``raise the school's      profile, helping it attract faculty, students--especially      graduate and international students--and raise funds,'' the      Philadelphia Inquirer reported.       Massachusetts state colleges changed their names in 2010,      though they retained the word ``state,'' so that Bridgewater      State College became Bridgewater State University.       Castleton students are buying into the idea that Castleton      University carries just a little bit more prestige. ``It      means we're expanding, we're growing,'' said Papandrea.       ``It's going to help the college bring in more students,''      Devoid said. It might look a little jazzier on his resume,      too, he said.       For Wolk, the name change marks a major milestone for      Castleton, which has actually had seven other appellations      since 1787: It's been Rutland County Grammar School, Vermont      Classical High School, Castleton Seminary, State Normal      School at Castleton, Castleton Normal School and Castleton      State Teachers College. The Castleton State College      designation dates to 1962.       ``Modernizing our name reflects who we've become and who we      aspire to be,'' he said. ``It's a wonderful turning point for      a wonderful institution.''       The idea for the name change emerged two or three years ago      as Castleton administrators crafted Wolk's second 10-year      plan. Although he was a driving force behind it, the      visionary president had to miss some of the meetings that      made it happen, during which his staff pitched the idea to      the Vermont State College committees. In the last few months,      as his wife's health worsened, he spent more time in Florida      than Vermont. He was with Diane when she died there on July      4.       ``Our goal was that her death be peaceful and painless,''      he said. ``It was that.'' In the weeks after, Wolk received      hundreds of messages from his wife's former students,      colleagues and friends telling him how much Diane had meant      to them.       ``Kids just loved her,'' said David Blow, a Castleton      journalism professor who had Diane as a first-grade teacher.      His mother, Lucille, who taught alongside her at Barstow      Memorial School in Chittenden, told her son that Wolk's was      the most difficult condolence card she has ever had to write.       When the full Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees      gathered July 23 to make a final decision on the name change,      David Wolk traveled to Montpelier for the meeting. ``I just      wanted to be there, because it was historic,'' he said. The      vote was unanimous. Word went viral as Castleton spokesman      Jeff Weld announced the move on Twitter and Facebook, and the      university's website got more than 10,000 hits.       Afterward, Wolk continued on to Burlington to board a plane      for Florida, where two days later family gathered for a      celebration of Diane's life. In his eulogy, Wolk spoke about      his wife's courage.       ``Her life was full of teachable moments, and this was the      final one,'' he said.       Diane Wolk's family members divided her ashes for each to      scatter as he or she wished. The next week, Wolk returned to      Castleton. That Friday afternoon, he and two of their four      children went to the Spartan monument and spread her remains      at the base of the rock that honors and encourages brave      souls.                          ____________________
