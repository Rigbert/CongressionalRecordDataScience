 Mr. Chairman, I also want to mention in particular the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. McIntyre] and the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner], the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella], the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Wynn], the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Ehrlich] and the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Price] who have joined with us in the offering of this amendment along with, as I said, the other Members from the Atlantic Coast States.  I want to in closing again thank the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Rogers] and the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Mollohan], who have worked very closely, I know, with the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey] and her staff on the nonpoint source pollution, which, of course, is very much a part of the pfiesteria problem so that this is a very closely related issue.  I want to thank Jennifer Miller as well, who has been so conscientious in assisting us to get this agreement.  We thank the gentleman from Kentucky very much, all of us who know that this issue is so critically important to our States, to our people, to the economy as well as the ecology of our waterways and our land.
