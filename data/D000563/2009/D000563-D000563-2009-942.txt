Just a few weeks ago, he had the legislation on credit card reform.  I thank Senator Enzi for making this a true bipartisan effort. We would not be here today without his cooperative effort.  I thank Senator Dodd for invoking the name of our great hero, Ted Kennedy, who started this fight.  In just a few minutes, this Senate will make a historic decision, and I think it will make the right decision. Joe Camel will be given a life sentence and put away forever, and we are going to give our kids and families across America a fighting chance for a better life.  This bill is historic. It has been a long time coming. I thank my colleagues for all their work to make it possible.
