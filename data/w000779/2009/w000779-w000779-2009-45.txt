President, I came to the floor this morning to take a few minutes to reflect on this week's developments on the issue of health care reform. For me, the week began with an inspiring essay by the man who has led the crusade for fixing American health care for more than 40 years, the man who continues to lead this body in our efforts to fix health care. I am referring to the wonderful essay by Senator Kennedy. I encourage all Senators to read his article because, as usual, Senator Kennedy lays out the challenge ahead. He says on the front page of the magazine, ``We're Almost There.'' That might be a little much for some folks, given the developments of the week, but as usual, there is a lot of validity in what Senator Kennedy has written in Newsweek magazine.  There is widespread agreement on some very significant areas of health care policy. For example, we have bipartisan support in the Senate for fundamentally changing the inhumane model of private health insurance.  Today, private health insurance is essentially about cherry-picking. It is about going out and finding the healthy people and sending the sick people over to government programs more fragile than they are. There is widespread agreement that needs to be changed. For example, 15 Senators are on legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate against those with preexisting illnesses. That is a fundamental change, a dramatic change in the way the insurance industry does business. Democrats, Republicans, both major committees--the committee Senator Kennedy chairs, the committee led by my chairman, Max Baucus--Democrats and Republicans support fundamental changes in the way private health insurance operates. If someone had told me 3 years ago that there would be such strong bipartisan support for fundamentally altering the model of how private health insurance is sold in our country, I probably would have asked them what hallucinogenic substance they were smoking. But it is an indication, as Senator Kennedy writes in his article, that we have made a lot of progress.  Suffice to say, as Senator Kennedy notes again, there is a lot of heavy lifting to do. In particular, if we go to the President's Web site, the three areas he is focused on are lowering costs, increasing choices, and maintaining quality. Those are the three areas the President has focused on, very correctly. Those are the three areas on which our President has made clear he is going to spend his political capital. This is what he is going to use his bully pulpit for. This is what he is going to put in these killer hours for. Having met with him recently, I can tell my colleagues that President Barack Obama is making that kind of effort with his political capital, using the bully pulpit, and putting in the hours to get the job done.  With respect to lowering people's premiums and lowering costs, one of the areas the Congressional Budget Office has said will generate real savings in the next few years is increasing individual choice, giving all Americans the opportunity, as we have in the Congress, to choose from a variety of plans--big plans, where we spread cost and risk, where they can't discriminate. When an individual makes a wise selection from one of those plans, the individual puts that money in their pocket. That is what the budget office folks have said they will score as real savings for the system, for people's individual premiums in the next few years.  The challenge for our committees is that in many respects, these bills don't give all Americans free choice. They don't give all Americans the choice the Senator from Virginia has--I note the presence of the distinguished leader from Kentucky--these bills don't give all Americans the kinds of choices we have as Senators. Choice and the requirement that companies compete for people's business is what competition is all about. It is what holding premiums down is all about.  I have developed legislation called the free choice proposal. It protects the employer-based system on which we know well over 150 million Americans rely. It also gives us a chance to improve on it. It creates more options for employers and for employees to hold costs down. For employers, our free choice proposal gives them more leverage with their insurance company so they can tell their insurer: I have done business with you for a lot of years. You better give me a better deal or I will take my business somewhere else.  It also says to an employer--hypothetically, in Virginia, Oregon--if you want to take all of your employees to what is called the insurance exchange, kind of a farmers market arrangement, the employer would have the ability to take their workers to the exchange, and the employer could get a discount for doing that against strengthening the employer's role in the effort to hold down cost.  For the worker, what it means is, for example, in Virginia or Oregon, if your employer's share of your health care coverage is, say, $13,000 and you can find a plan on the insurance exchange for $12,000, the $1,000 goes into your pocket. Again, you get a financial reward for shopping. Members of Congress get to shop. I would like to see everybody get to shop, everybody have those individual choices.  It is also good for the system because right now, really since the 1940s, since the middle of the last century, the individual has been disconnected from the health care system. The individual does not get many choices. Eighty-fivepercent of the employers who offer health care coverage do not offer choice--not because they are evil. They would love to do it. They cannot afford it. The administrative costs are too crushing.  So, again, if we get employers and employees into these larger systems, where they will have clout in the marketplace, there will be the ability for everybody to choose, not just folks who are unemployed or uninsured or small business, but give everybody, over the next few years, the ability to have these choices and be in a position to help drive more competition and more accountability and hold down their premiums in the private sector.  We can do that on a bipartisan basis. We have 15 Senators of both political parties on legislation that does it now. It could fit with the structure of several of the bills that are being considered. We can do this, as Senator Kennedy suggests in his wonderful essay, on a bipartisan basis. Both Democrats and Republicans have a good point.  I believe my party is right on the issue that you cannot fix this system unless you cover everybody. The reason that is the case is, you cannot build a market unless you cover everybody. Unless you cover everybody, there is too much cost shifting. The people who are uninsured shift their bills to the insured.  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--the distinguished leader from Kentucky and I have had this conversation on a number of occasions--they have valid points too. The Congress ought to be very careful about freezing innovation, about restricting private choice, about setting up price controls.  There is the sweet spot for a bipartisan bill: Democrats with good ideas, as Senator Kennedy lays out in his wonderful essay, about expanding coverage; Republicans bringing creative ideas to the table about innovation and choice. Both sides have some valid points. That is what Senator Kennedy is saying in his wonderful essay.  I see the leader on the floor. I hope colleagues will go to our Web site. That is where we lay out this free choice proposal. I think it is consistent with the idea of not blowing up the employer-based system but not saying we cannot improve on it. It gives new tools to both employers and employees to hold down costs. It ensures that all Americans will have choices, not just some.  I submit to colleagues, if folks in Virginia and Kentucky and Oregon come away from this and say that only some people got choices, that is not going to go down very well. Let's do what the President says on his Web site and give all Americans choices--choices such as we have in Congress from these big insurance pools, where you cannot discriminate and you have some leverage in terms of holding costs down.  It has certainly been a tumultuous week on this health care issue. But I hope colleagues, this weekend, will pick up a copy of Newsweek and read the inspiring essay by Senator Kennedy, who has led our body for more than 40 years--led the country--on this issue, and continues to lead us because there is a lot for us to build on now to finally end this injustice that we have not been able to fix our system so we hold costs down and all Americans get good, quality, affordable coverage. We can do it. We can do it this year, on the President's timetable, by working together.  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
