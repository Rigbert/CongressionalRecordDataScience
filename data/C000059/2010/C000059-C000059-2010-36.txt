 Since 1916, Riverside Community College District has served as an institution of higher education in western Riverside County. In 1991, the district created the Norco Campus as an education center to serve the communities of Corona, Norco, Eastvale and areas of Riverside County. When Norco's doors opened in March 1991 there were 3,088 students enrolled. Now, nearly 10 years later, that number has increased to more than 11,000.  Norco College offers a full complement of lower division courses in liberal arts, sciences, humanities and basic skills education, while offering specialist career technical programs in engineering, electronics, computer information systems, architecture, manufacturing, logistics, construction, game simulation and development, and commercial music.  On January 29, 2010, the Norco Campus received approval to become Norco College, thereby establishing it as the 112th college in the California Community Colleges system. And on June 10, Norco College will celebrate 531 students as its inaugural graduating class of 2010.  The process for gaining full accreditation status has been 8 years in the making for Norco, and I commend all those involved for their diligent efforts--including faculty, staff, students and administrators. I assure you, your dedication has not gone unnoticed and has yielded an achievement worthy of your efforts. Congratulations again, on this important milestone in Norco College's history.                          ____________________
