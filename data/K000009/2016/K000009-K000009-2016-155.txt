He handled the ceremony with great dignity, and we send our love and congratulations to his wife, to his family, and to all those who have the pleasure of knowing this really great American.  Congratulations, SEAL Team Member Edward Byers. You distinguished yourself on behalf of the people of your country and for freedom-loving people around our world.  Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Congressional Record two articles about this Toledo native.                 [From The Plain Dealer, Feb. 26, 2016]       Toledo Native Edward Byers Will Be Awarded Medal of Honor                          (By Brian Albrecht)       Cleveland, Ohio.--The rescue of an American hostage in      Afghanistan in 2012 will result in Toledo native and Navy      SEAL Edward C. Byers Jr. being awarded the Medal of Honor by      President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House on      February 29.       The Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator is only the 11th      living service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor for      bravery displayed in Afghanistan.       According to Navy information, Byers was born in Toledo in      1979 and grew up in Grand Rapids, Ohio. After graduating from      Otsego High School, where he played varsity soccer, he joined      the Navy in 1998.       Byers attended hospital corpsman school and also completed      a basic underwater demolition/SEAL course and special      operations combat medic course in 2003.       He went on 11 overseas deployments, including nine combat      tours.       The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed      forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry      and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and      beyond the call of duty.       The mission that lead to his Medal of Honor award involved      the rescue of Dr. Dilip Joseph, an American who was abducted      with his driver and Afghan interpreter in December of 2012.       U.S. intelligence located Joseph in a remote mountainous      area in a small, single-room building, and Byers was part of      the team assigned to the recovery mission.       In a subsequent Navy Interview, Byers detailed his role in      that mission:       ``So that night was December 8 in Eastern Afghanistan, it      was a cool night, we got off the helicopters, did a four- or      five-hour pretty arduous hike through the mountains, and upon      getting to our target building where we assumed the American      hostage was at, our point man Nick Cheque, he was right in      front of me, he saw a guard come out of the door, he engaged      that guard and we started sprinting towards the door.       ``Nick made his way in, and I made my way in right behind      him, and I went down by the wall, and I engaged an enemy by      the backside of the wall. And then I saw another person      moving across the floor, so by the time I got to him he was      on his back and I was able to get down on top of him and      straddle him with my knees, and I had to adjust my night      vision to try to get some facial recognition.       ``At the same time this is happening I'm calling out trying      to find the location of the American hostage. And finally he      spoke up and it was at that time I engaged the person I was      on top of and jumped off, and jumped off of the guy I was on      and jumped onto the doctor who was about three or four, maybe      five feet to my right.       ``The reason I did that is because I was wearing body      armor, so I wanted to protect him from any other potential      threats in the room.       ``Anyone who's been in combat knows that in those moments      you either react, or you get killed.       ``When I did that there was a guy that was right behind him      within arm's reach, who was armed, and I was able to pin that      guy to the wall by his throat, kind-of holding the doctor,      and waiting for my teammates to come in and take care of the      threat that was right next to us. When I was done, I still      laid on top of him, and kept asking him `hey can you walk,'      you know, and `is there anything medically wrong with you,'      because our goal is to bring this guy back alive.       So, he said he was fine, and once we got outside, I noticed      that our medics were working on Nick, and you know, being a      medic myself I passed off the American hostage off to our      other teammates and I went over to work on Nick, and did      resuscitative efforts on him all the way to the hospital,      where he was announced dead there.''       The official citation noted: ``Chief Petty Officer Byers      displayed superior gallantry, extraordinary heroism at grave      personal risk, dedication to his teammates, and calm tactical      leadership while liberating Dr. Dilip Joseph from      captivity.''       Byers said that when he found out he was being awarded the      Medal of Honor, ``I felt very honored and very humbled      because I'm gonna be a representative for the Navy and the      naval special warfare community, and there's a weight that's      carried with that.       ``And that weight is the sacrifices that everybody has made      within this community. Guys like Nick Cheque and all of our      other brothers that have fallen, is it's an affirmation of      the job that we do, and an appreciation of the job we do.''       In the interview, Byers also credited the support of his      family, and noted that when he told his mother about the      award ceremony, ``the first question out of her mouth is `Do      you think I can come to it?' And I said of course, mom, I      think you'll be able to come to it.''       He also noted that his daughter ``knows that I'm daddy, and      she loves me just for that. If you talk to her one-on-one,      she'll tell you all the five nicknames she has for me, and      none of them includes `hero.' ''       He concluded, ``I'm gonna continue to be a SEAL. And I'm      gonna take whatever job or mission is next for me, and just      continue doing that. I don't have any plans on changing my      job at this time. I still love what I do, and as long as I      love what I do I'll continue doing it.''       Byers' personal decorations include the Bronze Star with      Valor (five awards), the Purple Heart (two awards), the Joint      Service Commendation Medal with Valor, the Navy Commendation      Medal (three awards, one with Valor), the Combat Action      ribbon (two awards), and the Good Conduct Medal (five      awards).       He is one of only eight living Navy Medal of Honor      recipients. There are 78 living recipients total.       Ohio has had 319 other Medal of Honor recipients with a      connection to this state, dating back to the Civil War.                           Summary of Action Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Edward C. Byers Jr.: For        actions during Operation Enduring Freedom on Dec. 8, 2012       Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Edward C. Byers Jr.,      United States Navy, distinguished himself by heroic gallantry      as an Assault Team Member attached to a Joint Task Force in      support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM on 8 December 2012.                        specific accomplishment       Dr. Dilip Joseph is an American citizen, who was abducted      with his driver and Afghan interpreter on 5 December 2012.      Intelligence reports indicated that Dr. Joseph might be      transported to another location as early as 9 December 2012.      Dr. Joseph was being held in a small, single-room building.       The target compound was located in a remote area beside a      mountain in the Qarghah'i District of Laghman Province,      Afghanistan. Chief Byers was part of the rescue team that      planned to make entry into the room of guards where the      hostage was believed to be located. Success of the rescue      operation relied upon surprise, speed, and aggressive action.      Trading personal security     for speed of action was inherent to the success of this      rescue mission. Each assaulter in the rescue force      volunteered for this operation with full appreciation for the      risks they were to undertake.       With the approval of the Commander of all International      Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan, the rescue force      launched from its forward operating base. The infiltration      was an exhaustive patrol across unimproved trails and      mountainous terrain. After nearly four hours of patrolling,      the rescue force was positioned to make its assault on the      target compound.       As the patrol closed to within 25 meters of the target      building, a guard became aware of the rescue force. The      forward-most assaulter shot at the guard and ran towards the      door to make entry as the guard disappeared inside. Chief      Byers was the second assaulter in a sprint towards the door.      Six layers of blankets securely fastened to the ceiling and      walls served as the Afghan door. While Chief Byers tried to      rip down the blankets, the first assaulter pushed his way      through the doorway and was immediately shot by enemy AK-47      fire. Chief Byers, fully aware of the hostile threat inside      the room, boldly entered and immediately engaged a guard      pointing an AK-47 towards him. As he was engaging that guard,      another adult male darted towards the corner of the room.      Chief Byers could not distinguish if the person may have been      the hostage scrambling away or a guard attempting to arm      himself with an AK-47 that lay in the corner. Chief Byers      tackled the unknown male and seized control of him. While in      hand-to-hand combat, Chief Byers maintained control of the      unknown male with one hand, while adjusting the focus of his      night vision goggles (NVGs) with his other. Once his NVGs      were focused, he recognized that the male was not the hostage      and engaged the struggling armed guard.       By now other team members had entered the room and were      calling to Dr. Joseph to identify himself. Chief Byers heard      an unknown voice speak English from his right side. He      immediately leaped across the room and selflessly flung his      body on top of the American hostage, shielding him from the      continued rounds being fired across the room. Almost      simultaneously, Chief Byers identified an additional enemy      fighter directly behind Dr. Joseph. While covering the      hostage with his body, Chief Byers was able to pin the enemy      combatant to the wall with his hand around the enemy's      throat. Unable to fire any effective rounds into the enemy,      Chief Byers was able to restrain the combatant enough to      enable his teammate to fire precision shots, eliminating the      final threat within the room.       Chief Byers quickly talked to Dr. Joseph, confirming that      he was able to move. He and his Team Leader stood Dr. Joseph      up, calmed him, and let him know he was safe with American      Forces. Once Dr. Joseph was moved to the helicopter-landing      zone, Chief Byers, a certified paramedic and 18D medic,      assisted with the rendering of medical aid to the urgent      surgical assaulter. Chief Byers and others performed CPR      during the 40-minute flight to Bagram Airfield where his      teammate was declared deceased.       Chief Petty Officer Byers displayed superior gallantry,      extraordinary heroism at grave personal risk, dedication to      his teammates, and calm tactical leadership while liberating      Dr. Dilip Joseph from captivity. He is unquestionably      deserving of the Medal of Honor.                           Official Citation CHIEF SPECIAL WARFARE OPERATOR (SEA, AIR, AND LAND) EDWARD C. BYERS,                          JR. UNITED STATES NAVY       For service as set forth in the following citation:       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of      his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Hostage      Rescue Force Team Member in Afghanistan in support of      Operation ENDURING FREEDOM from 8 to 9 December 2012. As the      rescue force approached the target building, an enemy sentry      detected them and darted inside to alert his fellow captors.      The sentry quickly reemerged, and the lead assaulter      attempted to neutralize him. Chief Byers with his team      sprinted to the door of the target building. As the primary      breacher, Chief Byers stood in the doorway fully exposed to      enemy fire while ripping down six layers of heavy blankets      fastened to the inside ceiling and walls to clear a path for      the rescue force. The first assaulter pushed his way through      the blankets, and was mortally wounded by enemy small arms      fire from within. Chief Byers, completely aware of the      imminent threat, fearlessly rushed into the room and engaged      an enemy guard aiming an AK-47 at him. He then tackled      another adult male who had darted towards the corner of the      room. During the ensuing hand-to-hand struggle, Chief Byers      confirmed the man was not the hostage and engaged him. As      other rescue team members called out to the hostage, Chief      Byers heard a voice respond in English and raced toward it.      He jumped atop the American hostage and shielded him from the      high volume of fire within the small room. While covering the      hostage with his body, Chief Byers immobilized another guard      with his bare hands, and restrained the guard until a      teammate could eliminate him. His bold and decisive actions      under fire saved the lives of the hostage and several of his      teammates. By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting      spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of near      certain death, Chief Petty Officer Byers reflected great      credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the      United States Naval Service.
