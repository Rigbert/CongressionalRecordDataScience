 President, there is no greater threat to our country than that posed by weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear, chemical or biological weapons--perhaps delivered by long-range guided missiles--could cause more destruction in a week or even a day than we suffered in all of the Vietnam war.  The United States has many nonproliferation and counterproliferation programs, but there are cracks in our organization for combating this terrible scourge.  The Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, also know as the ``Deutch Commission,'' has found those cracks.  Yesterday the Commission gave America a blueprint for repairing them. We dare not ignore its analysis, any more than we would ignore termites in our homes.  My colleague and friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, also deserves special recognition today. The Commission was his idea; he secured its establishment and later ensured its continued existence. As Vice Chairman of the Commission, he worked to ensure that its recommendations would be practical and politically feasible.  Today Senator Specter is introducing legislation to implement one of the Deutch Commission recommendations: that we require electronic filing of Shippers' Export Declarations on a secure, Internet-based system.  This legislation will provide more timely and usable data for non-proliferation analysis by executive branch agencies, without causing any significant burden for exporters or endangering the traditional confidentiality of Shippers' Export Declarations.  I am pleased to be an initial cosponsor of this legislation and I am confident that it will be enacted.  Shippers' Export Declarations are already required under chapter 9 of title 13, United States Code. The content of those Declarations is prescribed in part 30 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. This legislation will not require any reporting by industry that is not already mandated under those regulations.  There is also an existing Automated Export System, but its use is voluntary and it has not gained much acceptance. This bill will require that shippers use an Internet-based Automated Export System, once it is certified as being secure and capable of handling the expected volume of information that would be filed.  I want to assure U.S. companies, as I have been assured, that this legislation will not cause difficulties for them. Exporters will have on-line assistance in filing their Declarations and will be able to double-check their Declarations for accuracy after filing them.  In addition, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which maintains the security of unclassified Federal Government communications, must join in certifying that the Internet-based Automated Export System is ready for use and has been successfully tested.  That will ensure the continued confidentiality of these Declarations.  This is hardly a revolutionary bill. Rather, it is one discrete, rational measure that is needed to improve our defense against the spread of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to countries or groups that could otherwise rain chaos and destruction upon our country and the whole world.  We simply must take this step, along with others recommended by theDeutch Commission. For our own sake and for our children's sake as well, we absolutely must respond to the challenge of proliferation.                                 ______                                       By
