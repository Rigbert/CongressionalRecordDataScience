President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution Subcommittee. He has been a leader on this issue and so many other constitutional issues that protect the rights of all of us. He has done that ever since he came to the Senate. I applaud him, not only for what he said here but for his active work in the committee.  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator, and my friend, from Massachusetts.
