 President, today I am introducing three bills to stop the contamination of California's drinking water by the gasoline additive MTBE.  First, I am introducing a bill to allow California to apply its own clean or reformulated gasoline rules as long as emissions reductions are equivalent or greater. California's rules are stricter than the federal rules and thus meet the air quality requirements of the federal Clean Air Act. This bill is the companion to H.R. 11 introduced by Representative Bilbray on January 6, 1998.  MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl either is added to gasoline by some refiners in response to federal requirements that areas with the most serious air pollution problems use what is called ``reformulated gasoline,'' a type of cleaner-burning gasoline. The federal law requires that this gasoline contain 2 percent by weight oxygenate. MTBE has been the oxygenate of choice by some refiners.  The major source of MTBE in groundwater appears to be leaking underground storage tanks. In surface water, it is recreational gasoline-powered boating and personal watercraft, according to the California Environmental Protection Agency.  The second bill requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make petroleum releases into drinking water the highest priority in the federal underground storage tank cleanup program. This bill is needed because underground storage tanks are the major source of MTBE into drinking water and federal law does not give EPA specific guidance on cleanup priorities.  The third bill will move from 2006 to 2001 full implementation of EPA's current watercraft engine exhaust emissions requirements. The California Air Resources Board on December 10, 1998, adopted watercraft engine regulations in effect making the federal EPA rules effective in 2001, so this bill will make the deadline in the federal requirements consistent with California's deadlines. In addition, the bill will require an emissions label on these engines consistent with California's requirements so the consumer can make an informed purchasing choice. This bill is needed because watercraft engines have remained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and up to 30 percent of the gas that goes into the motor goes into water unburned.  These three bills represent three steps toward getting MRBE out of California's drinking water.                Bill 1: The California Clean Gas Formula  The Feinstein-Bilbray bill would provide that if a state's reformulated gasoline rules achieve equal or greater emissions reductions than federal regulations, a state's rules will take precedence. The bill would apply only to states which have received waivers under Section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. California is the only state currently eligible for this waiver, a waiver allowing California to set its own fuel standards. The other 49 states do not set their own fuel specifications.  This bill would exempt California from overlapping federal oxygenate requirements and give gasoline manufacturers the flexibility to reduce or even eliminate the use of MTBE, while not reducing our air quality.  In 1994, the CARB adopted a ``predictive model,'' which is a performance based program that allows refiners to use innovative fuel formulations to meet clean air requirements. The predictive model provides twice the clean air benefits required by the federal government. With this model, refiners can make cleaner burning gasoline with one percent oxygen or even no oxygen at all. The federal two percent oxygenate requirement limits this kind of innovation. In fact, Tosco and Shell are already making MTBE-free gasoline.  In addition, Chevron has said:       MTBE is the best oxygenate of choice for blending CBG      (clean burning gasoline) in California refineries. . . .      However, consistent with our desire to reduce or eliminate      MTBE from cleaner burning gas (CBG), we want the flexibility      to be able to make prudent use of any oxygenate--MTBE,      ethanol, or the use of no oxygenate--while meeting the      emissions performance standards of reformulated gasolines. If      the government allows this flexibility, Chevron would likely      use more ethanol than now to efficiently provide cleaning      burning gasoline.  The legislation allows that companies who serve California's gasoline needs to continue to adopt innovative formulas for cleaner burning gasoline without contaminating the water.  The University of California study, released in November, recommended phasing our MTBE and concluded that oil companies can make cleaner-burning gasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE.               the problem: drinking water contamination  Contamination of California's drinking water by MTBE is growing almost daily. A December 14, 1998 San Francisco Chronicle headline calls MTBE a ``Ticking Bomb.'' The University of California study says, ``If MTBE continues to be used at current levels and more sources become contaminated, the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially groundwater basins, will increase. Severity of water shortages during drought years will be exacerbated.''  In higher concentrations, MTBE smells like turpentine and it tastes like paint thinner. Relatively low levels of MTBE can simply make drinking water simply undrinkable.  MTBE is a highly soluble organic compound which moves quickly through soil and gravel. It therefore poses a more rapid threat to water supplies than other constituents of gasoline when leaks occur. MTBE is easily traced, but is very difficult and expensive to cleanup. The Association of California Water Agencies estimates that it would cost as much as $1 million per well to install treatment technology to remove MTBE from drinking water. Without these funds, the only option is to shut down wells.  MTBE use has escalated from 12,000 barrels a day in 1980 to about 100,000 barrels today, according to CARB. EPA says that about 30 percent of the nation's gasoline is reformulated gas and MTBE is used in about 84 percent of reformulated gasoline. Two-thirds of California's gasoline is subject to the federal oxygenate requirement. This growth in use of MTBE is directly attributable to the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act.                        contamination widespread  A June 12, 1998 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory study concluded that MTBE is a ``frequent and widespread contaminant'' in groundwater throughout California and does not degrade significantly once it is there. This study found that groundwater has been contaminated at over 10,000 shallow monitoring sites. The Livermorestudy says that ``MTBE has the potential to impact regional groundwater resources and may present a cumulative contamination hazard.''  Californians are more dependent on groundwater as a source of drinking water than most Americans. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 69 percent of California's population relies on groundwater as their source of drinking water, while for the U.S. population at large, 53 percent of the population relies on groundwater.  Similarly, the Association of California Water Agencies reports that MTBE has impacted over 10,000 sites.  MTBE has been detected in drinking water supplies in a number of cities, including Santa Monica, Riverside, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sebastopol, Manteca, and San Diego. MTBE has also been detected in numerous California reservoirs, including Lake Shasta in Redding, San Pablo and Cherry reservoirs in the Bay Area, and Coyote and Anderson reservoirs in Santa Clara.  Santa Monica lost 75 percent of its groundwater supply; the South Lake Tahoe Public Utility District has lost over one-third of drinking water wells. Drinking water wells in Santa Clara Valley (Great Oaks Water Company) and Sacramento (Fruitridge Vista Water Company) have been shut down because of MTBE contamination.  In addition, MTBE has been detected in the following surface water reservoirs: Lake Perris (Metropolitan Water District of Southern California), Anderson Reservoir (Santa Clara Valley Water District), Canyon Lake (Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District), Pardee Reservoir and San Pablo Reservoir (East Bay Municipal Utility District), Lake Berryessa (Solano County Water Agency).  The largest contamination occurred in the city of Santa Monica, which lost 75% of its groundwater supply as a result of MTBE leaking out of shallow gas tanks beneath the surface; MTBE has been discovered in publicly owned wells approximately 100 feet from City Council Chamber in South Lake Tahoe; In Glennvile, California, near Bakersfield, MTBE levels have been detected in groundwater as high as 190,000 parts per billion--dramatically exceeding the California Department of Health advisory of 35 parts per billion; and                            dangers of mtbe  The United States EPA has indicated that ``MTBE is an animal carcinogen and has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.''  Studies to assess hazards to animals have found that MTBE is carcinogenic in rodents in high doses. MTBE has been linked to leukemia and lymphomas in female rats and an increase in benign testicular tumors in male rats. Studies of inhalation exposure in rats have also shown increased incidence of kidney, testicular, and liver tumors. Inhalation exposure has also resulted in adverse effect on developing mouse fetuses.  The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services and the Centers for Disease Control monitored concentrations of MTBE in the air and in the blood of humans in 1992 and 1993. Blood levels of MTBE were analyzed in gasoline station and car-repair workers and commuters. People with higher blood levels of MTBE were significantly more likely to report more headaches, eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, burning of the nose and throat, coughing, disorientation and vomiting, compared with those who had lower blood levels. From these studies, EPA concluded, ``MTBE can pose a hazard of non-cancer effects to humans at high doses. The data do not support confident quantitative estimations or risk at low exposure.''     california's regulations can achieve what federal law intends  The federal gasoline oxygenate requirement went into effect in December 1994, affecting areas where the air quality is the worst. Today, reformulated gasoline is required by federal law in the following areas of California:  Year-round: Oxygenates are required to be used in the South Coast Air Basin (the counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernadino, Orange, Ventura) and the Sacramento metropolitan area (which includes all of Sacramento County and portions of Yolo, Placer and Eldorado County).  Wintertime: Oxygenates are required to be added to gasoline in the Southern California Air Basin (the entire counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, and Ventura), Imperial County, Fresno and Lake Tahoe.  While federal Clean Air Act regulations were being promulgated, the California Air Resources Board developed more stringent air standards, using a ``predictive model.''  The Clean Air Act has no doubt helped reduce emissions throughout the United States, but the federal requirements have imposed limitations on the level of flexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to California. The overlapping applicability of both the federal and state reformulated gasoline rules has actually prohibited gasoline manufacturers from responding as effectively as possible to unforseen problems with their product. This bill addresses exactly this type of situation.  This legislation rewards California for its unique and effective approach in solving its own air quality problems by permitting it an exemption from federal oxygenate requirements as long as tough environmental standards are enforced. This bill does not weaken the Clean Air Act, but instead is a step in the right direction, towards sound environmental policy. It is a narrowly-targeted bill designed to make our drinking water clean to drink. With this bill, California is once again taking the initiative to lead the way in ensuring the protection of the air we breath, and the water we drink.  By allowing the companies that supply our state's gasoline to use good science and sound environmental policy, we can achieve the goals set forth by the Clean Air Act, without sacrificing California's clean water.                  california, a leader in air cleanup  California's efforts to improve air quality predate similar federal efforts and have achieved marked success in reducing emissions, resulting in the cleanest air Californians have seen in decades.  Since the introduction of California Cleaner Burning Gasoline program, there has been a 300 ton per day decrease in ozone forming ingredients found in the air. This is the emission reduction equivalent of taking 3.5 million automobiles off the road. California reformulated gasoline reduces smog forming emissions from vehicles by 15 percent.  The state has also seen a marked decrease in first stage smog alerts, during which residents with respiratory ailments are encouraged to stay indoors.  John Dunlap, former Chairman of California's Air Board, who supports this legislation, has said:       . . . our program has proven (to have) a significant effect      on California's air quality. Following the introduction of      California's gasoline program in the spring of 1996,      monitored levels of ozone . . . were reduced by 10 percent in      Northern California, and by 18 percent in the Los Angeles      area. Benzene levels (have decreased) by more than 50      percent.                      this bill should be enacted  There are several reasons to enact this bill:  1. Studies confirm need to eliminate MTBE.  The June 11, 1998 Lawrence Livermore study found MTBE at 10,000 sites and said it is ``a frequent and widespread contaminant in shallow groundwater throughout California.''  A five-volume University of California November 12, 1998 study concluded that MTBE provides ``no significant air quality benefit'' and that if its use is continued, ``the potential for regional degradation of water resources, especially groundwater, will increase.'' The landmark UC study recommended that MTBE use be phased out and that refiners be given the flexibility of the state's clean gas regulations.  2. MTBE is not needed. California can meet federal clean air standards by using our own state clean gas regulations.  The California Air Resources Board has testified that we can have equivalent or greater reductions in emissions and improve air quality using California's regulations. These standards are more stringent than the federal requirements, but offer gasoline refiners more flexibility.  3. MTBE in drinking water poses health risks.  MTBE is an animal carcinogen and a potential human carcinogen. It tastes bad. It smells bad. It may have other harmful human health effects.  4. The dangers of MTBE were not considered when Congress last amended the Clear Air Act in 1990.  According to the Congressional Research Service, during Congress's consideration of the Clean Air Act Amendments, which became law in 1990, there was no discussion of the possible adverse impacts of MTBE as a gasoline additive. Likewise, CARB has said that when they were considering our state's reformulated gasoline regulations, ``the concern over the use of oxygenates was not raised as an issue.''  5. California needs water.  California cannot afford to lose any more of its drinking water. According to the Association of California Water Agencies, by the year 2020, California will be 4 million to 6 million acre-feet short of water each year without additional facilities and water management strategies.  5. Congress has long recognized that California is a unique case.  California's efforts to improve air quality predate similar federal efforts. We have our own clean gas program and U.S. EPA has given the state a waiver under section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act to develop our own program.                           widespread support  I am appending at the end of my statement a list of California local governments, water districts, air districts, statewide and other organizations that support my MTBE bill.                bill 2: stopping underground tank leaks  My second bill will make threats to drinking water the highest priority in the federal underground tank cleanup program at EPA.  In 1986, Congress created a Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, funded by a one-tenth of one cent tax on all petroleum products. These funds are available to enforce cleanup requirements; to conduct cleanups where there is no financially viable responsible party or where a responsible party fails to correct; to take corrective action in emergencies; and to bring actions against parties who fail to comply. There is approximately $1.5 billion currently in the fund.  Under current law, section 9003(h)(3) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, EPA is required to give priority in corrective actions to petroleum releases from tanks which pose ``the greatest threat to human health and the environment,'' a provision that I support. My bill would add simple clarifying language that in essence says that threats to drinking water are the most serious threats and should receive priority attention.  Leaking underground gasoline storage tank systems are the major source of MTBE into drinking water. The June 11, 1998 Lawrence Livermore Laboratory study that examined 236 tanks in 24 California counties found MTBE at 78 percent of these sites. These scientists said that a minimum estimate of the number of MTBE-impacted tank sites in my state is over 10,000. Federal law requires tanks to have protections against spills, overfills, and tank corrosion by December 22, 1998. Tank owners have had ten years to do this. EPA has estimated that half the nation's 600,000 tanks and 52 percent of California's 61,000 complied by the December 22 deadline.  Clearly, stopping these leaks is a big part of the solution of stopping the release of MTBE. Making threats to drinking water a top cleanup priority makes sense since clean drinking water is fundamental to human health.                       bill 3: motorcraft engines  My third bill addresses a third source of MTBE into drinking water--watercraft engines. The Association of California Water Agencies says that MTBE in surface water reservoirs comes largely from recreational watercraft.  In October 1996, U.S. EPA published regulations, starting in model year 1998, requiring stricter emissions controls on personal watercraft engines to be fully implemented by 2006. On December 10, 1998, the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations very similar to EPA's in substance, but accelerating their effective date to 2001, five years earlier. In addition, California added two more ``tiers'' of emissions reductions that go beyond U.S. EPA's, reducing emissions by 20 percent more in 2004 and 65 percent more in 2008. Under the federal requirements, there would be a complete fleet turnover by 2050; in California, there would be a complete fleet turnover in 2024, 26 years earlier.  The federal and the California rules apply to (1) spark-ignition outboard marine and (2) personal watercraft engines, such as motorboats, jet skis and wave runners, beginning in model year 2001.  Outboard engines: In 1990, there were 373,200 gasoline-powered outboard engines in California. California sales of outboard engines represented ten percent of the U.S. market in 1997.  Personal watercraft: California sales of these engines were 12 percent of the 176,000 sales in the U.S. in 1995, numbers which have no doubt grown significantly. Personal watercraft like jet skis have increased by 240 percent since 1990 and these numbers are expected to double by 2020.  We need to curb emissions from these marine engines because (1) unlike automobiles which exhaust into the air, all marine engines exhaust directly into the water, and (2) 20 to 30 percent of the gas that goes in, comes out unburned. According to CARB, these engines ``discharge an unburned fuel/oil mixture at levels approaching 20 to 30 percent of the fuel/oil mixture consumed. This unregulated discharge of fuel and oil threatens degradation of high quality waters . . .'' CARB says that two hours of exhaust emissions from a jet ski is equivalent to the emission created by driving a 1998 automobile 130,000 miles. Some areas are considering banning jet skis and gas-powered boats.  My bill does two things: (1) It would make the EPA's existing regulations effective in 2001, instead of 2006, consistent with California's regulations. (2) It would direct EPA to make one addition to their current regulation, an engine labeling requirement, consistent with California's labeling requirement, designed to inform consumers of the relative emissions level of new engines.  Because these engines put MTBE and other constituents of gasoline into surface waters, I believe we need to accelerate the national rules to discourage people from ``engine shopping'' from state to state and bringing ``dirty'' engines into California. Because my state's relatively mild weather encourages boating, our air board concluded that we need more stringent standards than the national standards. Up to 30 percent of gasoline in these engines comes out unburned. In other words, of 10 gallons per hour used, about two and one half gallons of fuel goes into the water unburned in one hour. This has to stop.  The November 1998 University of California study recognizes the emissions of MTBE into surface waters from watercraft and says that technologies are available that will ``significantly reduce MTBE loading,'' that the older carbureted two-stroke engines release much larger amounts of MTBE and other gasoline constituents than the fuel-injected engines or the four-stroke engines.  Millions of Californians should not have to drink water contaminated with MTBE. I believe we must take strong steps to end this contamination.                          ____________________
