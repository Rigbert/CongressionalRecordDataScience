  First on the slate is Magistrate Judge Robert Wier, selected by President Trump to serve as a district judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky.  Judge Wier's sterling credentials and the support he enjoys from the legal community suggest that he will excel on the Federal bench. He graduated at the top of his class at the University of Kentucky, followed by a successful career in private practice. In 2006, he became a magistrate judge. In 2014, his colleagues unanimously reappointed him to a second term.  Judge Wier has the intellect, skill, and experience to take on this role. I will proudly vote to advance his nomination later today.  Following Judge Wier, we will consider Fernando Rodriguez for the Southern District of Texas and Annemarie Axon for the Northern District of Alabama.  In each case, the Senate's work will be upholding one of our most central constitutional responsibilities--to consider and confirm high-quality candidates.                          ____________________
