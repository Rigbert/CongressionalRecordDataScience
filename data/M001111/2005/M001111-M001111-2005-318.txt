 President, I know there are a number of other Senators who would like to speak. Certainly, I would like to yield to the Senator from West Virginia. Let me say, again, that I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for coming together with us right before the Fourth of July recess. I can't think of a better time for all of us to send an American issue forward and to stand up for our vets. I thank them for working with us.
