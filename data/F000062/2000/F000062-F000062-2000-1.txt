 President, I rise today to pay tribute to John J. Hock, the devoted father of my press secretary Jim Hock.  John Hock will be remembered by friends and family for his deep devotion to his religious faith, family, and football. His family members recall that although he was not one to yell or scream, he always commanded great respect from everyone who knew him. His greatest treasure was his family. Jim always spoke of the selflessness of this father, who even in his last days, wanted to ensure that his family would be taken care of once he was gone.  A natural athlete, Mr. Hock played in the National Footfall League as an offensive tackle for the Chicago Cardinals. During the Korean war, Mr. Hock, a participant in the Olympic trials in the late 1940's, also entertained troops while on USO football teams in Japan. After returning from the Korean war, he was traded to the Los Angeles Rams, where he played as a guard from 1953-1957. As captain of the Santa Clara University's football team, Mr. Hock led his teammates to victory over the top-ranked University of Kentucky in the 1965 Orange Bowl.  During the off-season, Mr. Hock taught high school in Los Angeles to make ends meet. It was while he was working as a teacher that he met his wife, Bernadette. His family remembers how devoted they were to one another. Because her husband was too humble to promote himself, Mrs. Hock carried around his paying cards to give to friends. Their son Joseph put it best when he said that his mother and father were one.  In 1960, his pro-football career over and family growing, Mr. Hock moved into sales and marketing at Western Carloading, a Los Angeles-based trucking and shipping company. From 1988 until this year, he worked as a sales agent for Coldwell Baker Realty in Mahwah, spending his freetime with his grandchildren, his family members said.  He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Bernadette, his sister, Ruth Rahe, his children, Jay, Joseph, Jim, Mary, Susan, Anna, and Lisa, and 11 of his grandchildren.  Mr. President, Mr. Hock will be greatly missed, not because he entertained us, but because he stands as a reminder of the importance of family. As the holiday season draws near, let us all remember what John Hock always knew: Family and friends are truly the sweetest rewards.                          ____________________
