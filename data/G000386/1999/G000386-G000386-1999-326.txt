(B) Rules.--At a minimum, to the extent that it is      determined that notice should be given to a particular      regulatory entity, the rules shall require that the debtor,      in addition to any other information required by section 342      of title 11, United States Code, shall--       (i) identify in the schedules and the notice, the      department, agency, subdivision, instrumentality or entity in      respect of which such notice should be received;       (ii) provide sufficient information in the list or schedule      (such as case captions, permit numbers, taxpayer      identification numbers, or similar identifying information)      to permit the governmental unit or subdivision thereof,      entitled to receive such notice, to identify the debtor or      the person or entity on behalf of which the debtor is      providing notice where the debtor may be a successor in      interest or may not be the same as the person or entity which      incurred the debt or obligation; and       (iii) identify, in appropriate schedules, which shall be      required to be served on the governmental unit together with      the notice, the property, if any, in respect of which any      claim or regulatory obligation may have arisen, and the      nature of the claim or regulatory obligation for which notice      is being given.
