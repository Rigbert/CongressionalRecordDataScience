Mr. Speaker, I have not communicated with the gentleman from Minnesota, because I support what the gentleman wants to do, but I would suggest that if the gentleman from Minnesota and I can reach this agreement, and I am sure we can, we can come out with a resolution out of our committee immediately and bring it to the floor under unanimous consent, because what I think what the gentleman is asking is very legitimate.  I will commit that to the gentleman as chairman of the committee, and I am sure the gentleman from Minnesota and I can work that out. So I give you that commitment.
