Yes, the gentleman from Michigan is correct. This provision is intended to maintain the status quo with regard to existing reserved water rights in the system, and to clarify that reserved water rights previously created at the time of withdrawal of these lands for refuge purposes will not be expanded nor restricted, diminished, or eliminated due to the passage of H.R. 1675. As a result, refuge reserved water rights will remain exactly in the same position as they are today if H.R. 1675 becomes law.
