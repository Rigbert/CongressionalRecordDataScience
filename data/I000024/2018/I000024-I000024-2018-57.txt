President, we are about to go to conference. The first three votes here are very, very significant. They are considered to be maybe the most consequential votes of the year.  We have been working closely with the President on our John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. It is going to be a reality. We have done this through regular order in a very effective way. The Senate Armed Services Committee has been in concert with our combatant commanders, with Secretary Mattis, with the service chiefs, with the President. We have had a markup, our committee markup. We actually had over 300 amendments.  I am disturbed that we can't change this policy we have had for a long period of time that says that if one person on the floor objects when we are considering a bill--the NDAA, which we have considered successfully for 57 years--we are not going to be able to consider amendments. That is something we may want to address. To overcome that, we adopted 47 bipartisan amendments, both through the managers' package and the votes on the floor.  Tomorrow, we are going to hold our first big meeting of the conferees. I have been through a number of these in the past. This is where Members of the House and the Senate meet each other, talk about their issues, and talk about their successes and what they want to accomplish in this conference report. I have already visited with Ranking Member Senator Reed, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith, and we have a commitment to finish this conference report by the end of July. It is very ambitious. It is something we will be able to do.  The second vote we are going to have is to instruct the conferees in terms of the CFIUS issue. Personally, having recently been to China and the South China Sea, seeing what they are doing right now in northern Africa, in Djibouti--we have a different China than we had before. We are going to have to thoroughly review foreign transactions for national security concerns. I think Senator Cornyn is on the right track. I fully support his amendment.  The last one we will have is from Senator Reed, and I think this is significant too. Our President has said several times--I have to say this. Not one President in my memory, Democratic or Republican, has been successful in getting our allies and NATO to carry their share of the burden. This President is getting very tough on that. I think the Reed motion to instruct conferees on NATO is one that will give him a lot of the force that he needs to impact these other countries.  If you take 29 countries--67 percent of our actual budget for our country is the entire amount for 29 countries. That isn't right. This is something we can change, and we will hopefully succeed in doing that during this conference we will have.                           Order of Procedure  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 5 p.m. be moved to now.
