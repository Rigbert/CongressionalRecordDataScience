 President, I rise today to remember a fallen soldier, SSG Donald D. Griffith, Jr., a member of B Troop, 2nd Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, WA. Staff Sergeant Griffith died on March 11, 2005, in Tal Afar, Iraq, when his dismounted patrol was attacked by enemy forces using small arms fire. My heart goes out to his parents and family, who reside in Mechanicsville, IA, and his wife in Lakewood, WA.  Today, this Nation remembers and honors a man who sacrificed his life to defend his fellow soldiers and his country. With the death of Donald Griffith, this Nation lost a hero.  We know that there is no greater gift than the laying down of one's life for another. Staff Sergeant Griffith has given us that gift and we are forever grateful for his sacrifice. I ask that my colleagues join me reflecting on the memory of Donald D. Griffith, Jr. as we extend our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.                          ____________________
