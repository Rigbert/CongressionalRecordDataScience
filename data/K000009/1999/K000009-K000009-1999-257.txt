Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary contributions that Roy and Georgette Engler made over the course of their lives to benefit mentally disabled children in Northwest Ohio. Their story poignantly recounts the love and patience that characterized one family's heroic struggle with mental retardation. Though both passed away in the 1970's, their legacy lives on in the form of Sunshine Inc. of Northwest Ohio, a first-rate facility that provides assistance to hundreds of developmentally disabled individuals and their families. Loved and cherished by many, Roy and Georgette are remembered as selfless humanitarians who sought to help those shunned by the rest of society. Their efforts are truly worthy of recognition and praise. On behalf of Ohio's lawmakers and citizens, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring these two wonderful people.  Roy and Georgette Engler did not have an easy life. Both were high school drop-outs who struggled to make ends meet. Roy worked 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week as a railroad telegraph operator while Georgette, just 16 when she married, helped out at her parents' bar, grille, and country store. The situation became substantially more difficult, though, when it became apparent that all five of their children (two girls and three boys) were mentally retarded. Teachers told the Englers that their 2nd grade daughters would have to leave school because they were simply too slow. The boys, moreover, were less capable than their sisters, even having trouble relating with each other. The situation was bleak. Roy confided in a friend, ``No one will ever understand what it is like to sit around the table at meal time and look at your children and know that they will never be independent.''  The Engler's visited several institutions but realized it would be best to keep the children at home, where they would be loved and properly cared for. The magnitude of this responsibility took its toll, though. Roy was forced to work night shifts at the telegraph office and take odd jobs in the morning. He was hospitalized seven times for depression and stress. Georgette was thus forced to remain at home, day after day, caring for the five children. She contemplated suicide, though she fortunately never acted on these impulses. The total commitment to their children was robbing them of life. The Engler's had long since abandoned their hopes and dreams, resigning themselves to the fact that they would have to care for their children the rest of their lives. As the children reached their twenties, though, Roy and Georgette realized that they needed to ensure acceptable care for their children when they passed on.  The Engler's knew from experience that institutions were an unacceptable choice. They believed their children, as well as other mentally disabled youths, would benefit from an organization that placed an emphasis on individual care, love and simple pleasures. Roy and Georgette started Sunshine Inc. in 1949 and 50 years later it serves hundreds of developmentally challenged individuals with a budget of over $13 million. Moreover, Sunshine manages 14 group homes, operates a summer day camp and supervises adults that live on their own. The Superintendent of the Lucas County Board of Mental Retardation says they are among the best facilities in Ohio.  John Milton wrote ``freely we serve, because we freely love.'' This is thoroughly exemplified by the actions of Roy and Georgette Engler. Through their unselfish dedication, mankind has advanced and come to understand more about the range of crippling illnesses and brain disorders that afflict millions of people. Let us hope medical science in this generation will unlock the mysteries of human development, but until then, let us be forever grateful for the lifetime of sacrifice Roy and Georgette dedicated through love and uncommon valor. I would also like to extend a warm thanks to Tahree Lane of the Toledo Blade for writing such a wonderful article that brought this touching story to my attention.                          ____________________
