President, I was in Tazewell County--which is in the area of Pekin, in East Peoria, IL--last week at the Veterans Administration Commission.  I talked to a number of vets from the Vietnam war and other conflicts. We talked about obvious questions: veterans' unemployment, what was happening with disability payments, education for veterans, topics that most vets are very concerned about. They face some pretty significant challenges, as we know.  We promise these men and women that if they put up their hand and swear that they will risk their life for America, we swear we will be there when they come home. It is that basic. We have to keep our word. As a nation, we have a sacred pledge to take care of veterans who serve. I take it very seriously--I think both parties do--and we should.  We also need to honor those who have lost their lives. Just a few weeks ago, we buried another soldier from that county. There was a huge turnout at the memorial service. One particular local resident was doing his part to honor our fallen heroes in an extraordinary way. I learned about him when I visited Tazewell County. He is from Little York, IL, and he is known as the Flag Man.  Larry Eckhardt is not a veteran, and there are no servicemembers in his family. But in 2006, Larry Eckhardt attended a funeral for a soldier from his area who had died. He said, ``There aren't enough flags here.'' So on his own, Larry bought 150 American flags and started hauling them in his truck to military funerals all across my State. As he puts it, ``I just honestly don't believe there's any such thing as too many flags for a soldier.''  Larry's inventory of 150 flags has grown to 2,200 flags, and he can line them up to 14 miles of a fallen soldier's final journey.  Traveling in his old 1999 Ford van, stripped down to one seat to make room for all the flags, he has now graced more than 80 funerals from Wisconsin to Kentucky and Iowa to Indiana and certainly in his home State of Illinois. Last year, Larry drove 40,000 miles with his flags to these funerals. He covers all the costs out of his own pocket and a couple donations from friends. When asked why he does it, he simply says, ``It's my way of giving back.''  Larry rarely uses the word ``I.'' He is quick to praise all the volunteers--often organized by veterans organizations--who help him stake the flags in the ground along the funeral procession routes. ``Without them,'' he says, ``I couldn't get them all done.''  In one instance over a long weekend, dozens of volunteers helped Larry install the 2,200 flags to honor a 23-year-old Army sergeant during his funeral. After the service, volunteers helped pack up the flags for the next stop. Volunteers ranged from kids as young as 3, assisting their parents, to an 83-year-old woman who wanted to help out in Orchardville, IL. When she was asked her reason for weathering the tough January Illinois cold to help, she said, ``We can only bake so many tuna casseroles.''  This story is what America and the State of Illinois are all about. It is the common man, such as Larry Eckhardt, following his heart and taking the initiative to do something extraordinary for our fallen heroes, and it is about a community rising to the occasion to lend its support and honor those who deserve so much of our gratitude. Larry may have said it best when he humbly stated:       This is my feeble attempt to say thank you to every soldier      who has ever served and fought to protect the freedoms that I      have.  This speech on the floor of the Senate is my feeble attempt to say thanks to you, Larry, and the countless Americans just like you who step up and do their part to show our veterans how much their service means to each and every one of us. They embody the enduring spirit and values that make America great and they make me proud to serve in the Senate and humbled to represent my State of Illinois.  Thank you, Larry, and thanks to all the other Americans who are doingtheir part to support our veterans and their families.                          ____________________
