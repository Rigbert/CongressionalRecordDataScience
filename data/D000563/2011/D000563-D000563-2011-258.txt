It is an outrage that they would reach this far, obviously, into the United States. We know they have backed terrorism forever, as my colleague said, having been recognized by our government as a state sponsor of terrorism. We need to heighten the sanctions on Iran and make it clear this type of action will not be countenanced.  Many of us still recall it is only a few days after the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the last time terrorists decided they would strike in the United States. Regardless of whether the Embassy is for the United States, it is in the United States. Being here, it is protected property of our Nation.  I would say to the administration--to back my colleague from Illinois--let's look for every available means to let the Iranians know this conduct is not only unacceptable but we will do everything we can to disable them from any further actions along these lines through sanctions.                          ____________________
