President, it is a shame when we pander to trial lawyers and allow them to kill an industry before it is able to get off the ground.  I urge these Democrats to stop the obstruction and pass this important legislation that will let the American people have the freedom to experience space, the final frontier.                               Exhibit 1        [From Aviation Week & Space Technology, September, 2004]                  Commercial Space--At a Tipping Point       ``I have such faith in the private sector that I've dreamed      of the day that government monopoly would be replaced by      commercialization or at least some form of partnership.''      Those words, on the prospects of private manned spacecraft      and industrial space stations, were penned by President      Ronald Reagan in a letter to Aviation Week & Space      Technology's publisher in March 1985.       It has taken two decades, but now there are tangible      indications that such a dream could indeed become a reality.      Many of them are detailed in this week's cover story (see p.      54) and in the lead article of our World News and Analysis      section (see p. 26) But one of the most visible indications      is yet to come.       This week, Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne is set to make      the first of the two required flights to claim the $10      million Ansari X-Prize far hauling three people (or an      equivalent mass) to the edge of space twice within two weeks.      The prize could be won as early as next week. Designer Burt      Rutan and/or the team's backer, Microsoft billionaire Paul      Allen, may even climb in for the ride.       Should Rutan's crew stumble, there are others fast on their      heels. A half-dozen or more serious competitors have spent      many times the prize money in developing their vehicles. That      is exactly what Peter Diamandis had in mind when he organized      the X-Prize Foundation a decade ago to seed a private human      spaceflight industry, and our hat is off to him.       Dating even further back, there were entrepreneurs saying      that making human spaceflight both reliable and affordable      was possible with existing technology. The problems, they      said, were not technical but financial and political, even      psychological.       Unintentionally, NASA made it hard for these pioneers to      attract capital. First, the agency was a competitor because      it operated its own expensive vehicle, the space shuttle.      Then, when NASA tried to develop a new, cheaper-to-operate      reusable vehicle, it opted to include challenging cutting-     edge technologies, making program execution difficult and      expensive. As one might expect, when entrepreneurs went      looking on Wall Street for money for their simpler projects,      they were rebuffed by potential investors who believed human      spaceflight was inherently costly, dangerous and prone to      failure.       On top of that was a chicken-and-egg problem of economics.      To drastically lower the costs of spaceflight, a vehicle      needs to fly frequently. But to find enough customers to fly      frequently, one needs to have low prices, and that requires      low costs. The solution seemed to lie in new markets, and the      one many believed could jump-start the private sector was      ``space tourism.''       When the Russians began selling spare seats on Soyuz      spacecraft to dot.com zillionaires and rock stars, it became      harder to posit the economic impossibility of space tourism.      But it was the first suborbital flight of SpaceShipOne to 100      km. altitude, back in June, that removed the giggle factor      from discussions of space tourism. Pictures of pilot Mike      Melvill sitting atop his privately financed craft and waving      victoriously made the front pages of newspapers aroung the      world.       Meanwhile, things had changed in the government. Many in      Congress ``got religion'' on commercial space (more about      that later). NASA began working seriously with startups such      as Bigelow Aerospace on manned spacecraft. And Adminstrator      Sean O'Keefe bought into the prize paradigm, seeing to it      that the agency itself would sponsor some of these fledgling      enterprises.       This week, Robert T. Bigelow will make some news on that      front. He plans to announce a $50-million ``America's Space      Prize,'' an orbital analog to the X-Prize. To be sure, taking      humans into orbit and bringing them back safely is orders of      magnitude more difficult than taking them on a suborbital      ride, but don't dismiss the salutary effects of $50 million.       Prizes have an important and glorious place in the history      of flight, dating to the days of the Wrights, Curtiss and      Santos-Dumont. The revolution in public understanding of the      practicality and possibilities of aviation that Charles A.      Lindbergh wrought in laying claim to the $25,000 Orteig Prize      in 1927 is widely seen as having been a necessary ingredient      for the growth of an airline industry.       We night now be poised at a tipping point in public      understanding of the commercial possibilities of human      spaceflight. But if the X -Prize is to be remembered as      something more than a stunt, there must be a legal     framework in place for market-based spaceflight to grow.       There is a measure pending in Congress that would go a long      way to providing that framework--the Commercial Space Launch      Amendments Act of 2004 (H.R. 3752)--but it has been stalled      in the Senate for months. It would spell but FAA licensing      rules for suborbital flights. Most critically, the bill would      make it clear that paying passengers are ``spaceflight      participants'' who understand the risks. And it would require      them to sign waivers of legal liability. Without this      provision, the prospect of relatives of passengers suing and      collecting millions in damages following an accident would      likely scare off investors. And without outside investors,      many of today's space entrepreneurs will go out of business      in the not-too-distant future.       This bill is not some wild-eyed libertarian scheme. It      passed the House in March by a vote of 402-1. Science      Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert of New York, perhaps the      ``greenest'' Republican in the House, even went along with a      provision that would exempt these launchers from some      environmental regulations. Admitting he first thought the      legislation ``flighty,'' Boehlert says he came to see it as      essential: ``This is about a lot more than `joy rides' in      space, although there's nothing wrong with such an      enterprise. This is about the future of the U.S. aerospace      industry.''       One or more Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee are      holding up this bill, and, maddeningly, no one will say      publicly what they object to. Democrats say they want the job      growth the Bush administration has failed to deliver. If they      do, they ought to pass this bill. If they do not pass it,      part of their legacy may be that of having strangled an      infant industry in the crib.                                  ____                               Show Time                           (By Craig Covault)       The Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne suborbital vehicle that      will attempt this week and next to twice rocket above 100 km.      to claim the $10-million Ansari X-Prize highlights a major      new wave of commercial space activity taking stride into      early October.       The initiatives include the planned announcement this week      of a new, much larger $50-million ``America's Space Prize''      to spur private development of an orbital space transport      that by 2010 could carry 5-7 astronauts to an orbiting      station.       The new America's Space Prize is being initiated by      millionaire developer Robert T. Bigelow who wants a low-cost      manned transport to take crews to Bigelow Aerospace      inflatable space modules under development in North Las      Vegas, Nev. (see cover and p. 54).       Until recently, individual commercial space ``wannabes''      struggled for technical competence and respectability.       But a more business-like approach by commercial space      company managers coupled with their innovative use of      technology is enabling them to capture bigger government      contracts, such as the $42 million just awarded by the      Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) for quick      reaction launch developments.       The new commercial companies are also increasingly      ``breaking down the hidebound bureaucracies'' of NASA and the      larger aerospace companies, says Courtney Stadd, NASA's      former chief of staff. He says commercial space is beginning      to do this with a more diverse, and increasingly capable base      of dynamic new companies, staffed with younger engineers more      representative of the future than the past.       They are forming in effect ``a new national incubator for      technology and talent'' that aerospace industry can draw upon      for major innovation, says Stadd, who has long been      affiliated with commercial space start-ups.       Private/commercial ventures like SpaceShipOne carry an      inherent high-risk of failure, including the risk of a fatal      accident, But the new commercial space industry is far more      steeled to accept and recover from failure than it was      earlier, Stadd said.       Several new commercial space milestones have just occurred      or will occur by early October. They include:       SpaceShipOne X-Prize flights. The flights to capture the X-     Prize are set for Sept. 29 and Oct. 4. at Mojave, Calif.      Propulsion subcontractor SpaceDev of Poway, Calif., itself a      small commercial space company, has delivered to the Burt      Rutan team three new SpaceShipOne systems carrying more      synthetic rubber fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer than used      during the demonstration flight June 21 (AWST June 28, p.      28).       This is to provide more performance earlier in the profile      when the vehicle is in the lower, more dense, atmospheric      phase of flight. More performance at lower altitude is      necessary so the engine can more assuredly propel the      slightly heavier X-Prize configured vehicle higher than 62      mi. altitude.       Canadian Da Vinci X-Prize attempt. The Canadian Da Vinci      Project plans to make its first try for the X-Prize with      launch of a manned rocket from a balloon 80,000 ft. over      Kindersley, Saskatchewan, as early as Oct. 2. SpaceDev's      ``Dream Chaser'' manned vehicle. In a major new      development, SpaceDev has just signed an agreement with      the NASA Ames Research Center for technology collaboration      in the design of what initially would be a new higher-     performance commercial manned suborbital vehicle capable      of carrying 3-5 people to about 100 mi. altitude. This      compares with about 62 mi. for the 1-3-person      SpaceShipOne.       The new vehicle will be designed using the basic      aerodynamic shape of the Orbital Sciences/U.S Air Force X-34      demonstrator that never flew before cancellation. The X-34      concept, but not the original hardware, will be redesigned      for manned vertical launch on suborbital flights as early as      2008, depending upon the flow of commercial or government      funding for the program, said Jim Benson, SpaceDev chairman      and CEO. SpaceDev and Ames will work on potential utilization      of the vehicle by NASA, USAF or the private sector. Benson's      ultimate objective is to scale the Dream Chaser design to an      orbital vehicle.       SpaceX Falcon 1 to Vandenberg. The first privately      developed low-cost Falcon 1 unmanned orbital launch vehicle      has been completed by SpaceX at its El Segundo plant and is      to be taken late this week or early next to its launch pad at      Vandenberg AFB, Calif. This major milestone could lead to the      first launch by late November, if a static firing on the pad      can be completed before the Western Range closes for upgrades      throughout December, says Elon Musk, CEO of Space Exploration      Technologies (SpaceX).       Musk told Aviation Week & Space Technology he now has four      firm contracts with deposits for Falcon missions, including      one just signed with the Malaysian Space Agency. Two others      are from the U.S. government and one from Bigelow Aerospace      for launch of a Genesis one-third scale inflatable module.       Commercial Zero-G flights. Amerijet International of Fort      Lauderdale, Fla., has just become the first commercial      airline ever to receive FAA certification for commercial      parabolic weightless flight operations. The flights are to      begin Oct. 9, at about $3,000 per person. The project will      use a Boeing 727-200 to conduct parabolic tourist flights out      of the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood, Fla., International Airport      in connection with the Zero-6 Corp.       NASA Commercial Transportation Call. NASA has just issued a      comprehensive ``request for information'' sounding out the      aerospace industry for new concepts in commercial space      transportation services related to the agency's new      exploration initiative. It is the single most comprehensive      call for commercial space transportation concepts ever made      by the agency. Responses, on which new contracting can be      based, are due back next September.       Darpa/USAF Rapid Launch Awards. Nearly $42 million in      development contracts are just being awarded to four      companies, mostly commercial space start-ups, as Phase II in      the Darpa/USAF Falcon Small Launch Vehicle (SLV) program. The      effort is designed to lead to a much more rapid launch      capability for 1,000-lb. critical U.S. military satellites      for less than $5 million per mission.       Except for Lockheed Martin, which received $11.6 million,      all of the winners are small start-up companies. Lockheed's      concept builds on its Michoud, La., development of a hybrid      powered system burning nontoxic fuel and liquid oxygen (AWST      Feb. 3, 2003, p. 54).       There is a range of innovative launch concepts among the      commercial start-up companies that won, but only AirLaunch      would deploy its two-stage ``QuickReach'' liquid propellant      booster from a C-17 that could be staged from literally any      friendly airfield around the world.       It won $11.3 million to explore the concept that could      provide great launch flexibility. Several small commercial      space companies including Space Vector Inc. of Chatsworth,      Calif., and Universal Space Lines of Newport Beach, Calif.,      are part of the AirLaunch team.       Another winner was Microcosm of El Segundo, Calif., that is      developing the simple liquid oxygen/kerosene pressure-fed      ``Scorpius'' engine system. Microcosm won $10.4 million to      further develop its 52-ft.-long Sprite launcher using a six-     barrel cluster of the engines to provide 120,000 lb. of      liftoff thrust.       SpaceX, also based in El Segundo, won $8 million for its      Falcon launcher. The project, by coincidence, has the same      name as the overall Air Force/Darpa program.       All of the selected companies are to conduct 10-month      preliminary design studies toward a downselect to one or more      competitors that will perform an actual launch in 2007.       But since SpaceX is more advanced in hardware fabrication      than the other competitors, Darpa and USAF have asked it to      perform an ``Early Responsive Launch Test'' with a Falcon 1      launch about July 2005. Musk said the objective will be to      cut the Falcon's launch pad time by 50%--to just one week.       This Aviation Week & Space Technology editor recently saw      the first Falcon flight vehicle in final assembly at the      SpaceX plant in El Segundo.       It is being readied this week for the trip to Vandenberg      AFB and mounting on its launch pad.       The flight engines have completed their final pre-     integration qualification tests at SpaceX test facilities      near McGregor, Tex., and development engines and components      continue to be tested at the site. Earlier turbopump problems      have been solved. But some other engine components, earlier      made of aluminum, have been switched to Inconel because of a      hairline crack found in one several weeks ago.       The Falcon 1 first stage will likely end up weighing less      than its specification weight--a highly positive factor. This      is because earlier delays allowed the program enough time to      switch a composite interstage for a heavier aluminum      structure, saving about 150 lb.     Also switching the overall thrust frame from steel to      titanium has saved another 100 lb. These improvements will be      especially helpful when the vehicle eventually begins to      launch heavier payloads, Musk said.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2                                               September 21, 2004.     Senator John McCain,     Chair, Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation, 241          Russell Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Sam Brownback,     Chair, Subcommittee on Science Technology, & Space, 303 Hart          Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Ernest Hollings,     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science, &          Transportation, 125 Russell Building, Washington, DC.     Senator John Breaux,     Chair, Subcommittee on Science Technology, & Space, 503 Hart          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Sirs, we are writing to respectfully urge that the      Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation      quickly report out and secure Senate passage of a perfected      H.R. 3752, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of      2004.       As you know, the U.S. commercial expendable launch vehicle      industry is challenged by a highly competitive international      market, and NASA's recent orbital reusable launch vehicle      development programs have not been successful. Fortunately,      the recent emergence of a suborbital reusable launch vehicle      industry demonstrates that American entrepreneurs are      bringing new private resources and ideas to bear on the vital      goal of advancing U.S. space transportation capabilities and      competitiveness, largely to pursue new commercial human      spaceflight markets.       The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 (CSLA) as amended      (49 U.S.C. 70101 et seq.) gives the Secretary of      Transportation sole regulatory authority over commercial      space transportation, which has been delegated to the FAA's      Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space      Transportation (ASST). That jurisdiction includes launches of      a `suborbital rocket' on a `suborbital trajectory,' but      unfortunately those terms were never defined in law.      Furthermore, the CSLA is silent on the issue of whether such      vehicles might carry persons. Therefore, confusion has      developed as to whether some of these suborbital RLVs might      be regulated as a rocket or an airplane, or worse still, as      both. Last summer a joint hearing of the Senate Science,      Technology, and Space Subcommittee and the House Space &      Aeronautics Subcommittee heard strong and unanimous testimony      that this regulatory uncertainty was a real and unnecessary      barrier to private investment in, and therefore the success      of, this new suborbital RLV industry, and that Congress      needed to fill in the ``legislative gap'' in the CSLA.       To address this issue, the House Science Committee crafted      H.R. 3752 after holding an additional public hearing, a      private forum, and extensive individual consultations with a      broad range of interested and disinterested parties. The      legislation not only creates the regulatory clarity needed by      industry, but strikes an important balance among competing      public policy objectives.       For example, the legislation continues the CSLA's priority      of protecting the safety of the uninvolved public, and also      affirms FAA/AST's authority to set safety-related      requirements for crew in these new vehicles. H.R. 3752 and      its committee report also directs FAA to promulgate      regulations requiring the full disclosure of the safety      records of human spaceflight vehicles and their operating      companies to all prospective customers, giving them informed      consent. (This is very different from the laissez faire      approach which existed during the barnstorming days of      aviation.)       The bill also creates a new, streamlined experimental      permit regime that allows for expedited review of non-revenue      flight test of vehicles so that companies can demonstrate      safe operating records before proceeding to revenue flight.      It should be noted that flights under experimental permits      would not be eligible to receive federal indemnification      against third party claims, and even during revenue flight      the spaceflight participants would not be eligible to receive      indemnification.       For all of these reasons, H.R. 3752 was sponsored by the      committee's bipartisan leadership, and passed the House of      Representatives by the overwhelming vote of 402 to 1 in March      of this year.       In recent months, Congressional staff, the FAA, and various      industry participants have developed compromise language that      would provide greater clarity over regulatory jurisdiction of      so-called hybrid suborbital rockets. With these changes,      which are attached to this letter, H.R. 3752 is ready for      final consideration in and passage by the Committee on      Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the full      Senate.       We, the undersigned leaders of this industry and supporting      public policy organizations, therefore respectfully urge you      to support this consensus amendment and send a perfected H.R.      3752 to the Senate floor this month for passage by unanimous      consent so it can be reconsidered by the House and enacted      into law before the November election.
