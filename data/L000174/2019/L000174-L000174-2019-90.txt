President, many of us are increasingly concerned that, since President Trump's reckless decision to abandon the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran, which by all accounts Iran had been complying with, the administration has been on a collision course that could draw us into a war with Iran. Although the President insists that is not what he wants, he is known to change his mind on a whim, and the statements and actions of others in his administration, including some who were vocal proponents of the unnecessary and costly war in Iraq, leave little doubt that they favor a policy of regime change.  We all deplore Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, its horrific violations of human rights, and its constant outpouring of hatefulanti-American, anti-Israel rhetoric, but a war with Iran would be far worse, and no one can be certain how it would end. As tensions increase, a misunderstanding or provocative act by either Iran or the United States could quickly trigger retaliatory strikes that spiral out of control, drawing us, our allies, and our adversaries into protracted hostilities. Rather than risk that potentially disastrous result, the administration should be partnering with our European and Middle Eastern allies on a strategy of negotiations to reduce regional tensions. In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a recent op-ed in ``The Guardian'' by Peter Westmacott, former British Ambassador to the United States, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Guardian, May 21, 2019]        To Defuse This Crisis the US Must Start Talking to Iran                         (By Peter Westmacott)       As Washington raises the stakes, the risk of a      misunderstanding is high--and it could lead to a new conflict      in the Middle East.       Washington's foreign policy hawks--and by extension for the      rest of us. Donald Trump says he doesn't want a war with      Iran, but his national security adviser, JJohn Bolton, has      despatched warships and bombers to the region while the US      secretary of state Mike Pompeo has been sharing worrying      intelligence about Iranian intentions with close allies and      congressional leaders.       What's going on? It's now a year since Trump tore up the      nuclear deal with Iran negotiated in 2015 by the Obama      administration along with Britain, France, Germany, Russia,      China and the EU. Since then, egged on by Israel and the Gulf      states, he has announced new sanctions, despite Iran's full      compliance with the terms of the deal, and tried bullying the      Europeans and others into applying US sanctions in order to      deny Iranians the economic benefits they were promised.       After a year of waiting to see if the other signatories      would make the deal work without US cooperation, the Iranians      announced earlier this month that they would no longer fully      comply with the uranium and heavy water restrictions of the      agreement--and that, unless the Europeans could help with oil      and banking within 60 days, more drastic measures would      follow. Western governments sometimes forget that the Iranian      government is not a monolithic entity, and that the officials      they are used to dealing with, such as president Hassan      Rouhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif, are under constant      pressure from hardliners who point to the lack of any return      on the investment Iran made four years ago.       Since Trump pulled the plug, the Europeans have been      working on a scheme to allow some forms of trade with Iran to      continue independently of the US. Its effects have been      limited, leading the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to      convince himself--wrongly--that the Europeans were only ever      playing good cop to Washington's bad cop. As US sanctions      continue to damage the Iranian economy, Trump says he is      still interested in some kind of grand bargain. Tehran should      call me, the president says, perhaps not realising that there      would be huge political consequences for anyone who did.       But outside the US, the impression has grown that the hawks      in the Trump administration are more interested in regime      change than in policy change--and by military action if      necessary. There are shades here of Iraq 2003, when the      George W Bush administration was desperate to prove that      Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It is      nonsense to claim, as Pompeo did last month, that ``there is      a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-     Qaida. Period. Full stop''. Al-Qaida's roots are in Sunni,      Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, and it hates Shia Iran almost as much      as it hates the US and its allies.       The Europeans have never disagreed about the nature or      extent of Iran's destabilising activity in the region. But      they don't buy the regime change argument, knowing from      experience that outside pressure is more likely to strengthen      rather than weaken the hardliners. They also still believe      that the best way to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons      is to stick with the deal.       There is now a real risk of the world finding itself with      another Middle Eastern conflict on its hands, by accident or      miscalculation. What can be done? As many of us have been      saying to Iranian officials for some time, they should help      others to stand up for the nuclear deal by moderating Iran's      behaviour in the region: stop supplying sophisticated      weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon; and stop supplying missiles      to the Houthi militia in Yemen that perpetuate the horrific      civil war. Iran could use its influence over President Bashar      al-Assad to press him to avoid further bloodshed in Syria.      And it could end the imprisonment and abuse of dual nationals      and other Iranian citizens on specious grounds.       Some suggest that current tensions may be partly the result      of misunderstandings between Tehran and Washington. That      wouldn't be surprising, given the long history of distrust      and the absence of diplomatic relations between the two      countries for 4o years. But it serves as a reminder that some      form of direct communication is essential: both sides should      move quickly to activate private channels.       Back in 1987--when the UN security council was trying to      stop the Iran-Iraq war Saddam had started (with western      encouragement) seven years earlier--the council passed a      resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a      withdrawal to international borders. It didn't manage to stop      Saddam launching another, ultimately unsuccessful offensive.      But tucked away in paragraph eight was a request to the      secretary general ``to examine, in consultation with Iran and      Iraq and with other states in the region, measures to enhance      the security of the region''.       That resolution is still valid. Why not look again at the      idea of all the regional powers, under UN auspices, coming      together with a view to lowering tensions? A recent OpEd in      the New York Times by Abdulaziz Sager, a Saudi Arabian      academic, and Hussein Moussavian, a former Iranian nuclear      negotiator, argues that the time for the region's two big      rivals to sit down and try to bury the hatchet might just      might have come. So much is at stake that it's surely worth a      try.                          ____________________
