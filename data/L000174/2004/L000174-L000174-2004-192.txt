President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to designate the recently-constructed annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC as the ``William B. Bryant Annex.''  Thomas F. Hogan, this Court's current Chief Judge, has expressed his support and the unanimous support of the other judges on the District Court for the District of Columbia. I am proud to join with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton in moving ahead with the Chief Judge's request.  Judge Bryant served with distinction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia since 1965. He was the Chief Judge on that court from March 1977 to September 1981.  Judge Bryant graduated from Howard University in 1932, and from Howard University Law School, receiving an LL.B. in 1936.  Judge Bryant's lengthy public service career is one of great distinction. In addition to the time he spent on the Federal bench, Judge Bryant served in the United States Army during World War II and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. After serving four and one half years as Chief Judge, Judge Bryant took senior status in January of 1982.  Naming the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse after Judge Bryant would be a fitting tribute to this distinguished jurist. Much like Judge Prettyman, Judge Bryant had an illustrious career in public service and on the bench. I am honored to offer this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join Congresswoman Norton and me in support of this well-deserved commendation.                                 ______                                       By
