 President, I am here today to commend the Drake University Men's Basketball team on its outstanding and unexpected success this past season. Drake is a school of less than 5,000 students in Des Moines, IA. Today the Drake community is experiencing basketball success the likes of which it hasn't seen in over 35 years. Coached by Keno Davis, the Bulldogs won the regular season Missouri Valley Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference tournament and earned a berth to the NCAA tournament. They were picked to finish ninth in the conference and instead roared to a 28-4 overall record. It was only the second winning season the Bulldogs have enjoyed in the past 20 years. And it's the first time since 1971 that they will play in the NCAA tournament. Drake also finished the regular season ranked 20th in the Nation and beating a tough Illinois State team by 30 points in the MVC tournament final. It's been a long drought, but the Bulldog nation, from Iowa to Washington, DC, to California, could not be prouder.  This upstart team has quite a story. Two starters, Adam Emmenecker and Jonathon Cox are former 3-year walk-ons who recently earned basketball scholarships. They are also incredibly successful academically. Drake started off the season well and won the mythical State championship by beating the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa. They snapped a 20 game losing streak at the University of Iowa. Drake also had great success in Missouri Valley Conference play. The Bulldogs cracked the Top 25, too, and traveled to Butler University and beat the eighth ranked team on their home court.  This Drake team exemplifies what it means to be a student-athlete. Five Drake players, Adam Emmenecker, Josh Young, Klayton Korver, Brent Heemskerk, and Jonathon Cox were named to the MVC's scholar-athlete team. Four of the five Bulldog starters have a GPA above 3.0. In addition, Emmenecker was named the ESPN Scholar Athlete of the year for NCAA Men's Division I basketball, with a 3.97 GPA and four majors.  It goes without saying that behind a great college team are great coaches and administrators. Keno Davis is in his first year as a head coach. He's been named the Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year, and Sporting News Coach of the Year. Just 36 years old, Keno learned from his father, Dr. Tom Davis, who retired as Drake's head coach in 2007, and was a longtime head coach at the Universityof Iowa. I have great respect for the Davis family, and I'm so glad that they have rebuilt the Drake program. Keno and his wife Krista became parents during the season, too. Assistant coaches Chris Davis, Rodell Davis and Justin Ohl have obviously spent hours fine-tuning their talented and intelligent team.  I also need to congratulate Drake's president Dr. David Maxwell and Athletic Director Sandy Hatfield Clubb for their support of the men's basketball program. They have helped rebuild Drake's basketball program while maintaining high academic standards. We all know how hard that is in college sports today. Drake is a shining example of how a team can win on the court and in the classroom.  Dolph Pulliam, a member of Drake's one and only Final Four team, has served as an inspiration to the current Bulldogs. Dolph and his team played Lew Alcinder, known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar today, and UCLA back in 1969 and only lost by 3 points. Since his playing days, Dolph has remained in the Des Moines area, working for the university and broadcasting their games on the radio. And he is quite a presence with his huge smile and blue leather suit. I know he has influenced the current Drake players, thanks to encouragement from Dr. Tom Davis to help them all rekindle the fires of great basketball.  So I want to again extend my congratulations to the Drake University men's basketball program, and to their students and fans who've never lost faith in them. It has been a joy to watch their success, and I hope that they continue winning during March Madness. I also hope that these young men will serve as an example to the young people in Iowa, to show that it is entirely possible to maintain high academic standards and winning ways on the court.                          ____________________
