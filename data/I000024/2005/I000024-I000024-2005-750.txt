President, during World War I and II, Native Americans heard the call of their Country and enlisted in the United States Armed Services in unprecedented numbers. Many of these brave men performed the role of code talkers, using a code language derived from a variety of American Indian languages to ensure secure and rapid communication of information on the battlefield. Through three wars and five decades, enemy forces were never able to break the United States code language thanks to the service and ingenuity of Native American Code Talkers. These patriots provided an invaluable service to the United States and our allies and deserve recognition for their bravery.  Until 1968, information related to the code talker's activities during both World Wars remained classified by the Department of Defense. The postponement in learning about the essential role of Native American Code Talkers has resulted in delayed recognition of these war heroes. The first step in recognizing these men came in 2000 when President Bush signed into law legislation authorizing Congress to award gold medals to the twenty-nine Navajo Code Talkers as well as a silver medal to each man who later qualified as a Navajo Code Talker. While this legislation was a step in the right direction, it failed to recognize a number of Native Americans who also served as code talkers but were not members of the Navajo Nation.  During the first World War, Choctaw code talkers served with distinction in France. By transmitting in their native tongue a variety of open voice messages relating to unit movements, United States forces completely surprised the enemy during battle. Following the success of the Choctaw code talkers, soldiers from the Navajo, Sioux, Comanche and Meskwaki tribes, along with members of 14 other tribes, served as code talkers in some of the most dangerous operations in both theaters of World War II.  Today I introduce the Code Talkers Recognition Act to honor those who were overlooked when medals were awarded to the Navajo Code Talkers in 2001. This bill authorizes the presentation of commemorative medals on behalf of Congress to Native Americans who served as Code Talkers during any foreign conflict in which the United States was involved during the 20th Century. I ask my colleagues to help honor the heroic contributions of these gentlemen by cosponsoring this bill.                          ____________________[Pages S5191-S5194]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS      By
