  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, I will shortly be offering an amendment, as the distinguished Senator from Washington indicated, with reference to the medical malpractice crisis that we have in our country. I will be offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Kassebaum.  This amendment, Mr. President, would expand the product liability bill to include health care liability cases. Medical malpractice reform is a perfect fit with the product liability reform effort underway here in the Senate. Overlap exists between these two issues, and if we do not reform them together, we could make the liability system even more complicated than it is now.  Take, for example, Mr. President, a lawsuit over an adverse reaction to a drug. The injured patient is likely to sue the doctor who prescribed the drug, as well as the manufacturer and the seller.  Now, Mr. President, if we only pass a narrow product liability bill, the drugmaker and seller would be covered under the product liability reform, but the case against the doctor would proceed under different rules. The result could be two separate cases involving the same set of facts.  Is that an improvement in the legal system? I think hardly is that an improvement.  So I say to my colleagues who support product liability reform, let us take a new look. Medical malpractice reform needs to accompany product liability reform. The problems within our health care liability system establish the need for the reforms contained within this amendment.  First of all, Mr. President, the liability system impedes access to affordable health care for many in our country. The Office of Technology Assessment reports that half a million rural women do not have access to an obstetrician to deliver their babies. Now, I know that is an acute problem in rural areas of Kentucky. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that more and more obstetricians are giving up the practice and restricting themselves only to gynecology, one of [[Page S5754]] every eight, according to their 1990 study.  Let me share a few statistics with you. In Georgia, 75 counties lack maternity care; in Alabama, 2 counties; in Colorado, 19 counties have no maternity care whatsoever.  During the health care debate last year, I received a letter from Dr. Leonard Lawrence, president of the National Medical Association, whose membership consists of African-American doctors. He wrote, Mr. President:       Minority physicians are particularly impacted by the      current medical malpractice crisis. The combined costs of      liability insurance and the threat of malpractice suits have      caused many of our members to stop practicing in high-risk      areas. The effects of these trends are painfully evident in      minority communities. Minority physicians who have      traditionally made a commitment to serve Medicaid patients      are being forced to discontinue these services.  Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues who are opposing the legal reform effort argue that reform will have an adverse effect on women and low-income minority individuals. Well, this information demonstrates that our failure to enact reform is what harms the women and minorities in the United States who need medical care.  The second problem caused by the medical liability system is the decline in medical innovation. While doctors, as we know, practice defensive medicine by ordering unneeded tests and procedures, they are also less likely to take risks with treatment procedures and surgery because of the chances of getting sued. According to the General Accounting Office, a doctor has a 37-percent chance of being sued during the course of his or her practice.  And there is the related issue of biomaterial access on which Senator Lieberman has been our most conspicuous leader. We need to ensure that raw material suppliers will sell their products to those who make important lifesaving devices.  A third problem, Mr. President, concerns the erosion of the doctor-patient relationship caused by defensive medicine. The dean of the University of Kentucky Medical School called my office this week to stress the importance of health care liability reform. He explained how hard it is to get young doctors to develop clinical skills when they can order a battery of expensive tests which will protect them in case of a lawsuit. Apparently, the chance of being sued has nothing to do with whether the doctor acted negligently. GAO reports that nearly 60 percent of all claims are dismissed without a verdict or a settlement.  Medical malpractice victims suffer from the same unpredictability of our civil justice system as other injured persons. Cases take too long to conclude, anywhere from 2 years to more than a decade. Of every dollar spent in the liability system overall in the United States, only 43 cents goes to the injured party. A full 57 cents of every dollar goes to the system itself, the lawyer and the court costs.  So, Mr. President, our goals here are basic and fundamental. First, to promote patient safety. Second, to compensate injured patients fully and fairly, but not to enrich the lawyers and the system; make health care more affordable and accessible; contain the costs of the liability system; strengthen the doctor-patient relationship; and, finally, encourage medical innovation.  Before I explain what our amendment does, I want to be clear about what it does not do. First of all, there is no cap on pain and suffering in this amendment. Doctors' groups advocate a cap on noneconomic damages of $250,000. The House included such a provision in its legal reform bill last month, but we chose to omit a cap on pain and suffering for several reasons.  First, there are circumstances where an individual suffers a serious injury but may have minimal or no economic losses. It seems harsh--not only seems harsh, it would be harsh--to tell such victims who have lost a limb or a sense of hearing, for example, that because they can go back to work, their damages are limited.  For too long, the proponents of reform have been attacked as trying to deprive victims of their rightful compensation. So we felt in introducing our medical malpractice bill that we could offer many, many significant improvements to the system short of limiting pain and suffering. Pain and suffering are part of compensatory damages awarded in an effort to make the victim whole. We can reform the liability system to make it more certain and more fair without limiting an injured party's right to be made whole, and that is why we omitted such a provision. There may be amendments offered to put a cap on pain and suffering, but that is not something that this Senator could support.  The second issue we omitted from our bill was the so-called FDA defense. That provision enables a company which obtained FDA approval for its device or a drug to be shielded from punitive damages. During last year's debate on a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to product liability, this issue was prominently discussed. Several Senators cited their opposition to this provision which was included in last year's product liability bill, and they cited that as their reason for opposing cloture.  So we wanted to avoid that controversy connected with the full medical malpractice bill. The FDA amendment may or may not be offered at some course during this debate and, as with the cap on noneconomic damages, I welcome the debate. There is no reason not to discuss those issues and let them come to a vote if others would like to proceed with that. But it is important to remember that with regard to the concern drug manufacturers have, they still would benefit to some extent by the cap on punitive damages.  As for our amendment, let me explain what is in it. I talked about what is not in it, now let me talk about what is in it.  First of all, it is basically the same bill with some changes --no, it is basically the same bill that myself, Senator Lieberman and Senator Kassebaum introduced which was referred to the Labor Committee.  She, along with other members of that committee, made significant changes in the bill from its introduction as S. 454. The amendment contains a uniform 2-year statute of limitations, which is the same statute of limitations contained in the product liability bill.  The amendment addresses punitive damages in much the same way that they are handled in the product liability bill. Our amendment sets out the standard for awarding punitive damages, either intent to injure, understood the likelihood of injury and deliberately fail to avoid injury, or acted with conscious, flagrant disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Punitive damages may be handled in a separate proceeding, and the amendment sets out the eight factors that the court may consider in determining the amount. The amount of punitive damages is limited to three times the economic damages or a quarter of a million dollars, whichever is greater.  The definition of ``economic damages'' specifically includes replacement services in the home, such as child care, transportation, food preparation and household care. We sought to be as comprehensive as possible to make clear that those individuals who do not work outside the home would be made whole for their losses. The fact that an injured individual does not earn a significant or, for that matter, any salary will not mean that there would be no economic losses.  I am aware in the Labor Committee that Senator Dodd successfully offered an amendment to eliminate the cap on punitive damages. We have declined to incorporate that amendment into this floor amendment because without a cap on punitive damages, you do not have uniformity, you have no chance of getting predictability into the system. To do so would make the medical malpractice section inconsistent with the product liability provisions, and it is important to keep these two issues on very similar tracks.  The amendment provides for periodic payment of future damage awards that exceed $100,000. Periodic payments must be made in accordance with the Uniform Periodic Payments of Judgments Act.  The amendment abolishes joint liability for noneconomic damages, including punitive damages.  Like the product liability proposal, the medical malpractice amendment provides that defendants are only responsible for their proportionate share of the harm caused. Like the proponents of the product liability bill, we [[Page S5755]] seek to put an end to lawsuits brought against a party because of its deep pocket. The amendment also reforms the collateral source rule to prevent double payment for the same injury. Amounts received by the individual from other sources, except those amounts paid by the individual or close family member, would be deducted from any damage award. The amount of the reduction would be determined in a pretrial proceeding, and evidence regarding the reduction could not be introduced at trial.  Further, Mr. President, the amendment limits lawyers' contingency fees to one-third of the first $150,000 and 25 percent of any amount over $150,000. Clearly, that benefits the victim so that the victim gets more of the money in these cases.  The amendment encourages States to adopt alternative dispute resolution and requires the Attorney General to develop guidelines for the States. The amendment sets forth a number of ADR options, including arbitration, mediation, early neutral evaluation, early offer, use of certificates of merit and no fault.  The amendment also contains a separate subtitle on protecting the health and safety of patients. It provides that 50 percent of punitive damage awards go to the State for licensing and disciplining health care professionals, as well as for reducing malpractice-related costs for health care providers who volunteer in underserved areas.  In addition, this subtitle requires the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to establish a panel on patient quality and safety. Within 2 years, this agency would take the work of the panel and establish guidelines for health care quality assurance, patient safety, and consumer information. In the interim, this agency would report to Congress on the work of the panel in these areas. Credit goes to Senator Jeffords for his hard work on this provision and the great improvement he made on the original bill.  Finally, I want to mention the preemption provision. The opponents of legal reform have all of a sudden become advocates for States rights. They accuse the proponents of reform of hypocrisy for wanting to establish Federal standards in these areas. But I argue we are not the hypocrites. First of all, we are not changing the substantive law of negligence. Whether a doctor or hospital was negligent in the provision or administration of health care will still be a matter of State law. We are not creating any Federal cause of action where none exists. Neither product liability cases nor medical malpractice cases will wind up in Federal courts if they could not be there today.  Second, Congress has the ample power to set national standards in this area. As in the product liability arena, health care is a national issue. We spent weeks debating this subject last year. Medical products and drugs are in the stream of interstate commerce. Health maintenance organizations and other health care providers are national--I repeat national--organizations operating throughout many States. And health insurance is generally sold on a nationwide basis. While a particular doctor-patient relationship may be local in nature, the delivery of health care is part of interstate commerce.  Moreover, the Federal Government, through Medicare and Medicaid, funds a substantial part of the health care system. So the preemption provisions strikes a balance in creating a minimum national standard. Those States which have enacted, or which in the future enact additional restrictions on limitations, will supplement these national standards.  I am aware that Senator Abraham, in the Labor Committee markup, successfully offered an amendment to allow States to opt out of national standards contained in this amendment. We have declined to include his amendment since we believe that preemption strikes the delicate balance needed in this area.  There is much more to say about this amendment, and I am sure we will all have an opportunity to express our points of view during the course of the debate. The effort here is to improve and strengthen the bill so doctors and hospitals are treated similarly to medical device and drug manufacturers and sellers.  Mr. President, this is indeed a national problem.                 Amendment No. 603 to Amendment No. 596(Purpose: To reform the health care liability system and improve health  care quality through the establishment of quality assurance programs)  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
