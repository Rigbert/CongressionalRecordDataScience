You were an oasis in a desert. You gave us hope by coming there and listening to us and allowing our people to put their stories of our communities, of what's going on in this mortgage market on the record.  And what is really disheartening about all of this is it seems that the financial system is getting so far away from community, from neighborhood, from our people, our people feel powerless to make a difference, and now you say these services are even over in India. Frankly, I had trouble with all this stuff moving to Wall Street and not being able to get a phone call returned when we're trying to do a workout at the local level.  We need to turn this financial system upside down, and I'm hoping that the chairman of the full committee is listening in this House and that whatever we do to bail out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, these investment banks on Wall Street--and I have some problems with doing that. I'm not a happy traveler in this party here--that power devolves back to the local level, that however this financial system is rearranged, that we go back to character, collateral, and collectibility, the old principles when we had a system that functioned well at the local level, and re-empower communities to handle their housing systems.  This system we have now has given us a multi-trillion dollar disaster. How can anybody say when you move away from home, so far away, how can that be good, when our people feel powerless to make a difference? Our mayors feel powerless. Our communities, our credit unions, the Realtors, how can this system be good when it so disempowers?
