 They have a 4-year term, an opportunity to develop a record of bipartisan cooperation with both the Republicans and the Democrats on the Federal Election Commission before reaching the end of the 4-year term. At that point, if they want to continue enjoying enough confidence across party lines to achieve another 4-year appointment--it seems to me eminently reasonable. And, Mr. President, I think it guarantees that the Federal Election Commission will be the kind of agency that the Congress intended it to be when it was created in the mid 1970s.  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, if I have any.
