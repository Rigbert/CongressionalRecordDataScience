President, when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was passed, there was a misinterpretation by the Health Care Financing Administration of this bill--while it should have been revenue neutral--to have regular reductions in the amount of reimbursement that goes to hospitals, specifically a 5.7-percent reduction to reimbursement that would take place in July of the year 2000. This was not the intent of the Members of the Senate.  I have a letter that has 77 signatures on it, including those of each Senator who is in the Chamber right now, stating that was not the intent. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying that was not the intent so we would not be having that 5.7-percent reduction in July of the year 2000.
