Waters. I could have no one that I admire more in terms of her love of community and her complete dedication to those who don't have enough voice in this Congress of the United States. To have that compliment from you means a great deal to me this evening. Thank you.                          ____________________[Page H4315]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           MINE SAFETY--HONORING THE MINERS OF HARLAN COUNTY
