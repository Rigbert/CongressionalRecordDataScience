Yeah, he had rights to purchase his health care under COBRA. But the cost of his health care was three-quarters of his unemployment benefit. His wife was deathly ill. This is a tough guy. He cried in public in that office. That won't happen again if we pass this legislation tomorrow. That gentleman will not be forced to choose between keeping his home, feeding his family, and getting his wife needed health care. Under your plan, that continues, status quo. You guys are the pets of the insurance industry, and you know it.  And then the woman that needed a double mastectomy and they had a special team from her insurance company. That was great. But their job was to find a way to get her off the plan. They reviewed her history. They found she had been to a dermatologist for acne. They said she hadn't reported it. They rescinded her policy. And a gentleman from your side of the aisle had to threaten that insurance company publicly to get her reinstated. This law will prohibit that in the future.  We need to take on the health insurance industry in America and prevent these abuses, and you guys did nothing about that under your charge, and your proposals for the future will do nothing about that.
