 Ladies and gentlemen, we all want to pursue the legislative process. One of the things that has undermined the legislative process in this House perhaps on both sides is the ``gotcha'' amendments. This amendment has a worthwhile objective, obviously, of protecting our children. We're going to give everybody an opportunity to vote on this amendment in just a few short hours, and then we're going to pass this bill--because the gentleman's debate had nothing to do with this amendment until the last few seconds of his remarks.  His remarks went to the substance of this bill. He's opposed to this bill. He said he's opposed to this bill. This bill passed unanimously. Unanimously means that every Republican, as well as every Democrat, wanted to reach out to provide for child nutrition for America's children.  This bill, I believe, enjoys the majority's support on this floor. We'll pass this bill, and we will pass it tomorrow, but we're going to give Members on this side of the aisle, as well as on your side of the aisle, an opportunity to pass an amendment that in effect says, okay, if you want to put these regulations on these small providers in these small jurisdictions, fine, we will do it; we want to protect children as much as you do. And I've said that during the substance of our debate, that we wanted to protect children, and I'm sure you want to make sure the children are well fed.  So, my belief is that we will rise now. We will come back on this amendment, which is not related. We'll give you an opportunity to vote on your amendment, and then we are going to pass this bill and send it to the President of the United States, as the Senate of the United States unanimously voted to do.
