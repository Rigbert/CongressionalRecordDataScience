 More troubling, the time of vacancies in courts around the country have remained at or above 90 for 2 years. We should be acting on the other 27 judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and ready for an up-or-down vote. Never during either Republican or Democratic administrations have I seen a time when nominations, approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, then wait month after month after month to be considered on the floor.  Mr. President, President Obama came to Congress 2 weeks ago and made a compelling case for passing the American Jobs Act. The bill he asked us to pass includes bipartisan proposals that have received broad approval in the past from members of both parties, including extensions of tax relief for businesses to encourage hiring. They are consensus proposals we can enact today. We should answer the President's call and act right away to help get Americans back to work and grow the economy. With the unemployment rate at an unacceptable 9 percent, we in Congress should be doing all we can to help our fellow Americans.  There is another unacceptable rate that we can help change to the benefit of all Americans. That is the judicial vacancy rate. It now stands at 11 percent, with 94 vacancies on Federal courts around the country. We can act today to bring down that rate dramatically by considering and confirming 29 judicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee that are awaiting final Senate action. With very few exceptions, the judicial nominations now on the calendar are not controversial and could be confirmed today.  Twenty-five of the 29 judicial nominations on the Senate Calendar were reported unanimously, and all but 1 of the 29 was reported with significant bipartisan support. All 28 of these consensus nominees have been favorably reported after a fair but thorough process, including an extensive background material on each nominee and the opportunity for all Senators on the committee, Democratic and Republican, to meet with and question the nominees. They have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. These are the kinds of consensus nominees that in past years would have been considered and confirmed within days or weeks of being reported, not delayed for weeks and months.  Certainly this was the practice we followed during President Bush's two terms, when consensus judicial nominees reported without any objection by the Judiciary Committee were confirmed an average of 28 days after they were reported. In President Obama's nearly 3 years in office that wait time for unanimously reported nominees to be considered by the Senate has nearly tripled to 78 days, and that number continues to climb as the delays continue. It is taking nearly three times as long for nominees that are by every measure consensus, noncontroversial nominations. They are nearly all confirmed unanimously when the Senate is finally allowed to vote. We should act today and not delay further.  The effects of these unnecessary delays have been dramatic and damaging. During the first years of the Bush and Clinton administrations, we were able to reduce vacancies significantly by confirming judges. The vacancies that had numbered over 100 early in those administrations were dramatically reduced by this juncture. By early September in the third year of the Bush administration judicial vacancies had been reduced to 54. By early September in the third year of the Clinton administration they had been reduced to 55. In contrast, the judicial vacancies now in September of the third year of the Obama administration stand at 94, with a vacancy rate of 11 percent, nearly double where it stood at this point in President Bush's third year.  As the Congressional Research Service confirmed in a recent report, this is a historically high level of vacancies, and this is now the longest period of historically high vacancy rates on the Federal judiciary in the last 35 years.  Even though Federal judicial vacancies have remained near or above 90 for more than 2 years, the Senate's Republican leadership continues to delay votes on qualified, consensus nominations. Republican obstruction has led to a backlog of over two dozen judicial nominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar, nearly half of them to fill judicial emergency vacancies. No consensus nomination to fill a judicial vacancy should be left to languish on the calendar 1 day longer than necessary, let alone for months and months.  Millions and millions of Americans are directly affected by this obstruction. More than half of all Americans--nearly 170 million--live in districts or circuits that have a vacancy that would be filled today if the Senate would act. More than half of all States--27--are served by courts that have nominations currently pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The Republican leadership should explain to the millions of Americans in these States why they will not vote. They should explain to the people of Louisiana, Maine, New York, Texas, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wyoming, Alaska, California, Delaware and Arizona why there continue to be vacancies on the Federal district courts in their States that could easily be filled if the Senate would vote on the President's qualified, consensus nominees. They should explain to the people of the many States that comprise the Second Circuit--Vermont's circuit--and the Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Circuits why those important Federal appeals courts are short on badly needed judges who could be confirmed today.  These 170 million Americans should not have to wait more weeks and months for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country. They should not have to bear the brunt of having too few judges available to do the work of the Federal courts. At atime when judicial vacancies remain above 90, these needless delays perpetuate the judicial vacancies crisis that Chief Justice Roberts wrote of last December and that the President, the Attorney General, bar associations and chief judges around the country have urged us to join together to end. The Senate can and should be doing a better job working to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans across the country.  Some have pointed to delays on judicial nominations in the past, real or imagined, to justify the continuing failure to take serious action to address the vacancies crisis. They recall selected instances where Democrats voted against some of President Bush's controversial nominees to justify the across the board freeze on dozens of consensus nominees. They forget the progress we were able to make in those years to confirm judicial nominees and fill vacancies. We confirmed 100 judges in the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002. The Senate has yet to confirm 100 judges in this, the 32nd month of the Obama administration. This is another issue on which I hope that we can rise above what the President called ``the political circus'' to return to Senate's tradition practice of quickly considering and confirming consensus judicial nominations.  At the end of President Bush's first 4 years in office, the Senate had confirmed 205 of his judicial nominees. We have a long way to go to reach that total before the end of next year. At this point in the Presidency of George W. Bush, 149 Federal circuit and district court judges had been confirmed: On September 19 of the third year of President Clinton's administration, 162 Federal circuit and district court judges had been confirmed. By comparison, although there are 29 judicial nominees stalled and awaiting final consideration by the Senate--many of them stalled since May and June--we have yet to confirm even 100 of President Obama's circuit and district court nominees.  I hope that we can come together to return to regular order in the consideration of nominations as we have on the Judiciary Committee. I have thanked the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator Grassley, many times for his cooperation with me to make sure that the committee continues to make progress in the consideration of nominations. Regrettably, it has not been matched on the floor, where the refusal by Republican leadership to come to regular time agreements to consider nominations has put our progress--our positive action--at risk.  The two judicial nominations we consider today are the kind of nominees we can and should consider more quickly.  The nomination of Timothy Cain to fill a judicial emergency in the District of South Carolina has the support of both his Republican home State Senators--Senators Graham and DeMint. Senator Graham was a law partner with Judge Cain in the 1990s, and he has spoken to the committee with enthusiasm about Judge Cain's experience and qualifications. During his 25-year legal career, Judge Cain has served as a city and county attorney, as an assistant prosecutor and a public defender, and as a judge in family court for the past 11 years. He has been selected to sit by designation on the South Carolina Supreme Court on five occasions. Judge Cain has seen the practice of law from all sides, and he will be a strong addition to the Federal bench.  John Ross is nominated to fill a judicial emergency in the Eastern District of Missouri and has the bipartisan support of his home State Senators. Judge Ross has served as a State judge in Missouri for over a decade. Since 2009, he has been the presiding judge for Missouri's 21st Judicial Circuit. He previously spent 9 years as the St. Louis County counselor, and 12 years as a State prosecutor, where he rose through the ranks to become the chief trial attorney in the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office. Judge Ross has served the people of Missouri for his entire professional career. I am glad that the Senate will vote on his nomination today.  Both of these nominees will fill judicial emergency vacancies. Both have the support of their home State Republican Senators. Both were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, without any objection from a single Republican or Democratic member of the committee. They are both by any measure consensus nominees. Yet, their nominations have been pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar for 117 days, since May 26, with no reason or justification given for the delay.  While I am pleased we will consider these two nominations today and confirm them, this has taken far too long. More troubling still, these nominations are only 2 of the 29 judicial nominations reported favorably by the committee and ready for final Senate action. Despite a serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country, where vacancies have remained at or above 90 for over 2 years, Senate Republicans refuse to consent to consider nominations more efficiently. I hope that this month Senators will finally join together to act to bring down the excessive number of vacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation for far too long. We can and must do better for the nearly 170 million Americans being made to suffer by these unnecessary delays.                     Vermonters Helping Vermonters  Mr. President, I will continue because I am not taking time from anybody on this. The time has been reserved to talk some more, to talk about what has been happening in Vermont.  I have spoken many times about my native State and what we went through with Tropical Storm Irene.  I was born in Vermont. My family came to Vermont in the 1800s. Nothing in my lifetime has approached the devastation we see in our State. Vermonters have continued to struggle to regain a sense of normalcy. Bridges, railroads, and roads remain damaged or wiped out. Those many homes, businesses, and schools that were not entirely washed away are in need of profound repairs. Farmers are struggling to salvage what they can of their livelihoods.  It is late September. In Vermont, October can bring snow. But amid the din and destruction of the debris of this horrific natural disaster come hundreds of heartening stories of either things I have seen firsthand or I have heard about Vermonters rising to the occasion to help their neighbors and friends, even strangers, to mobilize to recover.  I saw a man shoveling out a store. I asked him if it was his store. He said: No. I said: Do you live here? He said: No; I live two towns over. I said: Do you know the store owner? He said: No. But, he said, I wasn't damaged. I wasn't hurt; he was. I would hope that if I was hurt, somebody would help me.  Vermonters are known for our sense of community. We are known for our plentiful determination. Our State's people have proven their fortitude tenfold in the aftermath of this disaster.  The Weston Playhouse, a renowned playhouse, where actors from around the country come in the summertime, had half their theater performance stage wiped out by the floods. The theater group stripped the entire playhouse, set up a temporary stage so they could perform their upcoming show.  The Town Meeting House in Pittsfield has been converted into a medical clinic. The Air National Guard dropped more than 14,000 Meals Ready to Eat in the town so that those stranded had enough food. In addition to those meals, many others have donated meat and other goods so there is plenty of food to go around. Schools have fundraised to help provide free hot breakfasts to students, and Vermonters around the State have opened their homes to those who have lost theirs during the storm.  Various fundraisers, including some college students who are classmates of my son, have a group called Phish. They did their first live concert in years and they raised over $1 million--just one thing after another. But then, there are also bake sales and car washes to raise money.  One way where the indomitable Vermont spirit has endured is through the remarkable efforts of Vermont students and schools. Schools have started. I know; I have grandchildren going to school there. The schools faced tremendous challenges to open their doors just days after Irene descended on us. Many had to delay opening for a fewdays because the school buildings were serving as community centers for families who had lost their homes and children who had lost everything in the storm. But let me show a couple examples of students making the most.  Look at this New York Times picture. This is the Barstow Memorial School students in Chittenden. Chittenden is actually in Rutland County, down in the southwest part of our State. They used this trail to navigate on their way to school. They were going to go to school. They were cut off. There was no road to go to school, to get to the schoolbus. The parents of these children said: They are going to school.  Look at the mud on this child's legs. Look at the people. Look at them walking, carrying things. ``We are going to school.''  The washout on Route 4 took weeks to fix, so these students slogged along a muddy trail to meet vans and cars half a mile away, whether it was raining or dark or cold or anything else, and these cars carried the students to buses to take them the rest of the way to school. Community members helped chaperone the children on the trail. The whole community turned out. They stood there and they passed out snacks and refreshments.  When these students arrived at school, they were caked with mud. They didn't look like the children who normally come to school, but they were proud of their twice-a-day routine. They made it to school.  Moretown Elementary. This is one town over from where I live. I had a grandmother born there. They fared worse than many schools in the State. The buildings sustained damage and flooding overtook the school's septic system. The principal and teachers came together. They organized a series of field trips to get the kids out of the devastated town so they could continue in their studies. They visited Shelburne Farms and Montshire Museum, just to name two venues. Last week, with the school still closed, they met. They met. Look at that. The baseball field was covered by donated tents, as seen in this photo from the Web site of the Vermont Public Radio, where teachers held classes. The school's offices operated from popup trailers. Kids took well to their new school schedule, and teachers there are glad to provide the support they need.  The children of Vermont and their families and teachers are doing their utmost to make their way through these extremely difficult times. But these inventive measures are not permanent solutions. Vermonters are doing all they can and more to help each other recover, which makes it all the more dismaying that some in Congress seemed determined to play politics with disaster relief. Millions of American families and businesses, not just in Vermont but across the country have been devastated by an unprecedented series of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters this year, reaching into nearly every single State of our Union. This is no time to dawdle or to ignore the urgent needs of fellow Americans. We are one Nation, and until now we have willingly and generously come to the aid of our fellow Americans in times of need.  This is the time to help our fellow Americans who have suffered tremendous losses. Many of our states will take years to recover. I am pleased the Senate passed this essential bill last week, and I urge the House to send this emergency disaster relief bill to the President, without further delay.  We Americans are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan. Let's spend this money amount to rebuild America for Americans.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Iowa.
