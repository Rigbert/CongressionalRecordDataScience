  First, I thank my colleague, Senator Baucus. I appreciate his bipartisanship on this matter. The people of Montana are well served by his leadership on the Senate Finance Committee. In addition, I thank the Democratic staff on the Finance Committee, Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck and Jon Selib, for their work.  At this time, I should also commend the work of my staff on the Finance Committee, Dean Zerbe for the charitable provisions and Ed McClellan for the corporate shelter legislation. In addition, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr and Diann Howland were critical in putting this bill together.  It is clear that without the drive and energy of Senators Santorum and Lieberman we would not have had this success. I thank them for their efforts and their staff: Randy Brandt and Chuck Ludlam.  I also thank all those behind the scenes who have toiled on the CARE Act. Roger Colvineaux, Ron Schultz, Joe Naga from the Joint Committee on Taxation, as well as Mark Mathiesen from Legislative Counsel who did all the drafting.  Finally, let me note just a few of the members of the administration who ably served the President in this effort: Jim Towey, David Kuo, and Susan Brown at Treasury.  Thanks to all for their efforts.
