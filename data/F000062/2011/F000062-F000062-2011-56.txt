 President, if I understand this correctly, it is, as Senator Alexander has stated, that the effort is to, under a germane rule, have the Energy and Water appropriations bill brought to the floor. If that is achieved, then all Members, including Democratic Members, should get their amendments to the floor as soon as possible.  We know what this week is like. We know the Defense authorization bill has to come to the floor. We know there are other items that have to come to the floor this week.
