 In addition to the National Treasury Employees Union's failure to discuss the success of private debt collection programs at other Federal agencies--I mentioned them, Education and one other branch of the Treasury Department--the National Treasury Employees Union also conveniently fails to mention that the private collection agencies hired by the IRS have consistently scored customer satisfaction ratings above 95 percent, while the IRS collection employees appear to be scoring at less than 65 percent.  The National Treasury Employees Union also fails to mention the amount of employee time devoted to union activities is proportionately higher at the Internal Revenue Service than it is in comparison to other Federal Departments and agencies. Commissioner Everson testified to this at the Senate Finance Committee tax gap hearing held on April 18, 2007. Just think, then, of the additional revenue IRS could be collecting if union employees were actually doing the job they were paid to do instead of spending taxpayers' dollars to lobby Congress to do away with a program that is collecting money owed under $25,000 a year that would not otherwise be collected. Of course, they do not like that program.  Since the omnibus provision prohibiting the IRS from using 2009 appropriations to fund the program office may actually kill the program, I have this amendment before the Senate. I mean, at least it is filed. It is not before us yet. I would not support a government program that is unsuccessful, and this private debt collection program is no different. However, we do not have enough information to know whether this program is effective, and, given the success of such programs at other agencies, I believe it can be successful at the Internal Revenue Service. It surely is successful at the Education Department.  Last week, I, along with Senator Harkin, my colleague from Iowa, and Mr. Schumer, the senior Senator from New York--the three of us--sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Geithner and IRS Commissioner Shulman asking for more information so we can actually make an informed decision on the effectiveness of the private debt collection program.  The letter asks for, among other things, additional information to measure the cost-effectiveness of the program, information to gauge the results of the collection agencies, and more information on the use of collectionagencies by other Government agencies. So all my colleagues are able to read the letter, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2009.     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,     Secretary of the Treasury,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Douglas H. Shulman,     Commissioner of Internal Revenue,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman: We are      writing regarding the private debt collection program (PDC)      that is being implemented by the Internal Revenue Service      (IRS) and has been in place since 2006. We are aware that      many critics believe that the program does not operate      effectively, and they lead an annual effort to strip the IRS      of all authority to implement it. But we do not believe that      the necessary data has been collected and disseminated that      would allow an informed decision to be made about the      program's long-term effectiveness.       Make no mistake: If the program is genuinely unsuccessful,      we would be among the first to concur that it should be      terminated. However, we remain very concerned that IRS will      terminate the PDC program before a complete and thorough      accounting of the program is conducted. For example, while      some are critical of the effectiveness and efficiency of the      PDC program, we have yet to see solid, reliable numbers.      Criticism of the program's return on investment do not      account for its start-up or investment costs, and ignore the      fact that the program has not been fully operational for any      of its two years.       We appreciate that the IRS has decided to use an      independent third party to study the effectiveness of the      program, and its report may be issued as early as next week.      But it is not clear that the new study will discuss ways to      increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the PDC program      or explain why similar programs at other federal agencies      appear to be successful. For example, the Department of      Education uses PCAs to collect student loan debt, and the      Department of Treasury Financial Management Service uses them      to collect small business loans, farm loans, and other      similar debt owed to the federal government, and these      programs appear to work well with little controversy.       Given the amount of uncollected tax debt, a program that      was allowed to operate at full capacity would have the      potential to be successful, yet the current program has only      operated in fits and starts. In fact, during the past fifteen      years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the      Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)      have issued numerous reports discussing the IRS's problems in      collecting delinquent debt. A list of these reports is      attached. Some of the key findings include:       In its May 1993 report, New Delinquent Tax Collection      Methods for IRS, the GAO highlighted the complexity of the      IRS's collection process. GAO presented a number of options      to improve the IRS's delinquent debt process, including      establishing early telephone contact with debtors and      utilizing private collection agencies. So there is a long      track record indicating that a well-run PDC program could      be successful.       In its June 2007 report, Tax Debt Collection: IRS Has a      Complex Process to Attempt to Collect Billions of Dollars in      Unpaid Taxes, the GAO description of the IRS's collection      process indicates that IRS has not experienced significant      improvement in its collection function since 1993. The report      also states that the total unpaid tax debt as of fiscal year      2007 was $290.1 billion, of which $184.8 billion was      classified as non-potentially collectible inventory and $25.5      billion was deemed potentially collectible, but not in active      collection status. This would seem to be further      justification for a viable PDC program.       In its December 2008 report, Tax Administration: IRS's 2008      Filing Season Generally Successful Despite Challenges,      Although IRS Could Expand Enforcement During Returns      Processing, the GAO notes that, because collections staff was      reassigned to answer telephone calls regarding stimulus      payments, the IRS reported $655 million in forgone revenue      through August 2008 alone, which means that the number for      the whole calendar year will likely be greater. If the IRS      viewed the PDC program as part of its larger collection      program, rather than a stand-alone program, PCAs may have      been able to complete the work of the collections staff that      had been temporarily reassigned.       It is important for critics of the program to recognize      that the IRS's PDC program is designed to go after tax debts      that have been conceded by taxpayers, but not paid. What's      more, even if the IRS enforcement budget were significantly      increased, the accounts turned over to PDC are those that      would still likely be ignored by IRS collection agents. In      his May 2007 testimony before the Committee on Ways and      Means, Subcommittee on Oversight, Acting Commissioner Kevin      Brown, confirmed that IRS would not otherwise pursue these      debts even if IRS were given additional resources.       We remain cautiously optimistic that a PDC program could be      successful in helping to close the tax gap, but only if it is      allowed to operate at full capacity. Only after that point      could a determination be made about whether the program is      meeting its objectives. We are hopeful that the report being      prepared will provide answers to the following questions. If      not, we hope that you will take the time to let us know the      following key information before the IRS makes any final      decision about the PDC program:       The primary argument for terminating the IRS PDC program is      that it is not cost effective. In order to better understand      the program's revenues and costs, we would like a monthly      accounting of all funds expended on the program since its      inception, including a breakdown of all costs for IRS      personnel involved in administering the program (salary      levels, positions descriptions, etc.), as well as costs      associated with technology and travel.       We would also like to know the number of cases placed with      the private agencies since the program began, including the      number of cases for which the amount was collected in full,      the number of resulting installment agreements, and the      number of cases recalled and reasons for recall. We would      also like an accounting of the commissions earned by the PCAs      since the program started.       Some taxpayers choose to ignore the IRS's many letters and      respond to the IRS only after it notifies them that their      cases will be referred to a PCA. In these cases, where the      IRS benefits from the use of the PCA's names, we would like      to know why the PCAs are not compensated when those taxpayers      settle those debts.       We would also like for you to describe how IRS's collection      process and procedure differs from the process and procedure      used by PCAs in collecting IRS debts, including the IRS's      ability to make outbound phone calls, negotiate or settle tax      debts, and impose liens and levies.       Another criticism of the program is that the IRS has run      out of cases that can be assigned to the current PCAs, which      is why other PCAs have not been added. However, the exclusion      list, which was not determined by statute but by the IRS,      appears fairly extensive. In addition, as noted above, the      GAO's June 2008 report indicates that, as of fiscal year      2007, there was at least $25.5 of potentially collectible      inventory that IRS was not actively pursuing. We would like      to know how each of the exclusion criteria was determined.       Tables 5, 6 and 7 of the GAO's June 2008 provide a      breakdown of the total delinquent debt for fiscal years 2002      through 2007. Please update these tables to add numbers for      fiscal year 2008 and provide a breakdown of this amount by      the exclusion criteria. We would also like to know why all      potentially collectible inventory is not in active collection      status and cannot be assigned to PCAs.       We would also like to know whether Treasury or any other      agency has studied the cost effectiveness of the use of PCAs      by Treasury or other federal agencies. If such studies are      available, we would like to see them.       Finally, you may be aware that there are almost 200 jobs in      both Iowa and New York that will be lost if the IRS PDC      program is terminated prematurely. Given the current economic      crisis, such job losses should not be forced to occur before      a full accounting of the program's success is made available      and/or the program is allowed to operate as originally      intended. The recently enacted Economic Recovery Act, which      will further strain IRS resources, is an additional reason      why the PCAs should be allowed to operate until the success      or failure of the program can be definitively determined.       If you have any questions regarding the above, please do      not hesitate to contact our staff. We also ask that you brief      our staff on the forthcoming study before the study is      finalized and made public.           Sincerely,     Chuck Grassley,       U.S. Senator.     Charles E. Schumer,       U.S. Senator.     Tom Harkin,       U.S. Senator.
