Chairman, this legislation will allow State Attorneys General to seek Federal court injunctions against any out-of-State companies that illegally direct ship alcohol to consumers. These illegal direct shippers are bypassing State excise and sales taxes, operating without required licenses, and most appallingly, illegally selling alcohol to underage persons.  It is important to note what H.R. 2031 does not do. It does not change existing State laws, and makes no restrictions on legal Internet or catalog sales. It does not open the door to Internet taxation. In fact, the word ``Internet'' does not appear anywhere in the text. It does not create a new Internet E commerce policy. It only deals with direct shipments of alcohol.  The legislation has bipartisan support. It was adopted overwhelmingly as an amendment to the other body's juvenile justice bill. Attorneys General from 23 States have signed a letter of support on this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of States' rights, and urge my colleagues to allow States to enforce their own alcohol laws by voting in favor of this much needed legislation.
