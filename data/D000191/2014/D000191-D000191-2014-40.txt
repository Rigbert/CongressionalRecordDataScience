Chairman, unfortunately, the gentleman misstated what his amendment does. It doesn't say that individuals filing litigation under the Endangered Species Act must disclose whether or not they receive any Federal funds and are using any Federal funds in this case. It doesn't say that.  It says that Fish and Wildlife Service must determine. How is the Fish and Wildlife Service going to determine whether or not someone used Federal funds?  As he said, money is fungible. He is saying they may be violating the circular that prohibits nonprofit organizations from doing this. They may be violating the circular.  These are, of course, criminal offenses, that prohibit State, local, and Indian tribal governments from using Federal money for such litigation. He is saying that may be go going on, so then Fish and Wildlife should just discover it themselves.  How is that going to work? It sends Fish and Wildlife on a mission that it is not equipped to handle. They can't say: pretty please, tell us.  If someone is violating the law, they are probably not going to volunteer it to Fish and Wildlife.                              {time}  1645  If you wanted to do this, you would have to write an amendment that amends the Rules of Civil Procedure or whatever--I am not a lawyer--that would require that these litigants disclose at the time of filing their litigation. Saying Fish and Wildlife should find out after it has been filed is absolutely absurd.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).  The amendment was agreed to.                    Announcement by the Acting Chair  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 113-563 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. DeFazio of Oregon.  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Holt of New Jersey.  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. DeFazio  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                             Recorded Vote  The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.
