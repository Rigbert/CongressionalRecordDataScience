 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I respectfully request that the following testimonials be included in the Congressional Record.                       Regarding Juvenile Justice        (By Sean Fontaine, Krystal Turnbaugh, and James Nichols)       SEAN FONTAINE. Hi. I am going to begin. My name is Sean      Fontaine. This is Krystal Turnbaugh and James Nichols. We all      represent YouthBuild, and we're all members of the policy      committee.       We come here today to discuss juvenile justice, the idea of      what ongoing problems in the community with juvenile      offenders, usually in age brackets of 16- to 17-year-olds,      and how it affects the community in terms of positive      reinforcement and what we need to do for programs to      financially fund these reinforcement types of things.       I got some notes here somewhere.       I'm just going to start with a brief summary. But I'm      speaking on behalf of juvenile offenders on the juvenile      justice system. We all know the community is just as      responsible for the upbringing of these delinquents as they      are themselves. Most people fear the youth of America, and it      is not a surprise. There are 2.4 million 16- to 24-year-olds      in the U.S. that live low-income lifestyles. 360,000 of them      are in prison. There are only 300,000 job-training openings      among the 2.4 million students, which means that there are a      lot of kids running rampant with no positive reinforcement      and nothing to do.       There is a very few amount of people that are not involved      in the community, because a community involves everybody,      even though delinquents are the weakest links, I guess. But      in 1997 alone, drug-law violations increased 125 percent, and      I'm sure crime has a lot to do with drug use. Drug use is      definitely an ongoing problem in my community, and that's      something that we definitely need help with. We need more      money for youth programs to support drug-free environments,      recreational facilities, and low-income housing programs like      YouthBuild that promote positive reinforcement and good life      styles and living situations.       The biggest problem with juvenile cases today, I believe,      is the system that's handling with them. I don't believe it      is right to throw kids in jail. We need to improve conditions      in SRS today. I attended a meeting, there was a partnership      in service, with Dave Martin, the director of SRS. According      to him, the caseloads are just unmanageable for their      caseworkers, and they're completely understaffed, underpaid,      and overwhelmed,     which leads kids to believe that no one cares about them,      especially in the system of social rehabilitation services.       YouthBuild honors community. YouthBuild has just made      unparalleled contributions to its community, and the      residents are proud of its participants. And it's one of the      many programs. There are 250-something YouthBuilds      nationwide, and there is a proposal for more money. We are in      the process of doing a HUD grant to get more money for those      programs.       I know, from my experiences, it is unlike any program I      have been in, in terms of juvenile offenders, and that is why      I speak about this as I do. I know that the system that deals      with juvenile offenders is basically a ``first-come, first-     serve'' basis, that you need to be referred to by programs      like Spectrum or the Department of Corrections.       Now, for kids that would like to intervene on negative      pathways, we need to have programs available for kids to want      to enroll for themselves, alternative programs in jail.      Instead of, like, CSE is a program and Pathways is a program      in jail for sexual offenders and drug addicts. There should      be a way to intervene and have other programs available for      kids that just need positive reinforcement. These programs      can't just possibly apply to everybody's need areas.       But more importantly, people need to listen. Problems exist      everywhere, and we see them and we try to solve them. Our      current juvenile system doesn't respect individual cases. It      is merely paperwork and statistics, seemingly. These      conditions need to improve. I know it cannot be done in a      six-minute segment, a six-year or a 600-year projection. The      important thing here today is the acknowledgement of these      problems and spreading of awareness to parents who are trying      to raise these troubled teens.                         Regarding Credit Cards                            (By Kelly Green)       KELLY GREEN. I would like to begin by asking if the people      who plan on attending college would raise their hand.       Thank you.       How many of you have a credit card at this time?       Thanks.       Two-thirds of you that raised your hand for going to      college will have a credit card while you are there,      according to Keeping an Eye on Junior's College Habits by      Terry Savage. That is completely normal. The unimaginable      part is, the average undergraduate will leave college about      $12,000 in credit card debt. This is due to the fact that the      average unpaid balance left on a credit card is $2,200. You      most likely won't just own only one credit card either. The      average number is three cards.       As a high school junior with college in my near future,      these statistics scare me. Not only am I paying more than      double what my parents did, but I also now have to worry      about a credit card company luring me into a trap that could      take away my future. According to chapter one of Paying for      Your Child's College Education by Margaret Smith, a year at      Harvard in the 1970s was barely $5,000. And between 1995 to      '96, the freshmen had to come up with $27,575. And today, on      average, a year in a public college costs about $6,824, and      in a private college costs about $17,630.       As you can see, college costs have risen drastically over      the years, due to more and more students attending. The      median income of families in America who have college-age age      children has nearly tripled. Today only 30 percent of the      public college costs is paid by a family's income. The rest      is coming from loans and grants. These loans have to be paid      off somehow, and what better way than a credit card or two,      or that is what the credit card companies lead to you think.       According to a Salliemae Financial Advice Internet site, a      $2,000 tuition bill on a credit card with 18.5 percent APR,      with only a minimum payment of $20 each month, will take      eleven years to pay off, plus you will pay over $1,900 in      interest on top of the initial $2,000. In the end, you will      be paying around $3,900 total. I don't know about you, but I      can't come up with that much money all the time. Credit card      companies know that. They aren't stupid. But they also know,      one way or another, they will have the money in the end, even      at the cost of your future.       Could you imagine being 19 years old, a sophomore in      college, and filing bankruptcy because you owe a company      $23,000? This is a true statement according to the College      Student Credit Card Protection Act. This sophomore isn't      alone either. In 1999, 100,000 Americans under the age of 25      declared bankruptcy. As you can see, I am not the first      person to bring this issue up. The legislature, too, has      discussed this issue.       In this day and age, more and more young people like myself      are being forced into bad credit ratings, without even      starting a full-time job. We will be forced to live with this      slander on our name for years after. It will affect our      ability to buy a house, car, and, depending on our field of      interest, starting a business will be almost impossible.       Credit ratings follow you for the rest of your life. Young      people like me and many others shouldn't have to file      bankruptcy so young, or be haunted by bad credit ratings. We      have our whole lives ahead of us.       Things can change, and should. I strongly suggest that we      take the time to make change happen. We can't eliminate all      debt and credit problems, but we can lower them. High schools      today don't offer much for money management classes. Freshman      in college are going in blind to what these companies are      doing. The school should be required, at some point in the      senior year of high school, to educate us about what is      happening and how to manage money so we can protect ourselves      from such debt.       Another problem that is influencing the debt is guidance      counselors. They are pressuring college on to students who      don't want to attend. So when they get to college, they end      up dropping out, and are stuck with the costs. And that, in      itself, is causing higher tuition and more debt. I'm not      saying that guidance counselors should stop promoting      college, but should not make students feel forced to attend.      This way, in the end, it will be worthwhile for them.       The credit card company should keep the amount an      individual can put on a card low, instead of letting us dig      ourselves a hole we can't get out of. John Simpson, of the      University of Indiana, stated, ``Credit cards are a terrible      thing.'' I strongly agree. College students shouldn't be      forced to ruin their lives by the bright, ludicrous ideas      credit card companies are putting into their head.       Lastly, I would like to thank you, Mr. Sanders, for      allowing teens like me an opportunity to have a voice on      issues that affect us now or will in the near future.                               ____________________
