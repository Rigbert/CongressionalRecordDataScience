President, one of our most preeminent oral historians of our time turns 100 on December 7. Timuel Black was born near the end of World War I and has been the keeper of the soul of the south side of Chicago to this very day. World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but we know some of America's greatest wars were yet to come. Tim Black was on the frontlines of many of those fights. As a historian, as an activist, and a humanist, he fought and continues to fight for the dignity of people and a better future.  Professor Black was born in 1918, in Birmingham, AL, the son of sharecroppers and grandson of slaves. At 8 months, his family moved to Chicago, joining the first wave of migration of African Americans from the Deep South to the North. His family settled in an area of Chicago then-called the Black Belt. It is now known as Bronzeville.  Tim would go on to celebrate and shape the history of Chicago's Black Belt. To Tim, this is sacred ground. But first, he went to Burke Elementary School and DuSable High School. His classmates included Nat King Cole; future publisher and founder of Jet and Ebony Magazine, John H. Johnson, the first African American on Forbes' 400 most wealthy; and future Mayor Harold Washington. Don Cornelius and musician Sonny Cohn also were among the many famous students of DuSable High School.  It was on his birthday in 1941 that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Army drafted Tim into a segregated army 2 years later. In the last 2 years of World War II, Tim experienced the worst of the war. He participated in the Normandy invasion, the Battle of the Bulge, and the liberation of Paris. He earned four battle stars. But it was what he saw while liberating the Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp, that altered the way Tim saw the world. The horrors of the human capacity for cruelty at Buchenwald filled Tim with despair.  He returned to Chicago, resolved to fight for human rights and human dignity. He earned an undergraduate degree from Roosevelt University and a master's degree from the University of Chicago. Tim started his professional career as a social worker, but he quickly discovered that his real love was, in his words, ``teaching young men and women about the world they live in and how to be responsible citizens of that world.''  For 40 years, Tim did just that through his teaching positions at DuSable and other Chicago public schools, as well as Roosevelt University, Columbia College Chicago, and schools in the City Colleges of Chicago system.  Tim also has spent his life on the frontlines of the struggle for human rights and dignity. At age 13, he walked his first picket line to protest the refusal of White-owned businesses in Bronzeville to hire Black clerks. As an organizer in labor and social justice movements of the 1940s and 1950s, he worked with Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Dubois.  Tim helped establish the Congress of Racial Equality and the United Packinghouse Workers of America labor union. I might not be where I am today were it not for Tim's work because it was the Packinghouse union that helped me work through college.  In December of 1955, Tim was watching television when he first saw an inspiring man in Montgomery, AL. He hopped on a plane to meet him. A year later, Tim convinced him to come to Chicago. This was the first time Dr. Martin Luther King would speak in the city. Tim then helped organize the Freedom Trains that carried thousands of Chicagoans to hear Dr. King roar ``I Have a Dream'' in Washington, DC, in 1963. In 1966, Tim was right there with Dr. King when an angry mob attacked him in Chicago's Marquette Park. Whenever there was a good fight against Jim Crow housing, segregated public beaches, job discrimination, or the shortchanging of Black students in public schools, you would always find Tim Black.  There is one student of Professor Black we all remember. A couple of decades ago, a young community organizer who had just returned to Chicago with a Harvard law degree asked Professor Black to teach him about organizing people so they could create a better life for themselves and their children. The young organizer and Professor Black became friends over the years. It was my privilege to invite Professor Black and his wonderful wife Zenobia Johnson-Black to be my guests as that community organizer swore an oath to become the President of the United States. I could not have had a better guest to see the history that he had helped make possible as Barack Obama became our first Black President.  Tim may have retired from teaching years ago, but we are all still students in his never-ending classroom. His three-volume history of Chicago's Black Belt, entitled ``Bridges of Memory,'' is the story of the great Black migration to Chicago from the Deep South, told by those who made that journey and by their descendants. His home in Hyde Park is an incomparable museum of stories about every place he has lived in Chicago. The theaters he first heard Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Billie Holliday are still alive and well in memories to be shared.  Happy birthday, Tim Black. Generations have grown up with a better appreciation of their homes and the history they inhabit because of you.                            ____________________
