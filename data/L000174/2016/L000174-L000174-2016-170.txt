President, today is the 62nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to justice and equality by ending racial segregation in our public schools. The unanimous Court overruled one of its worst precedents in Plessy v. Ferguson and held that ``in the field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''  For generations, the Brown v. Board decision has been viewed as a turning point in the effort to eradicate the shameful legacy of Jim Crow and racial segregation. On this anniversary, we are reminded of the significance of a strong and independent Supreme Court, as set forth in our Constitution. Americans respect the Court as our guardian of the Constitution and the rule of law. Each generation of Americans since the Nation's founding has worked to bend the arc of the moral universe further toward justice, seeking to fulfill the Constitution's stated purpose of forming ``a more perfect Union.'' In Brown v. Board, the Court's unanimous decision reflected that we are a nation of laws and that equal justice under law has meaning.  Unfortunately, while we commemorate this momentous Supreme Court decision today, we find the Supreme Court today weakened by Senate Republicans' current obstruction. It is an undisputable fact that the Republicans' refusal to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination means that the Supreme Court will be without a full nine justices for more than one of its terms. The Republican argument articulated in February that they should delay all consideration because it is an election year has no precedent and is unprincipled. It shows contempt for the Court as an institution and as an independent and coequal branch of government.  The result of Republicans' sustained obstruction is that the Court is taking on fewer cases, and even in the cases it does hear, it has repeatedly been unable to definitively resolve the issue before it. A May 1 article by Robert Barnes in the Washington Post notes that the number of cases that the Justices have accepted has fallen, and the experts in that article attribute this to the Court being down one member. As one expert noted in the article, ``there seem to be a number of `defensive denials,' meaning neither side of the ideologically split court wants to take some cases because of uncertainty about how it will turn out, or whether the court will be able to reach a decision.''  Another harmful effect of this Republican obstruction is that the Court has been contorting itself to avoid 4-4 splits by leaving the key questions of cases undecided. Just yesterday, in two different cases, the Court was unable to make a final decision on the merits. In both cases, the appellate courts are split on the law, and the Supreme Court was unable to live up to its name. One of the cases, Zubik v. Burwell, involved religiously affiliated employers' objections to their employees' health insurance coverage for contraception. The Court had already taken the unusual step of ordering supplemental briefing in the case, seemingly to avoid a 4-4 split. Even with the extra briefing, the Court was still unable to make a decision. Instead, it sent the issue back to the lower courts expressing ``no view on the merits of the cases.'' In the second case, Spokeo v. Robbins, the question at issue was Congress's ability to statutorily create rights that confer standing for plaintiffs to sue when those rights are violated. The case involves important privacy questions about Americans' power to take action when incorrect information is posted about them online. The Court, however, failed to reach the key question at issue. The effect is that the current split among the Circuit Courts of Appeals remains unresolved. As yesterday's New York Times editorialnotes, ``Every day that passes without a ninth justice undermines the Supreme Court's ability to function, and leaves millions of Americans waiting for justice or clarity as major legal questions are unresolved.''  In addition to these contortions, the Court has deadlocked in at least three instances on significant legal issues before it. These 4-4 splits have real, practical consequences. As a recent Economist article noted, ``By letting lower-court decisions stand but not requiring other courts to abide by the ruling, the stage is set for odd state-by-state or district-by-district distinctions when it comes to the meaning of laws or the constitution.'' I ask unanimous consent that all three articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Republicans' refusal to do their jobs and consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination diminishes the role of the Supreme Court. In nominating Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, President Obama has picked an eminently qualified judge who has more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. This is an individual who has received praise across the political spectrum. But instead of delving into his lengthy public service record for themselves, Republicans have decided to outsource their jobs to outside interest groups who have spent millions of dollars to smear Chief Judge Garland. And worse, they continue to refuse to allow Chief Judge Garland a chance to respond at a public hearing.  As long as they stick to this unprincipled position, Republicans will continue to undermine the Court's ability to serve its role under our Constitution as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Republicans should reverse course and treat the Court as the independent and coequal branch of government that it is.  So today, let us not only celebrate the Court's historic decision in Brown, but also resolve to return this venerated institution to full strength. It begins with giving Chief Judge Garland a fair public hearing and a vote.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 2016]  Scalia's Death Affecting Next Term, Too? Pace of Accepted Cases at                           Supreme Court Slows                           (By Robert Barnes)       The ways in which Justice Antonin Scalia's sudden death are      altering the current Supreme Court term have been widely      chronicled.       But it appears the absence of Scalia will be felt on the      court's work next term, as well.       The number of cases the justices have accepted has fallen,      meaning that a docket that in recent years has been smaller      than what is traditional is shrinking still.       The court has accepted only six cases since Scalia died      Feb. 13. The number is low compared with the average,      Scotusblog.com editor Amy Howe said at an event last week      reviewing the Supreme Court's work.       And none of the cases that the court has accepted for the      term that begins in October approach the level of controversy      that have marked the dramatic rulings of recent years.       A panel of court experts assembled by the Constitutional      Accountability Center last week offered a number of reasons      for the reduced workload.       But they boiled down to a reluctance of the ideologically      divided eight-member court to take on an issue in which it      might not be able to provide a clear answer.       First, a reminder of the enormous leeway the justices have      in setting their agenda.       An outraged citizen's vow to fight an injustice ``all the      way to the Supreme Court'' comes to pass only if the Supreme      Court consents.       With a few exceptions of cases the court is mandated to      consider, justices are unencumbered as they cull through the      thousands of petitions seeking review. In recent years, only      about 70 or so cases receive writs of certiorari--``cert      grants''--signaling that the justices will review the      decision of the lower court.       It takes the approval of four justices to schedule a case      for full briefing and oral argument. The court makes those      decisions all year--it could announce on Monday that it has      accepted more cases--but generally those granted after      January are placed on the court's docket for the term that      begins the following October.       So there is plenty of time for the court to pick up the      pace. But based on what's in the pipeline, Howe suggested      that there could be plenty of lulls in the court's schedule.       If Senate Republicans hold true to their pledge not to hold      hearings or a vote on President Obama's nomination of U.S.      Circuit Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat before      the election, the court will enter the next term one justice      down. And if a lame-duck Senate after the election does not      consider him, it would be sometime in the spring, at the      earliest, before the court is back to full strength.       John P. Elwood, a Washington lawyer and Supreme Court      specialist, said ``having an extra member matters.''       He watches the Supreme Court's docket as closely as anyone,      writing a column for Scotusblog about the cases the court      considers at its private conferences and which seem likely to      be granted.       He said there seem to be a number of ``defensive denials,''      meaning neither side of the ideologically split court wants      to take some cases because of uncertainty about how it will      turn out, or whether the court will be able to reach a      decision.       ``The court already is a defensive enough institution,''      Elwood said. He said that Justices Clarence Thomas and      Stephen G. Breyer have noted that the court is cautious about      granting cert in the best of times.       They ``have said essentially, `You can't screw up by not      taking a case, you can only screw up by taking a case,' ''      Elwood said. ``And now there's one more reason not to take a      case: that the court may blow up and not be able to decide      the thing.''       Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the      NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the apparent      slowdown is another consequence of waiting to fill Scalia's      seat.       It is a rebuttal to ``all of these sanguine statements that      we can have eight justices and it just doesn't matter, we'll      just kick the can down the road,'' she said.       Ifill often disagrees with the decisions of the      conservative court but said that everyone agrees ``this is a      branch of government that actually gets the job done.'' She      added: ``I think the court is trying to be prudent and not be      a participant in its own demise by not taking these cases it      can't decide.''       Brianne J. Gorod, the Constitutional Accountability      Center's chief counsel, said justices ``know that if the      issue is an important one it will probably come back in a      year or two, when hopefully there will be a ninth justice.''       Andrew J. Pincus, another Washington lawyer who practices      before the court, agreed with this analysis but said it is      the wrong approach for the court to take.       ``This sounds a little self-interested,'' Pincus began, but      he said the court has a ``wrongheaded view'' about the      frequency with which issues appear before it, and a      ``complete misperception of the real world impact of lower-     court decisions that are out there for a long time that      people in the real world have to comply with.''       But if it is easy to detect a slowdown in the court's      grants, it is more difficult to identify which cases the      court might have taken if at full strength.       The court makes those decisions in secret. No vote total is      announced and rarely is an explanation given.       So there can only be speculation about which cases are      skipped because the court is divided, or which the justices      agreed the lower court got it right and there is no work for      them to do.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2016]                       The Crippled Supreme Court       Every day that passes without a ninth justice undermines      the Supreme Court's ability to function, and leaves millions      of Americans waiting for justice or clarity as major legal      questions are unresolved.       On Monday, the eight-member court avoided issuing a ruling      on one of this term's biggest cases, Zubik v. Burwell, which      challenges the Affordable Care Act's requirement that      employers' health care plans cover the cost of birth control      for their employees. In an unsigned opinion, the court sent      the lawsuits back to the lower federal courts, with      instructions to try to craft a compromise that would be      acceptable to everyone.       This is the second time since Justice Antonin Scalia's      death in February that the court has failed to reach a      decision in a high-profile case; in March, the court split 4      to 4 in a labor case involving the longstanding right of      public-sector unions, which represent millions of American      workers, to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers.       The Zubik litigation, which involves seven separate cases,      was brought by religiously affiliated nonprofit employers      like hospitals, colleges and social service organizations      that do not want any role in giving their employees access to      contraception.       The Obama administration, mindful of concerns over      religious freedom, has already provided a way out for these      employers: They must notify their insurer or the government,      in writing, of their objection, at which point the government      takes over and provides coverage for the contraceptives at no      cost to the employers.       This sensible arrangement was not enough for several      plaintiffs who said it still violated their religious freedom      under a federal law, because the act of notification itself      made them complicit in the provision of birth control.       Eight federal courts of appeals have already rejected this      claim, finding that such a minor requirement did not place a      substantial burden on the objectors' religious freedom. In      her opinion for the Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit, Judge Cornelia Pillard wrote that under      both federal law and the Constitution, ``freedom of religious      exercise is protected but not absolute.'' This was the right      answer, and should     have easily guided the justices in resolving this case.       But in a highly unusual order issued days after oral      arguments, the justices asked both sides to consider a      potential compromise--having a religiously affiliated      employer tell an insurer of its objection to birth control      coverage, and then having the insurer separately notify      employees that it will provide cost-free contraceptives,      without any involvement by the employer.       In Monday's opinion, the court said both sides' responses      indicated that a compromise was possible. Without weighing in      on the merits of the litigation, the court sent the lawsuits      back to the federal appeals courts and told them to give the      parties ``an opportunity to arrive at an approach going      forward that accommodates petitioners' religious exercise      while at the same time ensuring that women covered by      petitioners' health plans receive full and equal health      coverage, including contraceptive coverage.'' '       This move solves nothing. Even if these plaintiffs can find      their way to an agreement with the government that satisfies      their religious objections, there are other employers with      different religious beliefs who will not be satisfied, and      more lawsuits are sure to follow.       The court could have avoided this by affirming the      appellate decisions that correctly ruled in the government's      favor. Unfortunately, the justices appear to be evenly split      on this issue, as they may be on other significant cases      pending before them.       The court's job is not to propose complicated compromises      for individual litigants; it is to provide the final word in      interpreting the Constitution and the nation's laws. Despite      what Senate Republicans may say about the lack of harm in the      delay in filling the vacancy, the court cannot do its job      without a full bench.                                  ____                   [From the Economist, May 9, 2016]                 Why the Supreme Court Is Slowing Down       With five votes, the late Justice William Brennan liked to      tell his clerks, ``you can do anything around here''. Justice      Brennan's rule still applies after the death in February of      Antonin Scalia. But with only eight justices remaining, the      magic number of five is now harder to come by. Twice since      Mr. Scalia's death the Supreme Court has performed the      judicial equivalent of throwing up its hands. In a small case      concerning banking rules and in a hugely consequential case      challenging the future of public-sector unions, the justices      issued one-sentence per curiam (``by the court'') rulings:      ``The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.'' A      tie in the high court means that the ruling in the court      below stands. But a tie-induced affirmance does not bind      other lower courts, and the judgment has no value as a      precedent. A tie, in short, leaves everything as it was and      as it would have been had the justices never agreed to hear      the case in the first place.       That's a lot of wasted ink, paper, time and breath. And now      it seems the justices may be keen to reduce future futile      efforts as they contemplate a year or more with a missing      colleague. As Robert Barnes wrote in the Washington Post last      week, the Supreme Court's pace of ``grants''--cases it agrees      to take up--has slowed. Only 12 cases are now on the docket      for the October 2016 term that begins in the fall, and grants      are lagging below the average of recent years. The slow pace      is especially notable because it marks a slowdown from an      already highly attenuated docket. Seventy years ago, the      justices decided 200 or more cases a year; that number      declined to about 150 in the 1980s and then plummeted into      the 80s and, in recent years, the 70s. The justices will      grant more cases in dribs and drabs following their private      conferences in May and June and after the so-called ``long-     conference'' in September (followed by more conferences      throughout the autumn and winter), but early indications are      that the term starting in October may be one of the most      relaxed in recent memory.       The Obama administration continues to push Senate      Republicans to change their minds and hold confirmation      hearings for Merrick Garland, chief judge of the District of      Columbia circuit court. While a number of GOP senators have      agreed to meet Mr. Garland for lunch or tea, none have      endorsed him or said he should have a hearing. The fight to      fill Mr. Scalia's seat before the next president takes office      includes a new hashtag (#WeNeedNine) and a counter showing      the number of ``days of obstruction'' in the Senate since Mr.      Obama tapped Mr. Garland for the job. (That number is 51 and      counting.) But the Republican leadership isn't budging.      Charles Grassley, chair of the judiciary committee, admits      that leaving the appointment to the next president is a      ``gamble'' given that Donald Trump is now all-but certain to      be the Republican nominee, but he is sticking to his guns.       What's wrong with eight justices? The primary worry is that      tie votes will sow legal confusion and uncertainty. When      justices are split down the middle, they cannot resolve rival      views on crucial national issues--from affirmative action and      public unions to gay rights, birth control and abortion. By      letting lower-court decisions stand but not requiring other      courts to abide by the ruling, the stage is set for odd      state-by-state or district-by-district distinctions when it      comes to the meaning of laws or the constitution. This seems      to be the worry that prompted the justices to search for a      compromise after hearing arguments in March in the latest      fight over Obamacare and contraception. One federal district      court has said that the contraceptive mandate violates a 1993      law banning the government from unduly interfering with other      people's religious scruples. A half dozen other appellate      courts have come to the opposite opinion. So if the justices      divide 4-4 in Zubik v Burwell, women across most of America      will have access to birth control through their employer's      health coverage, while women in seven midwestern states will      not. The justices' unprecedented effort to square the circle      by playing mediator does not look promising.       Some legal scholars argue that an eight-justice bench isn't      so bad after all and might actually be preferable. Eric      Segall, a professor of law at Georgia State University,      thinks the 4-4 ideological divide is pushing justices to      moderate their claims in an effort to win votes from their      colleagues on the other side. ``[T]o accomplish their      goals'', Mr. Segall writes, ``the Justices would simply have      to get along better''. This is a prescription, he says, to      ``more public confidence in the final outcomes'' of Supreme      Court decisions. We may have seen just such a compromise at      work in a recent voting-rights decision, Evenwel v Abbott.      After the oral argument in December, most pundits (including      your correspondent) were expecting a 5-4 decision upending      the common understanding of ``one person, one vote''      (counting everybody) in favour of counting only eligible      voters, a scheme favouring whiter, wealthier, GOP-leaning      districts. But the justices came out 8-0 in the other      direction. The four liberals seem to have attracted the      conservatives' votes (though Justices Samuel Alito and      Clarence Thomas disagreed with the reasoning) by lowering the      temperature a bit: the constitution permits states to use      total population as the basis for drawing districts, Justice      Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for her colleagues, but the      question of whether it requires them to do so is off the      table until a case forces it back on.       But beyond the Evenwel surprise and the seemingly ill-fated      attempt to resolve the dicey dilemma in Zubik, it's very hard      to see how a denuded court is an appealing concept in the      medium or long-term. A patchwork quilt of legal realities may      have been fitting for America under the Articles of      Confederation, before the country had a political system that      made it something approximating a union, but America's      constitutional design is not consonant with deep confusion      about what the law means on controversial questions of public      life. While the bind they're in may lead to occasional      compromises, the justices will only bend so far. Whether the      divide manifests as 4-4 splits or a tendency to hear fewer      cases in which those splits seem likely, a curbed Supreme      Court is not a court that can possibly live up to its name.                          ____________________
