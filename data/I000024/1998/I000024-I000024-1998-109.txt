But the Senate included an amendment in this bill that addresses this problem. Under this amendment, for the July 1997 PM2.5 standards, EPA would no longer be required to designate areas regarding their PM2.5 attainment status in July of 1999.  Instead of the designation schedule currently in the Clean Air Act, this amendment would establish the following requirements for PM2.5 designations: Section 4102 would extend the time for Governors to submit designations for the July 1997 PM2.5 standard until one year after receipt of three years of monitoring data.  Rather than the two year period normally provided by the Clean Air Act, under section 4102(d) of this amendment, EPA would not be required to promulgate nonattainment, attainment and unclassifiable designations for PM2.5 areas until one year after the Governors are required to submit the designations or until Dec. 31, 2005, whichever date is earlier.
