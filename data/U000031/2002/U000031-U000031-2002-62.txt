Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I intend to close at this point as well.  I want to say from the outset that this bill not only in this Congress but in the last Congress as well was known to be a very strong bipartisan bill, Republicans and Democrats working together to unshackle the regulations off a new technology that is so important for our country.  The Tauzin-Dingell bill does that. It was bipartisan in every way, as we have seen in the debate today. And as the new chairman of the subcommittee, my door was open to virtually every group. The concern I heard from virtually every group was that the FCC did not have the right authority to enforce the law. I welcomed the participation of virtually every member of the subcommittee to see this amendment through, both in committee, subcommittee, as well as today on the floor.  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) has been a tremendous help not only on this issue but so many others as we have worked in a bipartisan fashion in our committee. I commend my chairman, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), and I would urge all my colleagues to support the Upton-Green amendment.
