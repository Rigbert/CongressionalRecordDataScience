President, not long ago the Democratic leadership reached an agreement with the White House that both sides believed was reasonable and fair. Actually, it was the Democratic leadership, the Republican leadership, and the White House. We agreed to hold votes for 25 of the President's judicial nominees, including one that was so controversial that he received what might have been the highest number of ``no'' votes ever from both Republicans and Democrats for a confirmed judge.  Now in return for those good-faith votes, the White House agreed not to make any more recess appointments of judges for the remainder of the President's term. So we fulfilled our end of the deal. When we were in the majority during 17 months, we moved 100 of President Bush's nominees. In about 27 or 28 months, the Republican majority has moved another 98 or 99. Of course, we brought up for consideration and agreed to consideration of all 25 of the judicial nominees we had agreed on with the President.  Probably on the basis that no good deed goes unpunished, especially with the most political, poll-driven administration I have seen in the time I have been here, the day after the debate and this extremely closely divided vote on the last of the group of those 25 judicial nominees, one many Republicans voted against, President Bush flew to North Carolina and then on to Michigan in an effort to politicize this issue anew. It appears that nominating and appointing his most ideological, partisan slate of judicial nominees is not enough for this President.  Besting the confirmation record of Ronald Reagan, former President Bush, and President Clinton does not satisfy him.
