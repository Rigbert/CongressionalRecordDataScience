 President, I support the foreign operations appropriations bill now before the Senate, which will provide the necessary funds for foreign assistance programs of the United States in the coming fiscal year. Foreign aid is an important component of U.S. foreign policy. In addition to being a tangible demonstration of American leadership, it is a key instrument in encouraging and supportingAmerican values of democracy, respect for human rights, and free trade.  In recent years, foreign policy spending has suffered drastic cutbacks. According to a study of the Congressional Research Service, prepared earlier this year at my request, foreign policy spending for the current fiscal year is at its lowest level in 20 years.  Moreover, the steepest reductions in our foreign policy budget have come in foreign assistance, which at $11.5 billion last year, in fiscal year 1998 dollars, is lower, in real terms, than any year of the last twenty, and some 36 percent below the historical average of that period.  Mr. President, this year's foreign operations bill thankfully has started to reverse this precipitous decline. It provides $13.24 billion for foreign assistance and export financing programs. I commend the Appropriations Committee for its hard work and applaud the bipartisan effort its members have shown in enhancing the level of funding for our Nation's foreign assistance programs.  This legislation provides enhanced funding for critical foreign assistance programs, a few of which I will mention briefly.  The Appropriations Committee has recognized the importance of development assistance programs by providing $1.8 billion, $100 million over the President's request.  While the $485 million appropriated for the seed program for newly democratizing countries in Eastern Europe is regretfully below the President's request, the Committee's recommendation of $800 million for the nations of the former Soviet Union will allow our Nation to continue its efforts to bring democracy, stability, and prosperity to those former Communist States.  Mr. President, I am somewhat concerned about the considerable number of earmarks in this bill, and the number of ``subearmarks,'' that is, designation of funds for specific programs within specific countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia.  I am not opposed to earmarks in principle; Congressional priorities often differ with those of the executive branch, and the Congress has every right to protect those priorities by specific earmarks.  But the proliferation of such provisions unduly limits the administration's flexibility in a region that is constantly in flux. So I hope the committee will consider reducing the number of earmarks in the conference with the House.  Mr. President, unfortunately it has become popular of late to assert that foreign aid is merely the foreign policy equivalent of welfare--a supposed massive giveaway that yields few benefits to American interests.  To the contrary, American contributions to these efforts are an important way in which we protect our interests abroad, a fact that the Appropriations Committee has recognized through its enhanced funding levels for foreign assistance programs.  I wish to congratulate Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy once again for their work on this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.                  Child Survival and Disease Programs  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the child survival and disease program fund. I understand that the House Committee on Appropriations, as a part of its foreign operations, export financing, and related programs bill, has recommended that $650 million be allocated to the fund's programs for fiscal year 1998. On the House side, the subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead, as my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Tony Hall, has also in protecting these child survival programs. I commend him for his leadership on this issue.  The Clinton administration, however, has not specifically designated any direct funding for the child survival programs. Mr. President, in order to preserve the benefits of these important programs for children worldwide, I believe that the Senate should accept, when we go to conference, the House language that was agreed to in committee for this fund. It is, I believe, Mr. President, a tragedy, that millions of children die each year through disease, malnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both preventable and treatable. The programs in the child survival fund, which are intended to reduce infant mortality and improve the health and nutrition of children, address the various problems of young people struggling to survive in developing countries.  Mr. President, this fund places a priority on the needs of more than 100 million children worldwide who are displaced and/or who have become orphans. The fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of communicable diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, in the underdeveloped world, eradicating polio, as well as preventing and controlling the spread of HIV and AIDS.  Mr. President, aside from the addressing issues of health, the fund also supports basic education programs. Investment in education yields one of the highest social and economic rates of return because it gives children the necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each additional year of primary and secondary education results in a 10-to-20 percent wage increase, and a 25-percent net increase in income.  Mr. President, the programs supported by the child survival fund are effective, and they are effective because they save three million lives each year through immunization, vitamin supplementation, oral rehydration therapy, and also through the treatment of childhood respiratory infections which are the second largest killer of children on Earth.  Mr. President, eliminating the symptoms and the causes of this problem is not only the humane thing to do. It is also a necessary prerequisite for global stability and for global prosperity.  In my view, Mr. President, Congress needs to maintain its support for these very valuable programs. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee will, when we go to conference, accept the House language.  The child survival and disease programs are effective, they are important, and they should, Mr. President, be continued.  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on the floor, and my colleague from the State of Kentucky. I wonder if he has any comment about this.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have listened closely to the comments of my good friend from Ohio, and I would like to thank him for them and commend him for his tireless efforts in supporting the children's causes, not only here in the United States but throughout the world.  I would like to assure my good friend from Ohio that I will give every possible consideration to his request when we go to conference with the House on the bill.  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that very much.  Mr. President, if I could inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I have a statement which I would like to give at some point this evening in regard to the vote we are going to have tomorrow. I can refrain from doing that if it works with the chairman's schedule, or I can do it now.  Mr. McCONNELL. I have a block of amendments that have been cleared on both sides that I would like to offer. Senator Bennett is also here.  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.
