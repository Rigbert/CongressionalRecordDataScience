Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and I have been friends since he came to the Congress many years ago.                              {time}  1500  He serves on the Committee on Armed Services and is one of the most knowledgeable Members in the Congress on matters related to our national defense. But probably less well known is his extraordinary depth of knowledge of Russia, of the former Soviet Union, of former Soviet officials, and present leaders in Russia itself. He is a friend of many, a colleague of others, and an interlocutor of many more.  Obviously, our relationship to Russia is one of the most important relationships that we have as a Nation. The relationship between Russia and the United States is one critical to international security and stability. As vice president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have the opportunity to meet regularly with members of the Duma. However, under the leadership of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), and with the concurrence, as he pointed out, of then-Speaker Gingrich and minority leader Gephardt, we established a formal relationship.  It is interesting to note that the supreme Soviet, when the Soviet Union was still in existence, sought a formal relationship with the Congress. We demurred and did not want to enter such a relationship. The reason for that, of course, is they were not a democratically elected parliament. We have seen historic changes, revolutionary changes as Russia emerged as a new democracy. It is a democracy, obviously, struggling with its economy and struggling with a developing democracy. It was the thought of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), with which I strongly agreed, that the better and closer relationship they had with representatives of the people's House and of the United States Senate, really the examples for democratic parliamentary bodies in the world, it would assist them in their developing democracy and would assist us as well in establishing a relationship which would lead to better understanding and, therefore, more cooperation.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned that I chaired and am now the ranking member of the Helsinki Commission. That commission focuses on human rights. I kidded when we were in Moscow, when Viktor Chernomyrdin was at dinner with us, that I was coming back to the United States and raising a human rights issue about the gentleman from Pennsylvania making us work so hard. Forty-one meetings in 4 days is quite a schedule. But I found the meetings extraordinarily productive, worthwhile, and I think establishing a better relationship between our two countries and, indeed, between the leaders in Moldova, although they are now new, and the leaders in the Ukraine, although now troubled.  I had to leave the trip early and go to Vienna for a meeting of the standing committee of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe where I have the privilege of representing our country, but I know from talking to Members who concluded the trip that it was an extraordinarily worthwhile trip.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) is going to speak after me. He is a new Member of Congress. This was, I think, his first visit to Russia and to some of the former Soviet states. It was my 15th or 16th visit. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) has been there, as I recall his saying, 23 times.  Mr. Speaker, we need to continue these visits. We need to continue this conversation. We need to continue with cooperation. There will, of course, be and are times when we disagree; but we need to disagree while talking to one another. We need to disagree while understanding the perspective of one another. It is critical for our own countries and critical for all the world, and I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership and to tell him how much I appreciate co-chairing the Congress-Duma committee with him and the worthwhile work that we and other Members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate andthe Duma are doing to establish an ongoing, continuing, positive relationship with this great merging democracy, Russia.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
