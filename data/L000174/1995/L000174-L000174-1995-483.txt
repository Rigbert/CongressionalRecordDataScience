Last Friday, my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Exon, filed a revised version of the Decency Act as amendment No. 1268. The revisions made by Senator Exon reflect a diligent and considered effort by him and his staff to correct serious problems that the Department of Justice, I and others have pointed out with this section of the bill.  I commend Senator Exon for proposing in his amendment the striking of the provision in the bill that would impose a blanket prohibition on wiretapping digital communications. This section would have totally undermined the legal authority for law enforcement to use court-authorized wiretaps, one of the most significant tools in law enforcement's arsenal for fighting crime.  If that particular section were passed as introduced, the FBI would not have been able to use court-ordered wiretaps to listen in on digital calls made by kidnappers, terrorists, mobsters, or other criminals. This is an excellent change that I heartily endorse.                 problems with senator exon's amendment  But, even with this fix, serious constitutional and practical problems remain in Senator Exon's proposed legislation.  The first part of the amendment would make it a felony not only to send obscene electronic messages to harass another person, but would apply the same penalty to sending an e-mail message with an indecent or filthy word that you hope will annoy another person.  For example, if someone sends you an annoying e-mail message and you respond with a filthy, four-letter word, you may land in jail for 2 years or with a $100,000 fine.  Under this amendment, no computer user will be able to send a private or public e-mail message with the seven dirty words in it. Who knows when any recipient will decide to feel annoyed by seeing a four-letter word online?  The second part of the amendment would make it a felony to send out or receive over computer networks any obscene material. There is no requirement that the person soliciting and receiving the material knew it was obscene. This means that a computer user could be guilty of committing this crime at the moment of clicking to receive material, and before the user has looked at the material, let alone knows the material to be, obscene.  This means that an adult sitting at his computer in the privacy of his own home, who wants to get a copy--consistent with our copyright laws--of a magazine article on stock car racing, could be subject to 2 years in jail and a $100,000 fine for downloading the magazine, which unbeknownst to the user also contains obscene material.  This also means that if you are part of an online discussion group on rape victims, your computer is programmed to automatically download messages sent into the discussion group. If a participant sends into the group a graphic story about a rape, which could be deemed obscene, this story will automatically be downloaded onto your computer, and you would be criminally liable under this amendment, even before you read the story.  This may mark the end of online discussion groups on the Internet, since many users do not want to risk 2 years in jail because of what they might receive from online discussion groups. This amendment would chill free speech and the free flow of information [[Page S8341]] over the Internet and computer networks.  The amendment does give one out to users who meet some government, FCC determined standards to take steps to protect themselves from receiving material the government has determined to be obscene or indecent. This may mean that any user with a connection to the Internet or an electronic communications service may be required to go out and buy special FCC endorsed and expensive software programs to stop obscene materials from reaching their computers. That way they could show that they have at least tried to avoid the receipt of obscene materials. Otherwise, they may risk criminal liability.  Take another example. What if a user wants to join a campaign to stop obscenity on computer networks, and sends out the message to others on the campaign to send him examples of the obscene materials they are fighting to stop. Under this amendment, any receipt of these materials would be a crime. If this amendment had been the law, when my good friend from Nebraska collected the materials in his blue notebook, he would have committed a felony.  How will anti-obscenity or pornography groups that now monitor online obscenity be able to do so without criminal liability?  The third part of Senator Exon's amendment would make it a felony to purposefully make available, either privately or publicly, any indecent message to a minor.  We all share my good friend's concern over the kind of material that may be available and harmful to minors on the Internet and other online computer networks. But this provision is not the way to address the problem.  Under this provision, no indecent speech could be used on electronic bulletin boards dedicated to political debates, since kids under 18 may access these boards.  This will certainly insure that civility is reintroduced into our political discourse when we are online. But this also means that works of fiction, ranging from ``Lady Chatterly's Lover'' to Newt Gingrich's science fiction novel ``1945,'' which contains some steamy scenes, could not be put out on the Internet because of the risk that a minor might download it. Rap music with bad words could not be distributed online. This provision would censor the Internet in a way that threatens to chill our first amendment rights on electronic communications systems.  Under the amendment offered by my good friend from Nebraska, those of us who are users of computer e-mail and other network systems would have to speak as if we were in Sunday School every time we went on-line.  I, too, support raising our level of civility in communications in this country, but not with a government sanction and possible prison sentence when someone uses an expletive. All users of Internet and other information services would have to clean up their language when they go on-line, whether or not they are communicating with children.  There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to communicate electronically with people within our own homes and communities, and around the globe. A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our children takes on a new dimension of responsibility.  Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world through the Internet or some other on-line service. Many of us are justifiably concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to monitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed.  But government regulation of the content of all computer communications, even private communications, under the rubric of protecting kids and in violation of the first amendment is not the answer.                             existing laws  One could get the incorrect idea that we in Congress have ignored the problem of protecting kids from harms that could befall them from materials they get online. This could not be further from the truth. We have a number of laws on the books that the Justice Department has successfully used to prosecute child pornography and obscenity transmitted over computer networks.  Our criminal laws already prohibit the sale or distribution over computer networks of obscene or filthy material--18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1465, 1466, 2252 and 2423(a). We already impose criminal liability for transmitting any threatening message over computer networks--18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(c). Our existing criminal laws also criminalize the solicitation of minors over computers for any sexual activity--18 U.S.C. Sec. 2452--and illegal luring of minors into sexual activity through computer conversations--18 U.S.C. Sec. 2423(b). Just this weekend, there were reports of two instances in which the FBI successfully tracked down teenagers who were solicited online.  Congress took action 2 months ago to pass the Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 to increase the penalties and make these various laws even tougher.  Congress has not been ignoring this problem. This does not mean we cannot or should not do better. But, the problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many important constitutional issues.                   leahy amendment requiring a study  The amendment I am offering with Senators Kerrey, Feingold, and Moseley-Braun would require a study by the Department of Justice, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, on how we can empower parents and users of interactive telecommunications systems.  We should examine the recommendations of these experts before we start imposing liability in ways that could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and possibly undercut law enforcement at the same time.  We should avoid quick fixes today that would interrupt and limit the rapid evolution of electronic information systems--for the public benefit far exceeds the problems it invariably creates by the force of its momentum.  A number of groups support the approach of the Leahy study, including civil liberties groups, librarians, online providers, newspaper editors, and others. I ask that a list of the supporters of the Leahy study be placed in the Record.  An electronic petition has been circulated on the Internet for the past few weeks. Over 35,000 people have signed on in support of the Leahy study, as an alternative to the proposed Communications Decency Act.  A number of organizations have signed onto the electronic petition to support the Leahy study as an alternative to Government content regulation of electronic communications. These organizations, including the American Council for the Arts, Center for Democracy and Technology, Voters Telecommunications Watch, and others are helping to circulate the petition. Anyone is allowed to sign it or circulate it--this is a free country. Since May 19, when the petition was launched, over 35,000 people have signed on.  The Leahy study approach is supported by civil liberties groups, librarians, online service providers and newspaper groups, including: Association of American Publishers [AAP]; Association of American University Presses [AAUP]; The faculty of the City University of New York; Interactive Working Group; Online Operators Policy Committee of the Interactive Services Association; American Advertising Federation; American Association of Advertising Agencies; and American Library Association.  Also American Society of Newspaper Editors; Association of National Advertisers, Inc.; Association of Research Libraries; Business Software Alliance; Center for Democracy and Technology; Computer and Communications Industry Association; Direct Marketing Association; Electronic Frontier Foundation; Feminists For Free Expression; Magazine Publishers of America; Media Access Project; National Public Telecomputing Network; Newspaper Association of America; People For the American Way Action Fund; Recreational Software Advisory Counsel; Software Publishers Association; and Times Mirror.  I have also asked a coalition of industry and civil liberties groups, called [[Page S8342]] the Interactive Working Group, to address the legal and technical issues for policing electronic interactive services.  There is no question that we need to educate parents about the types of materials available on the Internet which they may want to stop their children from accessing. By focusing attention on this issue, Senator Exon's efforts to legislate in this area have already made strides in alerting parents to the material available online that may be harmful to kids, such as the Internet, to control the material transmitted to them over those systems. We must find ways to do this that do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private online communications, and undercut important constitutional protections.  Before legislating to impose Government regulation on the content of communications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more information from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My bill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.  Mr. President, I tell my good friend from Nebraska, I hope he realizes I would never call him a barbarian. We know each other too well and we are too good of friends for that.  I have to admit, when he talks about football, he has the good grace to live in a State where the team has had some modicum of success. He has rightly achieved bragging rights on that.  But when he talks about punting on this, with all due respect, Mr. President, I believe the Exon-Coats amendment punts, because it punts to the FCC the task of finding ways to restrict minors' access to indecent communications so users can implement them and have a defense to criminal prosecution.  What we have to understand is that nobody in this place wants to give pornography to children. I do not. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, all who have spoken on this issue this afternoon, none wants to give pornography to children.  Many Members also do not want to destroy the Internet as we try to find how to do protect children from harmful material on the Internet. We can accomplish the goal of keeping pornography from children without putting on a huge Government layer of censorship and without destroying the Internet.  Now, my friend from Nebraska says his amendment takes the same approach as the dial-a-porn statute. Not really. On dial-a-porn, it took 10 years of litigation for the FCC to find a way to implement the dial-a-porn statute in a constitutional way. That is why I say his amendment punts to the FCC the task of finding ways to restrict.  Why not instead follow the Leahy amendment, which will require a study, a group of experts, an accelerated legislative path, so that we will pass responsible legislation that will not be attacked constitutionally for years thereafter.  I note that the House Commerce Committee adopted basically the Leahy study in its markup of the House telecommunications legislation. This was Republicans and Democrats, across the political spectrum, trying to find the best way to handle this. They did what I have recommended here.  In fact, some provisions in my friend's amendment could hurt prosecution of those who are not law-abiding users of the Internet but use it to distribute obscenity and child pornography.  As a former prosecutor, I want prosecutors to have the best tools to go after criminals. I received a letter today from the Justice Department that makes several points. They say a study of the issue is needed. They also confirm that the Exon proposal would regulate indecent speech between consenting adults. And, third, the defenses in this proposal would undermine the ability of the Justice Department to prosecute online service providers even though they knowingly profit from the distribution of obscenity and child pornography.  The Department says, ``We still have concerns. We continue to believe that comprehensive review should be undertaken to guide the response to the problems the Communications Decency Act seeks to address.''  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 1995.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I write to respond to your letter of      March 1, 1995 concerning our prosecution of violations of      federal child pornography and obscenity laws and your April      21, 1995 request for the views of the United States      Department of Justice on the ``Communications Decency Act,''      which has been incorporated as title IV of the proposed      ``Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of      1995,'' S. 652. In accordance with your request, the analysis      of the Communications Decency Act focuses on sections 402 and      405 of the bill.       The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed,      successfully prosecuted violations of federal child      pornography and obscenity laws which were perpetrated with      computer technology. In addition we have applied current law      to this emerging problem while also discovering areas where      the new technology may present challenges to successful      prosecution. While we agree with the goal of various      legislative proposals designed to keep obscenity and child      pornography off of the information superhighway, we are      currently developing a legislative proposal that will best      meet these challenges and provide additional prosecutorial      tools. This legislative package is being developed while      taking into consideration the need to protect fundamental      rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.       With respect to the Communications Decency Act, while we      understand that section 402 is intended to provide users of      online services the same protection against obscene and      harassing communications afforded to telephone subscribers,      this provision would not accomplish that goal. Instead, it      would significantly thwart enforcement of existing laws      regarding obscenity and child pornography, create several      ways for distributors and packagers of obscenity and child      pornography to avoid criminal liability, and threaten      important First Amendment and privacy rights.       Similarly, while we understand that section 405 of this      bill is intended to expand privacy protections to ``digital''      communications, such communications are already protected      under existing law. Moreover, this provision would have the      unintended consequences of jeopardizing law enforcement's      authority to conduct lawful, court-ordered wiretaps and would      prevent system administrators from protecting their systems      when they are under attack by computer hackers.       Despite the flaws in these provisions, the Administration      applauds the primary goal of this legislation: prevent      obscenity from being widely transmitted over      telecommunications networks to which minors have access.      However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that      merit close examination prior to Congressional action. We      recommend that a comprehensive review be undertaken of      current laws and law enforcement resources for prosecuting      online obscenity and child pornography, and the technical      means available to enable parents and users to control the      commercial and noncommercial communications they receive over      interactive telecommunications systems.       The following are the Department's primary objections to      sections 402 and 405 of the pending telecommunications bill:       First, section 402 of the bill would impose criminal      sanctions on the transmission of constitutionally protected      speech. Specifically, subsections 402(a)(1) and (b)(2) of the      bill would criminalize the transmission of indecent      communications, which are protected by the First Amendment.      In Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989),      the Supreme Court ruled that any restrictions on the content      of protected speech in media other than broadcast media must      advance a compelling state interest and be accomplished by      the ``least restrictive means.'' By relying on technology      relevant only to 900 number services, section 402 fails to      take into account less restrictive alternatives utilizing      existing and emerging technologies which enable parents and      other adult users to control access to content.       Nearly ten years of litigation, along with modifications of      the regulations, were necessary before the current statute as      applied to audiotext services, or ``dial-a-porn'' calling      numbers, was upheld as constitutional. See Dial Information      Services v. Thornburg, 938 F. 2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991). The      proposed amendment in section 402 of the bill would      jeopardize the enforcement of the existing dial-a-porn      statute by inviting additional constitutional challenges,      with the concomitant diversion of law enforcement resources.       Second, the definition of ``knowingly'' in section 402 of      the bill would cripple obscenity prosecutions. Under      subsection 402(e), only those persons with ``actual      knowledge'' of the ``specific content of the communication''      could be held criminally liable. This definition would make      it difficult, if not impossible, to prove guilt, and the      standard is higher than the prevailing knowledge requirements      under existing obscenity and child sexual exploitation      statutes. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 629 (1973),      the [[Page S8343]] government must only prove that a person      being prosecuted under an obscenity statute had knowledge of      the general nature of the material being distributed. Large-     scale distributors of child pornography and other obscene      materials--among the most egregious violators--do not read or      view each obscene item they distribute. The proposed      definition in subsection 402(e) would make it nearly      impossible for the government to establish the necessary      knowledge requirement and would thereby severely handicap      enforcement of existing statutes.       Third, section 402 would add new terms and defenses that      would thwart ongoing enforcement of the dial-a-porn statute.      Currently, the government is vigorously enforcing the      existing dial-a-porn statute. It took more than ten years for      the government to be able to do so, due to constitutional      challenges. The proposed amendment to this statute      fundamentally changes its provisions and subjects it to      renewed constitutional attack which would hinder current      enforcement efforts.       Fourth, section 402 would do significant harm by inserting      new and sweeping defenses that may be applied to nullify      existing federal criminal statutes. The government currently      enforces federal criminal laws preventing the distribution      over computer networks of obscene and other pornographic      material that is harmful to minors (under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 1465, 2252 & 2423(a)), the illegal solicitation of      a minor by way of a computer network (under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2252), and illegal ``luring'' of a minor into sexual      activity through computer conversations (under 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2423(b)). These statutes apply to all methods of      ``distribution'' including over computer networks. The new      defenses proposed in subsection 402(d) would thwart ongoing      government obscenity and child sexual exploitation      prosecutions in several important ways:       The first defense under subsection 402(d)(1) would immunize      from prosecution ``any action'' by a defendant who operates a      computer bulletin board service as an outlet for the      distribution of pornography and obscenity so long as he does      not create or alter the material. In fact, this defense would      establish a system under which distributors of pornographic      material by way of computer would be subject to fewer      criminal sanctions than distributors of obscene videos, books      or magazines.       The second defense provided in subsection 402(d)(2) would      exculpate defendants who ``lacked editorial control over the      communications.'' Such a defense may significantly harm the      goal of ensuring that obscene or pornographic material is not      available on the Internet or other computer networks by      creating a disincentive for operators of public bulletin      board services to control the postings on their boards.      Moreover, persons who provide critical links in the      pornography and obscenity distribution chains by serving      as ``package fulfillment centers'' filling orders for      obscene materials, could assert the defense that they lack      the requisite ``editorial control.'' This proposed defense      would complicate prosecutions of entire obscenity      distribution chains.       The third defense provided in subsection 402(d)(3),      containing five subparts, would be available to pornographic      bulletin boards operators who take such innocuous steps as      (A) directing users to their ``on/off'' switches on their      computers as a ``means to restrict access'' to certain      communications; (B) warning, or advertising to, users that      they could receive obscene material; and (C) responding to      complaints about such minimum, this proposed defense would      lead to litigation over whether such actions constitute      ``good faith'' steps to avoid prosecution for violating the      section 402, and could thwart existing child pornography and      obscenity prosecutions.       The fourth defense provided in subsection 402(d)(4) would      exculpate defendants whose pornography business does not have      the ``predominate purpose'' of engaging in unlawful activity.      This defense would severely undercut law enforcement's      efforts to prosecute makers and distributors of noncommercial      pornography and obscenity.       The fifth defense provided in subsection 402(d)(5) would      preclude any cause of action from being brought against any      person who has taken good faith steps to, inter alia,      ``restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to,'' a      communication deemed unlawful under section 402. This defense      would encourage intrusion by on-line service providers into      the private electronic mail communications of individual      users. The defense actually promotes intrusions into private      electronic mail by making it ``safer'' to monitor private      communications than to risk liability. At the same time, this      defense would defeat efforts by the government to enforce      federal privacy protections against illegal eavesdropping.       Finally, but no less significantly, section 405 amends the      federal wiretap statute in several respects, each of which      creates considerable problems. First, it amends the wiretap      statute to add the term ``digital'' to 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2511,\1\ without considering the effect of this      amendment on other statutory provisions. For example, 18      U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1) provides that certain government      officials may authorize an application for a wiretap order      for wire or oral communications while 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(3)      provides that other government officials may authorize an      application for a wiretap order for electronic      communications. Since section 405 does not amend 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2516 to include the term ``digital,'' it would appear      that no government official has the authority to authorize an      application for a wiretap order for digital communications.      This is particularly problematic, since this investigative      tool is reserved for the most serious cases, including those      involving terrorists, organized crime, and narcotics.     \1\It should be noted that ``digital'' communications are      already covered by the wiretap statute. Under current law, a      ``digital'' communication is either a wire communication      under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(1) (if it contains voice) or an      ``electronic communication'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(12)      (if it does not contain voice). Since such communications are      already covered, the reason for enacting section 405 is      unclear, and it is difficult to predict how the courts will      interpret the amendment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Equally disconcerting, the amendment serves to protect      computer hackers at the expense of all users of the National      Information Infrastructure (NII), including businesses,      government agencies and individuals. Prior to 1994, the      wiretap statute allowed electronic communication service      providers to monitor voice communications to protect their      systems from abuse. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(a)(i) (1986      version). Thus, when hackers attacked computer systems and      system administrators monitored these communications, they      had no clear statutory authority to do so. In October 1994,      Congress finally remedied this defect by amending 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2511(2)(a)(i) to permit the monitoring of electronic      (i.e., digital, non-voice) communications. If section 405 is      enacted and these hacker communications are deemed digital,      system administrators will once again be denied the statutory      authority to monitor hacker communications. It would be most      unfortunate if, at the same time Congress is encouraging the      widespread use of the NII, it passed a law giving system      administrator's a Hobson's choice: either allow hackers to      attack systems unobserved or violate federal law.       There are three other concerns as well. First, by adding      the term ``digital'' without amending the suppression      provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, voice communications--if      they are deemed ``digital''--will no longer be protected by      the statute's exclusionary rule. This would serve to reduce      the privacy protections for phone calls.       Second, section 405 would replace the words ``oral      communication'' with ``communication'' in 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2511(1)(B). This would have undesirable consequences for      law enforcement because it would criminalize the interception      of communications as to which there was no reasonable      expectation of privacy.\2\     \2\The definition of ``oral communication'' in 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2510(2) contains a requirement that the communication to      be protected must have been made under circumstances      justifying an expectation of privacy.       From the law enforcement perspective, there is simply no      sound reason for eliminating this highly desirable feature of      present law. Additionally, the amendment might also impact      upon the news gathering process. For example, if the      conversation of two individuals shouting in a hotel room were      recorded by a news reporter standing outside the room, the      reporter would, under section 405, be violating the wiretap      statute. Under current law, of course, the individuals could      not complain about the recording because, by shouting loud      enough to be heard outside the room, they lack any reasonable      expectation of privacy.       Last, the provision in section 402(d)(5) provides that ``no      cause of action may be brought in any court * * * against any      person on account of any action which the person has taken in      good faith to implement a defense authorized under this      section. * * *'' This would seem to suggest that any person      can freely engage in electronic surveillance otherwise      prohibited by Title III so long as they claim to be      implementing a section 402 defense. As such, section      402(d)(5) severely weakens the privacy protections currently      offered by the wiretap statute.       In sum, sections 402 and 405 of the bill would hamper the      government's ongoing work in stopping the dissemination of      obscenity and child pornography and threaten law      enforcement's continued ability to use court-authorized      wiretaps. We believe that a comprehensive review be      undertaken to guide response to the problems that the      Communications Decency Act seeks to address.       I assure you that the Department is aware of the growing      use of computers to transmit and traffic obscenity and child      pornography. The Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and      Obscenity Section is aggressively investigating and      prosecuting the distribution of child pornography and      obscenity through computer networks, and the use of computers      to locate minors of the purpose of sexual exploitation. As we      have discussed with your staff in a meeting focussed on these      issues, we remain committed to an aggressive effort to halt      the use of computers to sexually exploit children and      distribute obscenity.           Sincerely,                                                      Kent Markus,     Acting Assistant Attorney General.                                                                    ____                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                                   Washington, DC.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: This is in response to your June 14,      1995 letter to me posing [[Page S8344]] questions about my      June 13 letter to Senator Exon concerning his proposed      Communications Decency Act.       My letter to Senator Exon commented on the version of his      proposal circulated in his ``dear colleague'' letter of June      7, 1995 (the ``Exon proposal''). Senator Exon had requested      that we comment on the extent to which that revised proposal      satisfied the concerns I detailed to you in my May 3 letter.      The letter does not address the Exon-Coats proposal, which we      had not seen nor were aware of until today. We have just      begun to review this new proposal.       As stated in my letter to Senator Exon, his proposal still      raises a number of complex legal and policy issues that call      for in-depth analysis prior to congressional action. Because      we still have concerns, we continue to believe that a      comprehensive review should be undertaken to guide response      to the problems the Communications Decency Act seeks to      address.       Among these concerns are constitutional questions raised      primarily by the lack of scienter required for the age      element of subsection (e) of the Exon proposal. In our view,      this subsection would consequently have the effect of      regulating indecent speech between consenting adults.\1\      Subsection (a) does not have the same constitutional      infirmity because of the specific intent requirement that the      communication be done ``with intent to annoy, abuse,      threaten, or harass * * *'', which we believe is inconsistent      with the concept of ``consenting adults.''     \1\Subsection (e) of the Exon-Coats measure exacerbates the      constitutional concerns because it is even more expansive      than the similar subsection (e) in the Exon proposal.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       As described in my June 13 letter, we continue to have a      concern with the ``knowledge'' requirements that were re-     inserted in the Exon proposal as defenses for certain      parties.       The defenses included in the Exon proposal would undermine      the ability of the Department of Justice to prosecute an on-     line service provider even though it knowingly profits from      the distribution of obscenity or child pornography.\2\      Although the existence of the defenses in the Exon proposal      would make prosecutions under the proposal's offenses      difficult, if not impossible, they would not threaten      obscenity prosecutions under existing statutes.     \2\The defense in subsection (f)(1) of the Exon-Coats measure      is particularly problematic as it focusses on whether the      service provider has control over the bulletin board service.      If the provider does not have control, regardless of whether      it has guilty knowledge or intent, it is immune from      prosecution.       I hope this information is helpful to you.           Sincerely,                                                      Kent Markus,                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.
