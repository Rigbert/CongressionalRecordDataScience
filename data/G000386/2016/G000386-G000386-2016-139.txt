 President, Des Moines Police Officer Carlos Puente-Morales's life was marked by a commitment to serving others and frequent expressions of love--love for his family and love for those he worked with.  On March 26, Officer Puente-Morales lost his life in the line of duty along with fellow officer Susan Farrell when their vehicle was struck by another that was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 80 near Waukee. I wish to take a moment to celebrate the life and service of Officer Puente-Morales.  Officer Puente-Morales served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Iowa Army National Guard, where he attained the rank of staff sergeant. He served his community as a deputy sheriff for Franklin County and as an Ottumwa police officer before coming to Des Moines to be closer to family. He joined the Des Moines police force just last year.  Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert has referred to Officer Puente-Morales as a loyal servant. I believe this to be a very fitting description. He was loyal to his family, to his community, to his country, and he did it with a heart full of love. He was just 34 years old when he left us, but his service and the example he set for all of us will endure for many years to come.  Officer Puente-Morales will be missed by his family and the community that he served.  Officer Puente-Morales's mother wisely said, ``We shouldn't wait for a tragedy to recognize our heroes.'' She is exactly right. On behalf of Iowans and all Americans, I express my gratitude for Officer Puente-Morales's service to community and country. My deepest sympathy is with his family in this difficult time. I thank all those who walk in Officer Puente-Morales's *COM007*footsteps to protect and serve.                          ____________________
