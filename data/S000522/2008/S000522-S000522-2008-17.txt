Mr. Speaker, I, in turn, thank the gentlewoman and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I recognize that there are good arguments for and against this bill, but I want to focus on a provision that many Members may not be aware of.  Under current law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider HIV/AIDS a communicable disease of public health significance; as a result, aliens with HIV/AIDS are inadmissible. Section 305 of the bill rescinds the statutory designation of HIV/AIDS as a communicable disease. This change would allow the current or a future administration to decide that HIV/AIDS is not a communicable disease of public health significance, and immigrants with HIV/AIDS would be admitted.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this provision will result in the entry of thousands of persons with HIV/AIDS. This change of policy inevitably will threaten the health and lives of many Americans. The CBO also estimates that allowing entry of thousands of persons with HIV/AIDS will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The cost of health care for each person with HIV/AIDS averages more than $600,000. Mr. Speaker, this provision removes a safeguard that protects the health of Americans and costs many millions of dollars.
