Speaker, let me just say that the gentleman from Illinois is a combat veteran. I am not. I have many in my family who have been, including those who served in World War II. I have the highest respect for the gentleman from Illinois. If anyone represents perseverance and honesty and integrity in this institution, it is he. It is my privilege to serve with him.
