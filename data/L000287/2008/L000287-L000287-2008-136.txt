Madam Speaker, on Monday, the city of Atlanta lost one of its mostinfluential residents and a pillar of the community, Ronald Brown.  Ron Brown was the head of Atlanta Life Financial Group, a company that is a historic institution. The 103-year-old company was founded by a former slave by the name of Alonzo Herndon and is the oldest and largest black-owned, privately held insurance company in the country. Ron was a major factor in Atlanta Life's success.  Ron Brown expanded the company's scope from strictly an insurance business to diversifying into three divisions: Atlanta Life Insurance Co., Atlanta Life Investment Advisors and Jackson Securities. Atlanta Life Financial possesses $16 billion in policies and manages $1 billion in assets. While achieving great business success, Ron advocated that companies have not only a responsibility to make a profit but to also get involved within its community. Ron servw on corporate and civic boards. He was a big believer of providing opportunities to children, sharing business experiences with them and meeting with student groups at the company headquarters.  Ron Brown accomplished much in his life. Through the many fruits of his labors from a life that was cut too short, Ron's impact will live on. With his passing, Atlanta has lost a figure of good and of progress.                          ____________________
