Speaker, today I along with my colleague, Representative Barbara Cubin, introduced important legislation to improve the standard of care for the mentally ill under the Medicaid program, the Medicaid Intensive Community Mental Health Treatment Act of 2000. This legislation provides each state with the option of covering intensive community mental health treatment under the Medicaid program. These community health programs are intensive treatments for adults and children with a diagnosed and persistent mental illness if they meet certain criteria under Medicaid. This bill amends title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide states with the option of covering intensive community treatment under the Medicaid program.  With this bill, the states can use 24-hour, 7-day-a-week intensive case management programs, psychiatric rehabilitation, discharge planning, and other evidence-based approaches such as assertive community treatment. These programs have been proven more effective and less expensive than inpatient care. The severely mentally ill are not receiving the help they need under the current programs covered under Medicaid.  This bill helps states reduce the costs of inpatient care under Medicaid. Trials have demonstrated that the use of these services substantially reduces the need for inpatient mental illnesses. This bill focuses the treatments used to benefit the severely mentally ill and thereby reduces the amount spent on inpatient care.  Current federal financing for community-based metal health care is spread across six or more optional Medicaid service categories. There exists a patchwork of state and country programs characterized by a lack of coordination, inflexible funding streams, and missing service components. This bill brings together a number of proven treatments for the severally mentally ill. States are given a choice, not a mandate, to adopt these improved services.  The people in our country who suffer from severe and persistent mental illnesses are not receiving the care they deserve. Without this specialized and intensive treatment it is extremely difficult for them to improve their lives. Many of the severely mentally ill are habitual inhabitants of the prison system or are homeless. If they have access to the specialized intensive care provided by these programs, cyclical regression to their illnesses may be avoided. This bill puts the choice squarely on the states: they can and should exercise the option to provide the quality of care individuals with severe mental illnesses deserve.  This bill does not cover everyone seeking psychiatric therapy. It covers only those with severe and persistent mental illnesses who meet one of the following criteria: a history of hospitalization or of repeated arrests for minor offenses; A history of poor outcomes from lesser treatments; who cannot meet their own basic needs; or have a history of coexisting substance abuse for at least 12 months.  The Medicaid Intensive Community Health Treatment Act of 2000 gives states a clear choice to improve the lives of their severely mentally ill residents.                          ____________________
