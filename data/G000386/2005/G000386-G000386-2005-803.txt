 President, this bill is all about fairness and balance. This bill, as I introduced it minus theSchumer amendment, is exactly the bill that Democratic leaders of the Judiciary Committee signed off on in the summer of 2002 when they controlled the U.S. Senate. I don't know how much more compromise you can get than that. But this amendment would gut one of the major compromises of this legislation that has evolved over that period of time going back to August 2002.  The bill's homestead compromise that we have would create a Federal cap of $125,000 on the homestead exemption, but would allow those States with higher or unlimited exemptions to take advantage of them as long as they comply with the 2-year residency requirements and a 10-year fraud reachback provision.  The bill's compromise is a good one that all parties have signed off on. The Kennedy amendment would gut it.  I ask you to kill this amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
