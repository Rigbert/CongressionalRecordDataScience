 Let me inform my friend from Iowa that he absolutely misstates my position. I have been against the sequester every year I was on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, these across-the-board cuts. I opposed your Cut, Cap, and Balance bill, which you supported, which had sequester as the alternative.  The President is against sequester, the Senate budget is against sequester, and you would not allow us to offer an amendment four times, which would have precluded sequester, not only for air travel, but for those Head Start children, for those senior citizens, for basic biomedical research.  So I tell my friend, if you are going to state the facts, state them correctly.
