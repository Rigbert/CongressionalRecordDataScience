I want to thank my colleagues for their leadership and strong support for public safety officers and their families. I also commend Representative Nadler and Representative Manzullo for their leadership on the House version of this bill.  This bill aims to restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to expressly include chaplains as members of the law enforcement and fire units in which they serve, and would make these chaplains eligible for the benefits available to public safety officers who have died or who have been permanently disabled as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty. In addition, the Act would expand the list of those who may receive benefits in the event of a public safety officer's death in the line of duty by including as potential beneficiaries the persons named on the most recently executed life insurance policy of the deceased officer. In short, this legislation will ensure that the families of chaplains killed in the line of duty receive due payments through the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program.  On September 11, 2001, Father Mychal Judge, a chaplain with the New York City Fire Department, was killed by falling debris as he ministered to victims of the horrific terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. He was survived solely by his two sisters.  Current law allows the Bureau of Justice Assistance to determine whether or not a public safety officer died as a direct or proximate cause of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, and, if such criterion is met, directs the BJA to pay a monetary benefit of $250,000 to the surviving family members of the officer. In the case of Father Judge, the BJA correctly determined that he was eligible for payment of death benefits. However, Father Judge had no wife or children, and outlived his parents, and no benefits were paid to his life insurance beneficiaries, his sisters, as they were ineligible under existing law to qualify as his beneficiaries and receive death benefits. This case is not unique, of the approximately 450 public safety officers killed in the September 11 attacks, there are 10 individuals known to have died without spouses, children or parents, so the $250,000 death benefit will not be paid. This is simply wrong.  For the purpose of determining benefit eligibility, the U.S. Code limits ``public safety officers'' to law enforcement officers; firefighters; rescue crews; FEMA employees; and members of State, local, or tribal emergency management or civil defense agencies who perform official duties in cooperation with FEMA. While the language of existing law could be interpreted to include chaplains, the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act would resolve any existing ambiguities. It specifically recognizes chaplains as public servants eligible for Public Safety Officers' Benefits so long as they serve as officially recognized or designated members of a legally organized volunteer fire or police department, or are officially recognized or designated public employees of a legally organized fire or police department, and was responding to a fire, rescue, or police emergency when injured or killed.  Additionally, this legislation would expand the list of those allowed to receive such benefits in the event of an officer's death in the line of duty. Current law restricts such beneficiaries to the spouse, child, or parent of the decedent. Our bill would expand this list, which would still give priority to spouses and children, but, in the event that neither survived the officer, would allow the monetary benefit to be paid to the individual designated by such officer as a beneficiary under the officer's most recently executed life insurance policy. In the event that there was no such individual named or that an individual so named did not survive the officer, the benefit would then be paid to the parents of the officer.  Before us we have yet another unique opportunity to provide much-needed relief for the survivors of the brave public servants who selflessly risk and sacrifice their own lives everyday so that others might live or be comforted. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on legislation to support our nation's public safety officers who put their lives at risk every day to protect us, and I urge the Senate to pass this bill expeditiously.                                 ______                                       By
