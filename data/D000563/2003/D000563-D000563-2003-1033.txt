I assume the Senator from Nevada, as a Senator from that great State, has had an opportunity to sit down with judicial nominees who were seeking district or circuit court appointments affecting Nevada and probably has nominated men and women for the Federal bench in Nevada. I do not know what his process has been. I have had that great honor in Illinois, and I try to get to know these people. I ask them questions to get an idea of what is going on in their minds.  It is not uncommon for me to ask the question we asked Miguel Estrada: Can you think of a Supreme Court case you think was particularly good or particularly bad and tell me why, as open-ended and as nonconfrontational as possible?  I say to the Senator from Nevada, this is a question I asked Miguel Estrada, and I ask the Senator from Nevada to think about it in the contextof interviewing nominees for the Federal bench in Nevada. A simple question and a simple answer.
