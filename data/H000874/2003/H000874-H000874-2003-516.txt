I do not want to prolong this too much.  I want to say with all sincerity, I share the gentleman's view of Mr. Pitts. I have worked with him over a long period of time. I have extraordinary respect and affection and regard for Bob Michel, for whom he worked effectively and for a long time.                              {time}  1315  I want to tell the gentleman, as sincerely as I can say on this floor, caring about this institution, frankly, if Billy Pitts is making the determination of what he thinks is fair or not fair, from his perspective from a long time in the minority, as to what the minority's rights ought to be in terms of offering alternatives on this floor, of having time to debate on this floor, of having individual amendments considered, I will tell the gentleman that I am confident that it will be done fairly.  But I will also tell the gentleman with equal sincerity that I have had my staff do an analysis from 1995 to date; and there has been, from 1995 to 2002, an almost straight-line reduction in the alternatives in bills allowed to the minority as we consider major pieces of legislation. I do not think that is good for our country, I do not think it is good for this institution, and it is not good for the comity between our two parties.  The gentleman from Texas and I have had an opportunity to work closely together on many items of great concern to this institution. We have worked well together. The gentleman and I have very serious disagreements on issues, but we do not have disagreements on the fact that this institution ought to operate as effectively as possible on behalf of our country. We share that in common, and I know we will continue to share that in common. But I really sincerely urge the gentleman, as the leader of his party on this floor and working with the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and Mr. Pitts, to say to the American public and to this institution that we are prepared to debate these matters, we are prepared to debate these matters fully and fairly and give options to the minority party.  I will say to my friend there was some discussion in our party. We had one motion, as the gentleman knows, to adjourn, and there was some discussion that we ought to make many more motions and have disruption. We did not do that. But I will tell my friend that there is great concern on this side of the aisle that if we do not have a fair and open system to consider legislation that we will not be as cooperative as we otherwise would like to be, and so that the American public can be best served.  On the budget, Mr. Leader, if I can, when do we expect the budget to be on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield.
