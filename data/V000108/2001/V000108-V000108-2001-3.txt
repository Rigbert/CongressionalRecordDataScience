Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Visclosky:       In the proposed division B (relating to emergency      supplemental appropriations), insert the following new title:                TITLE ____--STEEL INDUSTRY LEGACY RELIEF                                findings       Sec. ____1. The Congress finds the following:       (1) The United States steel industry has been severely      harmed by a record surge of steel imports into the United      States since 1998.       (2) This surge in imports has resulted in the loss of more      than 26,000 steel worker jobs and is the imminent cause of 25      steel company bankruptcies.       (3) The import surge has also forced the United States      steel industry into reduced volume, lower prices, and      financial losses.       (4) On October 22, 2001, the International Trade Commission      determined that the domestic steel industry has been severely      injured by the import surge.       (5) The United States steel industry has massive retiree      health care liabilities that total $13,000,000,000 and cost      the steel industry almost $1,000,000,000 annually.       (6) These health care liabilities pose a significant      barrier to steel industry consolidation and rationalization      that could improve the financial condition of the industry      and reduce the impact of foreign imports.       (7) Steel company bankruptcies, job losses, and financial      losses are contributing to the Nation's current economic      slowdown and are having serious negative effects on the tax      base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential      health, education, and municipal services that these      government entities provide to their citizens.       (8) A strong steel industry is necessary to a healthy      economy and to the adequate defense preparedness of the      United States.                 trade adjustment assistance for steel       Sec. ____2. (a) In General.--Title II of the Trade Act of      1974 (19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end      the following:         ``CHAPTER 6--ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR STEEL COMPANIES     ``SEC. 291.
