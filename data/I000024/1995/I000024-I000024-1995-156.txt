President, I see morning business is about to be concluded. I want to make a couple comments about our subject of the day, the welfare reform the country so desperately wants.  The postelection survey showed that there are three major elements to the mandate of the election of 1994. They were: We want to do something to eliminate the deficits; we want to do something meaningful about regulatory reform; and we want real welfare reform.  Mr. President, I am very proud that we in this House, the Senate, and over in the other body, submitted and adopted a budget resolution that is going to end up eliminating the deficit by the year 2002. So the President could not veto it, or I am sure he would have. Nonetheless, I think we are on our way to fulfilling that mandate. Regulatory reform--we are working on that right now, and I think we will end up with a product by the end of the week in getting it out.  Welfare reform is more difficult, because it seems that everybody campaigns on it, until they get here, and then they do not want to do anything about it. The two most important points are the exploding welfare costs and the crisis of legitimacy. In 1935, when AFDC was enacted, 88 percent of the families who received State cash relief were needy because the fathers had died. Benefits were intended primarily to enable the widow to care for her children at home.  Today, AFDC serves divorced, deserted, and never-married mothers and their offspring. Since the beginning of the program in 1965, in the last 30 years, State and Federal Governments have spent $5.4 trillion on welfare, providing cash, food, housing, medical care, and social services. For the $5.4 trillion spent since 1965, you could buy the entire industrial infrastructure of the United States--every factory, machine, store, every hotel, television station, office building, and still have money left over.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair advises the Senator that his time has expired.
