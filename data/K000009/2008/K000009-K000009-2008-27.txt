Since you mentioned the State of Ohio, I thought I should just state for the record that the vast numbers of people in our State do not favor the extension of NAFTA to Colombia. Indeed, the entire Catholic and Christian communities as well or other organized against this agreement because of the horrendous treatment of Afro-Colombians on the northwestern side of Colombia, as well as the massive killing of labor leaders, the largest number in the world, more than all other countries, combined. So we place human life first, and I just wanted to thank the gentleman, but I don't think you should use the State of Ohio in your argument about Colombia trade. I thank you for yielding to me.
