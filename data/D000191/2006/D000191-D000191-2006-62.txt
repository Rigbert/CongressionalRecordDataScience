  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders say that this unamendable, nonbinding, purely oratory resolution crafted behind closed doors is a referendum on the war on terror. And it is, but not in the way they characterize it.  It is a blanket endorsement of the failed policies, of the diversion of troops and resources from Afghanistan, and the effort to eradicate the Taliban, al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Remember him, the leader of the 9/11 plot? We have not heard much about Osama bin Laden. He is still out there.  It is about the redirection of the bulk of our military intelligence efforts to an unnecessary, preemptive war against the bloody, loathsome dictator who did not have weapons of mass destruction, was not involved in 9/11, was contained, and no direct threat to the United States.  Secretary Rumsfeld, Vice President Cheney said we would be in and out of Iraq in 90 days. Three years, 3 months later, 2,500 dead, we are still there in the middle of a civil war.  A vote for this resolution is a vote to stay the course, unconditionally, indefinitely in Iraq, and leave our troops in the middle of that war. You should not support it. If you want to lead our troops out of the middle of a civil war in Iraq, redeploy and redirect these efforts to a more productive use of our Nation's resources and put an end to al Qaeda and the Taliban once and for all.                          ____________________[Page H4138]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        BOGUS RESOLUTION ON IRAQ  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
