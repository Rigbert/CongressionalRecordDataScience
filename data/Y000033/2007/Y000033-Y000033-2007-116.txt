Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Royce O. Chapman. Mr. Chapman has been an integral part of my operations for more than a decade. He managed my Fairbanks campaign office during the 1992 election and since then Royce has run my Fairbanks District Office. He has been a truly tireless public servant, helping me, the people of Fairbanks and the whole of Alaska.  Royce was born March 4, 1951 in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. He spent his early years in the small farming community of Johnstown, Colorado and graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1969. He attended Western State College of Colorado in Gunnison, Colorado in 1969-1970. After leaving college, Royce started work for Great Western Sugar Company in Johnstown until entering the United States Air Force in April of 1971.  Royce has two brothers: Rodney who lives in Wisconsin, and David in Colorado; and a sister Jana who lives in Oregon. Royce has been married to the former Carolyn Warman since September 2, 1971. They have two adult daughters, Shannon and Stacie, and four grandchildren: Justin, age 10 and Shane, age 7 who live in Seattle, Washington; and Meghan, age 7 and Ryan, age 4 who live in Tok, Alaska,  Royce's public service started in the Air Force. He spent the majority of his time in the Air Force as a Public Affairs Specialist and Technician working in the community relations, internal information, and public information sections. He was also the editor of several base newspapers; along with this he wrote many articles for publication in civilian newspapers and magazines.  Royce served for 20 years with assignments in Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota; Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona; Zaragoza Air Base in Zaragoza, Spain; Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma; and Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. His final assignment was Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska were he served from 1984 until retirement in 1991.  Royce is also a key figure in the community. He is a member of the Optimist Club of Fairbanks, has served on the Fairbanks North Star Borough School Board for 9 years (1997-2006) and is currently sitting on the Fairbanks ``Kids Voting'' Board of Directors.  Royce has been an integral part of my ``Alaska team'' for many years and it saddens me to see him leave. He has used his skills in communication and management to help me better serve the people of Alaska. His outgoing personality, confidential counsel and comprehensive evaluation of situations, have allowed him to do his job to the fullest and for the benefit of all Alaskans.  Royce is a Great Alaskan. I wish him and Carolyn all the best and continued good health as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.                          ____________________
