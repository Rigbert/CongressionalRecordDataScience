 Chairman, in many ways we have already touched on this particular amendment. This is a second amendment. What this amendment deals with is a new proposal that came out of the committee that would do the following: what this proposal would do is say to any State in the country that wants to participate in the very successful weatherization program that they must come up with a 25 percent match.                              {time}  1145  And if they do not come up with that match, they will not participate in the program. There is no debate that that is what the committee is proposing.  Now, the objections to this are many. For a start, the very serious objection is that this proposal comes before us today without any hearings. We have not heard from the States. We talk about trying to improve Federal-State relations and yet we are imposing a significant mandate on the States which they have never had in the history of this program, and yet no one has bothered to ask the governors or the people who are in charge of the energy departments of the various States what the impact will be.  Within that regard, let me mention to my colleagues that in July of 1999, recently, a survey was done by the National Association of State Energy Officials, these are the people that implement this particular program, and what they found was that most States have indicated that they cannot meet this new 25 percent State match which has suddenly been imposed on them. The following 23 States have said that they will not be able to match 25 percent of the weatherization funds and that they will not be able to apply for the fiscal year 2000 funds.  This is the result of a survey done by the States, and I presume they are trying to develop and improve Federal-State relations: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. They have said, for a variety of reasons; maybe their legislature is out of session; maybe they are unable to debate this at the appropriate time.  Now, it seems to me to be extremely unfair to those States and other States, to the lower-income people, to the senior citizens in those States, that suddenly out of nowhere this very cost-effective, successful program will not be able to be implemented in their States. And this is my fear, and nobody can answer this question, because there have been no hearings on this question, what happens, for a variety of reasons, when 10 States say we choose not to participate in that program? The chairman cannot tell me that that is an impossibility. Nobody can because we do not know.  Now, my fear is twofold. If 5 States or if 10 States say we cannot participate in the program, tens of thousands of low-income people will not be eligible to participate in this cost-effective program.  Secondly, this is what will happen in years to come, and I think the gentleman understands this, that if 10 States do not participate in the program, somebody will come before the Congress and say, ``Listen, why are we funding a program when we have 10 or 15 States who are not participating? Who needs this program? Let us end this program.''  I believe this is a good, cost-effective and important program. Low-income people spend a substantial part of their limited income on energy. It makes no sense to our State as a whole and to the individuals to see energy dissipate through the windows, through the doors, through the roofs because homes are not adequately insulated. And in some cases, and people may not recognize this, this is a life and death issue.  Our friend and colleague from Chicago got up here and talked passionately about the issue. He will remember, as we will all remember, that a number of years ago hundreds of elderly people in the City of Chicago died from heat exhaustion. They died from heat exhaustion. The President has made mention that people are dying today from that problem. This is not a program we want to cut.  So I simply say to my good friend, I do understand the difficult problems we have balancing this program with that program. But we have a program that has worked, that has been cost-effective, and we have not gone out to the States.  And let me read something, if I might, to the gentleman. This is a letter that comes to me from the Governor of West Virginia, and he states that, ``With the considerable demands for the limited State funds available, I doubt that West Virginia would be able to meet the match requirement.''  In the State of Oregon, the energy program manager writes, ``If the United States House of Representatives is successful in requiring a 25 percent match in order for States to be awarded low-income weatherization assistance program funds, then Oregon, and perhaps many other States, will not be able to assist the economically disadvantaged with Department of Energy WAP funds.''
