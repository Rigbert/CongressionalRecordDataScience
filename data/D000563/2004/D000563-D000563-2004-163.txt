 These bills--S. 2537 and H.R. 4567--are currently on the Senate calendar. After the warnings we received today from Secretary Ridge, could there be anything more important for us to do at this moment in time but to move to these bills so that units of government in New York, in Illinois, in Alaska, in Nevada are provided with the funds they need immediately, so we can move this process beyond all the political rhetoric and debate on so many issues that take a distant second place to the security of this Nation.  I wonder if it would be appropriate for the Senator to yield to me to make that request, and then I would return the floor to her.
