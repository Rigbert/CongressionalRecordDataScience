President, I rise to speak about the need for legislation to help attract the most highly skilled Federal workforce. To help reach that goal, we need an education system that will ensure that every young person has the tools needed to succeed in the 21st century.   I have spoken many times about the fall of 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into orbit. We were caught off guard as a Nation. The start of the space race revealed to us that major changes had to be made to preserve our national security and to pull ahead in scientific and technological innovation.   One year later, Congress passed landmark legislation--the National Defense Education Act. The purpose of the act was ``to strengthen the national defense and to encourage and assist in the expansion and improvement of educational programs to meet critical national needs.'' The National Defense Education Act provided assistance to State and local school systems to strengthen instruction in science, math, foreign languages, and other critical subjects. It also created low-interest student loan programs and fellowships to open the door to higher education to a greater number of young people.   This coordinated national effort helped our Nation meet its goals. By 1969, Americans had landed on the moon. The United States became the most technologically advanced nation in the world. A new generation of highly skilled mathematicians, scientists, and technology experts were hired to staff laboratories, universities, and Federal agencies. Colleges and universities also established centers for foreign language study and research.   Sadly, this Nation received another wake-up call on September 11, 2001.   The week after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller made a public plea for Arabic and Farsi speakers to assist as translators, signaling the alarming deficiency in fluent speakers of languages crucial to our national security needs. It does our Nation little good to have sophisticated weapons programs if we don't have the scientists to back them up. It does our Nation no good to have expanded intelligence gathering capabilities if what we retrieve sits untranslated. The United States must have the brainpower to match its firepower.  Today I join Senator Akaka to introduce a bill to make investments in our future as a Nation through investments in our education system.  The Homeland Security Education Act will fund partnerships between local school districts and foreign language departments in institutions of higher education. These new foreign language partnerships will provide intensive professional development opportunities for foreign language teachers at every level from Kindergarten to 12th grade. The partnerships will foster contact and communication between university faculty and K-12 teachers in order to improve teachers' knowledge of the languages they teach as well as their teaching skills. Partnerships will also use grant funds to recruit foreign language majors to the classroom. Our bill will give priority to partnerships that include high-need school districts and that put a focus on languages that are critical for our future security needs.  Our bill will encourage more undergraduates to complete degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, and the less-commonly taught, critical foreign languages by establishing a program to forgive the interest on a borrower's student loans if he or she earns a degree in one of these subjects. This will provide an incentive for students who are interested in language, math or science to study them in depth.  The bill establishes grants for partnerships between school districts and private entities to help schools improve science and math curriculum, upgrade laboratory facilities, and purchase scientific equipment. The private sector partner will donate technology or equipment to the school district; provide scholarships for students to study math, science or engineering in college; establish internship or mentoring opportunities for students; or sponsor programs targeted to young people who are under-represented in the fields of math, science and engineering.  In order to stay on top of innovations in science and technology, more professionals in these fields will need to be proficient also in a foreign language. This is imperative to our national security--even some scientific documents and articles in the public domain are beyond the translation capabilities of our government. The Homeland Security Education Act will makegrants available to colleges and universities to establish programs in which students take courses in science, math and technology taught in a foreign language. Funds will also support immersion programs for students to take science and math courses in a non-English speaking country.  The Homeland Security Education Act authorizes $20 million for the National Flagship Language Initiative, which was authorized in the last Congress. The funds will be used to provide institutional grants to universities to graduate specific numbers of students with the foreign language proficiencies needed by the government and will allow the universities to operate foreign language immersion programs overseas. Participating institutions will make available a negotiated number of slots to student applicants who are Federal employees.  With this legislation, we hope to address some of the gaps in homeland security that have been identified by numerous experts and panels, including the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security in the 21st Century. We must do everything possible to ensure that our intellectual preparedness is equal to our military preparedness. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2299       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Education      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) American elementary and secondary schools need more      qualified teachers in mathematics and science.       (2) American colleges and universities must place new      emphasis on improving the teaching in areas of disciplines      that are critical to the interests of the United States.       (3) American elementary and secondary schools need the      equipment and resources to improve education in science and      mathematics.       (4) Foreign language proficiency is crucial to the economic      competitiveness and national security of the United States.      Significant improvement in the quantity and quality of      foreign language instruction offered in United States      elementary and secondary schools is necessary.       (5) All Americans need a global perspective. To understand      the world around us, we must acquaint ourselves with the      languages, cultures, and history of other nations.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure      national security through increasing the quantity, diversity,      and quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the      fields of science, mathematics, and foreign language.

(a) In General.--The Secretary of Education, jointly with      the Director of the National Science Foundation, shall      conduct an assessment of the long-term mathematics and      science needs of the national security workforce and of the      larger Federal workforce of which the national security      workforce is a part.       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of      enactment of this section, the Secretary of Education shall      prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress      a report concerning the findings made with respect to the      assessment conducted under subsection (a).            TITLE III--PROMOTING FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION     SEC. 301. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Foreign language skills and area expertise are integral      to, or directly support, every foreign intelligence      discipline and are essential factors in national security      readiness, information superiority, and coalition      peacekeeping or warfighting missions.       (2) Federal intelligence and defense agencies have been      reporting shortfalls in language capability.       (3) Communicating in languages other than English and      understanding and accepting cultural and societal differences      are vital to the success of peacetime and wartime military      operations.       (4) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is      in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn      and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills,      including pronunciation.       (5) Foreign language study can increase children's capacity      for critical and creative thinking skills, and children who      study a second language show greater cognitive development in      areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and      higher order thinking skills.       (6) Children who have studied a foreign language in      elementary school achieve expected gains and score higher on      standardized tests in reading, language arts, and mathematics      than children who have not studied a foreign language.       (7) Proficiency levels required to perform national      security functions have been raised, and what was once      considered proficiency is no longer the case. The ability to      comprehend and articulate technical and complex information      has become critical.       (8) Languages taught in universities are often not the      languages that address national security needs. The top      languages the United States Defense Language Institute      requires are Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pashto,      Persian-Farsi, Portuguese, Russian, and Serbian-Croatian.      Existing foreign language proficiency in nontargeted      languages also provides a foundation for subsequent foreign      languages, even if unrelated.       (9) Immersion through work or schooling abroad is very      beneficial for developing needed language proficiencies.       (10) Federal agencies have identified the need for      employees proficient in foreign languages who have diverse      skills including cryptography, translation (particularly with      technical documents), debriefing, and interrogation.
