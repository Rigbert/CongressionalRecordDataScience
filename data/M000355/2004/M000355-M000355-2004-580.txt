 President, very briefly, my good friend from Nevada and I discussed this last night and I listened carefully to what he just said. I want to make one adjustment as we get the facts before our colleagues.  On the amendment to prohibit the Labor Department from going forward with the 541 regulations, that was approved in the Senate. We voted on it earlier. It was not approved in the House. That is why it was a matter in conference.  As my good friend from Nevada pointed out, it was subsequently not agreed to in the conference. There was an additional vote in the House on a motion to instruct conferees, which came out the way my friend from Nevada suggests; but on the vote that counted, the House of Representatives did not approve the effort to block the Department of Labor from going forward with the overtime regulation.  As my friend from Nevada conceded, we have voted on this once and I am rather confident, given the persistence of Members on that side of the aisle, at some point we will probably vote on it again. But this underlying bill is a bill that is widely supported on both sides of the aisle. Sanctions have already been imposed on March 1 on Americanbusinesses. I would like to see, and I know the majority leader would like to see, and the vast majority of the Senate would like to see this bill approved so we can move on with other matters that will come before the Senate.                          ____________________
