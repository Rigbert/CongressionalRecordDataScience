Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan was great world leader with a fierce devotion to freedom, democracy, and the sacredness of human life--including the unborn.  He advocated peace through strength and played a major role in dismantling Soviet Communism which he rightly called the evil empire and stopped its extension into Latin America and elsewhere. I remember some of his critics laughing when he challenged Gorbachev in Berlin to ``tear down this wall.'' They're not laughing any more.  Ronald Reagan championed the 1981 tax cut--the largest tax cut in history--totaling $750 billion by 1986. All wage earners--low, moderate and upper income levels--got a 25 percent across-the-board cut in personal income taxes. Long term capital gains were also cut and the results were stunning--19 million new jobs created as Americans began to believe and hope again.  Ronald Reagan was strongly pro-life and fervently believed that women deserved better than abortion and that unborn children are precious and deserve respect.  Having been elected to Congress in 1980 along with President Reagan, I saw firsthand and often how genuine he was. He was a man of abiding principle who inspired our Nation to greatness, always believing America's best years lay ahead.  He endured personal hardship--including an assassination attempt--with incredible poise, dignity, and even humor.  Who can forget President Reagan telling Nancy after he was shot, I forgot to duck.  President Reagan will be missed, but his legend will endure.
