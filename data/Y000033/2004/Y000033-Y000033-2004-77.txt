Mr. Chairman, I am ashamed of my friend from Ohio. I told him earlier today that he did not even have the courtesy to talk to me about this amendment which affects my State, affects my people. You want to protect American jobs, and you have put 15,000 people out of work since 1980. We had the greatest industry in the State gone to waste because of the environmental community.  I am asking for enough timber left, and 4 percent of the total Tongass is all that is available, so I can retain three sawmills to employ about 160 people total with good-paying jobs. And this is not a subsidized forest any more. We pay for these roads. We paid for the activity in the Tongass when we had the bid. That is part of the bid. But this is an easy, cheap vote for somebody from Ohio, somebody who does not know squat about the people of Alaska, and I am disappointed. You are better than that.                Announcement by the Chairman Pro Tempore  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry). The gentleman will suspend.  The Chair reminds all Members to direct their comments to the Chair.
