 As I am sure he knows, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did not nearly cover the costs States and localities incurred do incarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions.  The cost for States and localities amounted to more than $11 billion. Thus, last year's funding level of $565 million covered a mere 5.1 percent, of the actual costs.  Failing to fund the program altogether would be devastating to our States. The State of Wisconsin, for example, would lose more than $3.5 million in funding; Massachusetts would lose over $13 million; Pennsylvania would lose over $2.6 million; Virginia would lose more than $6.4 million; North Carolina would lose $5.2 million; Michigan would lose $2.9 million; Minnesota would lose $1.8 million. Thus, even States that have not traditionally had to confront the growth in illegal immigration are now bearing the costs of this Federal responsibility.  When the Federal Government fails in its responsibility to control our Nation's borders, local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens in State and local jails. I will work closely with the Senators from New Hampshire and South Carolina and my colleagues in both bodies ensure that this bill adequately funds SCAAP.
