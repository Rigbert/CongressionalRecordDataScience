President, on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, who serves as the cochair of the Senate Army Caucus, together with the members of the caucus, I proudly wish to pay tribute to the Honorable John M. McHugh, former Member of the House of Representatives, colleague, friend, and inspirational leader as he leaves his current post as one of the longest serving Secretaries of the Army in U.S. history.  To say this patriot has faithfully served his country is an understatement. After over 42 years of public service, John leaves our Army, our Nation, and our world both safer and more secure. Moreover, his tireless advocacy and bold leadership for our soldiers, civilians, and their family members are legendary. From improvements in family and mental health programs to unprecedented strides in combating sexual assault and suicide, John M. McHugh has truly earned the oft-stated moniker of ``The Soldier's Secretary.''  Raised in Watertown, NY, John served as assistant city manager and went on to serve four terms in the New York State Senate. From there, this great leader was asked to run for Congress, ultimately representing his district in the House of Representatives for nearly 17 years, and rising to be the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.  As Congressman McHugh demonstrated repeatedly, it takes thoughtful, determined, and visionary leadership to ensure the security of our Nation. As a Representative of the 24th and later the 23rd District of New York, which includes one of our most important Army posts, Fort Drum, John ensured that cutting-edge facilities and programs supported our warfighters. To say that Fort Drum is the ``House that McHugh Built'' is very apropos. From MILCON projects to weapons systems, the soldiers, civilians, and families of that historic post were always cared for and supported, and John ensured that the 10th Mountain Division had all of the tools it needed to be at the tip of the spear of our Nation's defense. Moreover, his exceptional work as the cochair of the Army Caucus for over 15 years and as a critical member of the West Point board of visitors was instrumental in improving Congress's understanding of the Army's needs.  During his tenure as the second-longest serving Secretary of the Army, John M. McHugh has been at the very forefront of national military strategy, policy, and programs. His expert leadership, bold initiatives, and pragmatic management of the oldest and largest military service has ensured that our Army remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And it has been no easy task.  John presided over some of the toughest missions the Army has ever faced. From overseeing one of the largest retrogrades in military history; while holding the Army together as it was hit by sequestration; to reorganizing, revamping, and restructuring our force, while our soldiers conducted combat operations around the world, Secretary McHugh led with distinction and results.  Of particular note, John's determination, devotion, and love of our servicemembers ensured that our most sacred and hallowed ground, Arlington National Cemetery, overcame years of neglect and transformed its management and oversight.  With profound admiration and deep respect, we pay tribute to Secretary McHugh for all he has done for our Nation. We thank him for his dedication and sacrifice. We wish him all the fullest measure of peace and happiness as he boldly takes on new challenges in the next phase of his life.                          ____________________
