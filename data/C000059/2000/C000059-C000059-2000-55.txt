 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2917, the Santo Domingo Pueblo Claims Settlement Act of 2000.  This important bill is a result of decades of negotiations between the Pueblo, Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, and the State of New Mexico. The entire New Mexico congressional delegation strongly supports this bill, as does the administration, the Governor of New Mexico, and, most importantly, the Pueblo.  It is not every day that we can resolve a dispute that has lasted over 150 years. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2917.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
