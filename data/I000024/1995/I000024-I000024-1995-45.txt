I have these horrible visions of what happened with Somalia. I can remember when we were trying to bring our troops back from Somalia, and we sent resolutions to President Clinton month after month to bring our troops back from there.  It was not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered and the mutilated corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the American people finally woke up and said, ``We want them back. We don't have strategic interests there that are worth this kind of a sacrifice.'' I see similar things like this are happening over there.  When you talk about the morality of the issue and the fact that we are, in a sense, rewarding those individuals who are guilty of the most serious war crimes, because we are now saying we are on their side and we are doing this, this is something that I think we need to talk about before a decision is made that we are going to go along with this, because I see that happening.  I see discussions taking place in this Chamber and outside the Chamber, ``Well, let's wait until we have some hearings. Let's wait until this,'' and as this is happening, our troops are being deployed over there.
