  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, the Grand Old Oil Party has a case of collective amnesia. They would hope that the American people will share in their amnesia. The American people should forget that for 6 years they controlled everything, the House, the White House and the Congress. And for 6 years they labored and they brought forth the Bush-Cheney energy policy. I voted against it, as did most Democrats. We said it would make us even more dependent upon Saudi Arabia--one of the President's best friends here, the King of Saudi Arabia--and it has. It has worked exactly as they designed.  Now they're born again into caring about other forms of energy and energy independence and American consumers. It's just a smoke screen to cover for their continued addiction to the contributions of the oil industry and to fighting for the oil industry to continue that addiction.  We're bringing forward a bill to break that dependence, to break the enslavement to OPEC, and to move this country toward true energy independence on domestic resources and new technologies and jobs. I don't think anybody believes that they really care about the American consumers.                          ____________________
