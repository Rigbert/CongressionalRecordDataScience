President, the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania has worked as hard on this issue as anybody here. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the original PATRIOT Act was written by myself, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and others. It was the distinguished Republican leader from Texas, Dick Armey, and I who put in the sunset provisions so we would be forced to come back and look at different parts of it. Much of the PATRIOT Act is permanent law, but we should look at certain parts. Those are the parts that are now most in contention because they will expire.  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and I were at the White House on another matter recently and talked briefly about this with the President. I know the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, has been working very hard with us. I think the changes that still need to be made are relatively minor. I urge parties, especially all of us who helped write the original PATRIOTAct, to make that one last effort. That would include, of course, the White House and the other body to do it.  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has worked extraordinarily hard on this legislation. I, like so many others, am willing to continue to work with him. I think with a little nudge from the White House--that nudge may have to be a quiet one among the principals in both bodies--that can be done. I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for the work he is doing on this issue.  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding, even though it is on his time.
