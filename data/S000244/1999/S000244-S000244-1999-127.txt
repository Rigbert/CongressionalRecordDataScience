Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.  This is kind of a tough act to follow, but this is going to be an easier sell than the last amendment that the gentleman from Ohio sold to us. It is my understanding that these amendments relate to a buy-American provision and a utilization of abandoned buildings provision in the bill. Am I correct in that assumption?
