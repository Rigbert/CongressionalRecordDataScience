 LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed.  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Connecticut not agree that if your house is being burned and your wife is being raped, you are not likely to ask the question: Who is this person who is offering to help me? And if our Government were truly offended or if our Government were truly convinced about all these rumors that have been spread around about the KLA, does not my friend from Connecticut agree we would not be taking their phone calls at the State Department and the military and we would not be accepting their advice about what military targets to hit? Is that a reasonable assumption?
