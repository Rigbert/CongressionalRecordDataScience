 President, I join my colleague from Washington State, Senator Cantwell, this evening to congratulate Gary Locke on his confirmation now as our next Secretary of Commerce. This confirmation comes at an important time in our Nation's history as we all work very hard to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. We need a Commerce Secretary with the dedication and expertise to carry out policies that are going to strengthen our economy far into the future. Gary Locke is uniquely qualified for that task because he does have a lifetime of experience built on hard work, a wealth of knowledge, and a unique appreciation of the American dream.  Governor Locke understands the importance of the American dream because he lived it. His grandfather emigrated from China, and he worked as a servant about a mile from the Governor's mansion in Olympia that one day his grandson would call home. There are a lot of reasons why Governor Locke is an ideal Commerce Secretary, but I wish to tell a personal story this evening that I think illustrates his commitment to public service and to making sure we make the best decision for our taxpayers.  I first met Governor Locke when he was in the Washington State legislature and he was chair of the House Appropriations Committee and I was a new State Senator trying to get a piece of legislation passed that was critical to my constituents. As part of getting that bill passed, I had to go before then-Gov. Gary Locke as chair of that Appropriations Committee, and it was one of the toughest political experiences of my lifetime. He knew thebudget inside and out. He ran me through the paces. He grilled me about what my bill would do and how much it would cost and what kind of impact it would have on the taxpayers. He was very tough. But ultimately, because he asked those hard questions and made me defend my legislation, we improved the focus of that legislation and we got it passed. Governor Locke has brought that level of expertise and dedication to the taxpayers in every single position he has held, and it makes him an ideal person now to lead the Commerce Department.  So let me say a few words about the experience Governor Locke brings to this position. One of the most critical jobs the Commerce Secretary performs is finding markets for American products and technologies. He understands how important this is, and he knows how to do it successfully. As the two-term Governor of the Nation's most trade-dependent State, he spent 8 years breaking down trade barriers and promoting our American products, from airplanes to apples to operating systems. He has led numerous successful delegations to our Asian trading partners to help build those relationships. He also understands that the health of the environment has a direct impact on our quality of life and on our economy.  All of Governor Locke's experience means he is going to hit the ground running as our Commerce Secretary as we confront global climate change and other environmental concerns, including the management of our fisheries. So I was very pleased to help support the confirmation of Gary Locke. He won unanimous approval from our Commerce Committee, and today he won unanimous approval from the Senate. He has served the people of Washington State well, and he will bring that same level of commitment and intelligence to this administration.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
