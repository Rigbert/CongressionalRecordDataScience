Speaker, on December 30, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 649, 650, and 651.  Had I been present for rollcall vote 649, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass, as amended, H.R. 3159, the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act, I would have voted ``yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 650, on the motion to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 4057, to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency to veterans and members of the Armed Forces through the provision of information on institutions of higher learning, I would have voted ``yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 651, on the motion to suspend the rules and pass S. 3203, the Dignified Burial and Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act, I would have voted ``yes.''                          ____________________
