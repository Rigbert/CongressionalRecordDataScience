I thought we were confirmed, only to find out almost before the deadline--it was midnight, and there was a desperate attempt on the part of my staff and myself. I needed help to get this done, so I had to redo it. Then the thought occurred to me, we are going to have two Pat Roberts in there: one that my wife did and then the new attempt. I hope that is not the case. I think maybe we have it cleared up, but I am not sure, so we will find out. I hope we don't have to work to find out, but we will find out.  I think that is just a duplication of what everybody in the country is going through. And then what do you do if, in fact, you can't have insurance and you find out about copays and deductibles and all of this. I am repeating a sad story that I think everybody knows.  I thank the Senator from Indiana once again for his heartfelt plea to make the other side understand the error of their ways. I hope we can fix this. I hope they can see fit to fix this down the road. I doubt that will be the case, and I don't think the country will be better off as a result.  I thank the Senator.
