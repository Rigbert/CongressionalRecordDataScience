President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator Hatch in offering an amendment which will add strength, substance, and a new level of appropriate public accountability and involvement in the missions of the Food and Drug Administration.  Quite simply, our amendment provides for real access and participation by patients and consumer groups, science and health experts, and the regulated manufacturers in appropriate policy making functions within the scope of the agency's missions.  As my colleague Senator Hatch has pointed out, our amendment underscores the real partnership FDA must forge with all Americans as it conducts its work certifying the safety and effectiveness of so many products important to our everyday lives.  I certainly want to acknowledge and applaud the assistance and encouragement of our colleagues Senators Jeffords and Kennedy with regard to the development of the FDA reform bill generally, and their work with us in perfecting the agency's mission statement in particular.  I believe this legislation will help create the dialog necessary between the agency and all interested parties in order to effectively exercise all of the other far-reaching elements of this reform bill. I was very pleased to have played some part in the development of that legislation and the broader reform effort, and I know that American citizens dependent on pure food, life-saving new drugs and medical devices, and safe electronic equipment will benefit for many years to come from the work we do here, today.                    Amendment No. 1183, as modified
