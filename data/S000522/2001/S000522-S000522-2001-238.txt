Mr. Speaker, it will take weeks, months, perhaps years, for us to understand the magnitude of the terrorist attacks. Our lives will be changed as we struggle to find a balance between the need for increased security and the necessity of protecting our freedoms.  I was driving to work at the Rayburn House Office Building yesterday morning with my window down because of a broken air conditioner. As I came abreast of the Pentagon, which was on my right, I thought I heard a muffled boom and then, after a few seconds, saw a billowing black cloud of smoke. A few minutes later, when I stopped at the entrance of the Rayburn garage, a Capitol Hill policeman told me, ``They just hit the Pentagon,'' and pointed to the same black cloud of smoke I had just passed.  It will take a while for our government to resume normalcy and for our country to regain its confidence. I used to tell Sunday School students that ``confidence'' comes from the Latin, ``con fides,'' which means ``with faith.'' That is how we will have to proceed.
