 President, I want to let my colleagues know that I have introduced legislation to make it easier for all Americans to bear the cost of a higher education. My legislation, which I offer with my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, would restore the deduction on the interest paid on student loans, which was eliminated in the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  This bill is a simple, direct proposal. Under this legislation, those who are paying off student loans will be able to claim a deduction for that amount and they would be able to claim this deduction for the time it takes to repay the loan.  When we think of investing money, we often think of investing in things--machines, natural resources, or businesses. This measure is an investment in human capabilities and talents. This bill will send the message to college students across America that their intellectual talents are valued and are worth the investment of tax dollars. Students need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value their contributions of the mind.  Then, I believe they will have a greater appreciation of the effort necessary to successfully complete a higher education.  And, increasingly, a higher education is the starting point on a successful career path. According to the Department of Labor, by the year 2000, more than half of all new jobs created will require an education beyond high school.  However, at the same time as a higher education has become increasingly necessary, it has also become increasingly expensive. In the last 10 years, total costs at public college has increased by 23 percent and at private colleges by 36 percent.  According to the General Accounting Office, this means that over the last 15 years, tuition at a public 4-year college or university has nearly doubled as a percentage of median household income. Accordingly to the Congressional Research Service, the best data available indicates that students graduating from a 4-year program leave that institution with an average loan debt of about $10,000. This, of course, represents a significant burden in itself. However, at the current capped rate of 8.25 percent for the basic Federal student loan program, students also bear nearly $1,000 in interest debt. For individuals just starting out, this extra burden adds insult to injury. We, in the Congress, can send the signal that we value higher education and recognize the financial responsibility students have by restoring the deduction on the interest on student loans.  Furthermore, this proposal is more affordable than what the President has proposed. His tuition deduction which received cost estimates ranging from $36 to $42 billion. What I and my college from Illinois are proposing addresses interest cost, which, of course, is a percentage of tuition cost. I believe our proposal provides college students with the help they really need, while at the same time being fiscally manageable. That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Senator Moseley-Braun and I in supporting the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act.                          ____________________
