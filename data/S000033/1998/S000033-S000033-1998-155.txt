 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record these statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues.Statement by Trevor Gingras, Miranda Girvan, Jessica Bordeaux and April                     Hathaway Regarding Teen Smoking       Trevor Gingras: We interviewed teenagers to see how many      did and didn't smoke. Out of the ten, eight of the teens      smoked. Teenage smoking rates go higher and higher each year.      They start at a young age and get addicted to it. Some      teenagers got started by getting pressured by their friends,      some started smoking because they think it is cool, and some      teenagers smoke because their parents smoke and they figure      it is okay.       Teens get their cigarettes by either their parents or      someone who is old enough to buy them. No law or even raising      the price of the cigarettes are going to stop the teens from      smoking. Teens save their money for gas for their cars and to      get cigarettes. There are many places where teens are allowed      to smoke, so this doesn't help the issue any.       We also did a survey on what types of cigarettes teens      smoke. These were the results: Marlboros, Camels, Newports      and Parliaments.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you.                                  ____Statement by Shawn Brackett and Sid Messick Regarding Federal Funds for                              Youth Programs       Shawn Brackett: Hello. My name is Shawn Brackett, and this      is Sid Messick. We represent Youth Build Burlington. Youth      Build Burlington is a unique program dedicated to helping      out-of-school youth complete their education and prepare for      the world of work. Youth Build does this by providing      alternating weeks of academic instruction and on-the-job      training in construction skills. We also perform community      service by building or renovating affordable housing units      and providing our help to local agencies.       For example, Youth Build provided assistance during the      Montgomery flood cleanup efforts last summer, and during the      ice storm cleanup this January. We are currently completing      the construction of a new house on Hyde Street.       Currently, I am completing my high school diploma through      Youth Build, and Sid is completing his GED requirements. Over      the past ten months, Youth Build has helped four of us earn      our high school diplomas and eleven of us have already earned      our GEDs. Youth Build has provided us with a supportive      atmosphere. It has made counseling available and instruction      in small groups or on an individual basis. Without Youth      Build, none of us would have completed our education or      learned the work readiness skills that we need to move ahead      in our lives. If this program is not funded in the future, it      will be an immeasurable loss to the youth and the community.       Sid Messick: What Youth Build has done for me has changed      my life a lot. I was in trouble a lot all the time. So I      decided to go back to school, because my probation officer      said Youth Build would be a good program. So I just about      have my GED completed, and my construction certificate.       The amount that it cost for one Youth Build student for one      year is $20,000. We do activities like volunteer work also.      Like the ice storm, we helped like elderly people clean up      their yard and whatnot. We do like activities, like at the      Racket's Edge. We are trying to set up one to go to Camp      Abanaki.       That is pretty much it, but it has done a lot for me.       Congressman Sanders: Shawn?       Shawn Brackett: For people that are looking for places to      go for the youth in the community, I think Youth Build is the      best program for a lot of kids that will jump at the      opportunity, if they research it, with Youth Build. It is the      ideal program for this community.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very, very much. That was an      excellent presentation.                                  ____ Statement by Andrew Jaspersohn, Heather Cook, Debbie Cole and Alexis                        Oustinoff Regarding Issues       Andrew Jaspersohn: Thank you Congressman Sanders,      distinguished panel members. My name is Andrew Jaspersohn. I      am a senior at Lamoille Union High School in Hyde Park,      Vermont. I am also a product of school overcrowding. From      grades one through six, I attended an elementary school,      Johnson Elementary, that has some 375 students in a turn-of-     the-century building meant for fewer than 300. At Lamoille      Union High School, my student life in overcrowded conditions      has continued. I have taken math classes with as many as 30      students in a classroom designed for fewer than 25. I      witnessed teachers teaching in hallways, closets and      stairwells, and have seen one of Lamoille's finest teachers,      Mark Gilbertson, who is also a member of 1990 U.S. winter      Olympic ski team, pushing a grocery cart full of the teaching      materials through the crowded hallways of our school for want      of a permanent classroom.       Congressman Sanders, I have managed to have a decent high      school education despite overcrowded conditions, but I      wonder, sir, how much better that education might have been      given more space. I also wonder about those students, many of      them friends of mine, who dropped out of school early, who,      in effect, fell through the cracks of our overcrowded      infrastructure. Education takes time, but it also takes      space.       Debbie Cole: As a student at Lamoille Union, I have been      overall satisfied by my education, but continually frustrated      by the limited opportunities. As a result of overcrowding and      underfunding, there is a lot that my school has not been able      to offer me.       The beginning of ever semester finds me in the guidance      office pleading for more classes and less study halls.      Usually, I end up pursuing the list of courses offered and at      what times, and rearranging my own schedule. In this way, I      have incorporated woodworking, cooking and creative writing      into my schedule, usually with the help of my counselor      pulling strings to get me into an already full class. By      second semester, senior year, I was left with 18 out of 40      periods per week as study halls, almost 50 percent. Two of      the classes were only being taken to fill time because that      was all that was available. They held no real interest to me.      The other classes that I would not have minded taking were      only offered during the periods when I had my essential      courses.       The one thing my school could offer was an honors program      which allowed me to take up to two courses at Johnson State      College for $50 apiece. I took advantage of this, and now      have two college credits that are transferable. However, by      the time I paid for the classes, the fees and the books, the      cost was up to $150 per class, not to mention I needed my own      transportation. This was a valuable alternative, but not an      ideal one for many people.       Students should have alternatives within the school which      could be provided by more space and more funding. I would      have much preferred to take other high school classes than to      be removed from the high school environment for over half the      day. With more space and more teachers, more classes could be      offered, not to mention the current class size would      decrease, making all the courses more effective. Space and      money are also key aspects to incorporating satellite      learning into the school systems.       Students should have more options within their schools.      They should be completely satisfied by their high school      careers, based solely on the offerings of their schools, and      not have to search elsewhere, if they don't choose to.       Alexis Oustinoff: There always has been a greater demand      for tax dollars than will ever be available. However, a look      at the news on any given day sends warning signals that we      need to deal with the youths of this country.       By doing this, many problems may be prevented in the      future. The best place to deal with youth is in a school      system, especially as the schools are forced to take on roles      formerly left to the families. By spending money on the      schools to upgrade facilities, install adequate technology,      and make sure quality teaching is provided, we can only      enhance the education, and also make school a better vehicle      to help our youth and prevent outbreaks of violence that we      have seen so much of lately.       Our proposed solution to these issues is that the Public      School Modernization Act be passed. Until now, our district      has been able to fund temporary fixes, such as our now      decrepit modular classrooms, instead of projects that would      not only accommodate our immediate needs but our future      needs. The Public Schools Renewal Act would also improve      education by providing grants and programs to help schools      improve conditions and train teachers. Our school is not      alone in this problem. Other states have been struggling with      these problems of overcrowding for years. And what we would      like to see is some of these acts actually passed into law.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much.                               ____________________
