 In the center of downtown Benton Harbor sits a large rock, engraved with the name of Dwight ``Pete'' Mitchell City Center Park. That certainly represents Pete Mitchell--he's solid as a rock, a foundation for our community. An accomplished boxer as a young man, Pete Mitchell, like his hometown of Benton Harbor, has shown he can take a punch, and he can fight back and win. Many of the projects that are being accomplished right now that are leading Benton Harbor's renaissance have benefited from Pete's quiet and steady leadership. Whether it's the Arts District, downtown development, new housing, or new jobs and recreation, Pete was there with the vision and perseverance to put together the partnerships that are making a difference in lives of Benton Harbor residents.  While Pete is retiring as Benton Harbor City Manager, he has a long legacy of involvement in his community. A 1954 graduate of Benton Harbor High School, Pete has served on the Benton Harbor Area Schools board, the Airport Authority, the Council for World-Class Communities, the Boys and Girls Club, and a number of other organizations in his hometown. He has been honored by Lake Michigan College with the Distinguished Alumni Award, and was a recipient of the College's Diversity Award.  Pete Mitchell is a man who dedicated his life to his hometown, and to the betterment of his fellow man. He is truly ``The Rock.''                          ____________________
