 On September 26, 2001, this body confirmed Hilda's nomination to be Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Hilda is doing a fantastic job at that post and I wish her many years of continued success.  I have been privileged to know Hilda Legg for many years. She is a native Kentuckian who has worked very hard to improve the lives of the people of the Commonwealth. Hilda is one of those unique individuals who exudes the kind of enthusiasm and spunk that everybody wants to possess. Her energy and drive have allowed her to lead a storied life that is full of family, friends, and accomplishments. Hilda truly is one of a kind.  Hilda began her professional career as a teacher in Adair County, KY, and went on from there to work at the U.S. Department of Education during President Reagan's first term. In 1984, she jumped headfirst into the world of politics and worked on the successful Reagan-Bush presidential campaign. That same year she also helped me achieve victory in my very first Senate campaign. From 1985-1987 she proudly served the people of western Kentucky as a Field Representative in my Bowling Green office.  Hilda is most widely known and praised for her service and dedication to the people of rural Kentucky and America. Raised without running water, the difficulties facing rural Americans is something Hilda experienced firsthand as a child. As the Executive Director and CEO of the Center for Rural Development in Somerset, Kentucky, Hilda strongly promoted economic development in eastern and southern Kentucky. Her leadership at this state-of-the-art facility helped make the Center a national model for economic development in rural areas and for related educational, cultural, and recreational purposes.  Now, as Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, Hilda is working on behalf of millions of people throughout the United States. Specifically, her Agency is responsible for helping rural Americans finance electric, telecommunications, and water projects. The RUS also provides valuable loans and grants for rural distance learning and telemedicine projects. President Bush was wise to choose Hilda for this important position and I am confident she will prove to be as good a friend to rural America as she has been to rural Kentucky.  Hilda, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your contributions to Kentucky and this great nation. I wish you and your family the very best.                          ____________________
