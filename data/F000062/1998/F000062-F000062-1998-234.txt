 President, I am introducing today, the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act of 1998. Similar to the House passed Child Support Performance and Incentive Act, this legislation decreases penalties for states who didn't make the October 1997 child support enforcement system deadline but this legislation provides exemptions for those counties, such as Los Angeles county, that made the deadline even if the state didn't.  This legislation decreases the overall penalties to 4% of the child support administrative funds in the first year, and doubles the percentage of penalties each year, capping it at 20% by the fourth year. Additionally, if the state becomes certified during the year, 75% of the penalties would be forgiven for that fiscal year. The penalty structure in this legislation is the same as Clay Shaw's bill, HR3130, which passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago and awaits consideration in the Senate Finance Committee.  The current penalties for not having the child support enforcement system up and running are enormous. States would be penalized all their TANF (AFDC) funding and their child support administration funds for the year.  The total loss in TANF funds and child support administrative funds from the 14 states amount to over $8 billion annually and for California, the penalty would be $3.7 billion in TANF funds and $300 million in child support administrative funds annually.  What is unique about this legislation is that in addition to lowering penalties, it exempts from the penalties those counties who had their own certifiable systems prior to October 31, 1997.  All of us agree that for states who did not make the deadline, they should be held accountable. But for thosestates who have county based child support systems where individual counties could have been certified by HHS independently, it is unfair to penalize the counties with the state.  For California, 25% or $75 million of the penalty will be borne by LA County, the largest county in the nation serving 550,000 families and whose program is larger than 42 other states. Despite the fact that LA County completed its system by the October 1997 deadline and could be certified as recognized by HHS in its March 2, 1998 proposed rules, LA County will be penalized along with the rest of California.  This is unfair and wrong. As I propose in my legislation, when counties have met the system requirement by building their own system with separate HHS funding, their portion should be exempted from the total penalties imposed on a state.  Mr. President, I know there is bi-partisan support for my proposal which is similar to Clay Shaw's bill which passed the House. My proposal differs from Shaw's bill in that it exempts penalties for those counties who met all the requirements and completed their child support enforcement system before the October 1997 deadline. This provision is critical for many states whose counties have done their job but will suffer enormous penalties because the state as a whole have failed.  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, the memorandum of understanding, and excerpts from 42 CFR Part 307 be printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1798       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION. 1. ALTERNATIVE PENALTY PROCEDURE FOR CHILD SUPPORT                    DATA PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS.       (a) In General.--Section 455(a) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 655(a)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(4)(A) If--       ``(i) the Secretary determines that a State plan under      section 454 would (in the absence of this paragraph) be      disapproved for the failure of the State to comply with      section 454(24)(A), and that the State has made and is      continuing to make a good faith effort to so comply; and       ``(ii) the State has submitted to the Secretary a      corrective compliance plan that describes how, by when, and      at what cost the State will achieve such compliance, which      has been approved by the Secretary,     then the Secretary shall not disapprove the State plan under      section 454, and the Secretary shall reduce the amount      otherwise payable to the State under paragraph (1)(A) of this      subsection for the fiscal year by the penalty amount.       ``(B) In this paragraph:       ``(i) The term `penalty amount' means, with respect to a      failure of a State to comply with section 454(24)--       ``(I) 4 percent of the penalty base, in the case of the 1st      fiscal year in which such a failure by the State occurs;       ``(II) 8 percent of the penalty base, in the case of the      2nd such fiscal year;       ``(III) 16 percent of the penalty base, in the case of the      3rd such fiscal year; or       ``(IV) 20 percent of the penalty base, in the case of the      4th or any subsequent such fiscal year.       ``(ii) The term `penalty base' means, with respect to a      failure of a State to comply with section 454(24) during a      fiscal year, the amount otherwise payable to the State under      paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection for the preceding fiscal      year, minus the applicable share of such amount which would      otherwise be payable to any county to which the Secretary      granted a waiver under the Family Support Act of 1988 (Public      Law 100-485; 102 Stat. 2343) for 90 percent enhanced Federal      funding to develop an automated data processing and      information retrieval system provided that such system was      implemented prior to October 1, 1997.       ``(C)(i) The Secretary shall waive a penalty under this      paragraph for any failure of a State to comply with section      454(24)(A) during fiscal year 1998 if--       ``(I) by December 31, 1997, the State has submitted to the      Secretary a request that the Secretary certify the State as      having met the requirements of such section;       ``(II) the Secretary has provided the certification as a      result of a review conducted pursuant to the request; and       ``(III) the State has not failed such a review.       ``(ii) If a State with respect to which a reduction is made      under this paragraph for a fiscal year achieves compliance      with section 454(24)(A) by the beginning of the succeeding      fiscal year, the Secretary shall increase the amount      otherwise payable to the State under paragraph (1)(A) of this      subsection for the succeeding fiscal year by an amount equal      to 75 percent of the reduction for the fiscal year.       ``(D) The preceding provisions of this paragraph (except      for subparagraph (C)(i)) shall apply, separately and      independently, to a failure to comply with section 454(24)(B)      in the same manner in which the preceding provisions apply to      a failure to comply with section 454(24)(A).''.       (b) Inapplicability of Penalty Under TANF Program.--Section      409(a)(8)(A)(i)(III) of such Act (42 U.S.C.      609(a)(8)(A)(i)(III)) is amended by inserting ``(other than      section 454(24))'' before the semicolon.

(a) In General.--Section 452(d)(3) of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.C. 652(d)(3)) is amended to read as follows:       ``(3) The Secretary may waive any requirement of paragraph      (1) or any condition specified under section 454(16), and      shall waive the single statewide system requirement under      sections 454(16) and 454A, with respect to a State if--       ``(A) the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the      Secretary that the State has or can develop an alternative      system or systems that enable the State--       ``(i) for purposes of section 409(a)(8), to achieve the      paternity establishment percentages (as defined in section      452(g)(2)) and other performance measures that may be      established by the Secretary;       ``(ii) to submit data under section 454(15)(B) that is      complete and reliable;       ``(iii) to substantially comply with the requirements of      this part; and       ``(iv) in the case of a request to waive the single      statewide system requirement, to--       ``(I) meet all functional requirements of sections 454(16)      and 454A;       ``(II) ensure that the calculation of distribution of      collected support is according to the requirements of section      457;       ``(III) ensure that there is only 1 point of contact in the      State for all interstate case processing and coordinated      intrastate case management;       ``(IV) ensure that standardized data elements, forms, and      definitions are used throughout the State; and       ``(V) complete the alternative system in no more time than      it would take to complete a single statewide system that      meets such requirement;       ``(B)(i) the waiver meets the criteria of paragraphs (1),      (2), and (3) of section 1115(c); or       ``(ii) the State provides assurances to the Secretary that      steps will be taken to otherwise improve the State's child      support enforcement program; and       ``(C) in the case of a request to waive the single      statewide system requirement, the State has submitted to the      Secretary separate estimates of the total cost of a single      statewide system that meets such requirement, and of any such      alternative system or systems, which shall include estimates      of the cost of developing and completing the system and of      operating the system for 5 years, and the Secretary has      agreed with the estimates.''.       (b) Payments to States.--Section 455(a)(1) of such Act (42      U.S.C. 655(a)(1)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (B);       (2) by striking the semicolon at the end of subparagraph      (C) and inserting ``, and''; and       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:       ``(D) equal to 66 percent of the sums expended by the State      during the quarter for an alternative statewide system for      which a waiver has been granted under section 452(d)(3), but      only to the extent that the total of the sums so expended by      the State on or after the date of the enactment of this      subparagraph does not exceed the least total cost estimate      submitted by the State pursuant to section 452(d)(3)(C) in      the request for the waiver.''.                                                                    ____                      Memorandum of Understanding       This agreement is entered into by Wayne A. Stanton,      Administrator, Family Support Administration (FSA),      Department of Health and Human Services, Ira Reiner, Los      Angeles County District Attorney, Richard B. Dixon, Los      Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer, and Dennis      Boyle, Deputy Director, State Department of Social Services,      to resolve certain issues relating to needed improvement in      the Los Angeles County child support enforcement program.       It is understood and agreed that there is a top level      management commitment to accomplish management standards to      performance and to develop an automated system that can      adequately support the program operations and to employ      sufficient staff to carry out the duties of the Child Support      Program.       It is further understood and agreed that the lack of an      automation system that can adequately support the program      operations and the present number of employees assigned to      carry out the duties of the family support program have      significantly contributed to the current level of child      support collections.       All concerned parties will work together to quickly      complete Requests For Proposals for the following areas      consistent with applicable County charter and ordinance      provisions which require findings of cost effectiveness or      feasibility:       1. To replace, enlarge, or modify Los Angeles County's      existing Automated Child Support Enforcement System;       2. Supplemental locate and collection services for hard-to-     find absent parents;       3. An automated billing system;       4. Process serving;       5. Banking/Court Trustee operations;       6. Blood testing;       7. Data preparation of case backlog in anticipation of      automation.       The District Attorney's Office will immediately begin      hiring within current budgetary authorizations the necessary      additional qualified employees to provide required child      support enforcement program services.       All concerned parties will work together to:       1. Develop and approve a six to ten page planning Advance      Planning Document (as detailed on the Attachment).       2. Revise Request For Proposals and Advance Planning      Document so as to require the use of existing hardware.       The FSA will advise the State that Los Angeles County, in      recognition of the size of its caseload, is eligible to      establish its own automated system which may be separate from      any other system(s) which may be required of other countries.       The State will request and FSA will consider in a timely      manner an 1115 waiver so as to provide Los Angeles County 90%      funding to replace, enlarge or modify Los Angeles County's      existing Automated Child Support Enforcement System and not      jeopardize 90% funding for other systems within the State.       This document expresses the will and commitment of the      Federal, State, and County Governments to expedite the      approval processes necessary to accomplish the goals set      forth herein.     Wayne A. Stanton,       Administator, Family Support Administration.     Gregory Thompson,       Chief, Deputy District Attorney, District Attorney's      Office.     Richard B. Dixon,       Chief Administrative Officer, Chief, Administrative Office.     Dennis Boyle,       Deputy Director, State Department of Social Services.                                                                    ____                     Excerpts From 45 CFR Part 307    Automated Data Processing Funding Limitation for Child Support                           Enforcement Systems       Summary: The Federal share of funding available at an 80      percent matching rate for child support enforcement automated      systems changes resulting from the Personal Responsibility      and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act is limited to a total      of $400,000,000 for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. This      proposed rule responds to the requirement that the Secretary      of Health and Human Services issue regulations which specify      a formula for allocating this sum among the States,      Territories and eligible systems.       PRWORA requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services      to issue regulations which specify a formula for allocating      the $400,000,000 available at 80 percent FFP among the States      and Territories. The Balanced Budget Act Amendments add      specified systems to the entities included in the formula.      The allocation formula must take into account the relative      size of State and systems IV-D (child support enforcement)      caseloads and the level of automation needed to meet title      IV-D automated data processing requirements. Accordingly, we      propose to revise 45 CFR Part 307 to include conforming      changes and to add Sec. 307.31.     Conditions That Must Be Met for 80 Percent Federal Financial                              Participation       Pub. L. 104-193 provides enhanced funds to complete      development of child support enforcement systems which meet      the requirements of both the Family Support Act and PRWORA.      From this we conclude that no change in the conditions for      receipt of funds was anticipated by Congress. Thus, we      propose to retain in 45 CFR Part 307.31 the same conditions      for receipt funds at 80 percent FFP which appear at      Sec. 307.30 (a), (b), (c), and (d) and apply to claims for      FFP at the 90 percent rate.       Throughout this notice of proposed rulemaking we use      ``State'' as the inclusive term for States, Territories and      approved systems as described in 42 U.S.C. 655(a)(3)(B)(iii)      (section 455(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act) as added to the Act by      section 5555 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-     33). The technical amendments to section 455(a)(3)(B) of the      Act changed the entities included in the allocation formula      by adding ``system'' to States and Territories. For purposes      of this proposed rule, a system eligible for enhanced funding      is a system approved by the Secretary to receive funding at      the 90 percent rate for the purpose of developing a system      that meets the requirements of section 454(16) of the Act (42      U.S.C. 654(16)) (as in effect on and after September 30,      1995) and section 454A of the Act (42 U.S.C. 654A), including      a system that received funding for this purpose pursuant to a      waiver under section 1115(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1315(a)).                           Allocation Formula       Section 344(b)(3)(C) of PRWORA requires the Secretary to      allocate by formula the $400,000,000 available at the 80      percent FFP rate. This section specifies that the formula      take into account the relative size of State IV-D caseloads      and the level of automation needed to meet applicable      automatic data processing requirements. The legislative      history does not elaborate on the meaning of these factors.       The allocation formula proposed in this section is the      product of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. We      sought information from child support enforcement systems      experts, financial experts, economists, State IV-D directors,      and national associations. Before drafting regulations we      asked States to suggest approaches for allocating the      available Federal share of the funds. In a number of open      forums we sought suggestions for the allocation formula. An      internal working group considered the information from      States, reviewed the suggestions, then developed the proposed      allocation formula.       Simply stated, the proposed formula first allots a base      amount of $2,000,000 to each State to take into account the      level of automation needed to meet the automated data      processing requirements of title IV-D. The formula, then,      allots an additional amount to States based on both their      reported IV-D caseload and their potential caseload based on      Census data on children living with one parent.       As indicated earlier, we use ``State'' as the inclusive      term for States, Territories and systems described in 42      U.S.C. 655(a)(3)(B)(iii) (455(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act) as      amended by section 5555 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.      The technical amendments to section 455(a)(3)(B) of the Act      changed the entities included in the allocation formula by      adding ``system'' to States.       At this time caseload and census data are not available for      Los Angeles County. Therefore, the tables in appendix A show      a base amount allocated to Los Angeles County and blank cells      for the caseload factor and the census factor. With a base      amount assigned for Los Angeles County, we can calculate the      total remaining funds available for allocation among the      other States. California's caseload factor and census factor      represent the total for the State, including Los Angeles      County. The California IV-D agency and the Los Angeles County      IV-D agency have been asked to provide us with caseload and      census data, as described below, showing Los Angeles County's      share of the California total.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 1799. A bill to amend section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that a member of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be treated as using a principal residence while away from home on extended active duty; to the Committee on Finance.                       tax exclusion legislation  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code. This bill would modify the home ownership test for Sales of Primary Residence so that members of our Armed Forces, who are away on active duty, qualify for the existing tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main residence. This amendment will not create a new tax benefit; it merely modifies current law to include the time military personnel are away from home on active duty when calculating the number of years the home owner has lived in their primary residence. In short, this amendment is narrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to millions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes that affect individuals, families, investors and businesses. It is also one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent memory.  Mr. President, as with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in this instance, there is an unintended loser: military personnel. The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a much-needed tax break when they sell their primary residence. Under the old rule, taxpayers received a one-time exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal residence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in the residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision primarily benefited elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief to younger taxpayers and their families.  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under the new law, all taxpayers who sell their personal residence on or after May 7, 1997, are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale. Joint filers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they made from selling their principal residence.  Mr. President, I applaud the bi-partisan cooperation that resulted in this much-needed form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great, and it is. However, when we delve deeperinto this law, we note that the taxpayer must meet two requirements to qualify for this tax relief. To qualify, the taxpayer must (1) own the home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and (2) live in the home as their MAIN home for at least 2 years of the last 5 years.  The second part of this test unintentionally prohibits many of our women and men in the Armed Services from qualifying for this beneficial tax relief. Constant travel across the U.S. and abroad is inherent to military service. Nonetheless, some military personnel choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, even though they will not live there for much of the time. Under the new law, if you do not have a spouse, and are also forced to travel, you will not qualify for the full benefit of the new home sales provision, because no one ``lives'' in the home for the required period of time. The current law also hits dual-military couples that are often away on active duty. They, would not qualify for the home sales exclusion because neither spouse ``lives'' in the house for enough time to qualify for the exclusion.  Today, the United States has approximately 37,000 men and women deployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, if so ordered. There are another 8,000 American troops deployed in Bosnia, and another 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support of other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 women and men deployed outside of the United States, away from their primary home. These women and men are abroad protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear.  It is fundamentally unfair to deny these men and women the same tax relief as their civilian counterparts. The newly enacted current home sale provision unintentionally discourages home ownership among military personnel. Many of our troops simply do not qualify for the homes sales tax relief because they are away from their home so much of the time.  Discouraging home ownership among military personnel is unfair and bad fiscal policy. Home ownership has numerous benefits for communities and individual homeowners. Having a fixed home provides Americans with a sense of community, and adds stability to our nation's neighborhoods. Home ownership also generates valuable property taxes for our nation's communities.  We are in a period of robust growth. Americans who are fortunate enough to do so, reap the benefits of our country's growth by investing in the stock market. Many of our nation's recent millionaires became millionaires through the stock market. However, many middle- and lower-income Americans don't hold vast amounts of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the like. Therefore, how does the average American participate in our nation's robust growth? Through home ownership.  Appreciation in the value of a home resulting from our country's overall economic growth allows everyday Americans to participate in our country's prosperity. Fortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this, and provided this break to lessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay on the profit they make when they sell their main homes.  This bill simply remedies an inequality in the new law. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of our Armed Forces will be considered to be using their house as their main residence for any period that they are away on extended active duty. In short, military personnel will be deemed to be using their house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, in the ``no man's land,'' commonly called the DMZ between North and South Korea, or anywhere else on active duty orders.  We cannot afford to discourage Military service by penalizing military personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing their job. Military service in itself entails sacrifice, such as long periods of time away from friends and family, and the constant threat of mobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to heap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further inequities such as the current Home Sales provision is to adopt a fairer, flatter tax that is far less complicated than our current system. But, in the meantime, we must insure that the tax code is fair and equitable.  The Taxpayers' relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping tax relief to all Americans, including our women and men in uniform. Yes, it is true that there are winners and losers in any tax code. However, this inequity is unintended. We should enact this narrowly tailored remedy to grant equal tax relief to the members of our Armed Services.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
