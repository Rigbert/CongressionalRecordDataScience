Speaker, I am honored to rise today to commemorate Leonard and Ruby Bassett on their golden wedding anniversary. The Bassetts' children, Leonard Jr., Dennis, Leatha, and Oddette, are hosting a joyous celebration honoring their parents' 50 years of love, friendship and devotion. This event will be held this Saturday, July 20, 1996, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, IN.  While in their early twenties Leonard Bassett and Ruby Holman met in the spring of 1946 at a dance hall located across from Froebel High School in Gary. Mr. Bassett had just returned from 28 months of service in the U.S. Navy and resolved to attend a dance that was being held for young adults. It was there that they first met. The two knew of each other during their years at Roosevelt High School, but they did not formally meet until this magical night at the dance.  After courting for a couple of months, the two discovered that they shared the same dreams of settling down and starting a family. After a short period of dating, Leonard and Ruby knew that they had found true love and that they were destined to be partners in life. Shortly thereafter, Leonard and Ruby were joined in holy matrimony on July 21, 1946.  During the Bassetts' 50 years of marriage they had 4 children: Leonard, Jr., Dennis, Leatha, and Oddette. The Bassetts are thankful that, following graduation from Roosevelt High School, all four of their children were able to continue on to higher education and establish themselves in their respective careers.  In 1983, Leonard retired from U.S. Steel after devoting 37 years of his life to the steel industry. Leonard retired as a production foreman. When Ruby retired, she was head cook of the Gary Community School Corp. Currently, she is a part-time employee with the Lake County government. Ruby is also a precinct committee person and co-captain of the fifth precinct in Gary.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bassetts as they celebrate 50 years of marriage. In today's world, it is refreshing to see two people who have devoted their lives to creating a successful marriage and happy family. May the Bassetts be a positive role model for today's young couples who are starting families. They are proof that a little dedication and a lot of love can make marriage one of life's most magnificent experiences.                          ____________________
