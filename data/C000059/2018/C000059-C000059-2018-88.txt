Chair, I appreciate the interest in our Nation's water infrastructure needs.  Although this amendment does not do what the gentleman intends it to do, I think it is always important for Congress to have a clear understanding of what improvements need to be made to meet the quality goals of the Clean Water Act.  Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment I can accept, and I yield back the balance of my time.
