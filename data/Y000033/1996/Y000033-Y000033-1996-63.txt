Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3752, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act of 1996, asserts the power of Congress under article IV, section 3 of the United States Constitution over management and use of lands belonging to the United States. So that everyone understands, the concern here is the U.S. Congress--and therefore, the people of the United States--are left out of the domestic process to designate ``World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves.'' This will require the participation of the U.S. Congress and the citizens of this Nation in the process.  Within the last 25 years, more and more of our Nation's land has become subject to international land-use restrictions. A total of 67 sites in the United States have been designated as ``UN Biosphere Reserves or World Heritage Sites.'' These land designations under the World Heritage and Biosphere Reserve programs have been created with virtually no congressional oversight and no congressional hearings. The public and local governments are rarely consulted.  The World Heritage Site program is based on a treaty. This bill does not suggest that the United States shrug off the World Heritage Site program. We have a domestic law implementing the program and H.R. 3752 proposes to change that domestic law so that Congress must approve the sites.  In the case of Biosphere Reserves, the program is not even authorized by a single U.S. law or even an international treaty. That is wrong. Executive branch appointees--whatever their political party--cannot and should not do things that the law does not authorize.  What is unreasonable about Congress insisting that no land be designated for inclusion in these international land use programs without clear and direct approval of Congress? We need to reemphasize the congressional duty to keep international commitments from floating free of traditional Constitutional constraints. Otherwise, the boundaries between one owner's land and another or even between the government's land and private property are too easily ignored.  H.R. 3752 provides a process under which the United States may when desirable designate lands for inclusion under certain international agreements. This process will protect: State sovereignty, individual rights of United States citizens, and private interests in real property. This bill will also prevent attempts by the Executive branch to use international land designations to bypass the Congress in making land use decisions.  H.R. 3752 is a good bill which will protect our domestic land use decision-making process from unnecessary international interference. I look forward to reporting this bill to the House for consideration.  Mr. Speaker, if World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves have strong grassroots support, then why haven't we seen any evidence of this?  I have here a letter from the chairman of the Minnesota Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee, the Honorable Bob Lessard, which supports H.R. 3752 lamenting the lack of public input in these designations. I request that this letter along with the attached letters be entered in the Record.  At our committee hearing, local elected officials from Eddy County, NM; Ulster County, NY; and Lake George, NY testified in support of H.R. 3752 and also criticized the lack of public process in making these international designations.  Moreover, we also have received letters of support from the coalition of Arizona/New Mexico coalition and northern counties land use coordinating council in Minnesota.                                                           Senate,                                           State of Minnesota,                                               September 25, 1996.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: I am writing to express my strong      support for your bill the American Land Sovereignty Act (H.R.      3752) which would provide badly needed congressional      oversight for areas designated as World Heritage Sites or      International Biosphere Reserves in accordance with the      United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural      Organization (UNESCO).       The Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve was proposed      for much of northern Minnesota in the mid-1980's. This      proposal included Voyagers National Park and the Boundary      Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.       Thankfully, the area was withdrawn from consideration      because of massive local oppositions. A bipartisan commission      created by the Minnesota Legislature concluded, among other      things, that the designation would be contrary to the purpose      for which Voyageurs National Park was established. It was      also found that this designation included provisions for      creating buffer zones around federal areas. I understand that      former Wilderness Society President George Frampton, who is      currently Assistant Secretary of Interior for Fish, Wildlife      and Parks, proposed creating biosphere reserves around all      national parks and wilderness areas where roads would be      closed and economic development would be eliminated.       I also understand that dozens of these areas have been      created throughout the United States with virtually no      legislative oversight or public input. I consider this an      appalling situation that needs to be remedied.       As Chairman of the Senate Environmental and Natural      Resources Committee, I am concerned about the motives and      intentions of those who propose increased federal and state      land use control under the guise of program administered by      the United Nations.       In that day and age of open government. I cannot understand      how programs like these can continue without congressional      oversight and local public input. As a result, I      enthusiastically support the American Land Sovereignty Act.                                          Senator Bob Lessard,                                      Chairman, Senate Environment     and Natural Resources Committee.                                                                    ____                                                 Northern Counties                                  Land Use Coordinating Board,                                   Duluth, MN, September 25, 1996.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Young: I am writing to support the      American Lands Sovereignty Act that would require      Congressional approval for areas proposed for designation as      Biosphere Reserves.       My district includes the eastern portion of Voyageurs      National Park in Minnesota. In 1985, the National Park      Service proposed that the park and adjacent areas be      designated as the Northwoods International Biosphere Reserve.      Local opposition resulted in the elimination of this proposal      in 1987. One of the main concerns was that there was no      congressional approval required for these areas, although      they clearly have implications for the future of lands and      waters both inside and outside boundaries established by      Congress. Furthermore, a commission created by the Minnesota      legislature concludes that the Biosphere Reserve purpose was      contrary to the purposes for which the national park was      established.       As you know, we have had persistent problems in Northern      Minnesota with federal land management policies, as evidenced      by the results of Congressional Hearings held over the past      year. More Congressional oversight of federal land management      policies and practices is clearly necessary to restore public      trust and confidence in these agencies. The American Land      Sovereignty Act will go a long way toward achieving that      goal.           Sincerely,                                                     ------ ------     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                               September 25, 1996.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The American Sheep Industry Association      (ASI), the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) and      the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) representing 4.5      million members, wish to express their support for your      American Land Sovereignty Protection Act (H.R. 3752). As you      are aware, the Department of the Interior presently operates      the Man & Biosphere Program on Biosphere Reserves without      legislative direction and no authorization from Congress.      Furthermore, the 1995 designations of Glacier National Park      and the Carlsbad Caverns as World Heritage sites, and the      1989 designation of Yellowstone National Park as a Biosphere      Reserve were made with no public or Congressional input. Your      bill makes available a process in which we can begin to      correct these problems.       The operational guidelines for both World Heritage sites      and Biosphere Reserves require the establishment of a buffer      zone near or around designated areas. In many areas, the      establishment of buffer zones conflicts with the property      rights of both the individual and the state. ASI, NCBA and      AFBF policies support the language of your bill that compels      Congress to consider the implications of international      designations on these rights before the designations are      made.       The undersigned organizations stand with you and other      members of Congress in support of the American Land      Sovereignty Protection Act and thank you for your efforts in      support of fairness to land owners.     American Farm Bureau Federation.     American Sheep Industry Association.     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.                                                                    ____                                        Environmental Conservation                                                     Organization,                              Hollow Rock, TN, September 20, 1996.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     House Resources Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Young: Thank you for introducing The      American Land Sovereignty Protection Act (HR3752). Since      Congress bears the Constitutional responsibility for managing      federal lands and for protecting the private property rights      of individual citizens, the Bill offers welcome relief from      the intrusions of the international community. The 20 World      Heritage Sites, authorized under the World Heritage Treaty,      and the 47 Biosphere Reserves, administered in lock-step with      UNESCO's Biosphere Program by the U.S. Man and the Biosphere      Program, have imposed land use controls on public and private      lands that have not been authorized by Congress. Your Bill,      HR3752, will assure that the people affected by such      designations will have an opportunity to express their views      on such designations--before the designation is imposed.       We are equally concerned about Presidential, and      Administrative declarations that exclude Congress from land      management decisions on public lands and restrict and erode      property rights on private lands. The President's decision to      designate ``Canyons of the Escalante'' in Utah as a National      Monument is an excellent example of federal land use control      by Presidential decree which excludes Congress, locally      elected officials, and the people whose lives are directly      affected. The Chenoweth Bill, HR4120, would prevent these      unilateral Presidential decrees. These two Bills together,      would put Congress back in control of the management of      federal lands and give private property owners a measure of      protection--as is required by the Constitution.       The undersigned organizations support both these measures,      HR3752 and HR4120. We stand with you and other members of      Congress who support these measures, and we will work to see      that both become the law of the land.       Thank you for all of your efforts.           Sincerely,                                                   Henry Lamb,                                         Executive Vice President,                                  and the following organizations:         Citizens for Private Property Rights, Sullivan, MO;            Western States Coalition, New Harmony, WY; New Mexico            Cattle Growers' Association, Albuquerque, NM; Bootheel            Heritage Association, Animas, NM; Earthcare Contractors            Coalition, Hollow Rock, TN; Texas Wildlife Association,            San Antonio, TX; Davis Mountains Trans-Pecos Heritage            Association, Alpine, TX; Hill Country Heritage            Association, Lampasas, TX; Trans Texas Heritage            Association, Alpine, TX; Network for Eco-Policy            Awareness, Anchorage, AK; National Federal Lands            Conference, Bountiful, UT; Oregonians in Action,            Tigard, OR; Texas Eagle Forum, Dallas, TX; New Mexico            Wool Growers Action Committee, Yeso, NM; Take Back            Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR; Multiple Use Association,            Shellburne, NH; Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico            Counties, Glenwood, NM; Citizens Against Repressive            Zoning, Haslett, MI; ACCORD People for the West,            Phoenix, AZ.                              {time}  1403  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
