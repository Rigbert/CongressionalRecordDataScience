 President, the amendment of the Senator from Illinois is a clear violation of the Supreme Court decision of McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, handed down in 1995, in which the Supreme Court made it abundantly clear that you cannot require disclaimers on issue ads.  Having said that, I think everybody knows that the Senator from Kentucky would like to hang as many barnacles as possible on the hull of this bill, and I look forward to having one more argument to make before the courts. Therefore, I have no objection to this being adopted on a voice vote.
