 President, the bill before the Senate in its current form allows huge conglomerates, with just limited restrictions on marketing, to freely share vast quantities of personal customer information with commonly owned companies even if a consumer asks that the information not be shared.  Let me list the types of information we believe could be shared among companies that have common ownership--called affiliates--under the bill: Information mined from your check and credit card payments such as your political or charitable contributions, your magazine subscriptions, your liquor purchases, the location and identity of stores you frequent; the stocks you own and stock trading patterns; the cash you have in the bank; when your certificates of deposit mature; how much you owe on a credit card and what rate you get; your insurance claims history such as whether you pay your premiums on time, how many claims you have made and whether claims were paid out; how many times a consumer called the company's call center or complained about the company's service; an employee's work history, including performance ratings, use of sick days, vacation, and salary.  To make matters worse, the bill permanently preempts States from taking stronger action.  What we have before the Senate today is a weak privacy standard built for businesses at the expense of consumers which legislatures in all 50 States are forever barred from improving.  I am particularly concerned that financial institutions in California, with the lone exception of the California Credit Union, negotiated and signed off on State legislation resolving this issue, and now the same financial institutions are trying to eliminate the California law with national legislation.  I will spend just a moment on that because it is important. Essentially, the banks and financial institutions in California worked with the State legislature in crafting the Californlia law that has an opt-out for affiliate sharing. The reason they did so was because waiting in the wings was a well-funded initiative to pass an even stronger privacy law. They knew the people of California would pass that privacy law.  Senator Jackie Speier, who was the author of the California privacy bill, has sent Senator Boxer and I a letter. I will read two paragraphs from the letter.  ``It has recently come to my attention that the financial services industry has been criticizing the contents of your amendment to S. 1753, substituting the newly-enacted and stronger California privacy standard on affiliate sharing in the `corporate family of companies,' as unworkable and unreasonable. This same industry recently called my California bill `workable and reasonable,' specifically removing their opposition to my measure and lavishing praise upon it, even helping to gather votes. Industry made it clear that my bill met their workability concerns, progress made with their active participation. If my bill was workable for industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the national standard?''  ``One industry representative stood with me on that day and said my bill `encompasses all aspects of the workability needed to ensure protection of consumers' privacy,' while another called it `a balanced measure that will provide meaningful privacy protections to consumers while also addressing the workability concerns.' . . . Now the story is different, as industry sees a political opportunity to preempt California's standard on affiliate sharing with a weaker one.''  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      California State Senate,                                                 October 24, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Boxer, I wish to thank you for      your efforts on behalf of consumer privacy rights, and urge      you to continue to do all that is possible to protect      California's hard-fought consumer privacy gains.       It has recently come to my attention that the financial      services industry has been criticizing the contents of your      amendment to S. 1753, substituting the newly-enacted and      stronger California privacy standard on affiliate sharing in      the ``corporate family of companies,'' as unworkable and      unreasonable. This same industry recently called my      California bill ``workable and reasonable,'' specifically      removing their opposition to my measure and lavishing praise      on it, even helping to gather votes. Industry made it clear      that my bill met their workability concerns, progress made      with their active participation. If my bill was workable for      industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the national      standard? A transcript of their August 14, 2003, public      comments bear this out and is attached.       One industry representative stood with me on that day and      said my bill ``encompasses all aspects of the workability      needed to ensure protection of customers' privacy,'' while      another called it ``a balanced measure that will provide      meaningful privacy protections to consumers while also      addressing the workability concerns'' that industry had. Now      the story is different, as industry sees a political      opportunity to preempt California's standard on affiliate      sharing with a weaker one.       The financial services industry appears to be acting in bad      faith--it seems willing to say and do anything to erode      California's recent progress on behalf of consumers, first to      avoid a costly initiative battle and local ordinances      limiting third-party sharing, now to pull the wool over      Congress' eyes. Does the financial services industry really      believe that millions of American consumers don't deserve a      choice over what happens when their personal financial      information, their financial DNA, is shared with thousands of      affiliated companies? The industry's position is flawed      public policy, weaker than their own standards abroad, and      the kind of business practice that erodes consumer      confidence.       I urge you to continue your efforts in making California's      privacy standards those of the nation. California's affiliate      standard was good enough for the financial industry two      months ago; it certainly is acceptable now. Thank you again      for your efforts; I stand ready to help you in any way      possible.           All the best,                                                    Jackie Speier,                           California State Senator, 8th District.
