 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, James A. Turner of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Jim Turner was a man of great courage, intelligence and character. We were friends for more than 40 years. I believe America has lost a great patriot with the recent death of James A. Turner.  Born in 1925, Jim grew up on a farm just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. As World War II began, Jim left high school to serve his country. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served with honor. Indeed, he earned and received the Purple Heart in 1945 on Iwo Jima when a machine gun blinded him during battle.  Jim returned to Alabama and in spite of his blindness earned his undergraduate degree in 1949. He received his juris doctorate from the University of Alabama in 1952. Jim always credited his wife and classmate, Louise, for his success in school. Louise read Jim's textbooks to him so he could keep up with his studies.  Following graduation, Louise joined Jim at their law firm, Turner and Turner. Today, their son, Don, and their grandson, Brian, also work at Turner and Turner. The family law firm has spanned five decades and continues to thrive in Tuscaloosa.  Together, Jim and Louise raised three wonderful sons, Don, Rick and Glenn, who have brought them great joy in life. Their grandchildren, Brian, Lindsay and Brittany; and great-granddaughter Farris, are sources of considerable pride.  Jim was active in his community. He was an active member of the Tuscaloosa Bar Association and also servedas President of the Tuscaloosa Bar Association. His family worshiped at United Methodist Church in Alberta.  We have in recent years heard reference to ``the Greatest Generation.'' Many of us have friends and relatives who have served our country and earned the right to wear that mantle. However, I know of few men who lived every day of their lives with the valor, courage, and love of country with which Jim Turner lived his entire life.  Our country has lost a good man and great lawyer, a devoted husband and father, a proud Marine and a loyal American. Words cannot express the respect I have for Jim Turner, nor can they express the sorrow my family and our community feels since this loss.                          ____________________
