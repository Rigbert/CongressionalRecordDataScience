 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Kentuckian who has been selected for induction into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Mrs. Martha Comer of Maysville, KY, is devoted to her profession, to the Ledger-Independent, formerly the Daily Independent, and to her community.  Martha Comer was born in 1906, the same year that her father founded the Daily Independent. It is not surprising that Martha displayed her journalistic qualities at a young age. She served as the editor of the school annual at Maysville High School. Upon her graduation from high school she began working on the editorial staff of the Daily Independent. She assumed the duties as editor in 1935, although her name did not appear as editor until 1941.  In 1968 the Daily Independent was sold to the Maysville Publishing Corp. and became the Ledger-Independent. At this time Martha became the editor and was responsible for publishing both the morning and afternoon editions. Although Mrs. Comer retired on January 7, 1977, she continued to remain on as an editorial consultant. For many years she continued to write a daily column and editorials. And to this day, Martha Comer still writes editorial commentary two or three times a week for the Labor-Independent.  Mrs. Comer's editorial involvement allowed her to become actively involved with her community. She has campaigned tirelessly for many organizations and causes, such as advocating public policy and teaching in the literacy program.  Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Martha Comer, a new inductee into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. I am positive that Mrs. Comer will continue to display the great qualities in which she has in the past. I know that her community appreciates her involvement and dedication.                          ____________________
