 The gentleman and I have discussed this, and I believe he has taken the appropriate action in this instance, and we certainly support his determination.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for working together on this.  The one thing we know, this is a threat, and this House will act as one as Americans, and I look forward to continuing to work on it.                          ____________________
