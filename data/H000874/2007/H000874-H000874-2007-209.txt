Speaker, it's obvious we have a technical problem. I know that comes as a great shock and surprise to you. I've talked to the gentleman who's in charge of fixing mechanical problems. He tells me that we need to take the system down for a period of time in order to fix it. He has said he needs approximately 30 minutes to do that with no votes. We are in the process of a vote.  What the Speaker pro tempore has said, I don't know what the vote is. I don't know whether it's coming up on the computers. I do know in my office there was no time coming up on the computer. So Members do not know how much time they have left.             Permission to Vacate Vote on Motion to Adjourn
