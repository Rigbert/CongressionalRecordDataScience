Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1088 was introduced by Senator Jon Kyl. It would allow the Forest Service to consolidate and relocate the administrative facilities in the State of Arizona. It would also allow the Forest Service to convey land at fair market value to the City of Sedona for a much-needed wastewater treatment plant.  Back in May of 1999, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), our esteemed colleague, introduced H.R. 1969 which is the House companion to S. 1088. He worked diligently to see his legislation favorably passed through the subcommittee. However, because we have so few legislative days remaining and the Senate version is ready, in the interest of time, we are here today to consider S. 1088.  Let me close by saying, although this was a House bill originally, I support S. 1088.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
