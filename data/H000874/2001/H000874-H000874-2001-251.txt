Speaker, with the co-sponsorship of 44 of our colleagues, I have today introduced a concurrent resolution providing for the printing of a revised edition of the House document entitled Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1989.  The latest edition of this handsome work, published in 1990, contains brief biographies, photographs or sketches, and other important historical information about the 66 distinguished African-Americans who had served in either house of Congress as of January 23, 1990. An analysis of the membership of the six subsequent Congresses reveals that, as of today, an additional 40 distinguished African-Americans have served since the last edition. Moreover, several of the distinguished Members depicted in the last edition continued to serve in this House, and their biographies require appropriate updates. Clearly, the time has come to revise and reprint this important historical work.  My concurrent resolution directs the Library of Congress to revise the volume under the direction of the Committee on House Administration. The resolution provides for the printing of a number of copies of the volume, in a suitable binding, for distribution to Members of both houses as determined by the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. Speaker, the 1976 and 1990 editions of Black Americans in Congress have been a tremendous source of historical information for Members, scholars, students, and others about the distinguished African-Americans who have served their countrymen in the halls of the Senate and House of Representatives. The next edition will doubtless similarly become a tremendous resource, and a treasured addition to libraries across this land. I urge the Members to support my concurrent resolution.                          ____________________
