Speaker, I, too, wish Dave Curson a warm welcome in joining this body.  We have great Members on both sides of the aisle. I will say, from the Republican perspective, that I don't think any of us knew you before. We surely look forward to getting to know you in the next couple of weeks. We know that you'll be an active Member, and we look forward to your service and to getting to know you well. And we wish you the very best.
