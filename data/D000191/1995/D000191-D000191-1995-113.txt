Speaker, I find the gentleman's arguments convincing. I do not detect a partisan bias here. I think the naming of a visitor center or other appropriate memorial would be well taken, and I have swum in the lake myself and had no idea of the name of it. I was told I was swimming in Trinity Lake.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
