 President, I rise alongside my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the ``POW Assistance Act of 2001''.  This legislation makes an important statement in support of the many members of the U.S. Armed Forces who were used as slave labor by Japanese companies during the Second World War or subject to chemical and biological warfare experiments in Japanese POW camps.  The core of this bill is a clarification that in any pending lawsuit brought by former POWs against Japanese corporations, or any lawsuits which might be filed in the future, the Federal court shall apply the applicable statute of limitations of the State in which the action was brought.  This legislation is important because a recently enacted California law enables victims of WWII slave labor to seek damages up to the year 2010 against responsible Japanese companies, just as any citizen can sue a private company. Seventeen lawsuits have been filed on behalf of former POWs who survived forced labor, beatings, and starvation at the hands of Japanese companies. By asking Federal judges to look to the State statute of limitation, this legislation sends a clear message to the courts that we believe that suits with merit should not be precluded.  Today, too many Americans and Japanese do not know that American POWs performed forced labor for Japanese companies during the war.  American POWs, including those who had been forced through the Bataan Death March, were starved and denied adequate medical care and were forced to perform slave labor for private Japanese companies. American POWs toiled in mines, factories, shipyards, and steel mills. Many POWs worked virtually every day for 10 hours or more, often under extremely dangerous working conditions. They were starved and denied adequate medical care. Even today, many survivors still suffer from health problems directly tied to their slave labor.  It is critical that we do not forget the heroism and sacrifice of the POWs, and that the United States government does not stand in the way of their pursuit of recognition and compensation. They have never received an apology or payment from the companies that enslaved them, many of which are still in existence today.  The bill that Senator Hatch and I have introduced today does not prejudice the outcome of the lawsuits which are pending one way or another. The legislation we have introduced today simply holds that the lawsuits filed in California, or any which may still be filed under the California statute of limitations, should be allowed to go forward so that this issue can be settled definitively, without impeding the right of the POWs to pursue justice.  One of my most important goals in the Senate has been to see the development of a Pacific Rim community that is peaceful and stable. And I am pleased that the Government of Japan today is a close ally and good friend of the United States, and a responsible member of the international community.  And I want to clarify that this legislation is not directed at the people or government of Japan. The POWs and veterans are only seeking justice from the private companies that enslaved them, and this legislation has been designed in the interest of allowing these claims to move forward.  But I also believe that if Japan is to play a greater role in the international community it is important for Japan, the United States, and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to be able to reconcile interpretations of memory and history, especially of the Second World War. If, as Gerrit Gong has written, Japan aspires to be a normal country, this question of ``remembering and forgetting'' is critical if Japan hopes to forge an environment in which its neighbors ``do not object to that country's engaging in a full range of international activities and capabilities.''  The goal of this legislation is to remove this outstanding issue in U.S.-Japan relations, and to try to heal wounds that still remain. I hope that the Senate will see fit to support this bill.                                 ______                                       By
