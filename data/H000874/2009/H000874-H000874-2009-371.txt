It calls for withdrawal of our troops, to be out of Iraq in terms of a military role within 18 months. This is, I think personally, a responsible plan.  The gentleman asked me whether or not I think there will be a resolution of disapproval. I don't think there will be a resolution of disapproval. Clearly, as the gentleman well knows, there will be an authorizing bill that will come forward later this spring, there will be an appropriations bill appropriating money for the Defense Department, and obviously those two opportunities will present themselves to Members who may want to express themselves on this issue.  But as to the gentleman's question, do I expect a resolution of disapproval, I do not.
