  For example, Senator Paul has an amendment to create economic freedom zones to help struggling areas of our country to recover from the economic downturn. Senator Tim Scott's SKILLS Act would improve job training programs for the very long-term unemployed that this extension is actually designed to help. In addition, Senators Ayotte, Collins, Portman, and others have been working very hard--Senator Coats as well--to come up with a path forward on a meaningful offset that would extend unemployment benefits without adding to the deficit.  Their ideas have so far been blocked. So I would like to ask the majority leader to modify his request to provide for an orderly process for amendments. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments and motions be withdrawn and that the minority and majority sides be permitted to offer amendments in alternating fashion so that these important ideas can be considered.
