President, Congress went on a tax cut binge in the 1980s and left the bill for our children. Now that we have surpluses, we have a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. The last thing Congress should be doing right now is to put our strong economy at risk by passing a tax scheme as risky as the Republican plan.  Some of my fellow colleagues in Congress have gone off again on a binge of irresponsible tax cutting that puts our strong economy in jeopardy. Projections of budget surpluses in the future have gone straight to their heads--as if projected budget surpluses were like hard cider. It is time for my colleagues in the House and Senate to splash some cold budget reality on their faces and return to their economic senses.  A sound economy rests on a solid foundation of balanced revenue and spending policies. For the past seven years, the President and Congress have build this solid foundation by reducing the deficit and restraining spending. Just as we Vermonters restrained spending and put Vermont's state budget in the black, Yankee thrift was alive and well in Washington, as it is in Vermont.  President Clinton inherited a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 and his administration and Congress have steadily cut it down. For the first time since 1969, we now have a balanced budget.  I am proud to have voted for the 1993 deficit reduction package, which was a tough vote around here, and has brought the deficit down. I am also proud to have voted for the 1997 balanced budget and tax cut package--tax cuts that were fully paid for by offsetting spending cuts. These balanced policies have kept interest rates down and employment up. In fact, over the past seven years, this deficit reduction has produced $189 billion in interest savings on the national debt, or roughly $2,700 in savings for every American family.  Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the credit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important thing is to keep our budget in balance well into the 21st century and keep our economy growing.  That dose of Yankee fiscal discipline has paid off for Vermonters. Since 1993: Vermont's unemployment rate has been cut in half, from 5.8% to 2.9%; 20,000 new jobs have been created; Vermonter's average income has increased 25 percent; crime in Vermont has dropped by 15 percent; and the stock market has soared by 300 percent.  Instead of keeping on this path of prosperity, the huge tax cut bill that Congress just passed veers from our successful fiscal discipline. It cuts taxes by $792 billion and pays for these sweeping cuts out of projected budget surpluses over the next 10 years. These surpluses are not real. They are just projections. What happens if we suffer a recession in three years or a depression seven years from now? These tax cuts are paid for by Monopoly money.  But fooling with our strong economy is not a game. Passing risky tax cuts based on wishful thinking will have real consequences for Vermonters. It is estimated that paying for these huge tax cuts would: force more than 13,000 Vermont veterans to lose health care benefits; prevent any Medicare reform and new prescription drug coverage for senior Vermonters; drop 3,699 Vermonters from the WIC program; close off 2,116 Vermont students from Pell grants to help make college more affordable; and serve 11,127 fewer school lunches to Vermont children.  Instead of this fiscal folly, I believe Congress should follow three basic principles to continue our strong economy and provide targeted tax relief.First, we must continue to keep our fiscal house in order and pay down the national debt. The national public debt stands at $3.6 trillion--that is a lot of zeros. Like someone who had finally paid off his or her credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the federal government has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still have a national debt to pay down. Indeed, the Federal government pays almost $1 billion in interest every working day on this national debt.  It makes a lot more sense to pay off the national debt as our first priority, because nothing would do more to keep the economy strong. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates low. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, credit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners can invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates.  Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, recently testified before Congress that: ``I would prefer that we keep the surplus in place and reduce the public debt.'' I agree with Mr. Greenspan and I believe most Vermonters do too.  Second, we should put aside some of the surplus in a rainy day fund for Medicare and Social Security reforms. Just as we set aside extra revenue in a rainy day fund in Vermont, Congress should do the same on a national level. We all know that Congress must reform Social Security and Medicare for the future costs of the baby boom generation. This rainy day fund should also permit Medicare to cover prescription drug coverage for our seniors.  One of the toughest and most important challenges that we face--right now--is to make sure that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be there for those who retire decades from now. The number of Social Security beneficiaries will rise by 37 percent from now until 2015, and Medicare runs into problems even earlier than that. Protecting Social Security and Medicare will not be easy, but these projected surpluses make it easier to keep both programs strong for future generations.  Third, tax cuts should be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters, not just the wealthy. According to a Treasury Department analysis, the Senate-passed tax plan provides 67 percent of its tax breaks to the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans--those making more than $81,000 a year--while the poorest 60 percent of families would reap only 12 percent of the Senate-passed tax cuts. That is not fair.  This conference report is even more tilted in favor of the wealthy. According to an analysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice, the top 10 percent of taxpayers would receive 69 percent of the benefits under this bill while the bottom 60 percent would receive only 7.5 percent of the benefits from the conference agreement. That means the average tax cut would be $138 for the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers while the top one percent of taxpayers would receive a tax break of $46,389. Again, that is not fair.  Tax cuts that are targeted-- such as eliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-employed a full tax deduction for their health insurance and estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners--also don't break the bank. I supported a more responsible alternative package of $290 billion in targeted tax cuts that would still leave room in the budget for Congress to make key investments in veterans, education and crime-fighting programs. I believe this targeted approach is far more prudent than the Republican tax cut plan.  The enormous budget surplus that the Senate leadership claims is available to pay for nearly $800 billion in tax cuts is achieved only by unrealistic economic assumptions and deep cuts in programs that will never be attained. That is why I cosponsored an amendment filed by Senator Rockefeller that assumes there will only be a $100 billion surplus over the next ten years. This projected surplus is consistent with estimates by the Concord Coalition, Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, former CBO director Robert Reischauer and the Citizens for Tax Justice. The Rockefeller-Reed-Leahy amendment is a prudent and fiscally responsible approach that balances tax relief with reducing our debt and maintaining obligations to existing programs such as NIH research, veterans health, Head Start and the environment.  I call upon President Clinton to follow through on his pledge to veto this irresponsible tax scheme. He should send Congress back to the drawing board to do it right. And the next time, Congress should apply a stout measure of Yankee thrift.                         explanation of absence
