Speaker, I rise today to recognize Patuxent High School in Calvert County, Maryland for its ranking among the Nation's top 700 most demanding public schools as reported by Newsweek. I would like to commend Patuxent High School on incorporating a curriculum that challenges and advances the abilities of all students who attend this public school.  The Challenge Index rated each school by analyzing the number of advanced placement or International Baccalaureate tests taken by students in the high school and the number graduating from that school in a given year. Those schools that received a rating of 1.0, which meant that the number of students graduating was less than the number of tests given, were considered above average and included in the index. Based on this ratings scale, Patuxent High School achieved the ranking of 697th of schools across the Nation who met this 1.0 rating.  The Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB), a European based program, are courses students can take which have a challenging curriculum and prepare the students for their endeavors at the collegiate level. In addition, these exams allow the individual students to earn college credits depending on what score they receive on the exam.  In 2003 the Patuxent High School student body numbered 1775 students with a senior class of 371. It offers fifteen AP courses as well as numerous honors courses that challenge their students. This year twenty-seven percent of the graduating class will attend a four-year college or university with forty percent attending a two-year college. In 2001, Patuxent High School was honored for receiving the top average SAT scores in Calvert County.  Principal Robert F. Dredger along with the four Vice Principals: Nancy Highsmith, Steve King, Christian Hodge, and Robert Lawrence, have established an environment that motivates and challenges each and every student. Without the hard work of the administration, staff, and students this honor could not have been obtained.  Mr. Speaker, Patuxent High School has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to its entire student body by offering numerous courses that provoke the minds of each and every student. I would like to congratulate Patuxent High School on achieving such an honor and wish the faculty, staff, and students continued success in the future.                          ____________________
