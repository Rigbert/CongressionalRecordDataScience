Unlike the Y2K bill and other things, where there is a rush to complete congressional action on it, this is something where it appears, especially in the other body, that the parents and the children of this country do not have a voice. No matter what other legislative issues are going on, the conference could have been meeting if the House had just proceeded to take the normal steps needed and appointed conferees.  The majority leader of the House of Representatives has said they are not going to appoint conferees, certainly not any time in the near future. We have been ready to go forward at any time, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But if there are not going to be conferees, this bill is in limbo.  So you had the hopes of the parents of this country, the hopes that the schoolchildren had following the passage by the Senate of a good juvenile justice bill, that maybe we are coming to grips on at least some aspects of juvenile violence. Those hopes are dashed because when the matter is finally taken up by the other body, they say: Wait a minute, we don't have to have any votes on this.  I am privileged to participate in legislative action on the floor of the Senate. We Senators ought to run the Senate, not a powerful lobby. I say the same to the other body. They ought to stand up and speak for their constituents and not become mouthpieces for a powerful lobby, but that is what has happened.
