Due to our efforts, we now have given greater power to the State aeronautic boards, who have a better idea as to what the needs are in the State of West Virginia, my State of Oklahoma.  I think we have come a long way. I would certainly echo what you say. I am a little privileged to be the last active commercial pilot in the Senate, so I take a personal interest in these things.  But there is nothing that can help a community be more viable than a good general aviation airport, an airport that can serve the commercial community. In fact, you can look through our State and see where the communities are not doing well and tie that to the capacity they have--air traffic capacity.  So I think we are going to be doing a good thing by addressing that this afternoon. That is not why I am here though.                          ____________________
