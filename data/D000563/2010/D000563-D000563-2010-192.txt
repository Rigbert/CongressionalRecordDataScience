(k) Eligibility for Naturalization.--An alien whose status      is adjusted under this section to that of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence may be naturalized upon      compliance with all the requirements of the immigration laws      except the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 316(a) of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1427(a)), if      such person immediately preceding the date of filing the      application for naturalization has resided continuously,      after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence, within      the United States for at least 3 years, and has been      physically present in the United States for periods totaling      at least half of that time and has resided within the State      or the district of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services      in the United States in which the applicant filed the      application for at least 3 months.
