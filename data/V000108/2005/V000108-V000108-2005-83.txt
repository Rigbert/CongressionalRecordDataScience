Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's distinguished citizens, Judy and Alan Rooth. On Sunday, September 25, 2005, Judy and Alan will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to our community and to the State of Israel. Their praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the Northwest Indiana-Israel Dinner of State, as they receive the Jerusalem Medal. The Special Guest speaker is Dr. Mitchell Bard, executive director of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise.  Judy Rooth is completing her fourth year as president of the Jewish Federation. She previously served as the Federation's Women's Division Campaign co-chair for 3 years, and she also chaired the Jewish Community Services of the Federation. Judy is a lifetime member of Hadassah and has served as board secretary for Congregation Beth Israel. She also served on the boards of Kneseth Israel and CBI. Judy is also active in the Kneseth Israel Sisterhood.  Alan Rooth has served on various committees and also as an officer of several organizations. He was vice president of the Jewish Federation and also served as vice president and co-president of Kneseth Israel. Alan served as the chairman of the Annual Walks for Israel. He has also served on the Kneseth Israel Board and Congregation Beth Israel for a total of 20 years. Alan is the School Board chairman of both Kneseth Israel and Congregation Beth Israel.  The Jerusalem Medal is given each year to worthy recipients who demonstrate their dedication and service to Israel, the State of Israel Bonds, the Jewish community, and their own community at large. The Rooths are most certainly worthy recipients of this year's award. The Jewish Federation Community Building will be filled Sunday night with friends and family who have been blessed with the opportunity to know and work with Judy and Alan Rooth and who wish to celebrate with them as they receive the Jerusalem Medal.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Judy and Alan Rooth for receiving the 2005 Jerusalem Medal. Their dedicated service to both the State of Israel and our Northwest Indiana community is commendable and admirable. No government, leader, or military can safeguard the twin blessings of freedom and opportunity without the labors of dedicated, conscientious citizens. Their service and devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District deserves the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1839]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     COMMENDING JUDY AND ALAN ROOTH                                 ______                                                         HON.
