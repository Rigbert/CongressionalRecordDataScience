Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's concern.  The reason we looked at a quantitative and global approach is because, if we look at a product, if we look at a specific country based on a price, we are not going to resolve the crisis.  I would point out, for example, on a country basis steel exports from India suddenly increased to 70 percent inJanuary of 1990 compared to just December of 1998. Exports from Australia increased 31 percent in that last month. Exports from Korea increased by 25 percent.  So we are going to have to look at shifting within countries of various product lines as well as in people following behind if we do achieve success with one country coming in with new quantities of steel and again would remind the gentleman we are giving the administration 60 days to fashion their initiative, and they have great flexibility as to the design of that final plan.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his answer, and I also thank the gentleman very much for his courage in bringing this bill forward.  I would ask as a further courtesy, as this bill proceeds, if we discover that the quotas in place by H.R. 975 have an adverse effect and cause a short supply for our end users in this country, that we be willing across the aisle to work and address that issue, and I am certain that we can do that.
