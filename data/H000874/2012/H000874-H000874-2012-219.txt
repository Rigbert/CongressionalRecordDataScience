I was proud to sponsor that legislation and have worked over the last 20 years to make sure that it was effective and strengthened.  Contained in the bill before us in an unprecedented measure that would significantly erode the Justice Department's authority to protect access for those with disabilities to swimming pools.  Now, one might say, Access to swimming pools? But I want my colleagues to think about, if you have a mobility impairment, if you have some neurological impairment, that swimming is one of the most effective activities in which you can participate to get your motor skills back in an environment that will not allow you to sink. Therefore, you have an environment in which you can exercise your muscles. So many of you have seen that and know that to be the case.                              {time}  1950  This is an incredibly important accessible facility for those with disabilities. In any event, those with disabilities ought to have access, certainly, to public facilities; and we can make it so.  Now, I'm not going to offer an amendment to strike this language; but I hope, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, that this will be struck. I hope that we will listen to the literally tens of letters that you've gotten and that I've gotten.  For many Americans with disabilities, swimming pools are an important source of physical activity and emotional comfort. The provision in question would roll back the Justice Department's 2010 accessibility regulations, undermining standards for new pool construction and for the upgrading of existing facilities. This would constitute a serious setback to Americans with disabilities, including many of our veterans--and I want you to think about this--many of our veterans wounded while serving our Nation overseas. As all of you know, many of these injuries they've received are to their limbs. Again, their exercise programs are facilitated in swimming pools, supported by water. So this would constitute, as I said, a serious setback.  The 2010 accessibility regulations this provision would eliminate do not place an undue burden on pool operators who cannot afford to make their facilities accessible. Some of you will remember Steve Bartlett, who was a Member of this Congress, a mayor of Dallas, still in town--a wonderful friend of mine--and a conservative Republican from Texas. He and I spent literally hundreds of hours working on this legislation together. One of the things we did was to make sure that businesses would know that what they were asked to do was affordable and that they could do it with relative ease, realizing full well that one can't expect a small business, in particular, to incur a large expense notwithstanding the objective is a worthy one. So we had a practical approach to this, and we had language that said it had to be readily achievable and affordable for the enterprise. Certainly, we can continue to do that for these facilities which are so important to so many people with disabilities.  I want to say that Mr. Wolf is one of the most conscientious Members of this House and one of the most courageous Members of this House. He and I have had the opportunity to work together for over three decades on legislation.  I hope, Mr. Chairman, the House and Senate conferees will look carefully at the damage this provision will cause in the lives of so many Americans with disabilities and will strike it from the final version.  I commend my colleagues who have come here to draw attention to it, and I thank them for continuing to stand up for those with disabilities, including veterans and their right to equal access and opportunity.  When George Bush signed on July 26, 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said it was the most significant civil rights act in over a quarter of a century, since the sixties. He said it ensured that all individuals would have access to the full enjoyment of facilities in this country of opportunity and of freedom.  This amendment may be well intended, but its effect would be very detrimental. Again, I urge the chairman and the ranking member--and I will certainly be working with my Senate colleagues as well--to make sure this language is not in the final bill because this would be detrimental. As I will remind you once again, so many veterans are coming back in need of this kind of access.  I yield back the balance of my time.                                                  National Council                                        on Independent Living,                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2012.     Trent Franks, Chairman,     Subcommitee on the Constitution, Committee on the Judiciary,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Jerrold Nadler, Ranking Member,     Subcommittee on the Constitution, Committee on the Judiciary,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Franks and Ranking Member Nadler: These      comments are submitted by the National Council on Independent      Living (NCIL) for the record of the April 24, 2012 hearing on      ``The Department of Justice's Guidance on Access to Pools and      Spas Under the ADA.''       NCIL is the longest-running national, cross-disability,      grassroots organization run by and for people with      disabilities. Founded in 1982, NCIL represents thousands of      organizations and individuals including: Centers for      Independent Living (CILs), Statewide Independent Living      Councils (SILCs), individuals with disabilities, and other      organizations that advocate for the human and civil rights of      people with disabilities throughout the United States. There      are currently over 700 physical locations across America      actively providing Independent Living services to people with      disabilities.       This hearing was held to address the proposed legislation      in the House that is set to address the concerns of the DOJ's      decision to extend the rule RIN 1190 NYD Delaying the      Compliance Date for Certain Requirements of the Regulations      Implementing Titles II and III of the Americans with      Disabilities Act. We have serious concerns with Congress      preventing an executive branch agency from enforcing its own      regulations such as what is written in H.R. 4256 and H.R.      4200. We must let you know that we find both these bills to      be intrusive.       We disagree with both bills. They try to accomplish giving      the hospitality and hotel industry an opportunity to provide      accessibility to the public in the least efficient manner or      even at all. H.R. 4256 attempts to address technical      requirements that have been negotiated over years in the      rulemaking process that has worked well for all other aspects      of accessibility. This bill is broader than H.R. 4200 because      it prohibits any court enforcement of the new regulations for      a year (while DOJ is changing the standards, as required by      this bill), including enforcement by private plaintiffs.       To include Title II in the language of the resolution, even      though it would appear by the rest of the language that the      resolution concerns Public Accommodations only, under 28 CFR      Part 36; creates confusion and uncertainty about exactly how      far this resolutions impact and jurisdiction could be      interpreted to go. The resolution calls for a one year      extension to the effective date, which we in the community      disagree with its necessity.       The ADA has been in effect for 21 years, and all the ADA      pool rules have undergone extensive review for more than 10      years, with multiple comment periods and many opportunities      for hotels to learn about their responsibilities. The new      requirements already had a generous phase-in period of 18      months. Congress should not restrict enforcement of these, or      any, ADA requirements.       In response to comments that referred to the hospitality      industry not having adequate time to implement this rule, the      burden of providing access to swimming pools and the cost for      implementing this rule, we strongly disagree with all of      these claims. Providing access to swimming pools is      achievable and not burdensome. The ADA's accessibility      requirements for barrier removal in existing facilities are      very reasonable--they only require what is ``easily      accomplishable'' and able to be carried out without much      difficulty or expense. The rules are carefully crafted to      take the needs of covered entities, such as small businesses      including hotels, into account. In other words, hotel owners      need not comply with the standards in the new regulations      unless doing so would be inexpensive and simple. No extension      or enforcement ban is needed.       We also believe that it is not acceptable for the      Department of Justice to backtrack on ADA requirements      because an industry exerts pressure. To do so is an      invitation to other industries to say, ``Roll back our      requirements, too.'' Today it's the hotel industry. What      weakening changes will come tomorrow? What other human and      civil rights laws will be adjusted? In reference to the      expense this would cause for the hospitality industry, there      are Tax Incentives which have always been available and      under-utilized by businesses. IRS Tax code 44 and 190 provide      generous credits (dollar for dollar) and deductions      (reduction in gross reported to IRS) that let the hotel owner      get the money back (1/2 in credit the rest in deductions) so      cost should not be an issue.       The Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers      (DBTACs) has done a targeted education project for the      ``hospitality'' industry for several years now and have      repeatedly reached out to the organizations representing      hotels. They can be reached at 800 949 4232 anywhere in the      country.       The House bill H.R. 4256 represents an extraordinarily      prejudicial precedent. This bill would deny any federal      official, which can include judges, U.S. attorneys, and other      enforcing authorities, any power to administer or enforce the      new DOJ ADA regulations regarding pools. It removes the      waiting period and adds a clause that dismisses any suits      filed after March 15, 2012. It also tries to clarify their      portable vs. fixed lifts concern, something that should be      done by DOJ.       The amendment would affect Title II State and Local      Governments, which have been covered for access into the      water since 1990. This is seen as a targeted process to      undermine the strong federal enforcement role urgently needed      and sometimes reached under the ADA. Passage of this bill      could initiate a trend to render civil rights laws completely      powerless and ineffective, even though they remain public      law. This amendment would firmly take this part of the ADA      backward. It is our belief that congress should craft strong      civil rights protections to end discrimination, not remove      the government's enforcing authority.       In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department of      Justice requested comments on extending the compliance date      ``in the interest of promoting clear and consistent      application of the ADA's requirements to existing      facilities.'' The NCIL community has serious concerns with      the number of years it has taken to explain ``readily      achievable barrier removal''. Extensive technical assistance      has been provided to explain to many public accommodation      pool owners that the requirements are based on what they can      afford to do today on their existing structures, with an      obligation to provide better access when it can be afforded.      Nothing has changed with that concept since the ADA was      passed in 1990. It should not take another 6 months to      ``understand''.       To include Title II entities in this extension is a huge      step backward! Program access has been a requirement all      along, and most state and local government-run pools and      swimming facilities should already have addressed access into      to the water for their programs. An extension is      inappropriate as they have already been responsible for equal      access to the water for years.       The part that is confusing is not for new construction and      altered facilities having pools and spas, but at existing      pools there is some confusion that has been partly created by      the DOJ, as the Department responded in a letter February      21st to the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA)      when they asked for clarification on the provision of pool      lifts. In that letter, the Department addresses several      concerns raised in the ``eleventh hour'' of the rulemaking      process by AHLA representatives--including some regarding      ``fixed'' pool lifts versus ``portable'' pool lifts. The      Department has created part of the problem in its convoluted      definition of why a pool lift must be ``fixed'' which is not      addressed in the rule, the scoping, or in the technical      requirements of the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.       In addressing concerns by AHLA regarding existing hotels,      the DOJ stated that where it is not readily achievable for a      hotel owner to install a fixed pool lift, that a portable      pool lift may be used if it can be attached to the pool deck      while in use. That seems like a good idea to reduce liability      for the hotel owner, and makes the unit more stable for the      user, who also must be able to use the unit independently.      However, it is a matter of technical assistance advice that,      with additional helpful information could be given without an      extension in the effective date for compliance. Many of these      discussions should have already taken place multiple times,      given the length of time this rulemaking has taken, and to      reiterate the principles of readily achievable barrier      removal once again to the organizations pleading ignorance      should not take an additional 6 months.       The NCIL membership is very disappointed that an exception      was made in the rulemaking process by the current      Administration, and strongly objects to the proposed rule      extending the compliance date for public accommodations and      effectively abolishing the program access requirements      including pool lifts at swimming pools, parks, and resorts      run with State funds through yet another swimming season--to      September 2012. We insist the rulemaking proceed and become      effective immediately following the 60 day extension.       Submitted by: L.

Over twenty years after the passage of the Americans with      Disabilities Act (ADA), the accessibility of swimming pools      and other recreational facilities remains a problem for      people with disabilities around the country. NDRN encourages      the Judiciary Committee to work with the Department of      Justice and with swimming pool owners to ensure that people      with disabilities are able to enjoy swimming pools and other      recreational facilities to the same extent as others in our      society.       As a part of the training and technical assistance that      NDRN provides to the Protection and Advocacy agencies, NDRN      holds many face-to-face meetings in hotels throughout the      country. As such, NDRN routinely books hotel rooms and wants      our staff, the staff of the P&A agencies, and other      participants to have the opportunity to enjoy all the      amenities provided by the hotels. As a disability rights      organization whose staff and membership include people with      disabilities, we are committed to holding our conferences and      meetings at locations that provide full accessibility.       The effective date for swimming pool owners to become      compliant with ADA standards was originally March 15, 2012,      but the Department on its own chose to extend that time until      May 21, 2012. Based on the history of these standards      discussed below, NDRN believes that this first extension was      unnecessary and sees no reason (politically, practically, or      in the furtherance of public policy) to extend this      compliance date any longer. The 2010 ADA Accessibility      Standards did not create the requirement for accessibility      for pools and spas; it only provides more detailed      specifications of how to provide that accessibility.       Protection and Advocacy programs across the country have      represented people with disabilities seeking access to public      swimming pools. For example, P&As in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and      Colorado have successfully negotiated agreements with owners      of pools to provide pool lifts to allow individuals with      disabilities to use those pools. Despite these modest      successes, most people with disabilities throughout the      country continue to be unable to access swimming pools on the      same basis as their non-disabled peers.       The Department's process to develop accessibility      guidelines for swimming pools began over 7 years ago on      September 30, 2004, when the Department published an Advance      Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), 69 FR 58768. This      ANPRM requested feedback about the Department's proposal to      adopt the Access Board's 2004 revisions to the ADA      Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which included provisions      for swimming pool accessibility. The Department then      published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking almost 4 years ago      on June 17, 2008 seeking public comment, 73 FR 34508. The      Final Rule was formally published in the Federal Register on      September 15, 2010, 75 FR 56254, and gave owners and      operators of existing pools 18 months before the specific      regulations became enforceable.       Enough time has passed to allow swimming pool owners to      make their pools comply with the ADA. Over 18 months has      passed from the date the final rule was announced, over 4      years has passed from first proposal of a final rule, and      over 7 years has passed from first the first proposal to      adopt the ADAAG standards for pools and spas. Moreover, the      requirement to remove barriers to accessibility to swimming      pools for people with disabilities has been part of the      statutory requirement under the Americans with Disabilities      Act since it was passed in 1990, almost 22 years ago. The      need for pools and spas to be accessible for people with a      disability is not some new idea, but one that has been in      federal law for more than 2 decades.       Additionally, the Department's regulations provide more      than sufficient flexibility since the requirement is removal      of physical barriers that is ``readily achievable,'' or      easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much      difficulty or expense.       The swimming pool owners have raised concerns about the      Department of Justice     requirement that they install fixed rather than portable      lifts. The Americans with Disability Act Accessibility      Guidelines, or ADAAG, include specific guidelines regarding      the installation of pool lifts. See http://www.access-     board.qov/ada-aba/final.cfm#a1009. Generally, portable pool      lifts cannot meet the ADAAG standards, because they cannot be      installed or independently operated by people with      disabilities. As the Department of Justice has indicated,      however, if an entity chooses to use a lift complying with      the ADAAG standards that is removable or otherwise designated      as ``portable,'' it may do so, as long as while the lift is      provided at the pool, it is affixed in some manner to the      pool deck or apron.       NDRN is pleased that some members of the hotel industry      have realized that over the course of 22 years the ADA      applies to the accessibility of their pools and have taken a      proactive approach and installed pool lifts. For example, in      recent negotiations with a hotel chain to hold a conference,      NDRN raised the issue of whether the swimming pools were      accessible for people with disabilities, and were assured      that all the hotels were in compliance with all current ADA      laws and regulations concerning the pool and had a pool lift.      In addition, they were prepared to comply with any and all      revisions to Title 3 of the ADA that may occur, and took,      ``great pride in ensuring . . . our properties meet and      exceed any government regulation.''       As NDRN continues to contract for our business meetings as      well as our staff making their own personal summer travel and      vacation plans, we believe that people with disabilities      should be able to enjoy the same recreational amenities and      opportunities as every other American. Delaying the effective      date of the regulations any further will mean another season      where people with disabilities will be denied the opportunity      to use pools when they travel on vacations with their      families or on business. This is unacceptable.
