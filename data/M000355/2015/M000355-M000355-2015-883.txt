 President, late nights, vigorous legislating, and sometimes unpredictable outcomes may make some reach for the aspirin, but these are the hallmarks of a functioning Congress.  The push-and-pull between different parties, different Members, and different Chambers is all part of the democratic rhythm. That is especially true when you are talking about a measure as complicated and consequential as a multiyear highway bill.  I am pleased to see Republicans and Democrats continuing to hold together to pass the Senate's bipartisan highway legislation. We are on the verge of scoring another important victory for the American people.  Once the Senate completes its work on the bill, the House of Representatives will begin its work on a multiyear measure as well. A multiyear bill is now our joint goal. That is important for our country. We know it represents the best way to provide State and local governments with the kind of certainty they need to focus on longer term road and bridge projects.  Here is how Kentucky's main transportation advocacy group, Kentuckians for Better Transportation, put it: A longer term bill would ``provide an opportunity to plan for and implement projects that are important to Kentucky's citizens and Kentucky's economy--and to every other state in the nation.''  We will conference the legislation we pass with what the House passes and then send a unified bill to President Obama. In the meantime, we will work with our friends in the House to pass a measure that will give them the space they need to develop a multiyear highway bill. It is also a measure that would deliver some important relief to our veterans by covering unfunded requirements the administration failed to budget for. It would also extend a helping hand to heroes who need it.  I can't see a reason any Senator would vote against it. We will take up that bill once the House sends it to us. We will continue working in the interim to finish our own bipartisan, multiyear highway bill--a bill that is fiscally responsible and will not raise taxes by a penny.                          ____________________
