What I found was the poorest of God's creatures on Earth, people, literally mothers trying to raise children with nothing--nothing--who worried day to day whether they could feed them, and the United States, in its compassion, its understanding of its obligation to those less fortunate, provides financial assistance to the charitable organizations. In one case, in India it was Mother Teresa who was taking the money and feeding the poorest people. In Bangladesh, it was other organizations.  To make certain the record is clear, the money that these organizations would receive would come through this bill, this foreign operations appropriations bill which has been stopped on the floor of the Senate--according to the Senator from Nevada for almost 3 weeks or more--because some, in fact all Republican Senators but one--believe they want to stop the President's bill that would provide this food and medical care for the poorest children on Earth because they are not getting judges through the Senate Judiciary Committee at a fast enough pace.  Is that their argument?
