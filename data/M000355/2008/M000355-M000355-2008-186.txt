 We all know they are both retiring from the Senate later this year, but it is serendipitous that this issue has arisen at this particular time, when the American people are demanding the kind of action that the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Virginia have been promoting for years. So I think it is a good thing that while they are still here in their service to our country, we will be debating this issue vigorously next week, and all of us hope for success.                          ____________________
