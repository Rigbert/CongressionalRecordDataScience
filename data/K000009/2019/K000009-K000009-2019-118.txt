 With May being National Mental Health Awareness Month as well as National Nurses Month, we recommit ourselves to:  Building better futures for those struggling with a mental health condition;  Supporting research into diagnoses and treatment;  Erasing the stigma around seeking help; and  Removing barriers to high-quality and timely mental healthcare by educating and training doctors, nurses, and behavioral specialists dedicated to these disabling conditions.  Our Nation is also battling an epidemic of veteran suicide. Tragically, over 7,000 veterans die by suicide every year, more than the total number of American servicemembers killed in action during the entire Global War on Terrorism.  It is no coincidence that our Nation is short 100,000 neuropsychiatrists and 500,000 advance practice nurses in these fields. At the VA alone, today, there are nearly 50,000 medical vacancies.  If we are to make progress, then our country, our Nation, must support investments in educating these physicians and nurses to treat those who, every day, look for a better way of life.  I look forward to partnering with Members of Congress to help America treat these illnesses and create a more humane society for all.                          ____________________
