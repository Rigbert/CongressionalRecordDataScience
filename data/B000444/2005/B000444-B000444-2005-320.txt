 President, my amendment restores $1 billion for local law enforcement, three big programs that have essentially been zeroed out, the COPS Program, the law enforcement block grants. Four years ago we spent $2.3 billion helping local law enforcement. It is down to $118 million.  My friend from New Hampshire said we are going to prove we can end the program. Let us pick one that is not working to end. This one works.  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
