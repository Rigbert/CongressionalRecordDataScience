Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I understand there is a level of frustration regarding the Office of Surface Mining's continued use of funds to develop the stream buffer rule, and we attempted to address that through the bill language to limit funding.  I certainly support what you are doing for water infrastructure. It is a good amendment that will leverage jobs, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.
