President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 987       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``International Protecting      Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or      ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that      deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.       (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as      through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states,      ``Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full      consent of intending spouses.''.       (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund      (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing      countries now ages 20-24 were married under the age of 18,      and if present trends continue more than 100,000,000 more      girls in developing countries will be married as children      over the next decade, according to the Population Council.       (4) Child marriage ``treats young girls as property'' and      ``poses grave risks not only to women's basic rights but also      their health, economic independence, education, and status in      society'', according to the Department of State in 2005.       (5) In 2005, the Department of State conducted a world-wide      survey and found child marriage to be a concern in 64 out of      182 countries surveyed, with child marriage most common in      sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia.       (6) In Ethiopia's Amhara region, about \1/2\ of all girls      are married by age 14, with 95 percent not knowing their      husbands before marriage, 85 percent unaware they were to be     married, and 70 percent reporting their first sexual      initiation within marriage taking place before their first      menstrual period, according to a 2004 Population Council      survey.       (7) In some areas of northern Nigeria, 45 percent of girls      are married by age 15 and 73 percent by age 18, with age gaps      between girls and the husbands averaging between 12 and 18      years.       (8) Between \1/2\ and \3/4\ of all girls are married before      the age of 18 in Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the      Central African Republic, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and      Nepal, according to Demographic Health Survey data.       (9) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a      lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls,      parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage,      the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.       (10) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of      girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal      death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity,      obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases,      including HIV/AIDS.       (11) According to the United States Agency for      International Development (USAID), increasing the age at      first birth for a woman will increase her chances of      survival. Currently, pregnancy and childbirth complications      are the leading cause of death for women 15 to 19 years old      in developing countries.       (12) In developing countries, girls 15 years of age are 5      times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their      20s.       (13) Child marriage can result in bonded labor or      enslavement, commercial sexual exploitation, and violence      against the victims, according to UNICEF.       (14) Out-of-school or unschooled girls are at greater risk      of child marriage while girls in school face pressure to      withdraw from school when secondary school requires monetary      costs, travel, or other social costs, including lack of      lavatories and supplies for menstruating girls and increased      risk of sexual violence.       (15) In Mozambique 60 percent of girls with no education      are married by age 18, compared to 10 percent of girls with      secondary schooling and less than 1 percent of girls with      higher education.       (16) According to UNICEF, in 2005 it was estimated that      ``about half of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa who drop out of      primary school do so because of poor water and sanitation      facilities''.       (17) UNICEF reports that investments in improving school      sanitation resulted in a 17 percent increase in school      enrollment for girls in Guinea and an 11 percent increase for      girls in Bangladesh.       (18) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe      community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building      for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated      strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a      pathway to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty,      low status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.       (19) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have      a legally-established minimum age of marriage, yet child      marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the      failure to enforce existing laws.       (20) In Afghanistan, where the legal age of marriage for      girls is 16 years, 57 percent of marriages involve girls      below the age of 16, including girls younger than 10 years,      according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).       (21) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that      ``child marriage is a clear and unacceptable violation of      human rights, and that the Department of State denounces all      cases of child marriage as child abuse''.     SEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.       In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage      of a girl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage      stipulated in law in the country in which the girl or boy is      a resident.     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights and the      prevention, and elimination of child marriage should be a      foreign policy goal of the United States;       (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States      investments in foreign assistance to promote education and      skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child      mortality, reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of      HIV/AIDS, prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty;      and       (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic      opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child      mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium      Development Goals and the global health and development      objectives of the United States, including efforts to prevent      HIV/AIDS.     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO PREVENT THE INCIDENCE OF CHILDHOOD                    MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.       (a) Assistance Authorized.--The President is authorized to      provide assistance, including through multilateral,      nongovernmental, and faith-based organizations, to prevent      the incidence of child marriage in developing countries and      to promote the educational, health, economic, social, and      legal empowerment of girls and women as part of the strategy      established pursuant to section 6 to prevent child marriage      in developing countries.       (b) Priority.--In providing assistance authorized under      subsection (a), the President shall give priority to--       (1) areas or regions in developing countries in which 15      percent of girls under the age of 15 are married or 40      percent of girls under the age of 18 are married; and       (2) activities to--       (A) expand and replicate existing community-based programs      that are successful in preventing the incidence of child      marriage;       (B) establish pilot projects to prevent child marriage; and       (C) share evaluations of successful programs, program      designs, experiences, and lessons.       (c) Coordination.--Assistance authorized under subsection      (a) shall be integrated with existing United States programs      for advancing appropriate age and grade-level basic and      secondary education through adolescence, ensure school      enrollment and completion for girls, health, income      generation, agriculture development, legal rights, and      democracy building and human rights, including--       (1) support for community-based activities that encourage      community members to address beliefs or practices that      promote child marriage and to educate parents, community      leaders, religious leaders, and adolescents of the health      risks associated with child marriage and the benefits for      adolescents, especially girls, of access to education, health      care, livelihood skills, microfinance, and savings programs;       (2) enrolling girls in primary and secondary school at the      appropriate age and keeping them in age-appropriate grade      levels through adolescence;       (3) reducing education fees, and enhancing safe and      supportive conditions in primary and secondary schools to      meet the needs of girls, including--       (A) access to water and suitable hygiene facilities,      including separate lavatories and latrines for girls;       (B) assignment of female teachers;       (C) safe routes to and from school; and       (D) eliminating sexual harassment and other forms of      violence and coercion;       (4) ensuring access to health care services and proper      nutrition for adolescent girls, which is essential to both      their school performance and their economic productivity;       (5) increasing training for adolescent girls and their      parents in financial literacy and access to economic      opportunities, including livelihood skills, savings,      microfinance, and small-enterprise development;       (6) supporting education, including through community and      faith-based organizations and youth programs, that helps      remove gender stereotypes and the bias against girls used to      justify child marriage, especially efforts targeted at men      and boys, promotes zero tolerance for violence, and promotes      gender equality, which in turn help to increase the perceived      value of girls;       (7) creating peer support and female mentoring networks and      safe social spaces specifically for girls; and       (8) supporting local advocacy work to provide legal      literacy programs at the community level and ensure that      governments and law enforcement officials are meeting their      obligations to prevent child and forced marriage.     SEC. 6. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING                    COUNTRIES.       (a) Strategy Required.--The President, acting through the      Secretary of State, shall establish a multi-year strategy to      prevent child marriage in developing countries and promote      the empowerment of girls at risk of child marriage in      developing countries, including by addressing the unique      needs, vulnerabilities, and potential of girls under age 18      in developing countries.       (b) Consultation.--In establishing the strategy required by      subsection (a), the President shall consult with Congress,      relevant Federal departments and agencies, multilateral      organizations, and representatives of civil society.

(d) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress      a report that includes--       (1) the strategy required by subsection (a);       (2) an assessment, including data disaggregated by age and      gender to the extent possible, of current United States-     funded efforts to specifically assist girls in developing      countries; and       (3) examples of best practices or programs to prevent child      marriage in developing countries that could be replicated.     SEC. 7. RESEARCH AND DATA COLLECTION.       The Secretary of State shall work through the Administrator      of the United States Agency for International Development and      any other relevant agencies of the Department of State, and      in conjunction with relevant executive branch agencies as      part of their ongoing research and data collection      activities, to--       (1) collect and make available data on the incidence of      child marriage in countries that receive foreign or      development assistance from the United States where the      practice of child marriage is prevalent; and       (2) collect and make available data on the impact of the      incidence of child marriage and the age at marriage on      progress in meeting key development goals.     SEC. 8. DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS                    PRACTICES.       The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended--       (1) in section 116 (22 U.S.C. 2151n), by adding at the end      the following new subsection:       ``(g) The report required by subsection (d) shall include      for each country in which child marriage is prevalent at      rates at or above 40 percent in at least one sub-national      region, a description of the status of the practice of child      marriage in such country. In this subsection, the term `child      marriage' means the marriage of a girl or boy, not yet the      minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in the country in      which such girl or boy is a resident.''; and       (2) in section 502B (22 U.S.C. 2304), by adding at the end      the following new subsection:       ``(i) The report required by subsection (b) shall include      for each country in which child marriage is prevalent at      rates at or above 40 percent in at least one sub-national      region, a description of the status of the practice of child      marriage in such country. In this subsection, the term `child      marriage' means the marriage of a girl or boy, not yet the      minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in the country in      which such girl or boy is a resident.''.
