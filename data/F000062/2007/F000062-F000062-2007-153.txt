 We believe there are 60 votes for the bill. We are happy, all of us--those of us who have worked on this bill--to sit down with you and go over it again and hopefully have something for the September farm bill. I think it is important.  The problem with waiting until September is part of the harvest is over, and we have lost a crop. I cannot tell you how much is going to be on the ground come September, but I can tell you in my State it is going to be a substantial amount. I worry about land lying fallow and then being sold by farmers for development and the loss of rich, great American farmland. I don't think that is what either one of us want.  We will try to work with you, Senator Boxer, Senator Craig and I, and, hopefully, we will be able to come up with something by September.  So I thank the Senator and the Chair.
