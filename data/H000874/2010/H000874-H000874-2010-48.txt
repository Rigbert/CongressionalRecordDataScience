 The Senate, as you know, has not completed its consideration of the supplemental and are debating other issues, some of which we sent to them, and as a matter of fact, I think some of those have the majority's support. The small business lending bill, in particular, I would hope they would bring to us.                              {time}  1620  We included a number of things, not the least of which is trying to ensure that 140,000 teachers around the country remain on the job for our children and for our schools. I don't know whether the Senate will include that or not.  We also included money for border security, which was not in the Senate bill. FEMA and Haiti, and oil spill money, I believe, were in the Senate bill initially. We have also included that. There are other items that we have included to try to grow jobs and expand the economy, which, unfortunately, the Senate at least at this point in time has not supported.  But I say to my friend that in light of the fact that the Senate has not yet passed the supplemental, I am not sure what's going to be in it. But I would say to the gentleman, once again, as he knows, it is my intention to ensure that the money for the troops is, in fact, passed before we leave here.
