President, the Collins amendment, No. 1137, would allow the use of law enforcement terrorism prevention funds to be used for overtime costs associated with providing law enforcement operations in support of Federal agencies for increased border security and border crossing enforcement.  I am pleased to be joined in this amendment by Senator Dorgan.  There has been considerable discussion in recent months on the need to improve border security. One way to do this is to increase the number of Border Patrol Agents. But it takes significant time to recruit and train new Federal law enforcement agents. A more immediate way to improve border security is to activate our existing State, local, and tribal law enforcement partners as a back-up force in support of Federal border agents.  This is not a new idea. The Department of Homeland Security has authorized this use with different fundsin the past. Beginning with the last Federal election period up until the Presidential inauguration last January, Operation Stonegarden permitted reimbursement for State and local law enforcement activities that assisted Federal officials in securing the border.  My own State of Maine participated in that operation with a great degree of success. Arthur Cleaves, the Director of the Maine Emergency Management Agency, told me that Maine realized the Nation's second highest level of agency participation in Operation Stonegarden with 22 State, county, local, and tribal agencies involved. These dedicated law enforcement professionals assisted the Border Patrol Sector in Houlton, ME, with increased patrols, reporting of incidents, and arrests of significant persons attempting to enter the United States from Canada. In fact, according to the final report on the program's activities in Maine, more than 12 arrests of persons on Government watch lists were made by State and local law enforcement in Maine.  Now, however, the Department proposes to pull the rug out from under border States by allowing urban area grant funds to be used for such border security efforts, but not State grant funds.  This approach makes no sense whatsoever. And when my staff asked, even the Department could not explain the rationale behind the policy of allowing interior cities--but not more rural border areas--to use Federal funds to partner with State, local, and tribal law enforcement to protect our borders.  Partnering with State and local law enforcement is a proven and cost effective way to buttress our Nation's Federal border security efforts. I urge its adoption.                           amendment no. 1108 (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding a study of the   potential use of FM radio signals for an emergency messaging system)       On page 100, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:       Sec. 519. It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary      of Homeland Security should conduct a study of the      feasibility of leveraging existing FM broadcast radio      infrastructure to provide a first alert, encrypted, multi-     point emergency messaging system for emergency response using      proven technology.                           amendment no. 1197      (Purpose: To clarify authorization for port security grants)       On page 78, line 19 after ``based on'', insert ``risk      and''.                           amendment no. 1194(Purpose: To require the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and    Response to proposed new inspection guidelines within 90 days of  enactment that prohibit inspectors from entering into a contract with any individual or entity for whom the inspector performs an inspection for purposes of determining eligibility for assistance from the Federal                       Emergency Management Agency)       At the appropriate place, insert:       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security acting through Under      Secretary for Emergency Preparedness shall propose new      inspection guidelines that prohibit inspectors from entering      into a contract with any individual or entity for whom the      inspector performs an inspection for purposes of determining      eligibility for assistance from the Federal Emergency      Management Agency.                    Amendment No. 1111, as Modified
