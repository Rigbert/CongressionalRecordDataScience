 President, I am pleased, along with Senator Gregg, to introduce the ``Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act.'' This legislation combats identity theft by making it harder for criminals to steal another person's Social Security number, our de facto national identifier.  The United States faces a growing identity theft crisis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates 350,000 cases of identity theft occur each year. That's one case every two minutes.  The Federal Trade Commission, FTC, reports that identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the country. If recent trends continue, reports of identity theft to the FTC will double between 2000 and 2001, to over 60,000 cases.Fully 40 percent of all consumer fraud complaints received by the FTC in the first three months of 2001 involved identity theft.  Unfortunately, the State most affected by these complaints is California. Fully 17 percent of the identity theft complaints the FTC received this past winter came from my home state.  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses another person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license number, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car loans, phone plans or other services in the victim's name.  Identity thieves can get personal information in a myriad of ways, stealing wallets and purses containing identification cards, using personal information found on the Internet, stealing mail, including pre-approved credit offers and credit statements, fraudulently obtaining credit reports or getting personnel records at work.  Of all sources of identity theft, the most common trigger of the crime is the misappropriation of a person's Social Security number. Reports to the Social Security Administration of the Social Security number misuse have increased from 7,868 in 1997 to 46,839 in 2000, an astonishing increase of over 500 percent.  Let me give some examples of victims whose identities were stolen after a thief got hold of their Social Security number: An identity theft ring in Riverside County allegedly bilked eight victims of $700,000. The thieves stole personal information of employees at a large phone company and drained their on-line stock accounts. One employee reportedly had $285,000 taken from his account when someone was able to access his account by supplying the employee's name and social Security number. Three youths robbed a young woman on a San Francisco MUNI bus. The thieves stole her driver's license and social security card. While the victim was traveling over the Christmas holiday, the thieves represented themselves as her and drained her bank accounts, applied for cell phones, credit cards and other accounts. They also redirected her mail to a general delivery post to the Tenderloin. Amy Boyer, a 20 year-old dental assistant from Maine was killed in 1999 by a stalker who bought her Social Security number off the Internet for $45, and then used it to locate her work address. Michelle Brown of Los Angeles, California, had her Social Security number stolen in 1999, and it was used to charge $50,000 including a $32,000 truck, a $5,000 liposuction operation, and a year-long residential lease. While assuming the victim's name, the perpetrator also became the object of an arrest warrant for drug smuggling in Texas.  This bill proposes concrete measures to get Social Security numbers beyond the reach of criminals.  The bill prohibits anyone from selling or displaying a Social Security number to the general public without the Social Security number holder's consent.  No longer will identity thieves or stalkers, like the man who killed Amy Boyer, be able to log anonymously onto a website and obtain another person's Social Security number. Information brokers will no longer be able to sell Social Security numbers to anyone who asks for a nominal fee.  The bill also requires Federal, State, and local governments to take affirmative steps to protect Social Security numbers. Before giving out records such as bankruptcy filings, liens, or birth certificates to the general public, government entities will need to redact the Social Security number.  Thus, identity thieves can no longer mine Social Security numbers from county clerks' offices or state records offices.  In addition, the bill prohibits States from using Social Security numbers as identifying numbers on drivers licenses or printing Social Security numbers on checks.  Privacy advocates contend half of all identity theft cases stem from lost or stolen wallets. Public entities should not put individuals at risk by requiring them to carry cards which contain Social Security numbers on them.  In addition, the bill will empower individuals who wish to keep their Social Security numbers confidential and out of public circulation. Companies will be prohibited from denying an individual a good or service if he refuses to give out his Social Security number.  In recognition of the needs of the business community, this legislation permits businesses to use Social Security numbers with appropriate safeguards for internal uses or in transactions with other businesses.  I want to state up front that the business-to-business exception is an area of significant compromise. As a matter of policy, I believe that a Social Security number, like other sensitive elements of personal information, should be under the control of the person to whom it belongs.  I also understand that many businesses, unfortunately, rely extensively on Social Security numbers to conduct a range of transactions. Some of these transactions include checking databases to ensure the identity of a customer or purchaser.  The cost of changing to other identifiers can be significant. One California health care company, for example, conducted an internal study on how much it would cost to switch from Social Security numbers to another customer identifier. The price tag was over $25 million.  The bill directs the Attorney General to implement rules to permit legitimate business-to-business transactions, but prevent abuse. The Attorney general must consider several factors in the rulemaking: (i) The need for appropriate safeguards so that employees cannot misappropriate Social Security numbers, and (ii) The need to implement procedures to prevent identity thieves, stalkers, and others with ill intent from posing as legitimate businesses to obtain Social Security numbers.  In drafting the rule, the Attorney General must ensure that any business-to-businesss exception is consistent with other privacy laws, including Gramm-Leach-Bliley.  Thus, the bill would be consistent with a district court ruling issued last week that recognized limits on financial institutions' use of Social Security numbers. In Individual Reference Services Group v. Federal Trade Commission, the court held Gramm-Leach-Bliley requires banks to give consumers the opportunity to opt-out before their Social Security number is sold. I would like to submit into the record a copy of a Los Angeles Times article describing the decision.  I would like to thank Senator Gregg for working so hard with me to draft this legislation. I am pleased to report that this bill has garnered the support of the Attorney General of California, Bill Lockyer, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, Crimes Victims United of California, the Los Angeles Coalition of Crime Victim Advocates, and the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau.  Over 350,000 people a year are victims of identity theft, and the numbers continue to grow. Passing the ``Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act'' will help curb this crime by restricting criminal access to Social Security numbers.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in getting this common-sense bill enacted into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the article to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 848       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Social      Security Number Misuse Prevention Act of 2001''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act      is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings.Sec. 3. Prohibition of the display, sale, or purchase of social               security numbers.Sec. 4. No prohibition with respect to public records.Sec. 5. Rulemaking authority of the Attorney General.Sec. 6. Treatment of social security numbers on government documents.Sec. 7. Limits on personal disclosure of a social security number for               consumer transactions.Sec. 8. Extension of civil monetary penalties for misuse of a social               security number.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social      security numbers has contributed to a growing range of      illegal activities,     including fraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking      and other violent crimes.       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers,      and other entities have often used social security numbers to      confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to      the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used      to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of      individual privacy.       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every      individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a      social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for      social security benefits, or to seek employment. An      unintended consequence of these requirements is that social      security numbers have become tools that can be used to      facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the      individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because the      Federal Government created and maintains this system, and      because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to      exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate      for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of      this system.       (4) A social security number does not contain, reflect, or      convey any publicly significant information or concern any      public issue. The display, sale, or purchase of such numbers      in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-open      public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, or      purchase would not affect public debate.       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or      purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that      create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or      financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are      assigned.       (6) Consequently, this Act offers each individual that has      been assigned a social security number necessary protection      from the display, sale, and purchase of that number in any      circumstance that might facilitate unlawful conduct.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF THE DISPLAY, SALE, OR PURCHASE OF                    SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS.

Industry groups are likely to appeal the decision by      District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, which was disclosed      Monday by the Federal Trade Commission. If the decision is      upheld, the rule--issued by the FTC last year and set to take      effect in July--would work dramatic changes in the way      businesses rely upon the credit bureaus' databases for      everything from updating junk-mail lists to locating debtors.       ``It's going to set a higher barrier for the privacy of      this kind of information,'' said Robert Gellman, a privacy      consultant in Washington.       Credit bureaus and information brokers, who filed suit last      year to block the FTC rules, warned that the court decision      may have unintended consequences.       ``There are many beneficial uses for this information,''      said Clark Walter, a spokesman for Trans Union, the Chicago-     based credit bureau. He said the databases are used to find      fugitives, parents who owe child support, missing heirs and      runaway children. ``How these particular functions would be      affected remains to be seen,'' Walter said.       At the heart of the dispute is the top portion of consumer      credit reports, known as the credit ``header,'' which is      typically limited to a person's name, address, birth date and      Social Security number. The header does not include financial      information about credit history or bank accounts, which can      be released only to creditors and others with a legal right      to see it.       Because it has been considered less sensitive, credit      header information has been sold for years. Customers include      marketing firms, law enforcement agencies, private      investigators and journalists.       Last year, the FTC issued rules to prohibit credit bureaus      from continuing to sell the information unless consumers had      first been given an opportunity to block the practice. The      agency said the rule was mandated by Congress as part of a      1999 financial modernization law, which called for new      privacy     protections for consumers' financial information.       The Individual Reference Services Group, a trade group of      information companies, argued that the FTC had misinterpreted      the law. ``We don't think a name and address is `financial      information' under the statute,'' said Ronald Plesser,      attorney for the trade group. The companies also argued that      the rules violated their constitutional right to free speech.       The FTC countered that any personally identifiable      information provided to financial institutions, even if      available from other public sources, should be covered by the      law.       The disclosure of Social Security numbers, in particular,      raised the hackles of privacy advocates, who say the practice      has led to an increase in identity theft and other fraud.       In her 62-page ruling, dated April 30, Huvelle said the      regulations were lawful and constitutional. ``This gives      consumer more control over how their information is used,''      said John Daly, assistant general counsel at the FTC.       The decision marks the latest defeat for credit bureaus and      information brokers, whose operating environment is      increasingly hostile.       A federal appeals court ruled last month that Trans Union      may no longer sell marketing lists based upon certain      financial characteristics, such as consumers with three or      more credit cards, culled from credit reports.       The FTC banned the practice in 1992, saying it violated      federal laws prohibiting the use of credit information for      marketing purposes. The other two major credit bureaus halted      the practice, but Trans Union continued to sell such lists.       If credit bureaus are prohibited from selling credit header      data, businesses will probably turn to other sources, such as      the change-of-address database at the U.S. Postal Service or      voter registration records.
