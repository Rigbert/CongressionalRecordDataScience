  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this year, the United States Government will collect $170 billion more in social security taxes than it needs to pay current benefits. That is $300,000 a minute from the working men and women and small businesses of America. And that money is being used to buy Treasury bonds. It is being put away under the premise that we are creating a trust fund. The full faith and credit of the United States Government backs those bonds.  Now, the President is questioning the full faith and credit, and he is saying there is no trust fund. Now, if the President is right and there is no trust fund, then we should stop taking $170 billion from the working men and women under a false premise. That would be fraud.  We have to do either one of two things: lower the tax on working men and women in this country and small businesses, or honor the trust fund and the debt of the United States of America. I think there is only one choice, and that is to honor the debt of the country. But we have a President who is saying he might not.  Who is he going to pay first? The Chinese, the Japanese? Is he going to pay off his Treasury bonds first and then default on the savings of the working people of this country?                              {time}  1230  Mr. Speaker, it is an outrageous and reckless statement of the President of the United States to make, and if the bond markets believed the President, there would be an economic catastrophe today.                          ____________________
