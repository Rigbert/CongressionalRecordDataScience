President, yesterday I opposed cloture on S. 2271, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. Although I support Senator Sununu's bill, I voted against ending debate on it because Members of the Senate should have the right to offer amendments to this legislation, which implicates some very weighty constitutional and civil liberty issues. Today, I voted in support of S. 2271 on its merits because I believe it improves the PATRIOT Act conference report. I will continue to work with Senators Feingold, Specter, and others to make more improvements such as those included in the bipartisan Senate PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill, which passed unanimously last July.                          ____________________
