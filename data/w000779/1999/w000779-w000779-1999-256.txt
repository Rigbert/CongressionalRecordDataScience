President, I am pleased to join with Senator McCain, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senators Bryan and Snowe in introducing today the Airline Passenger Fairness Act of 1999. The purpose of our legislation is to assure that consumer protections don't end when a passenger pulls into the airport parking lot. Travelers ought to enjoy the same kinds of rights in the air as they do on the ground. But as airline profits have soared in recent years, passenger rights have been left at the gate.  We are well aware that legislation cannot resolve every problem air travelers may encounter. Our bill does not impose a federal mandate for fluffier pillows or a Constitutional right to a bigger bag of peanuts, just the right to basic information and the ability for consumers to make decisions for themselves.  The Department of Transportation's (DoT) Air Travel Consumer Reports just issued its final tally of consumer complaints for 1998. Consumer complaints about air travel jumped from a total of 7,667 in 1997 to 9,606 last year, an increase of more than 25%. In just three months last year, one airline alone denied boarding to 55,767 passengers. The 10 largest U.S. carriers combined denied boarding to more than 250,300 passengers from July-September 1998. One industry expert estimates that sometimes as many as 130-150% of the seats on a flight are sold. Clearly, all is not well.  The price of an airline ticket is one of the great mysteries of modern life. A ticket costs one price when purchased over the phone and another if purchased online, one if purchased in the morning and another three hours later. It practically defies the law of physics.  With this bill, we are putting the airlines on notice that business as usual is no longer acceptable for American air travelers. No longer can a passenger be bumped, canceled or overbooked with impunity.  Under this bill, consumers will be able to get full information about all the fares on all the flights. Airlines will no longer be able to withhold basic information on air fares, creating confusion and preventing consumers from comparison shopping. It will also make sure that when a consumer pays for a ticket, they can use all or part of it for whatever reason they choose. Airlines will have to inform a ticketed passenger when a flight is overbooked, as well as when the problem is when a flight is canceled, delayed, or diverted.  The legislation will work by building on current rules and regulations. Today, the Department of Transportation can investigate ``anti-competitive, unfair or deceptive practices'' by an airline. If the Department finds that an airline has engaged in such practices, DoT can issue civil penalties or take other actions to assure compliance. Our legislation will empower consumers to seek DoT action against carriers that fail to respect the common sense consumer protections spelled out in the bill.  To date, DoT has tended to look at this authority primarily on an industry-wide basis, or whether one airline has engaged in an unfair practice against another. Our bill brings this attention down to the consumers' level. It gives the Department the authority to investigate and punish violations of passenger rights. Under our proposal, airlines will no longer be able to deny consumers basic information without paying a price.  This bill will also put market forces to work to bring prices down. Today, a traveler cannot get much basic information. Poor information makes for poor decisions; poor decisions prevent the market from operating smoothly and set the stage for higher prices. Just last year, according to one national media report, there were more than a dozen fare hikes, and in late January, the media reported the major U.S. carriers raised leisure fares four percent and business fares two percent. Informed consumers engaging in real comparison shopping will put pressure on the airlines to make fares as low as possible.  There's been a lot of talk lately about ``air rage.'' In my view there is no excuse for violent or abusive behavior by anyone. But when people are treated like so many pieces of cargo, it's not surprising that some of them will lash out. One pilot at a major U.S. air carrier said recently: ``What's happening is the industry's own fault. We've got to treat passengers with respect. We've made air travel a very unpleasant experience.''  It's time to make sure air travel works better for everyone. It can if air travelers have the same basic protections as other consumers. The corner grocer cannot sell a customer a product at one price and then sell the next customer in line the same product at a higher price. The neighborhood movie house cannot cancel a show just because only a few people show up. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act will bring similar consumer protections to air travel and ensure that air travelers have the information they need to make informed decisions.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 383       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Passenger Fairness      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The number of airline passengers on United States      carriers is expected to grow from about 600 million per year      today to about 1 billion by the year 2008.       (2) Since 1978 the number of certified large air carriers      has decreased from 30 to 10. In 1998, 6 of the United States'      largest air carriers sought to enter into arrangements that      would result in 3 large networks comprising approximately 70      percent of the domestic market.       (3) Only \2/3\ of all communities in the United States that      had scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today, and      \1/2\ of those remaining are served by smaller airlines      feeding hub airports.       (4) The Department of Transportation's Domestic Airline      Fares Consumer Report for the 3rd Quarter of 1997 listed 75      major city pairs where fares increased by 30 percent or more      year-over-year, while total traffic in these city pairs      decreased by 863,500 passengers, or more than 20 percent.       (5) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that      large United States air carriers charge twice as much at      their large hub airports where there is no low fare      competition as they charge at a hub airport where a low fare      competitor is present. The General Accounting Office found      that fares range from 12 percent to 71 percent higher at hubs      dominated by one carrier or a consortium.       (6) Complaints filed with the Department of Transportation      about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent      over the previous year, and complaints against large United      States air carriers have increased from 6,394 in 1997 to      7,994 in 1998.       (7) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission      reported that recent data indicate the problem of delay in      flights is getting worse, and that the number of daily      aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer was nearly 20 percent      higher in 1996 than in 1995.       (8) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission      forecast that United States domestic and international      passenger enplanements are expected to increase 52 percent      between 1996 and 2006, and the Federal Aviation      Administration forecasts annual growth in revenue passenger      miles will average 4.2 percent.       (9) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that      the large United States air carriers charge about 60 percent      more to passengers traveling to or from small communities      than they charge to passengers traveling between large      communities.       (10) The Congress has directed the Secretary of      Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in      the airline industry.     SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS.       Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking ``On the initiative'' and inserting ``(a)      Duty of the Secretary.--On the initiative''; and       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following:       ``(b) Specific Practices.--For purposes of subsection (a),      the terms `unfair or deceptive practice' and `unfair method      of competition' include, in the case of a certificated air      carrier, an air carrier's failure--       ``(1) to inform a ticketed passenger, upon request, whether      the flight on which the passenger is ticketed is oversold;       ``(2) to permit a passenger holding a confirmed reserved      space on a flight to use portions of that passenger's ticket      for travel, rather than the entire ticket, regardless of the      reason any other portion of the ticket is not used;       ``(3) to deliver a passenger's checked baggage within 24      hours after arrival of the flight on which the passenger      travelled and on which the passenger checked the baggage,      except for reasonable delays in delivery of such baggage;       ``(4) to provide a consumer full access to all fares for      that air carrier, regardless of the technology the consumer      uses to access the fares if such information is requested by      that consumer;       ``(5) to provide notice to each passenger holding a      confirmed reserved space on a flight with reasonable prior      notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed for any reason      (other than reasons of national security);       ``(6) to inform passengers accurately and truthfully of the      reason for the delay, cancellation, or diversion of a flight;       ``(7) to refund the full purchase price of an unused ticket      if the passenger requests a refund within 48 hours after the      ticket is purchased;       ``(8) to disclose to consumers information that would      enable them to make informed decisions about the comparative      value of frequent flyer programs among airlines, including--       ``(A) the number of seats redeemable on each flight; and       ``(B) the percentage of successful and failed redemptions      on each airline and on each flight.       ``(c) Report.--The Secretary shall include information      about violations of subsection (a) by certificated air      carriers in the Department of Transportation's monthly Air      Travel Consumer Report.       ``(d) Confirmed reserved space.--The term `confirmed      reserved space' shall mean a space on a specific date and on      a specific flight and class of service of a carrier which has      been requested by a passenger and which the carrier or its      agent has verified, by appropriate notation on the ticket or      in any other manner provided by the carrier, as being      reserved for the accommodation of the passenger.''. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Snowe, and Senator Bryan, to introduce the Airline Passenger Fairness Act.  People who travel by air are the airlines' customers. As such, they expect and deserve the same fair treatment that consumers in other areas have come to rely on. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act would ensure that passengers have the information that they need to make informed choices in their travel plans. It also seeks to encourage airlines to provide better customer service by outlining some minimum standards.  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on some of the specific provisions in the bill. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act will enable an airline passenger to:  find out whether the flight on which that passenger is booked has been oversold;  use whatever portions of a ticket he or she chooses to use to get to his or her destination;  receive his or her checked baggage within 24 hours of a flight's arrival, unless additional delays are reasonable;  find out from an airline all of the fares that the airline offers, regardless of the method used to access fares;  receive prior notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed, if reasonable;  receive accurate information about the reasons why a passenger's flight has been delayed, canceled, or diverted to another airport;  obtain a full refund of the purchase price of a ticket if the passenger requests it within 48 hours of purchase; and  receive accurate information about an airline's frequent flyer program, including the number of seats that can beredeemed on each flight, and the percentage of successful and failed frequent flyer redemptions on each flight.  The Department of Transportation already holds the authority to investigate airlines that have been charged with exercising ``unfair and deceptive practices,'' and ``unfair methods of competition.'' Our bill simply specifies that if passengers are denied any of the items of fair treatment that I just listed, that denial constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice on the part of the airline, or an unfair method of competition.  Mr. President, as I said earlier, this legislation is about helping consumers make informed choices among their air travel options. A key component of this bill is a publication requirement. Consumers will be able to review the Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report to find out what airlines are denying passengers the fair treatment outlined in the bill, and on how many occasions.  Air travel is on the rise. As airport congestion, delays, and fares increase, so have the complaints among airline passengers. The Air Passenger Fairness Act seeks to respond to these complaints in a constructive manner by giving passengers better information on which to judge the service levels offered by the airlines. We expect to hold hearings soon on this bill in the Commerce Committee, and we welcome any input on the initiative.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 384. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive certain domestic source or content requirements in the procurement of items.                  BUY AMERICA RESTRICTIONS LEGISLATION Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive ``Buy America'' restrictions on all items procured for the Department of Defense.  I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential impact of our ``Buy America'' policy on bilateral trade relations with our allies. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose this type of protectionist trade policy, not only because I believe free trade is an important means of improving relations among all nations and a key to major U.S. economic growth, but also because I believe we must reform these practices in order to make our limited defense dollars go further so as to reverse the downward trend in our military readiness.  Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward bill that promotes U.S. products, not by imposing restrictive barriers on open competition and free trade, but by reinforcing sound and beneficial economic principles.  This bill gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to waive restrictions on the procurement of all items with respect to a foreign country if the Secretary of Defense determines they would impede cooperative programs entered into between a foreign country and the Department of Defense. Additionally, it would waive protectionist practices if it is determined that such practices would impede the reciprocal procurement of items in that foreign country, and that foreign country does not discriminate against items produced in the U.S. to a greater degree than the U.S. discriminates against items produced in that country.  For example, the Secretary of Defense may waive ``Buy America'' restrictions for contracts and subcontracts for items because of unreasonable delays or costs to the U.S. government in equipping servicemembers with U.S. products; insufficient quantity or unsatisfactory quality of U.S. products; and absence of competition in the U.S., resulting in a monopoly or a sole source contract, and thus, a higher price for the Department of Defense and ultimately the taxpayer.  Let me be clear, I am not against U.S. procurement of American products. The United States, without a doubt, produces the very best products in the world. In fact, a recent Department of State study reported that U.S. defense companies sold more weapons and defense products and claimed a larger share of the world market than was previously realized. This new study shows U.S. exports of defense products increased to nearly $25 billion in 1996, comprising nearly 60 percent of global exports. This number continues to rise steadily.  From a practical standpoint, adherence to ``Buy America'' restrictions seriously impairs our ability to compete freely in international markets for the best price on needed military equipment and could also result in a loss of existing business from longstanding international trading partners. While I fully understand the arguments made by some that the ``Buy America'' restrictions help maintain certain critical industrial base capabilities, I find no reason to support domestic source restrictions for products that are widely available from many U.S. companies (e.g., pumps produced by at least 25 U.S. companies). I believe that competition and open markets among our allies on a reciprocal basis would provide the best equipment at the best prices for taxpayers and U.S. and allied militaries alike.  In recent meetings, the Ambassadors and other senior representatives of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia and Israel have apprised me of similar situations in their countries. In every meeting, they tell me how difficult it is becoming to persuade their governments to buy American defense products, because of our protectionist policies and the growing ``Buy European'' sentiment.  Mr. President, we have heard over the last four months of the dire situation of our military forces. We have heard testimony of decreasing readiness, modernization programs that are decades behind schedule, and quality of life deficiencies that are so great we cannot retain, much less recruit, the personnel we need. As a result, there has been a recent groundswell of support in Congress for the Armed Forces, including a number of pay and retirement initiatives and the promise of a significant increase in defense spending.  All of these proposals are excellent starting points to help re-forge our military, but we must not forget that much of them will be in vain if the Department of Defense is obligated to maintain wasteful, protectionist trade policies. When we actually look for the dollars to pay for these initiatives, it would be unconscionable not to examine the potential for savings from modifying the ``Buy America'' program. Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated repeatedly that they want more flexibility to reform the military's archaic acquisition practices. We cannot sit idly by and throw money at the problem, without considering this partial solution regarding ``Buy America.''  Mr. President, the Congress can continue to protect U.S. industry from foreign competition for selfish, special interest reasons, or we can loosen these restrictions to provide the necessary funds to ensure our military can fight and win future wars. Every dollar we spend on archaic procurement policies, like ``Buy America,'' is a dollar we cannot spend on training our troops, keeping personnel quality of life at an appropriate level, maintaining force structure, replacing old weapons systems, and advancing our military technology.  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this legislation will end once and for all the anti-competitive, anti-free trade practices that encumber our government, the military, and U.S. industry. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this critical bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 384       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
