President, today I am introducing legislation to extend to Federal retirees and both active and retired military personnel the same health insurance premium conversion benefits allowed to current civilian Federal employees. This legislation directs the Office of Personnel Management to establish a system allowing those who participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, to pay their health insurance premiums from pre-tax income.  The practice of allowing health care participants to use pre-tax income to pay their health insurance premiums is often used in the private sector as a way of recognizing the importance of adequate, affordable health insurance. This system is called premium conversion. Last year, the Office of Personnel Management recognized this concept by establishing a plan to allow most employees of the executive, legislative and judicial branches to participate in premium conversion.  Many Federal retirees also participate in the FEHBP program and as a matter of fairness should be extended the opportunity to participate in premium conversion. In addition, the military currently has a separate health care system, but it is exploring offering health benefits under FEHBP, and therefore military employees or retirees who do participate in FEHBP should also be allowed premium conversion.  I have heard from Federal retirees in Maine who have pointed out the unfairness of not including retired Federal employees in the premium conversion system. This legislation will address this inequity.  I urge my colleagues to review and support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
