 We look at what the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, GEN Ron Fogelman, said before these plans were announced. He argued for a larger Reserve component and a smaller Active-Duty Force. He did a guest column in DefenseNews. He said, among other things:       The big question is, how does the department reduce its      budget and continue to provide a modern, balanced and ready      defense when more than half of the budget is committed to      personnel costs?       The answer to that question is right before us: We should      return to our historic roots as a militia nation. So, what      does that mean, exactly? Simply put, it means we should      return to the constitutional construct for our military and      the days when we maintained a smaller standing military and a      robust militia.       To do that, leaders must put old parochial norms aside and      be willing to actually shift forces and capabilities to the      National Guard and Reserve.  He said ``put old parochial norms aside.'' He goes on to say:       This would enable significant personnel reductions in the      active components. It would also result in a larger reserve      component. Most important, it would preserve capability and      equipment that has cost the American taxpayer trillions of      dollars, nest it in our mostly part-time Guard and Reserve,      and have it available should it be needed.       This concept worked well for our country for the better      part of two centuries. Unfortunately, several generations of      leaders have come and gone, and most of today's leadership      fails to recognize the true potential of the militia model.       We need our collective senior military and civilian leaders      to recognize there is a way back to a smaller active military      and a larger militia posture. The fiscal environment and      emerging threats demand it.  Those aren't my words. Those are the words of a former Air Force Chief of Staff.
