 We asked Vermonters if, given a choice between raising taxes on upper-income people or cutting Medicare, what would they prefer. Overwhelmingly, people said if the choice is cutting Medicare or raising taxes on upper-income folks, we should raise taxes on upper-income folks.  What would be the poll results if we said should we lower taxes on the richest people in America and cut Medicare? I do not know of 5 percent of the population who thinks that is a good idea. That is why they want to move this thing through the House so very fast.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Absolutely. I thank the gentleman very much.                          ____________________
