Speaker, I would tell the gentleman, it is because there is an urgency that we restore confidence in the markets that corporate wrongdoing is going to be dealt with firmly and severely, which the increased penalties in this bill do.  Last week, the minority leader, the distinguished gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt), on three occasions called on taking bipartisan action to correct the problems now. At least insofar as weak criminal penalties are concerned, this bill meets the minority leader's call.
