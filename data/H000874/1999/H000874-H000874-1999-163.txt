Chairman, I tell my colleague from South Carolina that if the President had gotten simply a cost of living adjustment since 1969, he would be making $758,000 today. Just a cost of living.  So I think the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), has been very modest in his proposal. And as a matter of fact, all the testimony before the Committee on Government Reform, chaired by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), was that a higher salary was justified.  So I enjoyed the back of the envelope presentation. I tell the gentleman from South Carolina, notwithstanding the fact that it was written on the back of the envelope, it was not given at Gettysburg, and may not last quite as long. I think his compilation was interesting but not particularly relevant.  It is important for us, I think, to compensate the President not in the sense of a king or lavishly, but certainly appropriately as it relates to the rest of the people in government. And as the gentleman knows, the Speaker makes $175,000. In 1969 the Speaker was making less than half of that.  So it is appropriate, in my opinion, to at this point in time, for the next President, this will not affect, as the gentleman knows, the incumbent President. Under the Constitution, we cannot do that and should not be able to do that. But this will reflect an appropriate salary for arguably the person who has the toughest job in the world and on whom billions of people rely for good judgment and honest service.  So I would hope that the House would reject this amendment and approve the committee's recommendation.
