Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues as a proud original cosponsor of this important resolution.  I congratulate our brothers and sisters in Israel on this important milestone--the 60th anniversary of becoming an independent nation. From the first hour on that first day, Israel and the United States began a relationship based on democratic values, friendship and respect that continues to this day.  Over the years, Israel has developed into a thriving society, a world leader, and an active democracy. Welcoming people from Russia to Ethiopia, Israel has become a refuge for those persecuted for thousands of years.  In fact, many of my constituents have traveled or lived in Israel. In 2005, we made history when Atlanta became the first U.S. city in the Southeast to have non-stop direct flights to Tel Aviv.  I, too, have a personal connection with the people of Israel--like me, they are descended from survivors. The atrocities of the holocaust must never be forgotten. Every day, we must recommit ourselves to never allow this history to be repeated. We have overcome so many trials and hardships, but there is still so much farther to go.  It is my hope that one day, together we will be able to celebrate peaceful relationships and coexistence with all the countries in the Middle East. And I hope that this peace comes long before another 60 years.  Mr. Speaker, I extend my deepest congratulations to the Israeli people on this historic day.                          ____________________
