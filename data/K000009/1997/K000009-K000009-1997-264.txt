Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize G. Ray Medlin of my district, on his receipt of the Northwest Ohio Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation's Humanitarian Award. Ray will be honored in Toledo, OH on February 25, 1997.  Ray has served our community, our State, and our Nation in many capacities. He is a dedicated and diligent trade union leader, having served as the executive secretary-treasurer of the Northwest Ohio District Council of Carpenters and president of the Northwest Ohio Building and Construction Trades Council. He currently is the executive director of the Carpenters Health and Safety Fund of North America.  Extending his commitment outside his profession, Ray serves as a key member on several northwest Ohio boards including the Bowling Green State University Board of Trustees which he currently chairs, the Toledo-Lucus County Port Authority Board, the Toledo Regional Growth Committee, the Riverside Hospital Board, and the Rossford, OH Economic Growth Committee.  Ray Medlin directs his energies to those ventures which will reap economic rewards for our region, thereby assisting our entire community in achieving economic security. In that sense, he is a classic humanitarian: Focusing his volunteer efforts on bettering the lives of his fellow citizens. He is a worthy recipient of the Northwest Ohio Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation's 1997 Humanitarian Award. I am pleased to join the organization in congratulating him and acknowledging his service and commitment to us all.                          ____________________
