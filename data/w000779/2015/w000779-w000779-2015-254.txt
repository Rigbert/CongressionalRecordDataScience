President, colleagues, Social Security is a promise between workers and seniors that should never be broken, and Social Security benefits ought to be protected and should not be cut.  The Congress needs to take steps to ensure that Social Security can pay full benefits for future generations and must avoid creating artificial roadblocks to the proper use of Social Security trust funds.  The House of Representatives has refused to do that even though Social Security trust funds today have a balance of $2.8 trillion, and should be able to pay all earned benefits until 2033.  Support this amendment. Don't privatize Social Security.
