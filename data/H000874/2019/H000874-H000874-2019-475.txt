Samuel L. Myers, Sr. on reaching his milestone centennial birthday this past April 18, which is being celebrated on September 27 at a gathering of friends, family, and community and national leaders at National Harbor in Maryland. From speaking out against segregation in the military as an Army captain during the Second World War to becoming one of the first African Americans to earn a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, from his efforts as part of the Civil Rights Movement to expand access to higher education to his championing of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) for more than half a century, Dr. Myers' life has been one of blazing trails and breaking down barriers.  In 1967, Dr. Myers assumed the position of President of Bowie State University, the oldest HBUC in Maryland and one of the oldest in the country. Under his administration, enrollment increased 200 percent and tensions between the student body and officials werecalmed by his skilled diplomacy and determination to ensure that high-quality education always came first. After ten years at Bowie State, Dr. Myers began an eighteen-year tenure as President of the National Association for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO). Representing 117 HBCUs, Dr. Myers fought tirelessly to secure much-needed funding for these colleges and universities to expand and offer more courses and degrees. I am proud, Madam Speaker, to be a member of the Congressional HBCU Caucus and to support Bowie State University and other HBCUs as they work hard to carry out their important mission of making educational achievement and career success more equitable in our country.  Even after his retirement from NAFEO, Dr. Myers has been a force for good in the community, working since 1995 as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Minority Access, Inc., an organization that works to expand the access of under-represented groups to institutions of higher education, federal and state governments, and private corporations. Dr. Myers has spent decades fighting for the public good, for equality, for justice, and for opportunity. His impact on education in my home state of Maryland and in our country cannot be measured and will surely be long-lasting. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr. Myers for his lifetime of service and wishing him a very happy 100th birthday.                          ____________________
