President, 29 years ago, March was designated National Women's History Month. It is hard to imagine, but as recently as the 1970s, history books largely left out the contributions of women in America. This began to change in 1978, when a small group set out to revise the school curriculum in their community--Sonoma County, CA. The idea was to create a Women's History Week, and its goal was to write women back into history books. It was an idea that was long overdue. And Women's History Week took off around the county . . . around the State . . . and across the Nation. It didn't take long before organizers lobbied Congress and even the White House. And on February 28, 1980, it paid off.  President Jimmy Carter announced for the first time that March 2-8, 1980, would be designated as National Women's History Week. He urged libraries, schools, and community organizations to focus on leaders who struggled for equality: Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cody Stanton, Harriet Tubman, and Alice Paul. In 1981, the cause gained further momentum when an unlikely partnership between then-Representative Barbara Mikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch cosponsored a congressional resolution for National Women's History Week. And 6 short years later, National Women's History Week became National Women's History Month. And last November, Senator Mikulski was awarded the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in part for her work on equal pay for women--what an honor.  Throughout history, women have achieved significant progress in the face of discrimination and, time and time again, blazed new trails. So it is appropriate that Senator Barbara Mikulski would play such an integral role in creating National Women's History Month. After all, she understands the role of a trailblazer better than many. And during her last year in the U.S. Senate, it is fitting we honor some of her accomplishments. Senator Mikulski was the first woman elevated to a leadership post in the U.S. Senate and the only current Member of Congress in the National Women's Hall of Fame. She is also the first woman elected to Congress in her own right, not because of a husband or a father or someone who served before her in higher office. Senator Mikulski embodies what National Women's History Month is all about, particularly this year, when its theme is ``Working to Form a More Perfect Union: Honoring Women in Public Service and Government.''  So with that in mind, I would like to tell you a story about Senator Mikulski, also known in this chamber as the Dean of Women. Following the election of a number of esteemed women into the Senate, a lot of reporters deemed 1992, the Year of the Woman, but Senator Mikulski didn't like the sound of that.  She said: ``Calling 1992 the Year of the Woman makes it sound like theYear of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus. We're not a fad, fancy or a year.''  That is classic for Senator Mikulski.  Today there are a record 20 female Members in the Senate, but Barbara would be the first to point out that is still a minority, and we can do better. Well, after 40 years in Congress, Senator Mikulski will be sorely missed. Without the leadership and determination of Senator Mikulski, the fight gets a little harder, and there is plenty of work to do.  Women still receive an average of 78 cents for every dollar earned by men, and it is even greater for women of color. African-American women make 64 cents for every dollar earned by men, and Hispanic women only make 56 cents. It is not right, and it is long past time that Congress pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to provide women with the necessary tools to fight wage discrimination. It is also time to guarantee paid family and medical leave for all. Making this a reality will mean that when major life events happen, birth of a new child or caring for an aging parent, hard-working Americans will not have to choose between their family and debt, bankruptcy, or losing their job. But America can overcome these challenges. We have done it before. Just look how far we have come.  Here are just a few of the problems women faced and overcame since the 1970s: women could be fired from the workplace for being pregnant; sexual harassment wasn't recognized in the workplace; women couldn't get a credit card; and marital rape wasn't considered a crime in most States. But we solved these discriminatory and heinous practices. You see, America's democracy has indeed been imperfect, but throughout our history, we have sought to address our Nation's imperfections. Because the story of the United States is not a story of a perfect union, It is a story about the pursuit to create ``a more perfect union.''  Let me close with this. Years ago, in my home State of Illinois, then First Lady Hilary Clinton said: ``If you go to the poorest places on Earth struggling from social problems of poverty, disease, and hunger and all that comes with it, and you can only ask one question to determine if they have a chance, the question you should ask is this: How do you treat your women?''  If you give women an equal playing field, status, education, and opportunity, you are giving them and your country a chance to thrive.  This March, as we pay tribute to all the brave women who have moved this country forward and in doing so inspired each and every one of us, let's challenge ourselves to build on their legacies and make our country a more equal society for our mothers, sisters, and daughters.                          ____________________
