President, earlier this month, Vermont's Governor Peter Shumlin appointed Sydney Lea to serve as Vermont's new Poet Laureate. This honor has been bestowed to Vermonters whose poetry manifests a high degree of excellence since Governor Kunin reestablished the position of Poet Laureate in 1988. Sydney Lea is certainly deserving of this honor.  A resident of Newbury, VT, Sydney has written a number of poetry collections including Young of the Year, Ghost Pain, Pursuit of a Wound, and The Floating Candles to name a few. His pieces have been published in the New York Times, the New Yorker, the New Republic, Sports Illustrated, and many others. In 2000, his poem, Pursuit of a Wound, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. In 1998, he was a cowinner of the Poets' Prize, one of the nation's highest honors for a single collection of poems.  Sydney has taught at Dartmouth, Wesleyan, and Middlebury College as well as the University of Vermont and Yale University. He has also spent time teaching at the Franklin College in Switzerland and the National Hungarian University in Budapest. His dedication to and love for the written word has inspired hundreds of students in Vermont and around the globe. As a Central Vermont Adult Basic Education board member, he continues to see education as a lifelong process. Sydney's stories attract a wide array of audiences and come alive for Vermonters of all generations. His personal dedication to land conservationhas given him an unique ability to describe our beautiful New England landscape.  I am proud of Sydney Lea and applaud his accomplishments as a distinguished Vermonter and poet. When I called to congratulate him he was characteristically modest, but we are so proud of him, and I join all Vermonters in congratulating him on this appointment.                          ____________________
