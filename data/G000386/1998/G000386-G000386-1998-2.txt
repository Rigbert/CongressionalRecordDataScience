 President, I am introducing the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1998. This legislation would provide block grants to the states to provide educational programs that focus on and are tailored to the needs of gifted and talented students.  The needs of gifted and talented students are often misunderstood. Too often we believe that all we need to do for gifted and talented students is to put them on an accelerated course of study. However, that is not sufficient. Gifted and talented students think and look at the world in a unique way. Therefore, their educational agenda must be tailored to the thought processes gifted and talented students employ. Currently, our nation's education system does not do so. This is due in part, to a lack of resources available in schools across the country.  My legislation, which has been offered in the House of Representatives by Congressman Elton Gallegly of California would provide block grants to state education agencies to identify gifted and talented students from all economic, ethnic and racial backgrounds--including students of limited English proficiency and those with disabilities. Funding would be based on each state's student population, but each state would receive at least $1 million.  This legislation would leave the decision on how best to serve these students to state and local officials. I have always believed that state and local officials, working with parents, are in a much better position than bureaucrats in Washington to know what their students need to succeed. I have also always believed that the most effective education spending is that which goes directly to the students. That's why this bill caps administrative costs at 10 percent.  So while the funds in this measure can't be used for bureaucracy, it can be used for items such as professional development for teachers; counselors and administrators; innovation of programs and services for high-ability students and for developing emerging technologies such as distance learning and other initiatives. It is my hope this measure will give educators the resources and the flexibility they need to meet the needs of gifted and talented students.  Mr. President, our nation's gifted and talented are among our great untapped resources. We must focus on the needs of these students so that their particular gifts can flourish and be fully realized. I am aware Mr. President that at this late date, this measure will not pass. However, I hope introduction of this bill will help shed some light on the needs of the gifted and talented and force a much-needed national conversation about the tremendous potential that we are allowing to go undeveloped. While this measure will obviously not receive any further action before the end of the 105th Congress, it is my sincere hope that introduction of this bill will be the beginning of a new era in educating the gifted and talented.                                 ______                                       By
