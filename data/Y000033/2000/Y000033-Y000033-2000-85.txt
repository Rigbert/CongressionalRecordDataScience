Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1367) to amend the Act which established the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site, in the State of New Hampshire, by modifying the boundary and for other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1367       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     That Public Law 88-543 (16 U.S.C. 461 (note)), which      established Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site is amended--       (1) in section 3 by striking ``not to exceed sixty-four      acres of lands and interests therein'' and inserting ``279      acres of lands and buildings, or interests therein'';       (2) in section 6 by striking ``$2,677,000'' from the first      sentence and inserting ``$10,632,000''; and       (3) in section 6 by striking ``$80,000'' from the last      sentence and inserting ``$2,000,000''.
