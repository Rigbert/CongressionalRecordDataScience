Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter the comments of some Georgia residents into the Congressional Record. For Black History Month, the Democratic National Committee queried African Americans asking them to write in and describe how the policies of President George W. Bush's administration are affecting them. The following are the words of Georgia residents who responded:       John A. Olagoke, Dallas, Ga: ``Dear Mr. President, For the      very first time in American History, I have never seen such a      mess up in the American Economy. So many of us African      Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, their assets and      everything they have worked hard for. I am talking about      well-educated people, Mr. President. Most of our      telecommunication jobs are being moved overseas for cheaper      labor. Last week, again, over 500 co-workers were laid-off at      my company. I and others can no longer wait until the      November election. I intend to take two of my family members      who have not voted for eight years with me to the polling      station to express our feelings.''       Arnitta Lawson, College Park, Ga.: ``In spite of the fact      that I have a job, I am very worried that the job I do have      will not last. I was laid off once because of 9/11, as well      as other family members. [I was] forced to take menial jobs      and worry about how to get food for the children, pay bills      and try to get a job. I am very distrusting of Republicans      such as George W. Bush.''       Ginny Albert, Atlanta, Ga.: ``Mr. President, because your      administration has been so lax and deliberately cruel to the      middle class, the corporations who have filled your coffer,      thanks to the tax cuts and special initiatives that favor      businesses over people, these same corporations now feel that      they can be negligent and indifferent toward their customers      and employees. They demand more and pay less in every sector.      They have cut back on benefits, and in some cases have      eliminated benefits altogether. Yes, your lack of true caring      toward the non-rich has engendered a sense that cruelty      toward people is okay and acceptable, and that employers no      longer have to promise their workers anything. And another      thing, why have you not initiated a program that will assist      the unemployed in keeping their homes. Legislate something      that will make it impossible for companies to foreclose on      unemployed Americans. The homeless rolls are growing under      your administration. If you care, put a stop to it.''                          ____________________
