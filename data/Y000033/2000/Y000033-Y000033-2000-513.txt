Mr. Speaker, first, let me say that I have jurisdiction over the Marianas. We have reviewed this. We requested a GAO report and most of the accusations made, in fact all of the accusations made, by the Interior Department have been proven false. In fact, the Marianas improved the well-being of their people. I have been there. It has worked well, and we have made an independent nation out of the Marianas.                              {time}  2115  To have this motion to recommit and enforce this I say undue burden upon the Marianas would be wrong to those people there. This Congress said they shall be independent. This would take their independence away from them. I rise in strong opposition to the motion to recommit.
