Chairman, I would like to assure the Members that the following amendment is the one that we are debating: ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to revoke funding previously awarded to or within the State of North Carolina.''  Is this the amendment that the gentleman is offering?  The Acting CHAIR. Amendment No. 34, as printed in the Congressional Record, is pending.
