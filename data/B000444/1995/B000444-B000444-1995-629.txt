  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Support the Biden-Bradley Amendment to the Balanced Budget Amendment       Dear Senator: As currently drafted, the Balanced Budget      Amendment (BBA) would create a political straight jacket that      could push Congress to sell off our nation's treasured public      lands such as national parks, forests and wildlife refuges.      To help prevent this consequence, we urge you to support an      amendment Senators Biden and Bradley are expected to offer      this week to the BBA. The Biden-Bradley amendment would      establish a capital budget to assure continued federal      investments in major public assets from being counted toward      reductions in the operating budget deficit.       Some policy groups have voiced support for selling off      public lands as a means of lowering the federal deficit, most      recently at a January hearing before the House Interior      Appropriations Subcommittee. While such a proposal seems      unthinkable to most Americans, the BBA could push Congress in      this direction. This possibility is not merely academic.      After a previous administration initiated wide-spread sales      of public assets to reach deficit reduction targets, Congress      approved the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (contained in      Public Law 101-508), which prohibits the Congressional Budget      Office from counting the sale of public assets toward deficit      reduction.       The reason for such a prohibition is obvious. While sales      of federal assets may help reduce the deficit during the year      in which they occur, the resulting one-time revenues do      nothing to reduce the persistent spending problems that cause      continued federal deficits. Far from reducing spending,      selling public lands only results in the exchange of one      public asset--say a national park--for another, cash. As      such, it amounts to budgetary gimmickry in the name of      deficit elimination.       Circumstances may well arise in which it is appropriate for      Congress to consider the sale of individual federal land      holdings. The Biden-Bradley amendment does nothing to inhibit      that. But the Biden-Bradley amendment does assure that the      balanced budget amendment does not provide a perverse      incentive to sell off large portions of the public estate to      produce phony deficit results.       We urge you to support the Biden-Bradley amendment.
