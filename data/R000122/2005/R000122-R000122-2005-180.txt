President, I will make a few additional comments in the remaining time with respect to the LIHEAP program and this legislation.  This is a very simple amendment. It adds $3.1 billion. It would bring it up to the level that was authorized in the Energy bill which we considered on this floor several weeks ago, recognizing the authorization levels had to be raised given the increase in prices, given the need for more Americans to access the LIHEAP program.
