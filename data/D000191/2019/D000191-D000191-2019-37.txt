Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just in quick response to my colleague from North Carolina, a member of the committee of jurisdiction, the Coast Guard has interdicted more drugs than all of the other Federal agencies combined, yet they say they are only acting on 20 percent of them. So that is a pretty big hole.  But the second thing is, she is right. We are not interdicting very many drugs at the points of entry because we only inspect 6 percent of the semis with high technology. And Guzman's buddies said: That is how we bring it in. We put fake floors in the semis, and we are bringing tons of drugs across.  He is right. We are not intercepting them because we don't have the personnel and we don't have the technology.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).
