 President, I rise to discuss one of the major crises facing our health care system today, and that is that the pharmaceutical industry itself has become a major health hazard to the American people. The pharmaceutical industry in this country is charging the American people by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  The result is that one out of five Americans, including patients suffering from cancer who get a prescription from a doctor, is unable to afford to fill that prescription. This is totally absurd. The result is that Americans who are unable to buy the drugs that were prescribed to them become much sicker than they should have been, and in some cases they die. The result is also that people will end up in the emergency room or in the hospital at great expense to themselves and to the system because they were unable to afford the drugs that would have improved their health.  As Dr. Marcia Angell, a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, recently wrote in the Washington Post:       Why do drug companies charge so much? Because they can.  Simple truth. There is not a rational economic reason for that. They charge outrageously high prices because nobody is stopping them in this country.  The United States is the only major country on Earth--the only one--that does not in one form or another regulate prescription drug prices. What that means is you could walk into the drugstore and the pharmacy tomorrow, and you could find that the price you are paying for a drug you have been using for many years has doubled, tripled, or gone up 10 times, and the United States has chosen to be the only major country on Earth that does not address this issue.  Let me give a few examples, some of which have received a good deal of attention recently.  In the United States, Daraprim, a prescription drug used to treat patients diagnosed with cancer and AIDS, shot up in price from $18 a pill to $750 a pill, literally overnight, after this drug was acquired by a former hedge fund manager by the name of Martin Shkreli, who is quickly becoming the poster child for pharmaceutical greed. This same exact drug sells for 66 cents a pill in Britain, and Mr. Shkreli is charging the American people $750 for a drug used to treat patients with cancer and AIDS. That makes no sense to me, and it makes no sense to the American people.  Last week Congressman Elijah Cummings and I sent a letter to Mr. Shkreli asking him to explain why the price of this drug has skyrocketed by over 4,000 percent. Now the good news--or it appears to be the good news--is that Mr. Shkreli recently said he would lower the price of this lifesaving drug, although he has not yet indicated what the new price will be. But let's be very clear--this is just one of many examples of price gouging within the pharmaceutical industry.  I wish to give another example. In the United States the prescription drug Sovaldi, which is used to treat a very serious and widespread disease, Hepatitis C, costs $1,000 a pill--a thousand bucks a pill. In Europe, the same exact drug, made by the same exact company, costs $555 a pill. In Egypt and India, the same drug costs $11 a pill.  The cost of this drug has become so expensive that Medicaid and the Veterans' Administration--and many veterans are suffering with Hepatitis C--both Medicaid and the VA are rationing access to Sovaldi and other blockbuster Hepatitis C drugs to only the sickest patients. In other words, people in the United States are dying and suffering because they or the government programs they rely on--Medicaid or the VA--are simply unable to afford the outrageous prices this company is charging.  According to a recent article in the Atlantic magazine, despite rationing Sovaldi, the State of New Mexico--and I am just using New Mexico as one example; this is taking place all across the country--the State of New Mexico will spend an estimated $140 million this year on that drug alone.  I should tell you this issue first came to my attention as the former chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee when the VA requested an additional $1.3 billion for that particular drug--$1.3 billion for one drug. This is unacceptable and it has to change.  Last year, the pharmaceutical industry--shock of all shocks; I know the American people will be very surprised to hear this--the pharmaceutical industry spent $250 million on lobbying and campaign contributions, and they employed some 1,400 lobbyists. Well, that is what you get when you spend one-quarter of a billion dollars and you have 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill. What you get is the ability to rip off the American people, to charge our people prices far higher than the people of any other country on Earth pay. And you have the three largest drug companies in this country making $45 billion in profit last year. So that is not a bad investment. Hey, just spread the money around on Capitol Hill--$250 million--throw in some campaign contributions, and the three largest drug companies make $45 billion in a year. Meanwhile, all over this country, one out of five Americans cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. People die. People become sick. State governments spend huge sums of money on these drugs because they are so expensive.  The time has come to say loudly and clearly: Yes, the drug companies make a lot of campaign contributions, but maybe, just maybe, Congress might have the radical idea that it is more important for us to represent our constituents than the people who throw all kinds of money at us in Congress.  It is unacceptable that total spending on medicine in the United States has gone up by more than 90 percent since 2002. It is unacceptable that the monthly cost of cancer drugs has more than doubled over the last 10 years to $9,900 a month. In the United States of America, you should not be forced into bankruptcy because you are diagnosed with cancer.  It is time--in fact, the time is long overdue--for our country and our Congress to join the rest of the industrialized world by implementing prescription drug policies that work for everybody and not just the owners in the pharmaceutical industry. That is why I recently introduced legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs in America. That legislation is cosponsored by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota and was introduced in the House by Congressman Elijah Cummings.  Specifically, this is what the bill would do: No. 1, it requires Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate with the prescription drug companies for better prices--a practice that was banned by the Bush administration several years ago. No. 2, this bill would allow individuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed Canadian pharmacies, where drug prices are significantly lower than they are in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a comparison of the prices of some drugs in the United States with Canada be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 BRAND VS.
