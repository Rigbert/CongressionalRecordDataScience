On this particular one, we will part company, but I certainly appreciate his commitment.  In the report, we state that we provide no additional funding to continue studying the alternatives to the MOX plant and that the NNSA has not described any alternatives which have not already been exhaustively considered or which are likely to resolve in any substantial cost savings to justify this pause, particularly with no permanent nuclear waste repository available after the Department's decision to unilaterally terminate Yucca Mountain.  So there are reasons for the MOX facility. We have made an enormous investment in it, and thousands of jobs are at stake. I am very sorry that we have to part company on this, but I have the highest respect for you and your work.  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).
