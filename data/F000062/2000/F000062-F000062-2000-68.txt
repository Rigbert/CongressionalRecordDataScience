 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today to designate the Santa Rosa/San Jacinto mountain range in southern California as a National Monument. This bill was introduced by Congresswoman Mary Bono earlier in the year. An almost identical version of this bill was passed out of the House Resources Committee earlier in the week.  The Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains contain nationally significant biological, cultural, recreational, geological, educational, and scientific values. This includes magnificent vistas, unique wildlife and mountains which rise from the desert floor to an elevation of almost eleven thousand feet. These mountains provide a picturesque backdrop for Coachella Valley communities and support a wide array of recreational opportunities.  The bill designates this environmentally sensitive area as a monument and instructs the Department of Interior and the Forest Service to craft a management plan. The bill protects the rights of individual land owners, Native American tribes, and all lands outside the monument boundary. It protects the environment and preserves property rights. The bill has bipartisan support and supported by most of the local community.  This bill is quite timely. Three hundred and fifty-five thousand acres of the Sequoia National Forest were designated a national monument by President Clinton on April 15. Over the sixty-day period preceding the designation, many members of the affected community expressed significant opposition to the monument designation. I came to believe that when possible, Congress is in the best position to decide monument and other land use designations and can best ensure that stakeholders affected by such a designation have ample opportunity to provide input, influence the process and understand the designation.  I believe this bill is the proper way to protect this majestic national resource.                                 ______                                       By
