 President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Paul Davis, who was recently awarded with the 2005 Alabama Press Association Lifetime Achievement Award. Paul Davis has been in the newspaper business for more than 35 years, and his career has been filled with courageous accomplishments.  The Alabama Press Association Lifetime Achievement Award honors outstanding service in journalism for individuals who have spent a large percentage of their newspaper career in Alabama. Paul has been recognized for standards of excellence in journalism, courage and controversy on tough issues, and a voice for those less fortunate.  Paul has spent most of his professional career in Alabama. From 1969 to 1973, he was a reporter, columnist and then associate editor at the Tuscaloosa News, my hometown newspaper. Following his time at the Tuscaloosa News, he moved on to serve as editor of the Selma Times Journal and then as vice president and general manager of the Natchez Democrat in Mississippi. From 1983 to 1998, Paul served as editor, publisher and president of the Auburn Bulletin, the Spirit Magazine, and the Tuskegee News. Today, he serves as the president and publisher of Davis Publications of Auburn.  I believe that Paul is well-known for his work as a young reporter at the Tuscaloosa News. Through his investigative reporting, he exposed the abuse of retarded youth and adults at Partlow School and the horrific treatment of patients at the state mental institution, Bryce Hospital. He uncovered the unthinkable details about patients living in wards with no air-conditioning during hot Alabama summers with only one psychiatrist to care for some 5,000 patients. He reported that attendants would dispense pills every hour to keep patients sedated day after day. Even worse, we learned that patients helped construct caskets in the basement and buried their fellow patients in fields behind the hospital, using only numbers to identify the graves. His work on this issue earned him a nomination by his publisher, Buford Boone, for the Pulitzer Prize.  Paul also played an important role in the Federal case regarding the treatment of mental patients. In this important case, U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. ruled that mental patients have a constitutional right to treatment. Following Judge Johnson's ruling, Paul was asked to serve as chairman of the Human Rights Committee at Bryce Hospital. Indeed, his investigative work in this area helped reform Alabama's mental health hospitals.  Long before his reporting exposed the horrific conditions of the mental hospital in Tuscaloosa, Paul spent many days during his youth at Partlow School, visiting and playing games with the residents. Later in life, as president of the Civitan Club in Tuscaloosa, he helped open the first rehabilitation center at Partlow.  Paul Davis has also been an outspoken critic of the leadership at Auburn University. A devoted Tiger fan himself, he has written numerous articles about the school's board of trustees. Supporters and opponents alike agree that, while you may not like what he has to say, he is in-depth and thorough in his reporting. He was recently honored with the Academic Freedom Award from the Auburn University chapter of the American Association of University Professors for his articles on governance issues at Auburn.  In addition to the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Academic Freedom Award, Paul has received numerous professional and civic awards and has twice been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Paul is a member of the American Political Science Association; Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi; and the National Mental Health Association. He also served as past presidents of both the Alabama Press Association and the Alabama Press Association Journalism Foundation.  His company, Davis Publications, publishes the Tuskegee News weekly, and he is a columnist for the Auburn-Opelika News. Paul and his wife Gayle have five sons, one daughter, and thirteen grandchildren.  I have tremendous respect for Paul Davis and his devotion to uncovering the truth. He is most deserving of the Alabama Press Association Lifetime Achievement Award, and I am pleased to congratulate him on this important achievement.                          ____________________[Page S4013]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                               PAUL DAVIS
