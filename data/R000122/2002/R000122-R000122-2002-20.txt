President, The Senate is engaged in a momentous and historic debate. The President seeks the authority to use force in our on-going confrontation with Iraq.  The Constitution entrusts the Congress with the exclusive power to ``declare War.'' It is our Constitutional obligation to consider the President's request carefully and conscientiously, to review the evidence thoroughly, to weigh the costs and the consequences. We are called upon by the Constitution to make an independent judgment, not an automatic acquiescence.  I begin this debate acknowledging several unassailable conclusions.  First, we are already in a confrontation with Iraq. Since the Persian Gulf War, we have maintained military forces in support of international sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Our pilots are routinely fired upon as they enforce the ``No Fly'' Zones. Thus, the question is not whether we should confront Iraq. The question is how best to thwart this outlaw regime and for what ultimate purpose.  Second, Saddam Hussein is a despicable person who oppresses his people as he threatens his neighbors. Despite his military defeat in the Persian Gulf War and the imposition of sanctions, Saddam continues to defy United Nations resolutions and, of most concern, continues to develop and attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. But, our judgment cannot rest simply on his unalloyed evil. We must consider our actions more broadly. Will we enhance the stability and security of the region? Will we strengthen our security not just for the moment, but for the future as well? What kind of precedent will we establish?  Third, we will decisively defeat Iraqi military forces in any conflict. The skill and courage of our forces, aided by superb technology, will overwhelm Iraqi resistance. The military outcome is certain, but the costs and the consequences are uncertain and could be quite grave.  As I consider the proper course of action, as I weigh the uncertainties as well as recognize what is apparent, I return again and again to one further conclusion. Whatever we do will be better done with others. Thus, it is imperative that we commit all of our energies to encourage the United Nations to live up to its founding principles: to be more than just an international forum for discussion; indeed, to be a force for collective action in the face of common dangers. President Bush said it very well when he addressed the United Nations' General Assembly:       We created a United Nations Security Council so that,      unlike the League of Nations, our deliberations would be more      than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. After      generations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and      squandered lives, we've dedicated ourselves to standards of      human dignity shared by all and to a system of security      defended by all.  Acting alone will increase the risk to our forces and to our allies in the region. Acting alone will increase the burden that we must bear to restore stability in the region. Acting alone will invite the criticism and animosity of many throughout the world who will mistakenly dismiss our efforts as entirely self-serving. Acting alone could seriously undermine the structure of collective security that the United States has labored for decades to make effective. Acting alone today against the palpable evil of Saddam may set us on a course, charted by the newly announced doctrine of preemption, that will carry us beyond the limits of our power and our wisdom.  For these reasons, I will vote against the Lieberman-Warner resolution granting the President the permission to take unilateral military action against Iraq regardless of the immediacy of the threat. And I will support the resolution proposed by Senator Levin.  The Levin resolution recognizes the inherent right of the President to use our military forces to defend the United States. This resolution supports the President's demands that the United Nations promulgate a tough, new framework of inspections to disarm Iraq, and this resolution gives the President the right to use American military forces to enforce the resolve of the United Nations. The Levin resolution recognizes Congress' responsibility to promptly consider the President's request to unilaterally employ American forces if the United Nations fails to take effective action.  On Monday in Cincinnati, President Bush said, ``Later this week the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked the Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands.'' That is what the Levin resolution provides.  Those who advocate unilateral action assume that time has run out in dealing with Iraq. They see an immediate threat that will yield only to immediate military action. Thus, it is important to assess the Iraqi threat as best we can.  Iraqi conventional forces have been seriously degraded since the Gulf War. Saddam does have a cadre of Republican Guards that are capable and fought with determination in the Gulf War. One cannot totally discount Iraq's conventional forces, but they are not capable of defeating United States forces. The most dangerous aspect of Saddam's military power is the possession of chemical and biological weapons and his aspiration to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.  Today, Iraq has the capability to use chemical and biological weapons within the region to augment conventional forces that have been seriously degraded since the Gulf War. These capabilities, however, must be viewed in terms of intentions in order to fully evaluate the threat  An assessment of Iraq intentions reveals areas of consensus and areas of disagreement. It seems clear that Saddam is intent on rebuilding his military and acquiring weapons of mass destruction including nuclear devices. His expulsion of U.N. inspectors certainly supports this view. Moreover, it may suggest that the inspectors posed a very difficult obstacle to his plans and their future utility cannot be summarily dismissed. Saddam continues to aspire to be a regional power. Unchecked, Saddam would threaten his neighbors and endeavor to claim the mantel of leadership in the Gulf and, perhaps, in the greater Muslim world.  There is, however, a lack of consensus on two significant points. Will Saddam risk the survival of his regime by threatening or conducting attacks on his neighbors? Will Saddam provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups who can or will use them against the United States or any other nation?  At the heart of discussions of Saddam's possible plans is the general question of whether deterrence and containment will work against Iraq as it did in the Cold War. Saddam certainly has a lot to lose in any conflict with the United States. Both his life and his lifestyle would be in great jeopardy. Saddam also seems to be devoid of any ideology other than self-preservation and self-aggrandizement. Saddam is a secular thug, not a messianic leader. There is evidence that he will not put his regime at risk. During the Gulf war, the United States clearly signaled that any use of Iraq of chemical or biological weapons against Coalition forces would result in his destruction. Saddam accepted a humiliating defeat rather than risk losing power.  Of course, there are many who accurately point out that Saddam has already attacked his neighbors, Iran and Kuwait. He has used chemical weapons against the Iranians and the Kurds. Still, one is left with the question whether even this despicable behavior is a product of calculation rather than delusion.  And complicating the record of his actions against Iran is mounting evidence of our covert support both before and after he had begun to employ chemical weapons.  The second issues involves Saddam's willingness and ability to cooperate with terrorists. After September 11, this issue takes on a new and powerful emphasis. Despite extraordinary and justifiable efforts to establish a connection between the Iraqi regime and the attacks on New York City and the Pentagon and the downed aircraft in Pennsylvania, no such links have been established. Indeed, if credible links exist, the President, in my view, could employ unilateral force under the terms of the congressional resolution passed on September 14, 2001.  Recently, however, administration officials are publicly, but cryptically, trying to make the case that there is a definite connection between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaida. Secretary Rumsfeld and Condolezza Rice have asserted at various times that Iraq is harboring al-Qaida fighters in Iraq, that information from detainees indicates that Iraq provided chem-bio weapons training to al-Qaida, and that senior-level contacts between the Iraq regime and al-Qaida have increased since 1998. They have offered few details beyond Secretary Rumsfeld's claims that the information is ``factual,'' extremely accurate'' and ``bulletproof.''  But according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, these claims are disputed by ``a growing number of military officers, intelligence professionals and diplomats.'' The article quotes an unnamed official declaring:       analysts at the working level in the intelligence community      are feeling very strong pressure from the Pentagon to cook      the intelligence books.  The Inquirer article examined some of these administration claims and found that ``the facts are much less conclusive.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows:             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 8, 2002]                 Officials' Private Doubts on Iraq War      (By Warren P. Strobel, Jonathan S. Landay and John Walcott)       Washington.--While President Bush marshals congressional      and international support for invading Iraq, a growing number      of military officers, intelligence professionals and      diplomats in his own government privately have deep      misgivings about the administration's double-time march      toward war.       These officials say administration hawks have exaggerated      evidence of the threat that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein      poses, including distorting his links to the al-Qaeda      terrorist network; have overstated the amount of      international support for attacking Iraq; and have downplayed      the potential repercussions of a new war in the Middle East.       They say that the administration squelches dissenting views      and that intelligence analysts are under intense pressure to      produce     reports supporting the White House's argument that Hussein      poses such an immediate threat to the United States that      preemptive military action is necessary.       ``Analysts at the working level in the intelligence      community are feeling very strong pressure from the Pentagon      to cook the intelligence books,'' said one official, speaking      on condition of anonymity.       A dozen other officials echoed his views in interviews with      the Inquirer Washington Bureau. No one who was interviewed      disagreed.       They cited recent suggestions by Defense Secretary Donald      H. Rumsfeld and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice      that Hussein and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network working      together.       Rumsfeld said Sept. 26 that the U.S. government had      ``bulletproof'' confirmation of links between Iraq and al-     Qaeda members, including ``solid evidence'' that members of      the terrorist network maintained a presence in Iraq.       The facts are much less conclusive. Officials said      Rumsfeld's statement was based in part on intercepted      telephone calls in which an al-Qaeda member who apparently      was passing through Baghdad was overheard calling friends or      relatives, intelligence officials said. the intercepts      provide no evidence that the suspected terrorist was working      with the Iraqi regime or that he was working on a terrorist      operation while he was in Iraq, they said.       Rumsfeld also suggested that the Iraqi regime had offered      safe haven to bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed      Omar.       While technically true, that, too, is misleading.      Intelligence reports said the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, a      longtime Iraqi intelligence officer, made the offer during a      visit to Afghanistan in late 1998, after the United States      attacked al-Qaeda training camps with cruise missiles to      retaliate for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and      Tanzania. But officials said the same intelligence reports      said bin Laden rejected the offer because he did not want      Hussein to control his group.       In fact, the officials said, there is no ironclad evidence      that the Iraqi regime and the terrorist network are working      together, or that Hussein has ever contemplated giving      chemical or biological weapons to al-Qaeda, with whom he has      deep ideological differences.       None of the dissenting officials, who work in a number of      different agencies, would agree to speak publicly, out of      fear of retribution. Many of them have long experience in the      Middle East and South Asia, and all spoke in similar terms      about their unease with the way that U.S. political leaders      were dealing with Iraq.       All agreed that Hussein was a threat who eventually must be      dealt with, and none flatly opposed military action. But,      they say, that U.S. government has no dramatic new knowledge      about the Iraqi leader that justifies Bush's urgent call to      arms.       Some lawmakers have voiced similar concerns after receiving      CIA briefings. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D., Ill.) said some      information he had seen did not support Bush's portrayal of      the Iraqi threat. ``It's troubling to have classified      information that contradicts statements made by the      administration,'' Durbin said. ``There's more they should      share with the public.''       Several administration and intelligence officials defended      CIA Director George Tenet, saying Tenet was not pressuring      his analysts but was quietly working to include dissenting      opinions in intelligence estimates and congressional      briefings.       In one case, a senior administration official said, Tenet      made sure that a State Department official told Congress that      the Energy and State Departments disagreed with an      intelligence assessment that said hundreds of aluminum tubes      Iraq tried to purchase were intended for Baghdad's secret      nuclear-weapons program. Analysts in both departments      concluded that the Iraqis probably wanted the tubes to make      conventional artillery pieces.       Other examples of questionable statements include: Vice      President Cheney said in late August that Iraq might have      nuclear weapons ``fairly soon.'' A CIA report released Friday      said it could take Iraq until the last half of the decade to      produce a nuclear weapon, unless it could acquire bomb-grade      uranium or plutonium on the black market.       Also in August, Rumsfeld suggested that al-Qaeda operatives      fleeing Afghanistan were taking refuge in Iraq with Hussein's      assistance. ``In a vicious, repressive dictatorship that      exercises near-total control over its population, it's very      hard to imagine that the government is not aware of what's      taking place in the country,'' he said. Rumsfeld apparently      was referring to about 150 members of the militant Islamic      group Ansar al Islam (``Supporters of Islam'') who have taken      refuge in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. However, one of      America's would-be Kurdish allies controls that part of this      country, not Hussein.
