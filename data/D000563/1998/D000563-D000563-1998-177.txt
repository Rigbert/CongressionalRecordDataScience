President, with every right in America, there is a responsibility, even with the second amendment right to bear arms. Every gun owner has a responsibility to store his gun safely.  What I find interesting about the argument from the Senator from Idaho is that when I speak to responsible gun owners across America, the first thing they tell me is, ``Senator, I do not want any of my guns to harm any of my children or anyone else's children or any innocent person. I understand I have a responsibility to store them safely.''  The Senator from Idaho is arguing that gun owners have no responsibility and should have no responsibility under the law to store their guns safely.  That is not a fair standard. The overwhelming majority of the American people may support an individual's right to own a gun, but the overwhelming majority of the American people also understand that right carries a responsibility to protect innocent children. The fact that there has not been an enforcement action in 15 States where the laws are on the books should be heartening to the Senator from Idaho, and not discouraging, because in those same States that have passed laws just like this, the number of accidents involving firearms with children have gone down over 20 percent.  We can save children's lives with this amendment by saying to gun owners: ``Take this issue responsibly.'' Let us send America's kids back to school safely, schools that are gun free and violence free, and let the parents of those kids realize they have a responsibility, if they are gun owners, to store their guns safely so their children cannot get their hands on them and hurt themselves or others.  I yield the remainder of my time.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
