Opponents of the PATRIOT Act have repeatedly pointed to the Brandon Mayfield case as an example of abuse of the act. Members of Congress asked the DOJ Inspector General to examine whether the PATRIOT Act was abused in this case. On January 6, 2006, the Inspector General concluded: ``We do not find any evidence that the FBI misused any of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act in conducting its investigation of Mayfield.''  Even though no credible evidence of abuse of the PATRIOT Act has been received by Congress, the conference report adopted over 30 new additional civil liberty protections to address concerns about the potential for misuse. For example, the conference report contained several new reporting requirements that will provide additional information for congressional oversight of the act. These provisions establish specific procedures to consult legal counsel and seek judicial review for those wishing to challenge the national security letter or a section 215 order, two of the authorities most criticized by opponents.  Additionally, the conference report increases accountability by requiring the FBI director, deputy director, or executive assistant director to authorize applications that request the FISA court to issue a section 215 order for certain records, including library records, medical records, educational record and tax return records. The conference report also requires public reporting of the aggregate use of section 215 orders.  Because time does not permit me to detail all of the civil liberty protections contained in the conference report, the following list details each of those safeguards.  Additional Civil Liberties Protections Contained in the Conference Report on H.R. 3199, the ``USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization                              Act of 2005''       The conference report contains the following additional      safeguards:       Requires a description of a specific target in both the      application and the court order for ``roving wiretaps,'' and      specific facts in the application that show that the target's      actions may thwart surveillance efforts--if the target's true      identity is unknown.       Requires that the FBI must notify the court within 10 days      after beginning surveillance of any new phone for all      ``roving wiretaps.'' The notice must include the total number      of electronic surveillances conducted under the court's      multipoint order.       Includes new reporting requirements to Congress, including      new details about the use of ``roving'' authority.       Requires that for delayed notice search warrants that      notice of the search be given within 30 days of its      execution, unless the facts justify a later date, eliminating      the open-ended period of delay permissible under current law.       Allows for extensions of the delay period in giving notice      of a search, but only upon an updated showing of the need for      further delay. Also, it limits any extension to 90 days or      less, unless the facts of the case justify a longer delay.       Adds new reporting requirements to Congress on the use of      delayed notice search warrants.       Requires for section 215 orders, relating to investigator's      access to business records, a statement of facts showing      reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other      things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation to      protect against international terrorism or espionage. This      provides additional safeguards to the original USA PATRIOT      Act, which required the government only to certify that the      records at issue were sought for an authorized      investigation--without any factual showing.       Requires a three part test for section 215 orders that      ensures the records are sought for: a foreign power or an      agent of a foreign power; the activities of a suspected agent      of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized      investigation; or an individual in contact with, or known to,      a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an      authorized investigation. This test combined with the newly      required statement of facts should mitigate concerns of      government ``fishing expeditions,'' while maintaining the      flexibility for legitimate terrorism investigations.       Explicitly guarantees the right for recipients of section      215 orders to consult legal counsel and seek judicial review.       Requires high level approval by either the FBI Director,      Deputy Director, or Executive Assistant Director for requests      for certain records, including library records, medical      records, educational records, and tax return records.       Limits the scope of section 215 orders to materials that      could be obtained via grand jury subpoena or a similar court      order for the production of records.       Limits retention, and prohibits dissemination, of      information concerning U.S. persons.       Requires that the DOJ Inspector General conduct two      separate audits of the FBI's use of section 215 orders that      will examine: any noteworthy facts or circumstances relating      to 215 orders, including any improper or illegal use of the      authority; the manner in which such information is collected,      retained, analyzed, and disseminated by the FBI; and an      assessment of whether the minimization procedures protect the      constitutional rights of United States persons.       Requires enhanced reporting to Congress of section 215      orders, including a breakdown of its use to obtain library      records, medical records, educational records, and other      sensitive types of records.       Requires public reporting of the aggregate use of section      215 orders.       Allows recipients of National Security Letters (NSLs) to      consult with legal counsel.       Creates an explicit right to judicial review of NSL      requests.       Permits a reviewing court to modify or set aside an NSL if      compliance would be unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise      unlawful--this is the same standard used to modify or quash a      subpoena in a criminal case.       Provides for judicial review of the nondisclosure      requirements.       Adds a ``knowing and willfully'' standard that must be      proven before someone who discloses an NSL can be subject to      a 1-year misdemeanor offense.       Requires the DOJ IG to conduct two comprehensive audits of      the FBI's use of NSLs.       Requires the Attorney General and the Director of National      Intelligence to submit to Congress a report on the      feasibility of applying minimization procedures to NSLs to      ensure the protection of constitutional rights of U.S.      persons.       Adds a new ``sunshine'' provision that requires annual      public reporting on NSLs.       Provides for expanded congressional access to significant      FISA reporting currently provided to the Intelligence      Committees.       Includes a provision requiring the FISA Court to submit its      rules and procedures to Congress.       Creates new reporting requirements for the use of emergency      authorities under FISA.       Requires new reporting on the use of emergency disclosures      of communications information made under section 212 of the      USA PATRIOT Act.       Requires the Department of Justice to submit a report to      Congress on the Department's data-mining activities.
