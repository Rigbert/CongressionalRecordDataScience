President, on July 4, our Nation will celebrate the 42nd anniversary of the signing of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. While we mark this important anniversary, the country also celebrates the enactment earlier this year of the first major reforms to FOIA in over a decade--the OPEN Government Act--which will reinvigorate and strengthen this vital open government law for many years to come.  Now in its fourth decade, the Freedom of Information Act remains an indispensable tool for shedding light on bad policies and Government abuses.The act has helped to guarantee the public's ``right to know'' for generations of Americans. Today, thanks to the reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act, which was signed into law on December 31, Americans who seek information under FIOA will experience a process that is much more transparent and less burdened by delays than it has been in the past. This is very good news. But there is still much more to be done to ensure that FOIA remains an effective tool for keeping our democracy open and free.  A key component of the OPEN Government Act is the creation of an Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, within the National Archives and Records Administration. The office would mediate FOIA disputes, review agency compliance with FOIA, and house a newly created FOIA ombudsman. Establishing a fully funded OGIS is essential to reversing the troubling trend of the last 7 years towards lax FOIA compliance and excessive Government secrecy.  I am pleased that the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies--a panel on which I serve--last week rejected the President's budget proposal to move the functions of OGIS to the Department of Justice. I will continue to work very hard to ensure that OGIS is fully funded within the National Archives--as Congress intended--so that this important office has the necessary resources to fully comply with the OPEN Government Act.  There is also more work to be done to further strengthen FOIA. Earlier this year, I was pleased to join with Senator John Cornyn in introducing the OPEN FOIA Act, S. 2746, a bill that requires Congress to clearly and explicitly state its intention to create a statutory exemption to FOIA when it provides for such an exemption in new legislation. While there is a very real need to keep certain Government information secret to ensure the public good and safety, excessive Government secrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant democracy.  The OPEN FOIA Act provides a safeguard against the growing trend towards FOIA exemptions, and would make all FOIA exemptions clear and unambiguous, and vigorously debated, before they are enacted into law. The Senate Judiciary Committee will consider this bill at its business meeting this week, and I urge all members to support this legislation to further restore the public's trust in their Government.  As we reflect upon the celebration of another FOIA anniversary, we in Congress must also reaffirm our commitment to open and transparent government. As I have said many times, open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American value and a virtue that all Americans hold dear. It is in this bipartisan spirit that I join Americans from across the political spectrum in celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the birth of FOIA and all that this law has come to symbolize about our vibrant democracy.                          ____________________
