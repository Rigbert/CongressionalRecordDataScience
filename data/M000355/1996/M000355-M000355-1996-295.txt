 President, after 2\1/2\ years of inexplicable delay, on January 19, 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] issued final regulations concerning tobacco sales to minors for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA].  These SAMHSA regulations implement the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Block Grants [ADAMHA] Reauthorization Act of 1992, which required States to prohibit the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors, take steps to enforce that prohibition and report annually to HHS, or lose Federal substance abuse block grants. While HHS dallied over the final SAMSHA regulations, the Food and Drug Administration--itself an arm of HHS--proposed a highly intrusive new set of regulations governing tobacco sales, distribution, labeling, advertising, and marketing.  I support the approach taken by the SAMSHA regulations. As Congress specifically required in the ADAMHA Reauthorization Act, the SAMSHA regulations give States the maximum degree of flexibility while ensuring that States do in fact take strong steps to stop the sale of tobacco products to minors. The SAMSHA regulations will accomplish the same goal that FDA professes to want--reducing the use of tobacco by minors--in a shorter time for less money and with much less Government interference.  The Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation in 1994 to address ADAMHA compliance. As an example, the State Department of Agriculture, with assistance from local law enforcement officials, must conduct random, unannounced inspections. Persons under the age of 18 may be enlisted to test compliance, provided that parental consent has been given. Kentucky has also established sign requirements, license requirements, and vending machine restrictions.  Mr. President, I represent 60,000 hard-working tobacco farm families and thousands of hard-working individuals who are involved in the manufacturing and retail of tobacco products. Under the SAMSHA regulations, tobacco growers and others involved in the tobacco industry can rest assured that they will not be subjected to excessive government interference. States where tobacco is grown will be free to craft laws that take into account the needs and interests of tobacco growers. Tobacco growers will not be treated as the enemy. On the other hand, FDA's proposed regulations would treat nicotine as an addictive drug and position the FDA to march on every tobacco farm in the United States. FDA's proposal is unacceptable.  Tobacco already is one of the most heavily regulated products in the United States. More than a dozen Federal agencies have jurisdiction over some aspect of tobacco production, sales, or advertising. In light of this fact, Congress authorized SAMSHA not to imposed sweeping Federal tobacco regulations, but instead to encourage States to prevent youth access to tobacco.  Mr. President, I strongly believe that minors should not use or purchase tobacco products. I also believe the most effective way to prevent minors from using or purchasing tobacco products lies in the strict enforcement of laws already in effect in each of the 50 States. A new Federal bureaucracy, as proposed by the President and FDA, is not needed. In 1992, Congress made a bipartisan decision that State officials, not a Federal agency, were best suited to deal with the problem of underage tobacco use. The SAMSHA regulations are a constructive, constitutionally appropriate and cost-effective way to deal with underage tobacco use. The SAMSHA regulations take the right approach. FDA's approach is wrong, excessive, costly, and unnecessary.                          ____________________
