Speaker, I want to say a word about Amtrak. I represent the largest passenger terminal in Ohio, and it has been amazing to me to watch under this administration's purview how service has been cut back. I travel around the world, and I ride trains that so far surpass anything that we have over land in this country. It is actually embarrassing. We talk about a stimulus package. What about high-speed rail? Why has it taken us as a country to this point in the 21st century where we have an antiquated system that needs new stimulus, that needs new investment, coast-to-coast, in order to meet all of the congestion problems we have at our airports; to provide a real, third rail, one might say over the road, in the air, and over land, not counting the sea ways, but to take a look at our rail system and the investment that is needed in it, and to think that we are cutting back to allow Wall Street to put our investment in China or Mexico or somewhere else.  Mr. DeFAZIO. China is building a huge and very expensive multibillion dollar new high-speed rail system, probably with some U.S. investment behind it.
