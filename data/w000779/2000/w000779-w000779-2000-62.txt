President, I thank Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl for accepting this important amendment to S. 2536, the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001.  According to the USDA, Oregon ranks first in hunger and seventh in food insecurity in the nation. This amendment will fund, at $176,000, a demonstration project pairing technology and teamwork: The Food Electronically and Effectively Distributed FEED Website Demonstration Project.  As the only state in the nation with a statewide food bank system in place, the Oregon Food Bank, as well as an organized and active agricultural community, Oregon is prepared to develop and use the FEED website to provide a national model for other states interested in pursuing an organized statewide anti-hunger campaign.  Developed and used in conjunction with Oregon food producers, processors, distributors, transporters, and anti-hunger agents, as well as the UDA and state agriculture extension agents the FEED website will transform the current anti-hunger food distribution network by using the power of Internet technology to support and facilitate real-time communication links between those with food, those who need food and those who can transport food.  The FEED website will also provide a forum for sharing information about innovative anti-hunger efforts, both legislative and organizational, as well as links to other existing government, non-profit, and anti-hunger web sites to increase information sharing between active organizations and people in need.                           amendment no. 3991 (Purpose: To increase the Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing income                                 limits)       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:       ``Sec.   .
