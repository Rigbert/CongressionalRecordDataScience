 President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate what I believe to be a building environmental crisis in southern California, and that has to do with the Salton Sea. Let me begin by telling you what the Salton Sea is. The modern day Salton Sea is often referred to as the largest manmade water body in California. It was formed in late 1905 as a result of a break in a temporary levy along the Colorado River. For a period of about 16 months after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into the below-sea-level depression then known as the ``Salton sink,'' filling it to a depth of more than 80 feet above its lowest elevation. Since that time, the water level in the sea has been seeking a balance between desert forces that extract water as a product of evaporation and the inflows of water from surface and subsurface sources. The Salton Sea is about 350 square miles. It is 35 miles long, it has 115 miles of shoreline, and it is 15 miles wide. It is a big body of water. Today, the depth is about 51 feet, and I believe it is about 234 feet below sea level.  This lake was originally a freshwater lake. It is now dying because of a confluence of events. It is the combination of the rising salinity levels caused by the evaporation I just mentioned--and the body of water is now 25 percent saltier than the ocean--plus major disease outbreaks and other up to this point identified as unknown causes that scientists believe are linked to millions of gallons of polluted agricultural drainage as well as chemical wastes coming out of Mexicali. Now, these wastes flow from the Alamo and the New Rivers, which go from Mexico, flow north, and empty into this huge body of water. The body of water is best known as being between Palm Springs and the Mexican border. It is near the areas we considered for the Desert Protection Act, and originally it was hoped that it would be a major recreation area. As a matter of fact, it was hoped that about $500 million a year in revenues would be produced because of recreational and job opportunities. Instead, it is now just a dreadful situation.  The two rivers I just mentioned, the New River and Alamo River, accountfor about 78 percent of the water replenishment of the Salton Sea. The Whitewater River on the northern end also dumps agricultural runoff into the Salton Sea. I first visited the area in 1990 when I was in El Centro. I remember going to the banks of the New River and there were workers there, volunteers, picking up rubbish along the riverside. They had on elbow-high gloves. I asked the question, ``Why do you wear these gloves?'' They told me that even above the gloves they would get blisters when they worked around the area. So in 1990 something was going on. It has gotten a lot worse since then.  In 1996, pathogenic micro-organisms were identified in the sea's environment, and that includes the New River. Among them were the organisms capable of causing polio, typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. Also, concerns about public health from disease-causing agents have resulted in the issuance of public health advisories warning of the dangers of eating fish caught in the sea.  Because of its diverse ecosystem, the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge has been ranked among the top 10 of our Nation's 510 national refuges. It is of critical importance to the western region because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and Mexico. It is a key component in the Pacific flyway for millions of migratory water birds that rest at that refuge on their annual journeys to and from Canada and South America. So birds that touch down there may well also be dying elsewhere. However, an increased frequency and severity of massive die-offs of thousands of waterfowl and shore birds and millions of fish have been occurring in the Salton Sea in recent years, and it's threatening the existence now of the entire regional ecosystem.  The size of the calamity is mind-boggling. The mortality toll includes birds from every one of the species that visit the sea, including the endangered California brown pelican, with which I happen to be particularly enamored.  The degradation of the Salton Sea ecosystem is also taking a toll on the economy of the surrounding area, and we have seen economic values drop off precipitously. There are some who believe it is too late to save the Salton Sea because the problems are too complex and too large. I don't share that point of view, and I am asking this body's support for increased efforts to address the sea's problems to prevent further degradation of this environmentally rich ecosystem and to preserve it for all time.  Let me quickly mention a brief chronology of happenings. In 1992, more than 150,000 waterfowl, known as eared grebes, died from an undiagnosed cause. In 1996, a severe botulism outbreak killed more than 15,000 birds, including more than 1,400 endangered brown pelicans. About 15 percent of the western race of the North American white pelican have perished in the last 2 years. That is 15 percent of the entire white pelican population of the west coast.  Earlier this year, an outbreak of Newcastle disease decimated an entire nesting colony of nearly 2,000 double-crested cormorants. The destruction of the cormorant nesting colony on a small island less than 100 yards long, which had been popular with the birds, shows how quickly death comes in this area. One week the island was alive with the sounds and sights of hundreds of nesting waterfowl, of eggs hatching and new fledglings checking out their surroundings. The next week they were all dead, every one of them. Today, all that is left are the skeletal remains and the rotting carcasses that dot the island. It is a macabre, tragic scene, as I think some of these photos begin to show. This is a bird skeleton in a nest. Right here you can see one of the bird skeletons and a baby carcass in the sand with a nearby pen, just to show you the size. There are just a few in this photo, but they dot the whole landscape.  The birds died in their nests or where they collapsed in the sand, unable to fly or walk. So the scenes you see are depicted all over the island. Two of my staff members visited the Salton Sea recently--just a couple of weeks ago--and had to carefully pick their steps in order to avoid stepping on dead birds.  Equally tragic is the sight of birds stricken with botulism which affects the nervous system. First they lose their ability to fly, and then the ability to stand upright or walk. Lastly, as the deadly disease progresses they become completely paralyzed and can no longer raise their heads, and they drown or they die of starvation.  So the task of rescuing sick and dying birds and cleaning up the endless stream of carcasses is being handled by dedicated men and women of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in Imperial County. I have the utmost respect for their work.  Since last March, they have been bringing in boatloads--often three times a week--of stricken birds and carcasses of the dead that have been picked up throughout the sea. The death toll as of October 22 for this year stood at 6,792 birds, including 234 endangered California brown pelicans. The White pelican held by refuge worker, Marcos Orozco, rescued a week or so ago, and the other sick birds in the boat may have a chance to survive. They are the lucky ones who will undergo emergency treatment at the refuge's recently completed hospital in an attempt to stabilize them until they can be transferred to a volunteer organization's rehab facility in Orange County. If successful there they will be released back to the wild.  Let's talk about the brown pelican that you see dead in this photograph. And you see part of the Salton Sea here with this small island and vastness behind it. Last year more than 1,400 of these birds perished in the waters and on the mud flats of the sea. For refugee worker Orozco, it was the first time in his 26-year career at the Salton Sea that he had seen a die-off of brown pelicans. However, the deaths are continuing, and the prospects are not good.  ``It is not a pretty sight,'' notes refuge manager Clark Bloom who has observed grown persons breaking down and crying when they witnessed the sick and dying birds.  My big concern here is that not enough is being done. And I am almost as sure as I am standing here that it is only a question of time before some of these micro-organisms also begin to impact people as well. Right now it is birds. But if it were people, I think the shouts would be deafening.  And it is hard for me to imagine what 1 million dead fish floating on the surface of this lake must look like. But for Ken Sturm, the wildlife biologist at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, the scene is one he will not forget.  He reported that the lifeless mass of Tilapia, a popular sport fish which he observed at the northern end of the sea, extended more than 3 miles in length. That was on September 8, about 6 weeks ago. But that isn't the beginning nor the end. On September 24, another floating mass of at least 1,000 dead fish was spotted at the southern end of the refuge.  Scenes like this are commonplace along many shoreline areas, and in much larger numbers, I am sorry to say. A parasite which affects the gills of the fish is a prime suspect in some of the fish die-offs, but more scientific research is needed to pinpoint the exact cause.  Another suspect which some experts believe could trigger conditions leading to the fish kills is a purplish algae like that shown in this photo. It doesn't look like much. But they believe it is a potentially deadly algae. I would hazard a guess that it probably comes from some chemical waste.  There are some bright spots.  The first, of course, is the staff of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. They have been doing a truly commendable job. However, they need additional resources, including boats and personnel, in order to respond adequately.  Also, the Pacific wildlife project in Orange County, a volunteer group, deserves commendation. Ninety percent of the birds that are rescued would have perished without their care.  Also noteworthy is the fact that private groups, agencies, and businesses in the area have contributed to date more than $60,000 this year in cash and services to finance construction of a field hospital for sick birds at the Federal refuge. Whether the sick white pelicans in the refuge that you see in the photo here make it or not is unknown. They have just been brought in from the sea and given emergencytreatment, and we will see if they survive.  While these efforts are underway, the Federal Government and others are analyzing projects for restoration of the Salton Sea. This is where it gets very complicated.  The Bureau of Reclamation in September of this year issued its final draft on the Salton Sea which evaluated 54 alternatives to improve the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the sea. Five of those alternatives will be now considered further. The problem is no one agrees.  The recently enacted 1998 Energy and Water appropriations bill includes $400,000 for the Bureau of Reclamation to continue its research project.  The conference report in the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill includes $6 million in the EPA's budget for continued research on the Salton Sea--now you are beginning to see the number of agencies that are coming into this--including $1 million for the University of Redlands and $5 million for the Salton Sea Authority.  I have written letters, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.     Hon. Franklin Raines,     Director, Office of Management and Budget,     Washington, DC.       Dear Director Raines: As you prepare the Administration's      budget for Fiscal Year 1999, I would like to bring to your      attention the need to provide $2 million to address the      environmental calamity which has struck the Salton Sea      ecosystem in Southern California.       Disease outbreaks of catastrophic proportions have hit the      bird and fish populations at the inland lake which is a major      element of the migratory Pacific Flyway where some 49 bird      species are found. Unless corrective action is taken, experts      predict even more dire consequence which would mean the      destruction of the Sea's ecosystem within a decade, or      sooner.       In order to deal with the immediate crisis and to formulate      actions needed to restore the Salton Sea ecosystem, the Fish      and Wildlife Service had identified a number of programs,      actions and equipment components in need of funding in Fiscal      Year 1999. They are summarized as follows:       $1 million for operational support at the Salton Sea      National Wildlife Refuge to include $119,000 for four full-     time equivalent employees (16 persons for a four month      period) to pick up dead, sick or dying birds, and for      sampling work; $25,000 for equipment and supplies, $88,000      for purchase of more cages, wildlife medical supplies and      equipment for a field hospital and rehabilitation center;      $40,000 for a new incinerator for disposal of dead wildlife      and to meet air quality standards; $125,000 for assignment of      a full-time science coordinator and one support person to the      Salton Sea to orchestrate the implementation of scientific      studies and associate field operations; $350,000 for modular      facilities for research and support staff to work on site;      $60,000 for purchase of two new air boats for field      operations; $40,000 for equipment maintenance that supports      operations such as vehicles and boat repairs and minor      equipment replacement; $183,000 for a short-term study to      provide information on how to understand factor driving the      current pelican/fish die-offs and methods for eliminating the      kills.       $1 million for a Salton Sea Response Plan to included      $525,000 for hiring a team leader and assemble a interagency      team and to pay for consultant contracts; $115,000 for      miscellaneous office equipment rental or purchase; $125,000      for technical assistance contracts, such as a contract with      the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians to identify      Native American sites within the study area; $100,000 for      rental of temporary work space for team members; $85,000 for      conducting public scoping workshops, and $50,000 for printing      of a final plan.       The catastrophic degradation of the Salton Sea ecosystem      has helped to focus national and local attention to the      problem, providing considerable momentum among various      agencies, interest groups and the public for addressing the      problem. The funding needs cited above are critical in      getting a start on restoration of the Salton Sea ecosystem      and preventing a recurrence of the devastation that has taken      such a heavy toll of waterfowl and fish. Therefore, I      respectfully request your cooperation in providing the $2      million for the Fish and Wildlife in the Fiscal Year 1999      budget request. Because of initiatives underway to further      identify critically needed scientific research associated      with restoration of the Salton Sea, additional funding      proposals will be brought to your attention as soon as they      are identified.       Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your      commitment to preserving our nation's precious natural      resources.       With warmest personal regards.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator.                                                                    ____         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter regarding      the Fish and Wildlife Service's request for funding for the      Salton Sea ecosystem restoration. I appreciate your bringing      this matter to my attention, since OMB has just begun to      review Administration budget proposals for Fiscal Year 1999.       In that process we have many important needs to address.      The information you provided will be helpful as we undertake      our evaluation of the Service's request. The Administration      will strive to fund as many important projects as possible      within the constraints of the Balanced Budget Agreement.       Thank you again for your interest in this matter. If I can      provide further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact      me.           Sincerely,                                               Franklin D. Raines,      Director.                                                                    ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,     Secretary, Department of the Interior,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to ask your assistance      regarding the environmental crisis at the Salton Sea in      Southern California where the die-off of waterfowl and fish      has reached catastrophic proportions.       Recent disease outbreaks in birds and fish at the Salton      Sea have brought local and national attention to the      degradation that is occurring to the ecosystem of this inland      lake which is a major stop for migratory water birds along      the Pacific Flyway. The scope of the devastation underscores      the need for immediate steps to save the Salton Sea and its      precious resources. Last year an outbreak of Newcastle      disease killed 14,000 birds, and the die-off is continuing      unabated. The bird mortality toll through September 15, for      example, was 6,293, including 182 endangered California brown      pelicans. Also, on September 8, a massive fish kill composed      of more than 1 million Tilipia extending over three miles in      length was observed by the biologist at the Salton Sea      National Wildlife Refuge.       Several major engineering projects have been proposed by      various interests, including the Salton Sea Authority and      Congressional representatives for addressing the      deterioration of the inland lake. However, because of the      complexity of the problems confronting the Salton Sea, I      agree with experts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and      others who stress the need to fully understand the ecosystem      and its problems before committing vast amounts of funds to      any single restoration project. In this regard, I believe it      is imperative that the report to Congress which the Bureau of      Reclamation is preparing on its findings and recommendations      for solving the Salton Sea's problems be completed as soon as      possible. I am hopeful that the bureau's report will contain      an action plan, and recommendations for funding of necessary      scientific studies associated with any proposed restoration      project.       In that regard I respectfully ask your assistance in      calling on federal agencies with responsibility in the Salton      Sea to review and re-prioritize their FY 98 work programs so      that research tasks which are deemed most critical for      implementation of restoration projects can begin as soon as      possible. Also, because the Salton Sea is an environmental      and economic resource of regional and national significance,      I strongly believe that the federal, state and local      governments all must share in the responsibility for saving      the Sea and in paying for its restoration.       In light of the environmental calamity which grips the      Salton Sea, and the need for immediate action to prevent      further degradation, I ask that you give your personal      attention to these matters. I have been informed that because      of limited staff and equipment, personnel to the Salton Sea      National Wildlife Refuge are hampered in their ability to      handle the rescue of waterfowl and in the cleanup and      disposal of dead birds. Therefore, I would appreciate your      consideration of what additional resources can be provided      for field operations at the Salton Sea to deal with the      massive die-off of birds and fish that is occurring there,      including reimbursement for the Pacific Wildlife Project for      the assistance in rehabilitation diseased birds. I believe it      is imperative that the federal agencies be given the      resources that they need to do the job and that wherever      possible, volunteer groups who have provided invaluable      service in rescuing and rehabilitating diseased birds, be      compensated for their expenses.       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. I am      committed to doing all that I can to ensure that the causes      of the environmental degradation of the Salton Sea are      identified and eliminated, and pledge to work with you to      make it a reality.       With warmest personal regards.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                                                         ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1997.     Hon. John M. Bernal,     Commissioner, International Boundary and Water Commission, El          Paso, TX.       Dear Commissioner Bernal: I am writing to ask your      assistance in providing a progress report on the cleanup of      the New River pollution and in determining how completion of      the improvement project can be expedited.       As you know, the cleanup of the New River is a critical      factor to the elimination of the environmental degradation of      the Salton Sea and the public health threat which the      pollution poses for residents of Imperial County and the      border region. Disease outbreaks among birds and fish at the      Salton Sea have brought local and national attention to the      degradation of the inland sea and the region's ecosystem.      Moreover, the mortality toll of fish and wildlife continues      to rise, and has served to heighten interests in finding      solutions that will result in the elimination of the complex      problems besetting the Salton Sea.       Because of the concerns cited above, I respectfully request      your assistance in providing a progress and status report on      the short term and long-term New River pollution cleanup      measures which the IBWC is overseeing. I have been informed      that while much progress has been nade on the package of 11      so-called ``quick fix'' projects, that, because of technical      and other reasons, the project has taken longer than expected      to complete. I would appreciate information on the expected      completion date for all of the improvements. Also of interest      is the status of the other major work on upgrading of the      Mexicali I wastewater treatment plant and construction of the      new Mexicali II treatment plant.       Because of the importance of these projects for reducing      New River pollution and other serious threats to the      environment and public health, I also ask that the IBWC, in      conjunction with its Mexico partners, do all that it can to      accelerate completion of the improvements and certification      by the Border Environment Cooperation Commission.       Thank you for your cooperation. I also pledge to assist in      any way possible so please do not hesitate to contact me in      that regard.       With warmest personal regards.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,                                                     U.S. Senator.
