 President, I remain very concerned about the continuing prevalence of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. The ongoing reports of the vast use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports, especially Major League Baseball, illustrate the presence of a disturbing culture throughout all sports. It is becoming all too common to read not only about professional athletes using performance-enhancing drugs, but also college and high school athletes turning to these substances to gain a competitive edge. Although Congress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act to disrupt this cycle of abuse in 2004, we cannot relent in our efforts to keep performance-enhancing drugs out of our society and away from our children.  The dietary supplement, Dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA, is readilyavailable online and on the shelves of nutritional stores, but can be used as a performance-enhancing substance. In response to the growing use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports, Congress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act in 2004. When this bill was being considered, DHEA was among 23 anabolic steroids that are now schedule III controlled substances. Some of my colleagues objected to DHEA being included on this list, because they believed DHEA was harmless and did not have the same anabolic effects as the other steroids on the list. DHEA was subsequently removed from the bill, but the facts do not back up the claims that DHEA is not a performance-enhancing drug or harmless.  According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, DHEA is a pre-cursor hormone to androstenedione and testosterone. These substances became illegal anabolic steroids as a result of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. Although the body naturally produces DHEA, the natural production of the hormone ceases around the age of 35. Many people over this age use DHEA, in low doses, as part of an ``anti-aging'' regimen. However, when taken in high doses over time, DHEA, like its other relatives in the steroid family, may cause liver damage and cancer. In fact, one study conducted by scientists at Oxford University revealed DHEA use to be strongly associated with breast cancer development. The truth is there are few studies about the long term effects DHEA has on the body. According to Dr. F. Clark Holmes, Director of Sports Medicine at Georgetown University, many proposed studies involving high doses of DHEA are denied approval out of concern that the product may cause irreversible harm to human subjects. Because DHEA is marketed as a dietary supplement, companies are not required to prove their safety to the Food and Drug Administration. However, nearly all the professional sports leagues, the Olympics and the NCAA have banned their athletes from using it for good reason.  What is even more disturbing is the fact that DHEA is being marketed online to younger athletes. One bodybuilding website, directed towards teenagers, features a teen bodybuilder of the week to promote performance-enhancing supplements. A 19-year-old Junior National Champion bodybuilder is one of the bodybuilders on this website. When asked what supplement gave him the greatest gains for his competition this teenager replied, ``DHEA.'' In another website, DHEA is advertized as follows, ``If you're a bodybuilder, and want to increase lean body mass at the expense of body fat, actual studies show this supplement may significantly alter body composition, favoring lean mass accrual.'' Another example on another website describes DHEA in this way, ``DHEA is HOT, and you will see why. As a pre-cursor hormone, it leads to the production of other hormones. When this compound is supplemented, it has shown to have awesome effects.'' These advertisements are geared to the younger crowd, even though DHEA has no legitimate use for teenagers.  These DHEA advertisements, and others like it, are having some impact on young athletes, especially in my state of Iowa. The Iowa Orthopaedic Journal published a study on nutritional supplement use in 20 Northwest Iowa high schools. In this study, 495 male football players and 407 female volleyball players were asked if they used nutritional supplements. The results of this anonymous survey revealed that 8 percent of football players and 2 percent of Volleyball players used supplements. These students identified DHEA as one of the supplements that they used. The students were then asked to give the reason why they used DHEA and the general response was ``for performance enhancement.''  We have to find a way to keep young people from using a substance that can do them harm. Three states currently prohibit the sale of DHEA to minors. There are also various supplement stores like GNC and Walgreens that have policies in place that prohibit the sale of DHEA to anyone under 18. If we cannot place DHEA behind the counter, then we should at least make it difficult for teens to walk out of a store with a potentially harmful substance in hand. This is why I'm pleased to introduce the DHEA Abuse Reduction Act of 2009. This bill will place a nationwide restriction on the sale of DHEA for those under 18 years of age. It will also allow those who use DHEA, legitimately, to not have to obtain a prescription to do so. The Coalition for Anabolic Steroid Precursor and Ephedra Regulation, which is comprised of the Nation's leading medical, public health and sports organizations support this legislation. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency also supports this legislation to keep DHEA away from our children. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.  In the highly competitive world of sports, the pressure to use performance-enhancing drugs can be overwhelming. Even though we, as a society, demand excellence from our favorite teams and athletes, we cannot accept this excellence to be falsely aided by a drug. Furthermore, we cannot allow harmful drugs to destroy the health of so many young and promising athletes. We have to continue to curb the use of performance-enhancing drugs for the health of our country and children.                                 ______                                       By
