Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. Again, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his help on this from the start. It was in December 2003 I called him at his home in Massachusetts and asked if he would like to co-author this with me. With that support came the support of then-Chairman Tauzin and the gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Dingell).  The four of us introduced this legislation. A week and a half before the Super Bowl, we had our first hearing, in fact, before the Super Bowl came about where it got a lot of publicity. I know all of us on the committee and subcommittee when we held hearings were absolutely disgusted with some of the trash that was said on the radio that was fined. I would like to use a different word than ``trash'' or ``stuff,'' but we would probably get fined for doing that on the House floor, and maybe our words would get taken down. I'm not sure. But it was awful, particularly knowing that kids were listening to that kind of talk.  It was a bipartisan effort. As I recall, I think we had a vote of 49-1 to get that legislation through. I think the bipartisan spirit we have had from the beginning, and I think our House bill was a little better than what the Senate has here in S. 193, but we need to get it done. That is why I was glad to work with the Senators on both sides of the aisle. And I would note this, not a single Senator, not a single one from any State, opposed the legislation that we are going to pass with this bill, S. 193.
