President, today, in the waning hours of this Congress, the Senate has passed legislation that will improve important parts of our intellectual property law. Sponsored by myself, as well as by Senators Hatch, Cornyn, Biden, and Feinstein, the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2004 is the product of many months of bipartisan effort. Many of its provisions have passed the Senate before, others have passed the House, and the package enjoys the well-justified support of the many stakeholders. I am especially grateful for the assistance and support of our colleagues in the House of Representatives as we have tried to craft a broad, consensus bill.  Intellectual property is one of the driving forces in our Nation's economy, but if we do not continue to protect it, we will lose our place as the global leader in its production. Just as importantly, the United States enjoys the fruits of the labors of a multitude of creative and talented artists and inventors. Our arts and sciences bring not only monetary revenue to the country, but deep artistic satisfaction and rewards on a cultural level. The Digital Age has great potential to bring more of each.  Digital technology has allowed producers of intellectual property to find new and innovative ways to create and distribute their products, and it has enhanced our position as a global leader in the creation of cultural and intellectual works. However, the ease of duplication and nearly instantaneous communication that make these technologies so wonderful has also been used by some to undermine intellectual property rights; as a result, many of our copyright-holders are reluctant to embrace the very tools that offer so much to consumers and, if used legally, to our innovators. Thus, we face a key challenge: to preserve intellectual property rights while at the same time promoting the growth of new technologies. This act responds to the challenge. It bolsters our intellectual property protections while preserving the freedom necessary to make full use of music, movies, and other entertainment. The act also takes important steps to preserve our Nation's rich cultural heritage, and to ensure that this heritage remains available to our children.  The act includes the version of the CREATE Act that has passed both the House and Senate. That bill corrects for a provision in the Bayh-Dole Act which, when read literally by the Court of Appeals for the Federal, runs counter to the intent of that legislation. The correction will encourage more of the joint efforts between private industry and research universities that have proved so fruitful to the U.S. economy, our research universities, and the many Americans who work in the patent industries.  It also includes a version of the National Film Preservation Act and the Preservation of Orphan Works Act. These two provisions each play an important role in preserving our national heritage. The National Film Preservation Act, which I first introduced on November 21, 2003, reauthorizes a Library of Congress program dedicated to saving rare and significant films. The Preservation of Orphan Works Act corrects a drafting error in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Correction of this error will allow libraries to create copies of certain copyrighted works, such as films and musical compositions that are in the last 20 years of their copyright term, are no longer commercially exploited, and are not available at a reasonable price.  The act also includes the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act, which protects filmmakers from an increasingly common threat: the theft of their work by individuals who record films as they are played in theaters. Part of that provision directs the Register of Copyrights to create a registry of pre-release works in order to better address the problems associated with piracy of creative works before they are offered for legal distribution and provides improved remedies for such piracy.  It also includes the Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004, an important piece of legislation that Senator Biden has championed for several years. This provision adds much-needed protections to those who create records, films, and computer programs, by expanding the prohibition on affixing counterfeit labels to such products. Another provision, the Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act, enhances the integrity of the Internet by creating a rebuttable presumption that a trademark or copyright infringer acted willfully if that infringer used false information to register a domain name used in connection with the infringement. It also increases penalties for crimes committed using fraudulently-acquired domain names.  Finally, the act includes the Family Movie Act, which will preserve the right of home viewers to watch motion pictures in the manner they see fit. At the same time, the act protects the rights of directors and copyright holders to maintain the artistic vision and integrity of their works.  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in both houses of Congress, for their hard work on this bill. Our efforts here should be a model for achieving legislative consensus in this area, and others, in the future.                          ____________________
