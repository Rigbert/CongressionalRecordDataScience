Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation that we hopefully will pass in the next few minutes is very important. It clearly, I think, would have saved the lives of those folks that were taken, and it reflects the hard work of our committee on a bipartisan basis.  From the very start, the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee went to work. It got to the bottom of a very tragic situation that impacted some 20 States, hundreds and hundreds of people, and we've changed that system now. Because of their work and their investigation, we came back and moved legislation through the proper channels, regular order, through the Health Subcommittee and through our committee. We worked very closely with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to craft this bill that would have stopped this awful thing that happened a year ago.  Congress does work and can work when we work together, and I am proud of this product. I am proud of this legislation. I urge the Senate to take it up in the next day or two so we can, in fact, get it to the President's desk, and I thank every Member who worked so hard.  We saw today certainly the personal impact on all of our districts and on the Members themselves. Many of us, in fact, did know folks directly impacted not only through death, but also those who were impacted because of the impact on their own lives as they still try to recuperate and survive. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  I yield back the balance of my time.
