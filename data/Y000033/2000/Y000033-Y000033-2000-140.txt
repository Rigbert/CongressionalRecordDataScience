Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this has been a long process, and I agree with the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) that this was really instigated by the beginning of CARA legislation when it put in those millions of dollars in the Fish and Wildlife Service. That is why I instigated the investigation.  I want to thank my staff, Duane Gibson, who has worked very hard on this measure, and especially Christina Delmont-Small. For the record, she is now a Small instead of Delmont. She is on her honeymoon today and she cannot be here to actually enjoy the success of 2 years.  But this issue is one, and I said after the hearings that the GAO reported to us, that this is not about who is present and what happened because of those people involved, not individually, but because the agency itself, beginning in 1990, and the acceleration of the expenditures of monies. We believe there was a tremendous amount of money that was spent very frankly illegally. Of those people that voluntarily established the Dingell-Johnson and the Pittman-Robertson fund that voluntarily putting into that every day thinking as they buy a fishing rod or a package of ammunition or a firearm or a bow, that it was going into reestablishing State programs on the State level so that they could have fish and wildlife not only to view but to hunt and fish, and we find that the money is being misspent.  So what we are trying to do through this legislation, and even with the Senate provisions in it, is we have tried to say, okay, forget who has done it. Let us make sure it does not happen in the future. And we believe this has been done in this legislation, and we are strongly supportive of it. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation with a good aye vote.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
