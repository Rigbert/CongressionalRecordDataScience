 This is the report. It is a final report. It was done in March 2003, so it has been circulated for a few months.  Additionally, our legislation has the support of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have kept in touch with him so he is aware of what is in the report, and, of course, the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and former ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar.
