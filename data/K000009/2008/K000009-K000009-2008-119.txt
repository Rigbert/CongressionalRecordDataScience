You can go up to the room in the Capitol and you can read anything. You can read for days. I really don't understand what the minority is doing here tonight.  I am not comfortable with this at all. We had caucus meetings this week. This never came up. I understand under the rules you can ask for it and it can come up almost immediately, but I just am extraordinarily uncomfortable with being asked to hold this session tonight.  I won't attend, and I think there is special responsibility on the gentleman for providing documentation in the regular channels in the Intelligence Committee and in the other committees that have oversight over intelligence for the information that you claim you are going to be presenting to this Chamber.  I would just urge our leadership to not approve this.  Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation for the moment.
