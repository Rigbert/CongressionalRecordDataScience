 President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would make Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits misused by organizational representative payees, whole. While most people receive their Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefit payments directly, others must have assistance in money management. Benefits, totaling over $25 billion, to these people are paid through representative payees who receive and manage the payments on behalf of the beneficiaries. Representative payee responsibilities include, but are not limited to, frequently monitoring the beneficiary's current well-being for food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal needs; informing the Social Security Administration of changes in the representative payee's own circumstances that would affect the performance of representative payee services; reporting events to the Social Security Administration that may affect the beneficiary's entitlement or amount of benefits; and submitting an annual accounting to SSA reporting about benefits received, used, and conserved.  Currently, about 6.5 million Social Security and Supplemental Security Income program beneficiaries rely on representative payees to manage their monthly benefits. SSA usually looks for a payee among the beneficiary's family and friends. For others, those traditional networks of support are not available, and SSA relies on state, local, or community sources to fill the need. Family members serve as representative payees for about 88 percent of the beneficiaries requiring them. 45,050 organizations, such as institutions, government agencies, financial organizations, and qualified fee-for-service organizations, serve as payees for the other 12 percent, totaling 750,570 beneficiaries.  As Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I am especially concerned about the 795,060 beneficiaries, age 62 and over, who are served by representative payees. With the retirement of the baby boomer generation on the horizon, the number of institutions, such as nursing homes, serving as payees stands to increase dramatically. Therefore, addressing this matter now is all the more urgent.  The majority of representative payees provide much-needed help to beneficiaries without abusing this responsibility. A minority of payees misuse their position. SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has recently investigated several instances of misuse by organizational representative payees. One such investigation served as the subject of a recent ``20/20'' television news program segment. In this segment, several elderly Social Security beneficiaries accused Greg Gamble, of the Aurora Foundation, a former organizational payee, of using their benefits for his own purposes. On March 14, 2000, Mr. Gamble entered a guilty plea in federal court of embezzlement of Social Security funds. As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Gamble agreed to make restitution to SSA in the amount of $303,314.00. Although this is only one example of misuse, SSA's OIG has just begun investigating several instances of misuse. Since FY 1998, it has identified about $8 million in SSA representative payee fraud loss. SSA's OIG expects the number of misuse cases to increase as SSA increases its review of organizational representative payee records.  When any payee has been determined to have misused an individual's benefits, SSA reassigns another payee to the beneficiary. Unfortunately, SSA can reissue the benefits only in cases where negligent failure on SSA's part to investigate or monitor the payee resulted in the misuse. In virtually all other cases, the individual loses his or her funds unless SSA can obtain restitution, through civil processes, of the misused benefits from the payee. If SSA is able to recover the misused amount, it may take years to do so. In the meantime, the beneficiary has lost the amount misused and may be temporarily inconvenienced, by not having money to pay rent, utilities, or food, until a new payee is assigned.  In order to prevent misuse of benefits in the future, and to provide better accountability of benefits to beneficiaries, I am introducing the ``Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act,'' along with my co-sponsor and Special Committee on Aging Ranking Member Senator Breaux. This bipartisan bill:  (1) gives SSA the authority to re-issue benefits misused by organizational payees on its own determination (presently, benefits are only re-issued when a court finds that SSA negligently failed to investigate/monitor the payee);  (2) requires non-governmental organizational payees to be bonded and licensed (presently, there is a bonding or licensing requirement);  (3) requires fee forfeiture when payees misuse benefits;  (4) gives SSA overpayment recovery authority for benefits misused by non-governmental payees; and  (5) extends civil monetary penalty authority to SSA (of not more than $5,000 per violation for misuse offenses).  I urge my fellow Senators to support Senator Breaux and me in ensuring that our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, senior citizens and the disabled, will receive every dollar of benefits to which they are entitled.  I would also like to remind everyone that the Senate Special Committee on Aging is holding a hearing on misuse of benefits by Social Security organizational representative payees Tuesday, May 2, 2000, at 10:00 a.m. in 562 Dirksen.                                 ______                                       By
