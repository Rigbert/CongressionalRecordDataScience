 Mr. Chairman, let me say that I am glad that the gentleman from Indiana has offered this amendment this evening, and we look forward to working with him, and I hope we do not lose sight of the fact of the important mission that the Food and Drug Administration has.  They should be reformed, they should be improved, and we can work toward that end, but they certainly perform an invaluable function which no other Federal agency does. I hope that in our criticism of the present practices we do not overlook much of the good that is being done by a lot of hard-working professional people.  I support the amendment by the gentleman from Indiana.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. McIntosh].  The amendment was agreed to.                    amendment offered by mr. sanford
