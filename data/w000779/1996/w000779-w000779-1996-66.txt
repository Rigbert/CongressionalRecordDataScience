President, I rise to offer an amendment which will add much-needed new protections for the sacred, confidential relationship between physicians and their patients. In doing so, I want to single out, on a bipartisan basis, the excellent work done by a number of Members of Congress on this issue.  In particular, I would like to single out Dr. Greg Ganske, a Member of the House, a physician, a Republican. He has done excellent work with Congressman Markey in the House, and also to thank Senator Kennedy, who joins me in this effort.  This matter of protecting the rights of patients in health maintenance organizations has been thoroughly bipartisan through this Congress, and I want to make sure that this body understands that there is a very strong track record of bipartisan support for this issue.
