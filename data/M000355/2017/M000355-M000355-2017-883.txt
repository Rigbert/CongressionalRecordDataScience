 President, the Senate has confirmed more executive branch nominees this week than all of the executive branch nominees confirmed this year--combined. This was an important step toward filling critical roles throughout the administration, including the Deputies of multiple Cabinet offices that had been lacking these key positions.  Moving forward, I hope this agreement represents the way forward on confirming nominees so our government can be fully staffed and working for the American people.
