Speaker, I rise today in observance of National POW/MIA Recognition Day.  Many of the ideals and beliefs that form the backbone of our nation continue to flourish in large part because of the great perseverance and dedication of our nation's armed forces. Unfortunately, as we all know, during war and even smaller armed conflicts there inevitably are troops killed, as well as troops captured by enemy forces or who become missing in action.  It is important that communities regularly honor not only those brave soldiers who risked their lives and were killed, but also remember those who became either missing or prisoners of war. We must show them and their families the appropriate appreciation for their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice to defend and preserve the democratic principles held so close to the hearts of all Americans.  About one year ago, on September 21st, President G.W. Bush declared that day as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. By establishing a national day of recognition, we have ensured that this country will formally honor every year those soldiers who were captured by the enemy or fallen missing in battle while serving their country.  The establishment and observance of a day of recognition for our prisoners of war and those missing in action is of great importance for the estimated 43,000 retired servicemen who were previously missing or held prisoner and who fortunately were able to return to the United States. It is just as important for the families and loved ones of those who remain unaccounted for or possibly are still in captivity.  Throughout our nation's history the men and women of the armed services have courageously risen to the call of duty ignoring whatever trepidation they may have for their own safety and security. While the numbers who have perished in the line of duty is a tremendous loss, there are also astounding numbers of those who continue to be listed MIA or as POWs.  Our friends and our neighbors, and even some of our elected officials, are former POWs or were listed MIA during their service. More than one-forth of the American soldiers held prisoner in the past five US conflicts were released by the enemy and returned to the United States again.  World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War era, Operation Desert Storm, and the Kosovo campaign all resulted in soldiers listed as MIA or POW.  Records show that approximately 143,000 Americans were captured and interned during those conflicts. This number includes 81 women seized on Guam or in the Philippines during World War II, and 2 during the Gulf War. Of these 143,000 American soldiers approximately 125,200 have since been returned to United States military control. That leaves almost 20,000 souls unaccounted for from America's 20th century wars and armed conflicts.  As our country wages the war on terrorism and we debate whether to go to war against Iraq, it is more important than ever to remember past sacrifices made by the men and women of America's armed forces. It is crucial to the continued high morale of our military and the peace of mind of missing soldiers' families that we offer our support--we must be clear that their loved ones' efforts were not in vain.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, the people of Maryland and citizens around the country to celebrate and honor those who have selflessly dedicated their lives to serving their country and have, as a result, been either imprisoned or remain missing. This country owes a debt of gratitude to the current and former POW and MIA soldiers of the United States armed forces.                          ____________________
