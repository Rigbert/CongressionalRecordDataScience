 President, I rise today in opposition to amending our Constitution with a balanced budget amendment. When I came to the Senate 2 years ago, I requested a seat on the Budget Committee. I wanted to learn firsthand how our budget is formed and to help steer this country's spending priorities. It is a big task.  As a nation, we accumulated more debt in the decade of the 1980's than we had in the previous two centuries. It is time for common sense, rational solutions. It is time for us to provide leadership with level headed, moderate decisions even if they are based on tough choices. The balanced budget amendment is not common sense, it is not level headed, it is not rational, and it will not achieve what it claims to do. Instead, what we need are real solutions, real cuts, and real decisions that make sense for the American people.  For example, we have reduced our deficit in a substantial way in the past 2 years. We have had to make some very tough choices. As an appropriator, I have had to say ``no'' more often than ``yes'' to programs that I support. We all know we just do not have a lot of money to go around.  So, Mr. President, no one needs convincing that we need to tighten our belt. What we do need is a workable, responsible solution. This resolution will not achieve what some in the Senate would have you believe, nor what the American people want. It will make a mockery of a document which is the very essence of our democracy.  Mr. President, our Constitution is a living document. In the course of history, we have had to change it and when we have amended the Constitution in the past we have acted to expand people's rights, to make this country more equitable for the little guy, to give ordinary Americans a stake in our society.  Look how we have amended the Constitution in the past. The first amendment, one sentence long, ensures our freedom of speech. The second amendment, just one sentence long, maintains our right to bear arms. The 13th amendment, one short sentence, abolishes slavery. The 19th amendment, again one sentence, gives women the right to vote. The 24th amendment, one sentence long, abolishes the poll tax. And the last time the American people amended the Constitution was in 1971 with the 26th amendment--and we did so with one sentence--we gave all Americans over the age of 18 the right to vote.  Mr. President, clearly when we have amended our Constitution in the past we did so to expand people's rights. This document, this Constitution and its Bill of Rights, is too important to attach pieces of legislation to it. The so-called balanced budget amendment does not fit the profile of previous amendments and, even worse, Mr. President, it is a promise to the American people that is too good to be true.  Mr. President, words on a piece of paper cannot balance our budget. Legislators, like those of us here, can and should. And let us think about what will happen if we take the flexibility out of our economic decisionmaking.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1995] Any Way Its Proponents Slice It, Balanced-Budget Amendment Is Baloney                           (By Hobart Rowen)       The case against a constitutional amendment to balance the      budget is overwhelming. It has been hyped by Democrats and      Republicans alike as the only way to force reluctant      congressmen to make tough decisions, and there is no doubt      that a large segment of the public has come to believe this      propaganda.       But the truth is that an amendment to the Constitution for      this purpose is bad economics, bad budget policy and bad      constitutional policy. By itself, such an amendment would cut      neither a dollar nor a program from the federal budget. As      Office of Management and Budget Director Alice S. Rivlin told      the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 5, ``most of all, it      evades the hard choices needed to achieve real deficit      reduction.''       Why is the constitutional amendment bad economics? In an      interview, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Laura      D'Andrea Tyson points out that the beauty of the present      fiscal system is that it contains automatic stabilizers that      moderate economic activity whenever business activity      weakens. Thus, when workers lose jobs, unemployment      compensation rises and it cushions the slide. If business      profits are off, then tax liabilities decline. These events      boost the government deficit, thus offsetting to some degree      the decline in the private sector.       ``But the balanced budget amendment would take away these      automatic stabilizers when the economy is slowing down,''      Tyson said. It would force the government to raise taxes or      cut spending to cover the increasing deficit that a slowing      economy was generating. Rivlin puts it this way: ``Fiscal      policy would exaggerate, rather than mitigate, swings in the      economy. Rescissions would tend to be deeper and longer.''       Meanwhile, the House Republican version of the amendment      wrongly (and possibly unconstitutionally) requires a three-     fifths majority of each house of Congress to increase      revenue, run budget deficits or increase the public debt.      There is supposed to be a safety valve to permit a deficit in      time of real economic weakness. But who in Congress is a good      enough forecaster to sense when the safety valve should be      opened? As Rivlin said, in all likelihood, ``the damage would      be done long before we recognize that the economy is turning      down.''       Why would the amendment also be bad constitutional policy?      Not only would it put fiscal policy, as outlined above, in a      straitjacket, it would denigrate the document that deals with      the big issues--individual rights, the system of separation      of powers, the ultimate guarantor of our system of liberties      in effect since 1776. It would force the courts to adjudicate      disputes certain to arise.       Meanwhile, what are the hard choices being avoided? The      Republicans who are pushing the ``Contract With America''      freely concede that to balance the budget by the year 2002,      as called for by the amendment, would cost $1.2 trillion in      cuts in the various big entitlement programs--Social      Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other pensions. But they      aren't prepared to make them. Rep. Richard K. Armey of Texas,      House majority leader, said forthrightly that if members of      Congress understood the full dimension of what is involved,      ``they would buckle at the knees.''       But wait, there's more than $1.2 trillion involved: Because      of the new tax cuts and other ``reforms'' proposed in the      Republican ``Contract,'' there is an additional $450 million      that would have to be found by 2002--making a net reduction      of $1.65 trillion.       But the story isn't over--and this is the most significant      missing piece.       The bland assumption is that if somehow a miracle is      accomplished--the huge $1.65 trillion cuts are made to      balance the budget by 2002--the budget will continue to be in      balance. Not so! The dirty little secret is that within a few      years after 2002, as the Kerry-Danforth entitlement      commission report showed, the workplace demographics begin to      explode, and with that, the budget deficit. Fewer workers in      the labor force supporting Social Security pensioners will      drive the Social Security trust fund deep into the red. Once      again, the budget will be unbalanced, perhaps more so than      before--and the game must start over again.       Clearly, the balanced-budget amendment is bad business.      Congress should reconsider the      [[Page S2096]] whole plot. The real goal, in the first place,      should not be to balance the budget but to balance the      economy. The deficit needs to be cut back sharply, but to aim      at a balance in 2002 or 2012 is self-defeating. There will be      some years ahead when the nation may need to run a deficit--     and it shouldn't be afraid to make such decisions.       The need now is to put aside the gimmickry, forget the      constitutional amendment and for the Clinton administration      and the Republican Congress to attend to business. A little      maturity, please!
