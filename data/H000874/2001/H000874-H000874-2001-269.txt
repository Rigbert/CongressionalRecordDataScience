Speaker, as our nation moves forward from September 11, we know that the answer to profound loss and tragedy can only be found in faith and determination,  Ours is a story of perseverance, of courage, of sacrifice. The American journey has not been paved by ease. Our quest for freedom, democracy and decency has never been free. Yet, we are strengthened by the fact that each generation of Americans prepares its place in history from the shoulders of those who preceded.  Thus, it's with great honor that I pay tribute, on the occasion of his 86th birthday, to one of the greatest public servants in the history of our nation and a great American--Robert Sargent Shriver, Jr.  Sargent Shriver's devotion to this nation--and humanity--sets an example for all to emulate and a high bar that only a few will ever hope to exceed.  A native of the State of Maryland, and in fact a member of one of the Free State's founding families, Sargent Shriver has dedicated his life to improving the lives of others.  A few years ago, Sarge was asked to explain his lifelong commitment to public service. ``I just feel my faith,'' he said. ``A life of service is like catching a disease. In a family it's passed on. . . . Our five children are all involved in service. It's in their veins.''  There is no doubt that this generation and future generations of Americans are the beneficiaries of his life of service.  After graduating from Yale Law School in 1941, Sarge enlisted in the Navy, where hereceived the Navy Unit Citation and the Submarine Medal for service in both the Atlantic and Pacific.  After World War II, Sarge accepted a position as assistant editor with Newsweek magazine. He later went into business with Joseph Kennedy, President Kennedy's father, and met Eunice, his wife of more than 48 years.  Sarge then moved his family to Chicago, where he served on the Board of Education. In 1956, he was elected President of the Board, the youngest person to serve in such a position in any major American city.  And in 1960, he joined the Presidential campaign of then-Senator Kennedy. After the election, he was asked by President Kennedy to create the Peace Corps and in March 1961 was appointed its founding Director.  Sarge's vision for the Peace Corps was straight-forward and strong: ``to permit Americans to participate directly, personally, and effectively in this struggle for human dignity.''  In nearly six years at the Peace Corps, Sarge developed programs in 55 countries with more than 14,500 volunteers. Forty years later, the solid foundation that he created has only strengthened and expanded. Today, 163,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served in 135 countries.  As CBS television commentator Charles Osgood said just a few weeks ago: ``Much has changed since 1960, but two things have not: Americans still pray for peace and they still join the Peace Corps.''  However, while Sarge is rightly identified as the founding father of this great American idea, his contributions to the Peace Corps do not tell the whole story.  Sarge also served as the first Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity under President Johnson. Then, between 1964 and 1968, he created VISTA, Head Start, Community Action, Foster Grandparents, Job Corps, Legal Services, Indian and Migrant Opportunities and Neighborhood Health Services.  And, then, from 1968 to 1970, he served as U.S. Ambassador to France, before being nominated in 1972 to serve as the Vice Presidential candidate on the Democratic Party's ticket with George McGovern.  I dare say that few Americans have given so much to help so many. Yet, in the twilight of this incredible life, Sarge and Eunice continue to give. For example, Eunice is the Founder and Honorary Chair and Sarge the Past-President and current Chairman of the Board of the Special Olympics.  To call this record of public service exemplary is a vast understatement. Words cannot adequately convey the decency and humanity that has been brought into the lives of millions worldwide through the work of Sargent Shriver--international lawyer, ambassador, humanitarian. His life's work shall live on long after this and succeeding generations have passed the torch of public service to their progeny.  ``Serve, serve, serve,'' Sarge was known to say, ``because in the end it is the servants who save us all.''  Mr. Speaker, today I honor a great American and wish him only the best as he begins this, his 87th year of public service to the United States and the cause of humanity.                          ____________________
