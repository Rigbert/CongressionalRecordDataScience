 Like any compromise, this is not a perfect bill. We don't pass perfect bills, but it's a good bill that is worthy of support.  I would be remiss if I did not note my concern with section 533--unnecessary and, in my opinion, dangerously vague language that represents another backdoor attack on the highly successful repeal of the discriminatory Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy and the open service of courageous gay and lesbian servicemembers.  As Barry Goldwater so aptly said, what I'm concerned about is not whether they're straight, but whether they can shoot straight. We ought to focus on competency and patriotism, not anything else.  On balance, this is critical national security legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Our troops continue to do an outstanding job. Many of them are at the point of the spear in harm's way. We owe them our gratitude and our continuing support.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, a member of the conference committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).
