I don't have a list which committees have completed their organizational structuring, but many have and are ready to do their business.  I am confident that all committees will be organized, and they may not have every member because there are still some Members that have not been finally assigned to committees, but by the middle of next week, we are confident that all committees will be organized to do business.  I would like to comment on the second part of your question. I want you to know that although we believe that the two bills that I have discussed that may well be on the floor on Friday, I want Members to have notice of that, are dealing with ethics and the safety of our pages, both issues are of substantial concern, and I would suggest immediacy. While they will be considered, I want you to know on both sides of the aisle, there is a desire for and a commitment to regular order. The points the gentleman makes with respect to considered judgment being given are well taken, and I agree with him, and we hope to proceed in that manner.
