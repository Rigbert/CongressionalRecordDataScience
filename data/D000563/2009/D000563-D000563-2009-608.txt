President, I inquire of the Senator from Arizona, who said the first two were in order because they strike and replace money, is the Senator saying the same about the third amendment? Is it in order on an appropriations bill?  Mr. McCAIN. I believe it is in order. I will be glad to have a vote on whether it is a violation of any of the Senate rules.
