President, today the Foreign Operations Subcommittee held its third hearing on global health since 1997. Our first hearing was the first of its kind in the Congress, when we highlighted how disease outbreaks and impoverished public health systems half a world away directly threaten Americans. Since then, the interest in these issues in the Congress, the Administration, the media and the public has skyrocketed.  Today, there are about a dozen pieces of legislation pending which deal with some aspect of global health, the President has proposed major increases in funding and policy initiatives to encourage the pharmaceutical companies to invest in new vaccines against HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and other major killers, and the World Health Organization is setting the pace for us all to tackle these challenges with new energy and new resources.  This sea change is a reflection of the magnitude of the challenges and opportunities, as well as a recognition of the essential role the United States must play in global health.  There is no need to recite at length what has spurred this interest, but I do want to cite a couple of illustrative facts:  In America, each year we spend over $4,000 per person on health care.  In the countries where 2 billion of the world's people live in desperate poverty, only $3 to $5 per person per year is spent on health care.  It would cost just $15 per person per year to address most of the urgent health needs of those 2 billion people.  With that $15 per person, we could prevent or cure the many millions of deaths caused by tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, measles, HIV/AIDS, and pregnancy related diseases.  That is the challenge we face. The benefits to the world, and to the United States, should be obvious. In an increasingly interdependent world, reducing the threats posed by infectious diseases and poor reproductive health, and the social and economic consequences of poverty and disease, is absolutely key to our own future security and prosperity.  The Congress has become increasingly seized with these issues. However, while I strongly support most of the bills that have been introduced--and I am a cosponsor of Senator Kerry's ``Vaccines for the New Millennium Act,'' they have tended to focus narrowly on the eradication of specific diseases and the development of new vaccines.  These are admirable and important goals, but I have always believed that global health consists of a broader set of issues that must be addressed together. Our primary challenge is to provide the resources to enable developing countries to build the capacity--both human and infrastructure, to support effective public health systems. That was the motivation for my infectious disease initiative three years ago, which since then has provided an additional $175 million to support programs in surveillance, anti-microbial resistance, TB, and malaria.  Today, in an effort to build on that initiative, I am introducing new legislation to authorize an additional $1 billion to support five key components of global health. The ``Global Health Act of 2000,'' targets HIV/AIDS; other deadly infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, and measles; children's health; women's health; and family planning.  Together, these five groups of issues account for over 80 percent of the disproportionate burden of disease and death borne by the 2 billion people living in the world's poorest countries. This legislation, an identical version of which Congressman Joseph Crowley has introduced in the House, has the strong support of the Global Health Council, the world's largest consortium of private and public companies and organizations, agencies and governments, involved in public health.  We have the technology to do this. The key missing ingredient is political will, and resources.  We can, and we must, recognize that we need to think in terms of far larger amounts of money if we are serious about global health. Every dollar of the additional $1 billion called for in my legislation, which is approximately double the amount we currently spend on these activities, is justified and urgently needed. And the payoff would be enormous, both in terms of lives saved and in future health care cost savings.  Senator McConnell, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has been a strong supporter of global health, and I will be working in the Appropriations Committee to obtain the funds we need to achieve these goals.                                 ______                                       By
