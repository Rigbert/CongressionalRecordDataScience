Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that Trenton was today awarded 1 of 15 Brownfields pilot grants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. The Trenton community truly deserves this Federal recognition and financial support for all the hard work we have done to identify and clean up hazardous wastes left over from the city's industrial heyday.  Trenton has the spirit, the commitment, and a detailed plan for restoring these sites and making them available for alternative uses. In fact, over the past several years, the city has committed funds and other resources to identify contamination, develop plans for remediation, and redevelop abandoned lots. But our city has lacked the appropriate financial means to make these assets fully effective. The Brownfields Program will provide the city with that funding assistance and propel our initial program to final success.  The Brownfields project which Trenton has developed will put the $200,000 Federal grant to good use. The city has enlisted the help of several civic organizations, State government, and community residents to devise their program and intends to call on them to implement it as well.  The city will employ a strategy to incorporate the resources of established community urban beautification and environmental justice programs, as well as the expertise of local legal, development, and other professionals.  I have worked closely with both the city of Trenton and Mercer County in a bipartisan effort to coordinate Federal, State, and local dollars and resources to improve New Jersey's capital. Together we made Trenton one of the initial pilot sites for the Weed and Seed anti-drug crime program, we helped to rehabilitate abandoned rowhouses, and we have made city gardens and parks cleaner and safer.  With its 89,000 residents, we in Trenton are proud to rank with some of the other awardees here today--such as Baltimore, New Orleans, and Detroit--that often receive greater attention from the Federal Government. Trenton--which has the same concerns as these larger cities--will use the money effectively and quickly to clean up sites, eliminating the abandoned areas where drug use, violent crime, and gang-related activities can fester.  Trenton has taken the bull by the horns to address all of these problems. This Brownfields project will advance this fight to save Trenton.                          ____________________
