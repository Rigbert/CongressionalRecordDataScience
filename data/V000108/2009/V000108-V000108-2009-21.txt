Ronald Good, of Lake Station, Indiana. After serving the people of Lake Station as a firefighter for 52 years, the last 16 of which he served as the department's Fire Chief, Ron retired from service at the end of 2007. In recognition of Mr. Good's service to his community, not only as a firefighter but also for his commitment to serving his community in many other capacities, a party will be held in his honor on Sunday, November 8, 2009, at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 9323 in Lake Station, Indiana.  Following a 3-year enlistment in the United States Marine Corps, Ron returned to his hometown and joined the fire department in 1956 at the age of 21. He credits his grandfather, Captain Solomon Hursey, a charter member of the fire department, which was then the East Gary Fire Department, with peaking his interest in his chosen career path. Mr. Good, as a child, would often go on fire calls and was immediately drawn to the idea of following in his grandfather's footsteps. Later on in his life, it must have made Ron quite proud to see two of his sons keep the family tradition alive through their service as Lake Station firefighters.  Aside from his incredible 52 years of service on the fire department, Ron's contributions to Northwest Indiana and beyond through his service on various firefighters' associations and service organizations have also touched the lives of many people. Mr. Good is a lifetime member of both the Indiana Volunteer Firefighters Association and the Indiana Firefighters Association, for which he has served on the Board of Directors. He is also a lifetime member of both Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 9323 and American Legion Post 100, and he has been an active member of the Lake Station Lions Club for the past 30 years. Never one to shy away from taking a leadership role when it comes to service to his community, Mr. Good also served for several years as a representative on the Lake Station City Council.  Ron Good's commitment to his community has been matched only by his commitment to his family. A husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Ron and his adoring wife of an astonishing 54 years, Beverly, have 7 children, 15 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. Ronald Good for his lifetime of leadership, service, and dedication to the residents of Lake Station, Indiana. He has touched the lives of countless citizens, and his commitment to the safety of his community and to the improvement of the quality of life for the people of Lake Station is to be admired.                          ____________________
