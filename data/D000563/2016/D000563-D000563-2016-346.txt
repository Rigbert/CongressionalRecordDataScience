President, I would like to say a few remarks about this resolution of disapproval.  While I oppose this measure, I share the junior Senator from Kentucky's frustration with some aspects of our relationship with Pakistan. Notably, I think the jailing of Dr. Shakil Afridi for 23 years under highly questionable charges is an outrage.  For those of you who don't remember, Dr. Afridi helped the United States locate Osama bin Laden. His approach may have been debatable, but one thing is clear--he doesn't deserve to languish in a Pakistani jail for more than two decades on manufactured charges.  I have also been troubled by the Pakistani military and intelligence service's support for militant groups that work against U.S. interests in the region. In fact, I would argue that many of these groups are also working against the long term interests of our friends in Pakistan as well, as evidenced by its own domestic terrorist problem.  I am also concerned that, despite important foreign aid given to Pakistan, there remains a troubling failure to address basic and urgent development needs--particularly education and schooling for girls. We also see continued cases of extreme religious intolerance, including death sentences for dubious charges of blasphemy.  At the same time, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge that Pakistan has suffered horrible losses in taking on militant groups within its own borders--something I don't think we always recognize.  And most importantly, I want to stress the importance of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--let's allow it to do its work and thoroughly consider this resolution first, rather than rush it through the Senate.
