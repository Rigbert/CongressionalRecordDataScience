I rise today to speak about the extraordinary service of this extraordinary individual.  When I became the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee in 2003, a freshman Senator took over the position that I had held as the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. During the next 6 years, I came to know Senator Norm Coleman as an energetic, farsighted, and committed public servant, but most of all I came to know Norm as a dear friend.  As chairman, and later ranking member, of PSI, Norm demonstrated unfailing leadership and extraordinary dedication. Working with his colleague from across the aisle, Senator Carl Levin, Norm enhanced PSI's reputation as the Senate's premier investigative subcommittee. He undertook many complex and important investigations.  Under this team's leadership, the subcommittee was successful in ferreting out waste, fraud, and abuse to the tune of $14 billion. I remember particularly well an investigation that exposed tax cheats in Medicare and in defense contracting.  Another success resulting from Norm's leadership was his highly successful and courageous ``oil for food'' investigation. Norm's investigation uncovered billions of dollars of fraud in this program operated by the United Nations. Norm was focused, determined, and undeterred in his pursuit of the facts, in his pursuit of the truth.  Norm's abiding concern for upholding the public trust is rooted in his background. As a former prosecutor, he is a champion of the rule of law. As a former mayor, he understands the concerns of State and local government. As a Senator, he always worked hard for the people he represented and for the people of this entire country.
