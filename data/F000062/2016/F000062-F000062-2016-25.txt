 President, I am pleased to introduce the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. This legislation directs the transfer of land between the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, the District, and the Bureau of Land Management in San Bernardino, California, BLM.  The bill is the culmination of years of collaboration between numerous federal and state agencies, private industry and municipalities representing mining, flood control, water supply and wildlife conservation, among other interests.  Included among the supporters of this land exchange are: County of San Bernardino; City of Redlands; City of Highland; San Bernardino Water Conservation District; San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District; East Valley Water District; Endangered Habitats League; CEMEX Construction Materials Pacific; Robertson's Ready Mix; and Inland Action.  In 1993, representatives from this diverse group formed the ``Wash Committee'' to address mining issues in the upper Santa Ana River wash area.  The role of the Committee subsequently expanded in 1997 to consider the broad range of land uses in the area, including natural resource conservation.  The Wash Committee developed a strategy that focused on ``best uses'' for more comprehensive planning and not focusing on private property boundaries that would segment the area. The result is a project expected to produce a Land Management and Habitat Conservation Plan covering 4,500 acres.  The land exchange takes place in a designated region within the Santa Ana Wash, at the junction of the Santa Ana River and Mill Creek.  Currently, land within the Santa Ana Wash is owned by both the District and BLM.  The land parcels owned by the District are currently used for recharging the local groundwater aquifer through the use of more than 77 basins, and also provide rare Riversidian sage scrub habitat for a number of State and federally listed species. In addition, under this plan, new land would be set aside for conservation purposes near land already managed by BLM.  The exchange of land between the District and BLM will connect a current patchwork of separately owned land parcels into a consolidated open space for conservation purposes and will optimize mining efficiency and water conservation efforts.  The land transfer resulting from this legislation will lead to more protection efforts for habitat, improved connectivity in the wildlife corridor, expanded groundwater recharge for water supply, and the future establishment of public access and trails.  Additionally, the legislation will allow the continued use of land and mineral resources while maintaining the biological and hydrological resources of the area in an environmentally sensitive manner.  I want to applaud diverse members of the Wash Committee that worked together, including the Cities of Highland and Redlands, East Valley Water District, the County of San Bernardino, Robertson's Ready Mix, CEMEX, the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, and the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, along with the Federal, State and local stakeholders for their continued work on the Wash Plan.  This group has demonstrated that while it takes significant time, funding and cooperation, it is possible to simultaneously protect the environment and support local jobs, business and community interests.  I would also like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Pete Aguilar and Paul Cook, for introducing similar legislation in the House.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act.                          ____________________
