I can recall a few years ago the tobacco companies said, ``We are going to stop marketing to kids, and we are going to tell these kids we don't want their business.'' And they delivered their message by buying full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal. There may be some kids who read the Wall Street Journal, but not a lot of them. It is far better to take that information and message and put it on a television show the kids are likely to watch.
