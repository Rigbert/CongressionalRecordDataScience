I thank the gentleman for his comments.  I would ask the authors of this amendment if they would respond to the question.  Will you respond, Mr. Chabot and Mr. Andrews?  I am going to introduce legislation to allow the forest to be sold to the State of Alaska. If you are fiscally conservative, we will raise about $4.5 billion, we will pay you for it.  Then we can manage it as we should manage it, because right now it's not being managed. When I introduce that bill, are you willing to get on my bill to sell that forest to the State of Alaska so we could manage it as it should be managed.  Would you be willing to sponsor that bill?                              {time}  2015
