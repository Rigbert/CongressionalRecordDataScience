 Res. 116       Whereas autoimmune diseases are chronic, disabling diseases      in which underlying defects in the immune system lead the      body to attack its own organs and tissues;       Whereas autoimmune diseases can affect any part of the      body, including the blood, blood vessels, muscles, nervous      system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine glands, and      multiple-organ systems, and can be life-threatening;       Whereas researchers have identified over 80 different      autoimmune diseases, and suspect at least 40 additional      diseases of qualifying as autoimmune diseases;       Whereas researchers have identified a close genetic      relationship and a common pathway of disease that exists      among autoimmune diseases, explaining the clustering of      autoimmune diseases in individuals and families;       Whereas the family of autoimmune diseases is under-     recognized, and poses a major health care challenge to the      United States;       Whereas the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates      that autoimmune diseases afflict up to 23,500,000 people in      the United States, 75 percent of the people affected are      women, and the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is rising;       Whereas NIH estimates the annual direct health care costs      associated with autoimmune diseases at more than      $100,000,000,000 and there are over 250,000 new diagnoses      each year;       Whereas autoimmune diseases are among the top 10 leading      causes of death in female children and adult women;       Whereas autoimmune diseases most often affect children and      young adults, leading to a lifetime of disability;       Whereas diagnostic tests for most autoimmune diseases are      not standardized, making autoimmune diseases very difficult      to diagnose;       Whereas, because autoimmune diseases are difficult to      diagnose, treatment is often delayed, resulting in      irreparable organ damage and unnecessary suffering;       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies      reported that the United States is behind other countries in      research into immune system self-recognition, the cause of      autoimmune diseases;       Whereas a study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases      Association revealed that it takes the average patient with      an autoimmune disease more than 4 years, and costs more than      $50,000, to get a correct diagnosis;       Whereas there is a significant need for more collaboration      and cross-fertilization of basic autoimmune research;       Whereas there is a significant need for research focusing      on the etiology of all autoimmune-related diseases, to      increase understanding of the root causes of these diseases      rather treating the symptoms after the disease has had its      destructive effect;       Whereas the National Coalition of Autoimmune Patient Groups      is a coalition of national organizations focused on      autoimmune diseases working to consolidate the voices of      patients with autoimmune diseases and to promote increased      education, awareness, and research into all aspects of      autoimmune diseases through a collaborative approach; and       Whereas designating May 2007 as ``National Autoimmune      Diseases Awareness Month'' would help educate the public      about autoimmune diseases and the need for research funding,      accurate diagnosis, and effective treatments: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates May 2007 as ``National Autoimmune Diseases      Awareness Month'';       (2) supports the efforts of health care providers and      autoimmune patient advocacy and education organizations to      increase awareness of the causes of, and treatments for,      autoimmune diseases; and       (3) supports the goal of increasing Federal funding for      aggressive research to learn the root causes of autoimmune      diseases, as well as the best diagnostic methods and      treatments for people with autoimmune diseases.
