 WELLSTONE. Does the Senator from Kentucky have a question?  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the Senator for his observation, because I do think there is a lot of rhetoric about people selling influence for lunch. I appreciate the observations of the Senator from Minnesota that is clearly not the case.  I also think that the only thing I agree with my friend from Minnesota about is, I think, on the gift issue, it is time to get it over with one way or the other. I think it is time to make a decision. I think we will have a good debate about what is appropriate; hopefully in restrained tones, without a lot of implications that things are going on that are clearly not going on.  So I commend the Senator from Minnesota for his observation that any such suggestions that Members of the Senate are selling influence for lunch are absurd. And I hope we can have a high-level, appropriate debate on this issue. Second, I agree with the Senator from Minnesota, I think it is time to wrap it up on the gift rule and, hopefully, we will be able to do that later tonight or first thing in the morning.
