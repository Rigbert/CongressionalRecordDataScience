President, for some time now a bipartisan group of Senators expressed concern about the letting of billions of dollars in Iraqi reconstruction contracts without competitive bidding. We have worked very closely with the chair of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Warner, and with Senator Collins, who chairs the Governmental Affairs Committee. We have been able to attach an amendment to the Defense authorization bill requiring the disclosure of awards that involve closed-bid or no-bid accounts.  But the fact is, as the legislative process goes forward, too much money is now moving out of public coffers into private hands with too little assurance that those hands have won their contracts fairly.  As a result, today Senator Clinton and I are requesting the immediate public disclosure of all documents relating to USAID's decision to exempt Iraqi contracting from full and competitive bidding. In addition, Senator Clinton and myself are asking Defense Secretary Rumsfeld for explanations regarding particularly troubling contracts that have recently come to light and have been awarded by his Department.  Recently, a number of Senators have returned from Iraq. Every one of them I have heard discussing their trip, Democrats and Republicans alike, have concluded that the U.S. military will be spending more time in that country than originally calculated. The work to rebuild that ravaged nation will be more difficult rather than less so. Certainly, the billions of dollars of costs to the American people seem only to be going up.  This week, Civil Administrator Paul Bremmer said that just over the next 6 months, Iraqi oil revenues will be $2 billion short of what will be needed to finance occupation and reconstruction. U.S. taxpayers are being asked to fund the difference. They are being asked to fund the difference for the 6 months and presumably for the foreseeable future. Yet the rationale behind much of this cost remains unknown to the American people and even to the Congress. Companies have been given contracts for work in Iraq with little or no competition and no explanation.  The history of this, documented by the General Accounting Office, is such that this is a very unwise approach. The General Accounting Office has repeatedly said sole source or limited source contracts are not the best buy. They found that military leaders have often simply accepted the level of services given by a contractor without once asking if it could be done more efficiently or at a lower cost. Yet these noncompetitive contracts now seem to be the rule rather than the exception when it comes to Iraqi reconstruction.  In my view, when Federal agencies employ a process that may expose taxpayers to additional costs, the need for explanation increases manifold.  There is a crying need for transparency in how these billions of dollars are being spent. On April 19 of this year, a $50 million policing contract was awarded through closed bidding. On the same day it was reported that an $8 million contract for personnel services had been awarded nearly a month before the war began.  Think about that--awards actually before the conflict began. By the time the end of hostilities was officially declared in May, billions of dollars of contracts had already been awarded.  Fortunately, the news media has helped to get out the word about some of these issues. Right now the media is the American people's only source, apparently, for insight into these contracts. The more we learn about this, the more troubling the pattern is. Just recently the New York Times ran a feature-length article describing the letting of a multimillion dollar oil field contract to Kellogg Brown & Root.  I ask unanimous consent that important article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the New York Times Magazine, June 22, 2003]                        Nation Builders for Hire                             (By Dan Baum)       The huge effort to restore Iraq's oil industry begins every      day two hours south of the Iraq-Kuwait border, at the lavish      Crowne Plaza Hotel in Kuwait City. No sooner does the lobby      restaurant open at 5 a.m. than a line of middle-aged men in      jumpsuits, golf shirts and identical tan caps forms at the      breakfast buffet, eschewing the mezzeh and labneh for French      toast, home fries and beef bacon. Outside, a couple of dozen      silver S.U.V.'s are lined up, and after a quick breakfast the      men are off in a swift northbound convoy, each car marked      with the sideways V of duct tape that designates American and      British vehicles. The road knifes across a packed pebble      desert as flat as a griddle, with hardly a plant or a rock      gentling the view to a hazy 360-degree horizon. But nobody's      minding the scenery.       The men in the S.U.V.'s are all talking at once, handing      clipboards and calculators back and forth, trying to make      10,000 impossible things happen in Iraq's oil fields in      exactly the right order. A couple are getting in last-minute      calls to headquarters in Houston before leaving Kuwaiti      cellphone coverage. Though they speak with the drawling soft      consonants of the Texas-Oklahoma oil patch, these are truly      citizens of the world--or at least the petroleum-producing      corners of it.       For they are the legions of Kellogg Brown & Root,      subsidiary of the oil-services giant Halliburton, which in      March won an open-ended Army contract to restore Iraq's oil      fields to working order. Most have spent years toiling in the      raw, scraped and sometimes violent places where oil lurks,      and each hews to the oilie's ethic: no place is a hardship.      How were your 12 years in Algeria? ``Not bad.'' Your six      years at Prudhoe Bay? ``Not bad.'' Your 14 years in Nigeria?      ``Not many of whom fought the hard battles for Basra and Umm      Qasr, pile into Land Rovers and fall in behind.       When Dwight Eisenhower warned in 1961 of the ``military-     industrial complex,'' he never imagined the regimental      descendants of Monty's boys at El Alamein tenting in the      desert to baby-sit corporadoes earning $10,000 tax-free a      month. This, however, is modern might. The military has      become the industrial, and vice versa.       Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, is      in high dudgeon lately, suggesting that Vice President Dick      Cheney's former chairmanship of Halliburton gave KBR the      inside track on the Iraqi oil-fields contract, which could be      worth as much as $7 billion. But the reality is subtler: KBR      didn't need any help. It is by now so enmeshed with the      Pentagon that it was able essentially to assign the contract      to itself.       KBR was founded in 1919 as Brown & Root, and quickly      acquired a reputation for taking on the kinds of projects      that tend to recall the building of the pyramids. It      constructed the gigantic Mansfield Dam in Texas, New Orlean's      24-mile Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Colorado's Eisenhower      Tunnel and the Johnson Space Center, among many other mega-     projects. Halliburton acquired it in 1962, and in 1998 merged      it with the petrochemical company M. W. Kellogg to form      Kellogg Brown & Root. KBR now accounts for almost half of      Halliburton's annual $12.5 billion annual revenue.       The Army says KBR got the Iraqi oil-field contract without      having to compete for it because, according to the Army's      classified contingency plan for repairing Iraq's      infrastructure, KBR was the only company with the skills,      resources and security clearances to do the job on short      notice. Who wrote the Army's contingency plan? KBR. It was in      a position to do so because it holds another contract that is      poorly understood yet in many ways more important, and      potentially bigger, than the one to repair the oil fields:      the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or Logcap, which      essentially turns KBR into a kind of for-profit Ministry of      Public Works for the Army. Under Logcap, which KBR won in      open bidding in 2001, KBR is on call to the Army for 10 years      to do a lot of the things most people think soldiers do for      themselves--from fixing trucks to warehousing ammunition,      from delivering mail to cleaning up hazardous waste. K.P. is      history; KBR civilians now peel potatoes, and serve them, at      many installations. KBR does the laundry. It fixes the pipes      and clean the sewers, generates the power and repairs the      wiring. It built some of the bases used in the Iraq war.       Writing the oil-field contingency plan was only one of a      thousand things KBR did for the Army last year under Logcap.      (KBR has a similarly broad contract with the Navy, under      which it built, among other things, the cages for suspected      terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.) The technical term for Logcap      is ``cost-reimbursement, indefinite-delivery)/indefinite      quantity,'' or ``cost-plus,'' meaning KBR spends whatever it      believes necessary to get a job done, then adds from 1 to 9      percent as profit. There's practically no limit on how      lucrative Logcap can be, and as the awarding of the Iraqi      oil-field contract--by KBR, to KBR--demonstrates, Logcap can      become a generator of yet more contracts. Nothing like it      exists elsewhere in government. That KBR wrote the oil-field      plan wasn't considered by the Army a disqualifying conflict      of interest--in fact, just the opposite. ``They were the      company best positioned to execute the oil-field work because      of their involvement in the planning,'' said Lt. Col. Gene      Pawlik, an Army spokesman.       The military has relied on civilian contractors ever since      George Washington hired farmers to haul supplies for the      Continental Army, and the use of mercenaries is as old as      time. But the KBR-style blending of corporations into the      fabric of the military is relatively recent. Its genesis is      one of the unsung but seminal ideological documents of the      Reagan era, a revolution-on-paper that goes by the dry title      Circular No. A-76. Issued in 1983 by the budget director,      David Stockman, A-76 mandates that government should ``rely      on commercial sources to supply the products and services the      government needs.''       Circular No. A-76 wasn't written specifically for the      Defense Department, and the military was slow to adopt the      approach. It took the end of the cold war for the Pentagon to      discover the benefits of outsourcing. The times demanded that      the military shrink--remember all the talk about a ``peace      dividend''? Oddly, though, the end of the cold war uncorked a      froth of conflicts from Africa to the Balkans that the      military had to monitor and, in the case of the former      Yugoslavia, fight. By one count, the Army has deployed      soldiers more than three times as often in the 14 years since      the cold war ended than in the cold war's four-decade      history, even though it is today down to only two-thirds the      size of its cold war peak.       Downsizing the military not only meant doing more with      less; it also meant that a lot of former soldiers, sailors,      airmen and officers were suddenly on the street looking for      the kind of work for which their particular skills would be      valuable. The Pentagon still needed those skills. So the      downsized warriors joined a constellation of corporations      that sold those skills--everything from data processing to      interrogation to bomb disposal--back to the military at      private-sector prices.       In 1992 the Defense Department, under Dick Cheney, hired      Brown & Root to write a classified report detailing how      private companies could help the military logistically in the      world's hot spots. Not long after, the Pentagon awarded the      first five-year Logcap--to Brown & Root. Then Bill Clinton      won the election, and Cheney, in 1995, became C.E.O. of      Halliburton, Brown & Root's parent company. A lot of      Halliburton's business depends on foreign customers getting      loans from U.S. banks, which are in turn guaranteed by the      government's trade-promoting Export-Import Bank. In the five      years before Cheney took the helm, the Ex-Im Bank guaranteed      $100 million in loans so foreign customers could buy      Halliburton's services; during Cheney's five years as C.E.O.,      that figure jumped to $1.5 billion.       ``Clearly Dick gave Halliburton some advantages,'' a      Hilliburton vice-president, Bob Peebler, told The Chicago      Tribune in 2000. ``Doors would open.''       Doors continue to swing freely between the corporate boards      of companies like KBR, whose livelihood depends on U.S.      energy and military policy, and the upper echelons of      government, where those policies are set. In addition to its      connection to Dick Cheney--who as vice president continues to      be paid ``less than $180,000 a year'' in deferred      compensation by Halliburton, according to a company      spokeswoman--Halliburton has on its board former Secretary of      State Lawrence Eagleburger, who has sits on the board of      Phillips Petroleum alongside a former chairman of the Senate      Select Committee on Intelligence, David Boren. Among the vice      presidents of Booz Allen Hamilton--another does-everything      company that has received millions in military contracts--is      the former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey. Of      the 30 members of the Defense Policy Board--the influential      Pentagon advisory panel from which Richard Perle was recently      forced to resign--at least nine are directors or officers of      companies that won $76 billion in defense contracts in 2001      and 2002, according to the Center for Public Integrity.      Lieut. Gen. Jay Garner, who served as chief civilian      administrator of Iraq, ran a subsidiary of L-3 Communications      that makes missile systems used in the Iraq war; and L. Paul      Bremer III, who took over from Garner, was plucked from a new      unit of the insurer Marsh & McLennan that was created a month      after 9/11 to profit from the new concern over catastrophic      risk.       I am unabashedly an admirer of outsourcing,'' Army Gen.      Barry McCaffrey told The Dallas Morning News three years ago.      ``There's very few things in life you can't outsource.''      McCaffrey now serves on the boards of the weapons makers      Raytheon Aerospace and Integrated Defense Technologies,      among others.       It's a relatively small club that has both guided U.S.      military, energy and Middle Eastern policies over the past      three decades and then run the corporations that benefit from      those policies. And it's a club that had a long history with      Saddam Hussein. A sheaf of declassified 1980's State      Department cables demonstrate that in 1983 Secretary of State      George Shultz--former president of Bechtel--sent Donald      Rumsfeld to meet personally with Saddam Hussein several      times, in part to promote an oil pipeline to the Red Sea port      of Aquaba. (The accompanying State Department photo of the      two men warmly shaking hands is startling, given the recent      vitriol between them.) In the midst of negotiations with      Rumsfeld, Hussein used poison gas against the Iranian Army.      While cables demonstrate the State Department discouraged      this, a memo to Eagleburger, then the under secretary of      state, noted it may have been American firms that sold      Hussein the gas, and outlined the need ``to avoid      unpleasantly surprising Iraq'' with public statements.       By July 2000, Cheney claimed on ABC's ``This Week'' that      neither Halliburton nor its subsidiaries dealt with Iraq at      all. ``Iraq's different,'' Cheney said at the time. ``I had a      firm policy that wouldn't do anything in Iraq, even      arrangements that were supposedly legal.'' But in fact from      1997 to 2000, when Cheney was running Halliburton, two of its      subsidiaries sold Saddam Hussein's government a total of $73      million in oil-field supplies. The deal didn't violate U.S.      sanctions because the subsidiaries, Dresser-Rand and      Ingersoll Dresser Pump Company, were foreign.       KBR/Halliburton, then, has rounded the bases when it comes      to Iraq. It got rich doing business with Iraq, it got rich      preparing to destroy Iraq and it's now getting rich      rebuilding Iraq.       Proponents of contracting make the point that as the      overall size of the military shrinks, the ``tooth'' needs to      increase relative to the ``tail,'' or, as one analyst put it,      ``You want the 82nd Airborne training to kill people and blow      things up, not cleaning latrines or trimming hedges.'' They      also argue it's cheaper to hire contractors to do short-term      work rather than have the military maintain full-time      capabilities it needs only briefly.       A good example is Camp Arifjan, a U.S. Army base about 90      minutes southwest of Kuwait City. Six months ago, this was      nothing but a small collection of buildings that was supposed      to be a training base. On Oct. 11--the day Congress gave      President Bush authority to wage war on Iraq--someone in the      Pentagon picked up a phone and told KBR it had nine weeks to      run Arifjan into a full-blown Army base for 7,000 people. The      job went to Robert (Butch) Gatlin, a wizened 59-year-old      Tennessean who served 32 years in the Army Corps of Engineers      before coming to perform the same work, at much greater pay,      for KBR.       ``When we got here, there was no power or water,'' Gatlin      said as we stepped from the air-conditioned trailer that is      KBR's Arifjan headquarters into the blinding desert sun.      Within about 72 hours of the Pentagon's call, Gatlin had a      handful of KBR specialists--electricians, carpenters,      plumbers--on planes headed here. Most of the rest were      hired locally. ``I had a thousand people working here in      24 hours,'' he said. ``The Army can't do that.''       KBR essentially took an entire Army base out of containers      and made it rise in the middle of the Kuwaiti desert two days      ahead of schedule: air-conditioned tents complete with 110-     volt outlets for the soldiers' boom     boxes, male and female shower blocks, kitchens, a laundry,      Pepsi machines, a Nautilus-equipped health club with an      aerobics room (``Latin Dance Thurs & Sat!''), a rec center      with video games and a stack of Monopoly sets, a Baskin-     Robbins and a Subway sandwich shop. (No beer, though; alcohol      is illegal in Kuwait.) To conjure Camp Arifjan in a twinkling      amid one of the most hostile environments on the planet was      by any measure a stunning logistical achievement. And now, as      at many bases in the U.S., it's KBR civilian employees, not      soldiers, who cook, do the laundry, shuttle supplies and      control the airspace overhead. KBR does everything but fight.      Though it looks like an Army base, Camp Arifjan effectively      is a subsidiary of Kellogg Brown & Root. The Army is merely--     to use Gatlin's term--the ``client.''       The advantage to the Pentagon of using contractors goes      beyond logistics. Had the Army tried to build Camp Arifjan      itself last October, it would have had to mobilize      reservists, said Lt. Col. Karen LeDoux, the Logcap commander      at Arifjan. Activating reservists means disrupting families      and businesses and generating TV coverage of men and women      leaving home in uniform. In October, the war was still being      debated at the United Nations and in the streets. ``It's a      political decision to use contractors,'' LeDoux said. ``The      Army can get a delicate job done quietly.''       Outsourcing military missions also lets the Pentagon do      things Congress might not approve. Congress, for example, has      said the military can have only 400 U.S. soldiers in      Colombia, an oil-rich country destabilized by guerrillas and      the cocaine trade. But for years, civilian pilots employed by      DynCorp, a KBR competitor, have been flying what amount to      combat missions in Colombia under contract to the State      Department, spraying coca crops with defoliant and      occasionally getting shot at. Representative Janice      Schakowsky, Democrat of Chicago, has been trying to put a      stop to this kind of end run around Congressional oversight,      but in the bellicose post 9/11 atmosphere on Capitol Hill,      she can't get traction. Congress would never authorize the      U.S. military to perform such a politically explosive mission      as the Colombian spraying, Schakowsky argues, and if an      American soldier was killed in Colombia it would be Page 1      news.       ``Is the U.S. military privatizing its missions to avoid      public controversy or embarrassment--to hide body bags from      the media and shield the military from public opinion?'' she      asks. Iraq, Schakowsky says, is no different. ``We talk a lot      in Congress about how many U.S. troops are there and for how      long, but not at all about the contractors,'' she said.      ``They don't have to follow the same chain of command, the      military code of conduct may or may not apply, the      accountability is absent and the transparency is absent--but      the money keeps flowing.''       The General Accounting Office and several watchdog groups      say it's not yet even clear that Pentagon contractors are      cheaper in the long run than a larger military; the      experiment is still too young. And there are other concerns,      first among them the uncomfortable fact that the military can      find itself dependent in wartime on people it doesn't      control. Often, the only people who know how to run the      military's new high-tech gear are the geeks of the company      that makes it, so the soldiers manning, say, an Abrams      tank don't necessarily know how to fix it if it breaks.      After visiting Arifjan I met a reserve Air Force colonel      in the lobby of the Kuwait Hilton who told me the      communications gear on which his job depends is entirely      maintained by civilian employees of the manufacturer (he      wouldn't tell me which). ``We had a problem in the middle      of the night and called down for the contractor; they told      us he doesn't come in until 9 a.m.,'' the officer told me.      ``We're fighting a war, and the contractor doesn't come in      until 9 a.m.!'' And really, there's no guarantee the      contractor will be there at all if things get ugly.      Soldiers have to stay put when the shells start falling or      face punishment for desertion; contractors who decide the      high pay isn't worth the risk can simply leave. As the      Defense Department itself put it in a 1991 report,      ``D.O.D. Components cannot ensure that emergency-essential      services performed by contractors would continue during      crisis or hostile situations.'' And that was before the      big increase in Pentagon contracting.       From the public's point of view, the increasing use of      contractors makes it harder to know what the military is      really doing. The Pentagon has lots of maddening rules that      citizens have to follow if they want information, but while      the Pentagon has secrets, it also fundamentally recognizes      that it is a public institution. Not so the contractors,      whose first allegiance is to their shareholders and who have      little incentive to share information about how they operate.      Take salaries. An Army sergeant with four years' service      earns $48,292.03 a year, a captain with two years' service      earns $60,500.47 and a lieutenant colonel with six years'      service earns $87,299.81; the salaries are even posted on the      Internet. But when I asked a KBR spokeswoman how much her      people were earning for their hard, beerless months in the      desert, she said, ``We absolutely don't discuss salaries.''       ``Why not?'' I asked. ``You're paying them with taxpayer      money.''       ``We absolutely don't discuss salaries,'' she repeated.      (Later, a KBR manager told me on the sly that because he and      his colleagues have all their expenses paid by KBR and      Americans abroad pay no income tax on the first $80,000 they      earn annually, they expect to net $120,000.)       At Camp Arifjan, Butch Gatlin spoke of the good old days of      the late 90s, when he had signing authority for any purchase      up to half a million dollars. Then came the U.S. involvement      in Bosnia and Kosovo from 1995 to 2000, when one of every      seven Pentagon dollars passed through KBR and both the      company and the Pentagon got dinged by the General Accounting      Office for overspending. The G.A.O. said it found ``no      evidence that cost was taken into consideration.'' Last year,      KBR paid $2 million to settle federal fraud charges that it      inflated the cost of an Army contract in California and ``in      doing so, it increased its profits at the government's      expense.''       Now when Gatlin wants to buy anything over $2,500--which is      almost everything--he has to get a signature from an Army      officer living at Arifjan. ``He signs a lot,'' Gatlin sighed.      Cost-plus contracting offers the Army maximum flexibility; in      an emergency or a politically sensitive moment, KBR can      quietly throw as much money as necessary at a problem. But      the more KBR spends, the more it earns.       Bechtel, another hydra-headed American giant, won what's      often called the ``mother contract'' from the U.S. Agency for      International Development to revive Iraq's water, power and      electricity and the port of Umm Qasr. Unlike KBR, which fills      the Crowne Plaza with a huge regiment of Texans who actually      turn wrenches, Bechtel keeps fewer than 50 engineers and      managers quartered at the Kuwait Sheraton. Bechtel's client      is USAID, not the military, so none of its work is      classified, and that makes it easier to hire its muscle      locally. So while the lobby of the Crowne Plaza feels like a      particularly high-rent sergeants' club--noisy and smoky, men      clumping in work boots across the faux-Persian carpets--the      cool marble lobby of the Sheraton plays the role of officers'      billet to the reconstruction campaign. On the Sheraton's      black leather sofas, British businessmen perch primly in no-     wrinkle blazers, sample cases ready, watching for the      company golf shirt of a Bechtel executive to emerge from      the elevators.       Robert Sedgbeer, who works for a smallish British company      that makes cellphone towers, was fighting jet lag to stay      awake. ``If I can just get these into the right hands, my      trip will be worth it,'' he said, fingering a stack of      company literature and craning his neck for a Bechtel exec.      Stephen Thomas, whose achingly polite Oxbridge manner belies      his 15 years in Oman (``not bad''), said he hopes to sell      Bechtel his company's food-service and telecommunications      skills. Like Sedgbeer and everybody else in the lobby, he      lowered his voice when saying ``Bechtel,'' lest he risk      offending the keepers of the golden keys. ``We don't often      get the chance, in our lifetimes, to see a country with such      tremendous oil wealth and virtually no civilian commercial      infrastructure get a whole new blueprint,'' Thomas said      eagerly.       The revolving door that spins at the top of the military-     industrial ziggurat spins at the bottom too. On my way out of      Arifjan, I looked more closely at the heavily armed soldiers      guarding the gate and found they weren't soldiers at all, but      rather civilian employees of something called Combat Support      Associates, a joint venture of three obscure American      companies that provide the Army with security, logistics,      ``live-fire training'' and maintenance. In southern Iraq I      ran into four big men in full combat gear and Robocop      sunglasses whom I also took to be soldiers until I noticed      the tape over the left shirt breasts; instead of US ARMY, it      said EODT. That stands for ``Explosive Ordnance Disposal      Technology,'' not an Army unit but a company based in      Knoxville, Tenn. The Web site says EOD Technology ``applies      leading-edge geophysical technologies to provide documented      efficient solutions to environmental challenges,'' and what      that translates to is: these guys dig up minefields for a      living. Their challenge the day I saw them was an unexploded      American artillery round that had crashed through an oil      pipeline and was buried who-knew-where underneath. All four      used to be soldiers; now they do the same work at private-     sector wages.       It's an article of faith among KBR's people that they will      be in Iraq only a short while. KBR's top client, Brig. Gen.      Robert Crear of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is the man      in charge of Team RIO (Restore Iraqi Oil) and on a walking      tour of the Basra oil refinery he insisted that the Army's      role--and by extension KBR's--is temporary. ``This is an      Iraqi operation,'' he said several times. ``The oil belongs      to the Iraqi people. We are only support, and only until the      infrastructure is up and running.''       But neither he nor anybody else was able to say what ``up      and running'' means. Depending on how that question is      answered, companies like KBR will be in Iraq for months and      will make millions, or years, and make billions. Decades of      war and sanctions have left the wellheads, drills, pumps, and      pipelines so inefficient and unsafe that, by some estimates,      it will take $50 billion and a decade to fix them.       There is no question that companies like KBR are up to the      job. What isn't clear is whether there will come a day,      anytime soon, when the United States says, ``O.K.; good      enough,'' and goes home--leaving the Iraqi oil fields patched      together and its equipment semi-safe. Or does the effort to      ``assist the Iraqi people'' require a     decadelong, oil-financed bonanza for oil-service companies      like KBR/Halliburton? If anybody has the answer to that      question, he or she is not saying. ``That's way above my pay      grade,'' says General Crear.       What's certain is that as long as the Army is in Iraq, KBR      will be there with it. In Baghdad every morning, a crowd of      desperate job seekers gathers at dawn at the back gate of the      old Republican Palace compound, which is now U.S. Army      headquarters. At about 7, a Humvee full of KBR men roars up,      and like doorkeepers at the old Studio 54 they select a dozen      or so grateful men and women for menial tasks on the base.      Nobody objected to my watching this scene, but later, when a      photographer took out a camera, an Army public-affairs      officer walked up with his hand outstretched. ``The      authorities in charge have decided not to allow access at      this time,'' he said. When asked if those ``authorities''      were the Army or KBR, the officer sighed and said, ``To be      honest, the lines get a little blurred sometimes.''
