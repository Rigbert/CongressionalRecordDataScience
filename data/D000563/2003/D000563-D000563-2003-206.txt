President, I beg the forgiveness of my colleagues for this statement which I wrote rather quickly this morning.       There is weeping on Waveland,       And Sheffield is dark,       Another sad ending       At Addison and Clark.       The Cubbies lost the big one       In the very last game.       A season so different       Has ended the same.       There's no joy in Wrigleyville       As the ivy turns brown,       But who can forget,       The Cubs lit up the town.       Our Boys of Summer       Were a loveable crew,       With Sosa, Lofton,       And Moises Alou.       Prior, Wood, and Zambrano       Threw fire at our foes,       And we counted Farnsworth       And Borowski to close.       Ramirez, Gonzales,       Grudzielanek, and Karros,       Joined Miller and Bako       To keep the games close.       Our skipper was new       From the city by the Bay       But ``In Dusty we Trusty''       From opener to closing day.       If Baker was the brains,       Each win had another part.       Our perfect 10, Ron Santo,       Was in every Cubby's heart.       America, we thank you       For loving the Cubs,       For cheering our long shots       In your living rooms and pubs.       Now in our despair       There's one thing to say.       Spring training is only       Four months away.       Next spring when the green       Is back on the vines,       Cubs fans will pour       Into the Friendly Confines.       America, don't give up,       Don't falter, don't grieve.       If you wanna be a Cub fan,       You gotta believe.                          ____________________
