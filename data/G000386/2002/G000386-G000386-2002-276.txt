 As Senator Lott brought up about tax benefits for COBRA insurance, there was divisiveness during the debate on economic stimulus, and it kept economic stimulus from passing.  It seems to me that a bill that was voted out of committee by 18 to 3 should not be handled in any other spirit than the spirit of that vote within the Finance Committee, which is typical of the way the Senate ought to work, and also a follow-on of how our committee has always worked to produce good bills which have come out of the committee most of the time with bipartisan support.  In so many other areas other than just this one, I compliment my Democrat counterpart, Senator Baucus, and his staff for trying to work through some of the disagreements that might come up on the floor of the Senate.  I think there is a terrible pressure for more to be done, and that it is going to be divisive. I hope we can get past that. For instance, in the case of health insurance and incentives for the unemployed to have health insurance, that is a very worthy issue. But that ought to come up in the context of dealing with the issue, as the President has presented it, of tax credits for all of the uninsured so they will be able to buy health insurance. We should not take that issue up with the very narrow part of the unemployed because of the relationship to trade. That should come up as an issue for all of the uninsured, and we should deal with that as a separate issue.
