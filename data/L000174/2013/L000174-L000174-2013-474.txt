President, I will not engage the Senator from Arizona with questions. I don't want to delay his reading time.  I appreciate the work the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee has done, and the distinguished ranking member, the senior Senator from Alabama. I worked with both of them for decades on the Appropriations Committee. I know they are diligent. They are hard working. In fact, I recall a discussion with the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland when she agreed to take this assignment. I told her I couldn't think of anybody better on our side of the aisle to be the chair of this committee because I know how hard she works and how well she works with the ranking member.  I spoke also with the distinguished Senator from Alabama at the time--again, somebody who knows how to get things done on appropriations. He and I have negotiated things over the years. We have always kept our word to each other, just as the Senator from Maryland has. Now it is time to debate the bill on the floor and it pains me that having got this far, two senators are preventing anyone else from offering amendments.  It is unfortunate we are discussing a continuing resolution because if left to the three Senators who are currently on the floor--the Senator from Alabama, the Senator from Maryland, and myself--we know we would be fully capable of completing action on individual appropriations bills. In fact, they were painstakingly negotiated by the Senate and the House as part of an omnibus legislative package last December. But then, for reasons we don't have to go into here, a year's work of seven appropriations subcommittees was dumped in the wastebasket, not because of the two leaders but because of others.  Unfortunately, that means we have been funding the government on autopilot. None of us who have spent time on the Appropriations Committee wants this because we know it wastes money and sequestration will make a bad situation even worse.  Having said that, I think what Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby have done in negotiating this continuing resolution is far better than putting the government on autopilot as we did last December.  I wish to talk about title 7 of this resolution, which concerns the Department of State and Foreign Operations. The House continuing resolution included several changes in the fiscal year 2012 appropriations act. The Senate incorporated those changes with minor modifications. Senator Lindsey Graham and I included other changes we believe are critical to our national security. Top officials at the State Department and the Pentagon agree with us.  We did our best to avoid spending money on things that may have made sense in fiscal year 2012 but are a waste today. I will give an example. The House continuing resolution includes another $250 million for the Iraq police training program, the same amount as in fiscal year 2012. Yet the State Department plans to spend zero in fiscal year 2013. That is just an example of why we should go, if we could, by the regular order, because nobody wants this money.  There have been a lot of changes in the world since December 2011 when the 2012 bill was signed by the President. There is the catastrophe in Syria, with millions of people fleeing their homes, which threatens to engulf the entire region. Benghazi and Mali are other examples. Conditions are changing in Egypt, Afghanistan, and in our own hemisphere. We face growing challenges in East Asia and the Pacific.  Now, we should not say, as these challenges come up--sometimes overnight--that well, two or three years ago we passed a bill, so there is no need to do one this year. The world does not stand still.  I think the chairwoman is doing a superb job, and Ranking Member Shelby is showing, as usual, his many years of experience and hard work. I thank Senator Lindsey Graham and his staff, who have provided very constructive input.  In the past, appropriations bills were always a bipartisan effort. We worked together. I think of Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens on this floor working things out; my predecessor as President pro tempore, Senator Inouye, and Senator Cochran working things out.  Title VII of this resolution is a grand total of 11\1/2\ pages. Out of over 500 pages, it is 11\1/2\ pages. It should not take long to read. We do not expect amendments, but if we get them, I hope we can act on them quickly.  Mr. President, if nobody is seeking the floor, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue for 5 minutes as though in morning business.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Without objection, it is so ordered.             Arrest and Prosecution of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith
