Madam Speaker, as we stand here, a 5-year-old woke up in a cage. She committed no crime. She came here seeking hope and refuge.  Instead, Madam Speaker, she was taken from her parents, from her bothers and sisters, from all she knows and loves. She does not know where she is; she does not know where her family is; she does not speak the language of her captives; and she may never see her family again.  This morning, Madam Speaker, that innocent little child is crying in a cage, and we stand here doing nothing as innocent little babies sit in modern-day camps.  That is not right; it is not fair; and it is not just. And, Madam Speaker, history will not be kind to us if we continue to pass this unbelievable injustice on to our children.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).
