Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2000 is legislation I have introduced in consultation with the Alaskan Federation of Natives. Considerable time has been spent to resolve the Calista land exchange issue,and I want to thank all parties involved for their commitment to resolve this important land exchange for Calista.  This land exchange was authorized to provide Calista with a means of economic self-sufficiency pursuant to the purposes of ANCSA. Under Section 8126 of the Defense appropriations Bill, the Secretary of the Interior and Calista were to determine a mutual agreement value for Calista's land. However, the two parties have been unable to arrive at a mutually agreeable value. Section 6 of this bill will eliminate this impasse by establishing a total value to be credited to Calista's lands and interests, as Congress has had to do in numerous other instances in 1976. In doing so Congress, will simply be providing the figure with Calista and the Secretary of the Interior were unable to determine.  I have two letters of support for section 6, the Calista land exchange, from six conservation organizations. Mr. Speaker, these organizations stated their support for the Calista land exchange when the lands offered by Calista was 28,000 acres of surface lands and 182,000 acres of subsurface lands. Calista has gone further in their commitment to address conservation issues within the region by increasing their surface acres to 56,577 and subsurface to 161,938 acres. The land package includes an overall of 218,515 acres of land, one-third the size of Rhode Island. These five conservation organizations recognize the fish and wildlife habitat of lands offered for exchange by the Calista Corporation. All of these lands, interests in land and subsurface estates in the exchange are located within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.  I would like to point out to the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller), my esteemed colleague, that the white-fronted geese and pacific brant are only a couple of the species which migrate to California from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. It appears to me that Mr. Miller and I have birds of a feather which hold strong ties between our respective States. Let us hope this will carry over to the agreement of this important wildlife refuge land exchange.  Lastly, the language contained in Section 6 of the Calista land exchange was coauthored by the Department of Interior, and the Calista Corporation reached a consensus with this important land exchange in America. At the request of the Department, Calista Corporation provided legal descriptions of lands being exchanged, a conservation easement agreement and added more surface lands. This was accomplished after intense discussion and negotiation of the Department of Interior. The language is also a product of efforts by Calista and the Department of Interior to address issues which were raised by that Department, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, the House Committee on the Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. I urge my colleagues to support this important exchange for the good of the environment on the terms which are very extensive and lengthy negotiations to address all parties concerned. I urge my colleagues again to support the passage of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following for the Record:       The Calista Conveyance and Relinquishment Document (CCRD)                            October 28, 1991                      [Revised September 22, 1998]       (Revised September 22, 1998 to reflect changes to      previously included Calista parcels, additions of the NIMA      and The Kuskokwim Corporation (TKC) tracts to the lands being      offered, The TKC Conservation Easement, and other relevant      edits.)

Purpose       The purpose of this document is to identify the lands,      interests in lands, and entitlements to lands owned by      Calista Corporation and three Native Village Corporations      which are to be exchanged for property held by the U.S.      Government or otherwise conveyed to the United States,      pursuant to an agreement with the Calista Corporation and the      participating Native Village Corporations. The Calista      Corporation represents the largest rural Native population in      Alaska and includes some of the poorest economic conditions      in the States. Yet, under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement      Act formula, Calista received less land per capita than any      other regional corporation.       The underlying purposes of the Calista land exchange,      authorized by Section 8126 of P.L. 102-172, include--       (1) assisting Calista to convert its principal tangible      asset, its lands, to property that can be used to help the      Corporation remain viable, develop economically, and continue      to carry out its responsibilities as envisioned in ANCSA to      the people of the Calista Region; and       (2) helping to ensure and enhance the long-term      conservation of Native-owned fish and wildlife habitat      located within the boundaries of Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge.       The Calista land exchange authorizes the exchange of      interests in land largely located within the boundaries of      the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge owned by Calista      Corporation, NIMA Corporation, Nunapiglluraq Corporation, and      The Kuskokwim Corporation (Alaska native Village      Corporations) for other property owned by the federal      government. The Calista exchange has been modeled on other      post-ANCSA property settlements.       With respect to the content of the exchange, the Secretary      of the Interior, the Calista Regional Corporation and the      participating Native village corporations agree upon the      lands, interests in lands, relinquishments, and adjustments      to entitlement that may be offered to the United States      pursuant to this document and enacting legislation consistent      with its terms. The parties also agree with the amounts to be      made available in the property account once all conveyances      and relinquishments are completed and the needs which form      the basis for such amounts. The parties do not necessarily      agree on the hortatory statements and descriptions which are      included in this document, but such disagreements will not      affect the implementation of this exchange.       Descriptions of wildlife values are provided herein for      some surface lands which are not offered in the exchange and      which will remain privately owned by Native village      corporations. Such surface lands and any wildlife values or      other surface values of these lands form no part of the      consideration for the exchange.         II The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act       The Calista land exchange involves interest in land which      are largely located within the boundaries of a National      conservation system unit established in 1980 by the Alaska      National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (P.L. 96-     487). Among other things, ANICLA significantly expanded the      National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska.       Among the purpose of ANILCA are these--       ``to preserve unrivaled scenic and geological values      associated with natural landscapes;       to provide for the maintenance of sound populations of, and      habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable value to the      citizens of Alaska and the Nation, including those species      dependent on vast relatively undeveloped areas;       to preserve in their natural state extensive unaltered      Arctic tundra, boreal forest, and coastal rainforest      ecosystems;       to protect the resources related to subsistence needs. . .      .''       Section 103(c) of ANILCA provides that if ``. . . a Native      Corporation . . . desires to convey any such lands, the      Secretary may acquire such lands . . . and any such lands      shall become part of the unit, and be administered      accordingly.''       ANILCA also provides that the purposes ``for which the      Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge is established and shall      be managed include--       (i) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats      in their natural diversity including, but no limit to,      shorebirds, seabirds, whistling swans, emperor, white-fronted      and Canada geese, black brant and other migratory birds,      salmon, muskox and marine mammals; . . .       (iii  to provide . . . the opportunity for continued      subsistence uses by local residents . . .''       consistent with the purposes of ANICLA and the Yukon Delta      National Wildlife Refuge, the lands in this exchange package      will become part of the Refuge upon completion     of the transactions authorized in the Calista land package.                     III. The Calista Land Exchange       The Calista Corporation is an Alaska Native Regional      Corporation organized under authority of the Alaska Native      Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) whose lands are located in      Southwestern Alaska. It includes more than 50 Yupik Villages      in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.       The Calista land exchange involves a total of approximately      218,515 acres of land or interests in land, including 46,577      acres of surface fee and conservation easements protecting      the surface resources and habitat, and approximately 208,515      acres of subsurface estate, all within the YDNWR as well as      10,000 acres of entitlement to surface fee which may be      selected adjacent to the YDNWR. The actual acreage in the      conveyances is substantially larger than this because the      computation of acreage deletes lakes more than 50 acres in      size and rivers more than 198 feet in width. Title to these      water bodies will also be transferred to the United States if      the water bodies are not navigable. The subsurface lands in      this lands package are in a very deep sedimentary basin whose      geology indicates the potential for hydrocarbon deposits.      Thus far, exploration on Calista subsurface lands has been      minimal and at relatively shallow depths. If significant      hydrocarbon deposits are discovered, however, it would be      unlikely that such lands would be available for exchange or      acquisition in the future.                  IV. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Values       All of the lands, interests in lands and subsurface estates      in the exchange located are within the Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Alaska. Additionally, Calista      Corporation is offering an entitlement to 10,000 acres of      land. The Calista Region is a sedimentary basin created over      the millennia by the flow of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.       The region is composed of extensive wetlands, marshes, some      highlands and mountains, estuaries, streams and riverine      areas. Because of the character of the land, it has been for      centuries, and is today, a highly productive and principal      nesting area for countless thousands of shorebirds,      waterfowl, passerines and other wildlife. (See maps following      page 4)       Some of the waterfowl and other birds inhabiting this      region are: Spectacled Eider, Gyrfalcon, Tundra Swans, White-     fronted Goose, Steller's Eider, Bristle thighed Curlew,      Northern Goshawk, Swainson's Thrush, Golden Eagle, Snow      Geese, Peregrine Falcon, Gray Cheeked Thrush, King Eider,      Black Brant, Great Horned Owl, Blackpoll Warbler, Northern      Pintail, Cackling Canada Goose, Emperor Goose, Canvasback,      Wilson's Warbler, Arctic Tern, and Harlequin Duck.       Additionally, the Calista region is also home to wolves,      brown and black bear, moose, caribou, otter, fox and many      other species of wildlife, as well as all major species of      salmon, grayling, sheefish, rainbow trout, dolly varden,      blackfish, pike and four species of white fish.       According to the U.S.F.W.S. the following are a few of the      superlatives describing the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta/Calista      Region:       Up to 80% of the world population of Pacific black brant      breed or nest on the coastal fringe of the Yukon Koskokwim      Delta Region;       Virtually the entire breeding population of cackling Canada      geese nest in the Region;       Approximately 90% of the world's population of emperor      geese nest in the Region;       Almost all of the world's population of white-fronted geese      nest in the Region;       Sixty percent of the world's breeding bristle-thighed      curlew nest in the Region;       100% of the world's black turntone population inhabit the      Region;       Nesting by a majority of world's populations of Western      Sandpipers and Pacific dunlins;       Highest diversity of the world's large shorebirds;       Over 800,000 ducklings, or approximately 50% of the      statewide total, were produced from the region;       Eight species of raptors breed in this region.       Disclaimer: The information in this section regarding fish      and wildlife habitat values of the Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge is intended to provide the reader with an      overview of the values attendant to the Refuge itself and is      not intended to relate those values to subsurface interests      offered in this proposal. Also, the fish and wildlife values      discussed in connection with subsurface parcels clearly      relate and are intended to relate to the overlying surface      estate regardless of whether the surface estate is included      in this proposal. For detailed information regarding the      birds which inhabit or have been identified as using the      lands in specific parcels in this lands package, please refer      to the document prepared by Calista, entitled ``Background      Information on Fish and Wildlife Habitat Resources of the      Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Region and the Calista Native Regional      Corporation Land Exchange Parcels'' as revised 1997, which is      based on information gathered over the years from the Yupik      Eskimos who inhabit the Region and other sources.

Current Social Conditions       The state of living conditions for most of the Native      people of the Calista Region can be difficult for outsiders      to comprehend. Many of the basics of life which the rest of      America takes for granted--running water, flush toilets,      trash collection, paved roads, neighborhood schools, a doctor      in the community, an ambulance in time of medical emergency,      the fire department, a regular paycheck from a job, a public      library--barely exist within the region. The following      disturbing statistics reflect both causes and symptoms of the      problems endemic to the region. The Calista Region has:       The highest infant mortality rate in the Nation;       A concentration of the population under the age of five,      approximately 14.5%, among the highest in the Nation;       Rates of hepatitis, meningitis and tuberculosis that are      among the highest in the Nation;       Higher invasive cervical cancer rates than the rest of the      population, growing 335% at a time when rates for U.S. whites      and blacks decreased over 40%;       High rates of alcoholism, drug abuse and domestic violence;       Extraordinarily high suicide rates: 10% of all young men      will commit or attempt suicide by the age of 25;       Unemployment rates of between 60% and 90%;       Inadequate sanitation with limited running water or indoor      plumbing facilities;       The second highest rate of multi-generational housing in      Alaska, with 16.4% of the households containing three or more      generations per household;       The highest rate of household overcrowding in Alaska, with      nearly 81% of the houses in the Calista Region containing      less than 300 square feet;       The lowest level of education of all Americans, Alaska      Natives complete only an average of 9.3 years, compared to      12.5 years for all Americans; and       Teen pregnancy rates of more than twice the national      average.       The Calista land exchange is being pursued by the Calista      Corporation as a key element in its efforts to remain a      viable Native Regional corporation with the capacity to help      effectively address these social and health issues. The      exchange will help the Calista Corporation work for      improvements in basic community infrastructure and facilities      in the region. In the Calista Region, there are, at present,      few economic resources other than the fish and wildlife upon      which to base the economy. In addition, the exchange has the      potential to create business opportunities and expand      employment for the Region, thereby providing individuals      with greater means to help themselves and their      communities.       The Calista Region has never experienced economic booms      like other areas of the state. The Calista Region and its      residents were left out of the Trans-Alaska pipeline      construction boom. The Region was too far away to provide      services and village residents had neither the skills nor the      trade union membership necessary to get the jobs available      during construction of the pipeline. As local economies in      other areas of the state grew throughout the 1970's and      1980's, the Calista Region's economy, with the exception of      construction, actually declined and local residents became      even more dependent on state and federal monies for survival.       Government spending is the single most important component      of the Regional economy, as is the case in much of rural      Alaska. The stability of the Calista Region's economy has      been largely dependent upon outside public funding;      consequently the economy is very vulnerable to state or      federal budgetary and program adjustments. In 1990, it was      estimated that state and federal expenditures accounted for      approximately 65% of the total wages earned by the residents      of the Calista Region.       The growth of government, trade and services sectors has      resulted in more white collar/professional jobs in the      Region. However, most men living in the villages are trained      as blue collar workers and laborers so the Region has a      disproportionately high amount of blue collar labor available      for the few labor related jobs available. As a result, new      white collar jobs are often filled by outsiders coming into      the Region with the necessary skills.                 VIII. Prehistory of Yukon Delta Region       The lands of this Region were probably inhabited from at      least 10,000 years ago to about 7,000 years ago by people of      the Paleo-Arctic Tradition. From about 7,000 years ago to      about 4,000 years ago people of the Northern Archaic      Tradition lived in the area. This tradition was followed by      the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, 4,000 to 3,000 years ago,      and by the Norton Tradition, from 3,000 to 1,000 years ago.      The archaeological record documents the lengthy human      habitation of the area and more importantly, the cultural      roots of the Region's contemporary Yupik inhabitation. The      cultural ancestors of present-day Western Region Yupik      Eskimos were living in and utilizing the subsistence      resources of the Region since about A.D. 1000.       While the Refuge has moderate populations of mammals,      including small furbearers, moose, caribou, and recently re-     established musk-ox, the primary wildlife resource is the      enormous populations of ducks, geese, swans, shorebirds, and      water birds that nest on the Delta. An estimated 100 million      waterfowl, shorebirds, and sea birds representing over 50      species use the Delta for nesting and for resting and feeding      during migration. A large percentage of the migrating birds      of the Pacific Flyway originate from the Yukon Delta. (See      maps in Appendix C).       The importance of the Delta as nesting grounds for North      American waterfowl increases yearly as productive prairie      pothole nesting habitats in the United States and Canada are      drained for agriculture or are lost to drought.                    IX. Land Transaction Accounting       The accounting, and, to the extent necessary, the      establishment of a property account required by subsection      (c) of Section 8126 of P.L. 102-172, upon relinquishment and      conveyance by Calista (and where relevant, The Hamilton      Corporation, The Kuskokwim Corporation, or NIMA Corporation)      of the lands and interest in lands in this document shall be      based on and credited with, respectively, a total amount of      $39.4 million for the lands interests in lands and other      considerations referenced in this document. For purposes of      Section 7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43      U.S.C. 1606(i)), ``Revenues'' are only those realized in      excess of $20 million from the compensation received by      Calista under Section 8126 subsection (b)(1) as amended for      subsurface estate listed in the Calista Conveyance and      Relinquishment Document.X. Description of the Lands, Interest in lands and Entitlements to Land                              To Be Conveyed                 hamilton/yukon delta area--7,135 acres       Location. The Hamilton parcel is located near the delta      complex at the mouth of the Yukon River between Apoon Pass      and Nanvaranak Slough. It is approximately 20 miles south of      Norton Sound.       General Description. The Hamilton parcel consists of 7135      acres of combined surface and subsurface estate. The lands      are part of the wet muskeg coastal plain with slough, lake      and pond habitats. Several small sloughs head in the parcel      and dozens of small lakes and ponds and their adjacent      marshes and wetlands are scattered throughout the parcel.      Most of the land is less than 20 feet above sea level and the      dwarf tundra vegetation is underlain by sand and silty flood      plain material. The southern part of the parcel contains some      areas of deciduous shrub land and has more extensive grassy      marshlands and riverine habitats. The parcel is five miles      south of the Yukon River Delta unit of the historic Clarence      Rhode Wildlife Range and the abandoned Village of Hamilton.       Refuge Values of the Surface. The chief habitat and      wildlife value of the parcel is waterfowl nesting. The parcel      is contiguous to coastal plain habitat to the north and west,      and is used by geese, swans, sandhill cranes, ducks, loons,      and numerous shorebirds, including curlews, sandpipers, and      plovers. Maps of species distribution by density blocks,      produced by U.S. Fish and Wildlife, show the area to have      medium range densities for pintail ducks, scaup, and tundra      swans: one to four birds per square mile, and up to one per      square mile densities for Canada geese, Arctic loons, and      sandhill cranes. Other nesting birds include white-fronted      geese, scoters, shovellers, and mallards. Shorebirds of      several species are common to abundant. Whitefish,      sheefish (inconnu), and northern pike are common in the      sloughs and larger lakes. Furbearers such as mink, otter,      muskrat, beaver, Arctic and red fox are abundant, but      large mammals are rare due to the lack of protective      cover. The land has been assigned a medium priority rank      in the Alaska Priority System.       Hamilton Subsurface. The subsurface beneath the Hamilton      surface lands is part of the Yukon Delta/Norton Sound      Sedimentary Basin. Calista leased the Yukon Delta subsurface      lands to Amoco Exploration in 1978. These lands have also had      several generations of seismic survey work since the early      1970's and the area continues to receive oil industry      attention.  hamilton parcel (nunapiglluraq corporation and calista corporation                                  lands)       Nunapiglluraq Corporation (for the village of Hamilton)      will convey to the United States of America the surface      estate for the following described lands that it received in      Interim Conveyance No. 562, dated October 28, 1982. Calista      Corporation will convey to the United States of America the      subsurface estate for the following described lands that it      received in Interim Conveyance No. 563, dated October 28,      1982. Nunapiglluraq Corporation entitlement to lands under      Section 12 (a) and Calista Corporation rights under Section      14(f) of ANCSA will be reduced by the acreage specified in      the below described legal description.     Hamilton Parcel Land Description                 Seward Meridian, Alaska, (Unsurveyed)     T. 31 N., R. 77 W.     Secs. 29 and 30.       Containing approximately 735 acres.     T. 31 N., R. 78 W.     Secs. 1 and 2;     Secs. 11 through 14;     Secs. 23, 24, and 25.       Containing approximately 5,440 acres.     T. 32 N., R. 78 W.     Sec. 35, S\1/2\.     Sec. 36.       Containing approximately 960 acres.       Aggregating approximately 7,135 acres.                      dall lake area--12,486 acres       Location. The Dall Lake parcel is located along the      southeastern border of Dall Lake southeast of Bethel, Alaska,      about 30 miles from the Bering Sea waters of Etolin Strait.      It borders the eastern boundary of the Nelson Island unit of      the Clarence Rhode National Wildlife Range.       General Description. The Dall Lake parcel is a surface and      subsurface selection of approximately 12,486 acres. This      parcel consists of low elevation wetlands dotted with      innumerable lakes and ponds along the southeastern border of      Dall Lake, an extremely large inland lake covering more than      150 square miles. Wet muskeg tundra vegetation and lake      margins characterize the habitat at Dall Lake.       Refuge Values of the Surface. The Dall Lake parcel lies      within the Yukon-Kuskokwim lowlands unit of the Yukon Delta      NWR. This unit is largely wetlands, habitat for a diversity      of fish and wildlife including geese, ducks, swans,      shorebirds, moose, caribou, many species of fur bearers,      ptarmigan, and many other bird and mammal species.       The area is an important producer of ducks and is      significant as a staging area for thousands of snow geese      migrating to and from their nesting grounds on Wrangell      Island in the Soviet Far East. US Fish & Wildlife Service has      indicated high scaup nesting densities of four to 12 birds      per square mile, and pintail and scoter densities of one to      four per square mile in the area. Also occurring at densities      of one to four birds per square mile are tundra swans, Canada      geese, Arctic loons, and sandhill cranes. Other species noted      in aerial surveys within the parcel area were red-throated      loons, white-fronted geese, old squaw ducks, and mallards.      Both shorebirds and ptarmigan are common in the area.       Approximately 30 musk oxen use the Dall Lake area year      around. These musk oxen are part of the growing 100-head      mainland herd established on Nelson Island which is currently      expanding its range to inland parts of the refuge. Fur      bearers such as mink, otter, muskrat, and red fox are common      in the Dall Lake area and are important subsistence      resources. The lakes and waterways contain resident Arctic      char, whitefish, northern pike, cisco, and burbot, all used      by villagers for subsistence. The land has been assigned a      high priority in the Alaska Priority System.       Subsurface Values. The subsurface beneath the Dall Lake      surface lands is in the central portion of the Bethel/     Kuskokwim Delta Sedimentary Basin. Calista leased the Bethel      Basin lands to Shell Exploration in 1974. Like the Yukon      Delta area, these lands have had several generations of      seismic survey work since the early 1970's and the area      continues to receive oil industry attention. In 1962 a single      test well was placed on the flank of what is now defined as      the Bethel Basin. In the future it is likely that this      sedimentary basin, which is nearly the size of Oklahoma, will      receive more exploration.   DALL LAKE PARCEL (NIMA CORPORATION AND CALISTA CORPORATION LANDS)       The legal description below describes lands validly      selected by NIMA Corporation (for the village of Mekoryuk)      under Section 12(a) of ANCSA.

Dall Lake Parcel Land Description                  Steward Meridian, Alaska Unsurveyed     T. 1 N., R. 82 W.     Secs. 23 through 36.       Containing approximately 7,716 acres.     T. 1 N., R. 83 W.     Sec. 25;     Secs. 26 and 27, excluding U.S. Survey 10449;     Sec. 28;     Secs. 33 through 36.       Containing approximately 4,770 acres.       Aggregating approximately 12,486 acres.                         NIMA AREA--9,958 acres       Location. The NIMA parcel adjoins the Dall Lake parcel on      its northern border. It is located near the southeastern      shore of Dall Lake, southeast of Bethel, Alaska, about 30      miles from the Bering Sea waters of Etolin Strait.       General Description. The NIMA parcel is a surface and      subsurface conveyance of approximately 9,958 acres. This      parcel consists of low elevation wetlands and lakes and ponds      near the southeastern shore of Dall Lake, an extremely large      inland lake covering more than 150 square miles. Wet muskeg      tundra vegetation and lake margins characterize the habitat      at Dall Lake.       Refuge Values of the Surface. The NIMA parcel has the same      habitat and subsurface attributes as the Dall Lake parcel,      with which it is contiguous. Therefore, the Refuge and      Subsurface values are the same as for the adjoining Dall Lake      parcel.      NIMA PRACEL (NIMA CORPORATION AND CALISTA CORPORATION LANDS)       NIMA Corporation (for the village of Mekoryuk) will convey      to the United States of America the surface estate for the      following described lands it received in Interim Conveyance      No. 453, dated November 20, 1981. Calista Corporation will      convey the subsurface estate to the United States of America      for the following described lands that it received in Interim      Conveyance No. 454, dated November 20, 1981. Additionally      Calista Corporation shall file a relinquishment to the in-     lieu selections under Serial Number AA-8099-1 top filed on      any lands described below that are identified for sale to the      United States of America. NIMA Corporation entitlement to      lands under Section 12(a) and Calista Corporation rights      under Section 14(f) of ANCSA will be reduced by the acreage      specified in the below described legal description.     NIMA Parcel Land Description                 Seward Meridian, Alaska, (Unsurveyed)     T. 1 N., R., 82 W.     Secs. 1 through 22.       Containing approximately 9,958 acres.       Aggregating approximately 9,958 acres.                     Hooper bay area--21,190 acres       Location. The Hooper Bay parcel is located on Dall Point;      Kokechik Bay is on the north, Hooper Bay on the south, and      the Bering Sea to the west. It is adjacent to the Clarence      Rhode National Wildlife Range unit of the Yukon Delta      National Wildlife Refuge on its eastern border.       General Description. The Hooper Bay parcel consists of      subsurface estate. The surface is owned by Sea Lion      Corporation and is not offered as a part of this proposal.      The surface estate is coastal plain with innumerable small      ponds and lakes and several small sloughs. Most of the parcel      is below 50 feet in elevation. Long shore sand spits form      northern and southern extensions of the land, and dunes form      Dall Point itself. The village of Hooper Bay is located at      the mouth of Napareayak Slough on Hooper Bay.       Habitat Values of the Surface. Village corporation lands      overlying the offered subsurface estate include Kokechik Bay      frontage with some of the highest value habitat rankings on      the Yukon Wildlife Delta Refuge. Although acquisition of the      subsurface estate will prevent development of subsurface      resources and any related disruption of the surface, the      village corporation may develop the surface estate. These      lands are biologically productive, tide-influenced marshlands      critical to the Arctic nesting geese species. High densities      of nesting emperor, white fronted, and cackling Canada geese      utilize this rich marshland, and it is also important for      nesting swans, cranes, ducks, loons and abundant numbers of      several species of shorebirds. Northern pintails in the      coastal zone occur at three times the density that they occur      in the interior delta, averaging four to 12 per square mile      in F aerial surveys. Scaup also occur at these densities      and other ducks such as old squaw, spectacled and common      eider, scoters, shovellers, and mallards also utilize the      habitat. The mudflats and sand spits in both bays are vital      feeding and staging areas for vast numbers of migrating      waterfowl and shorebirds.       Subsurface Values. These lands have been subject to oil and      gas leases twice in the recent past. The geology is      permissive of several mineral deposit types; however, there      are no known occurrences of minerals in this poorly explored      Region.             Hooper bay parcel (Calista corporation lands)       Calista Corporation will convey the subsurface estate to      the United States of America for the following described      lands that it received in Interim Conveyances Nos. 511, dated      May 28, 1982, and 579, dated December 22, 1982. The surface      estate of these lands is being retained by Sea Lion      Corporation (for the village of Hooper Bay). Calista      Corporation rights under Section 14(f) of ANCSA will be      reduced by the acreage specified in the below described legal      description. The surface acreage charged against Sea Lion      Corporation 12(a) entitlement will not be affected.

Containing approximately 9,035 acres.       Aggregating approximately 21,190 acres.                     scammon bay area--77,512 acres       Location. The Scammon Bay parcel is located on the Bering      Sea coast at Scammon Bay on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.       General Description. The Scammon Bay parcel is a large      tract (25 miles long by up to 12 miles across) of subsurface      estate, whose surface estate is privately owned by Askinuk      Corporation, the Native corporation of Scammon Bay village,      is not involved in this conveyance. The parcel includes      77,512 acres of conveyed subsurface estate and remaining      subsurface entitlements at Scammon Bay. The parcel includes      about 20 miles of Bering Sea coastline.       The surface overlying this subsurface parcel consists of      several distinct habitats. There is a prominent, rocky,      mountainous upland to the south which is used by upland      ground-nesting birds such as ptarmigan, rock sandpipers,      golden and semi-palmated plovers, short-eared owls, and      jaegers. Steep rocky bluffs, fast, clear streams, and small      sheltered bays characterize the parcel's 14 miles of Bering      Sea shoreline on the southern shore of the bay. The mountains      rise to an elevation of 1,465 feet within the parcel. The      intrusive volcanic rock that forms the mountains is useful as      quarry material and is currently being extracted for an      airport improvement project at the village of Scammon Bay.      The southern border of the parcel is adjacent to the Kokechik      Bay/Paimuit unit of the Clarence Rhode Unit of the YDNWR      which has some of the most significant habitat values on the      Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta National Wildlife Refuge due to its      intensive use by Arctic nesting geese species.       To the north, the overlying habitat is a flat coastal plain      utilized by Arctic nesting geese such as the endangered      white-fronted geese, emperor geese and cackling Canada geese.      The coastal plain is dissected by the large, shallow meanders      of the Kun River and several smaller tributaries including      the Kikneak and Ear Rivers. Habitat includes tidal sloughs      and estuaries, beach ridges and swales, lake and pond shores,      and sedge meadows important to nesting and brood-rearing.       Habitat Values of the Surface. The offered Scammon Bay      surface parcel underlies Native land in the delta coastal      plain unit of the Yukon Delta NWR. Although acquisition of      the subsurface estate will prevent development of subsurface      resources and any related disruption of the surface, the      village corporation may develop the surface estate. The      dominant feature of this unit is vast wetlands characterized      by thousands of thaw lakes and ponds underlain by permafrost.      The freeze-thaw cycle coupled with regular tidal and riverine      flooding maintain a herbaceous wetland that is excellent      waterfowl habitat. It is considered the best goose-brant      nesting area in North America. Historically, one half of the      continental populations of brant nested on the coastal      fringe, as do nearly the entire populations of cackling      Canada and emperor geese. Most of the Pacific flyway      population of white-fronted geese also nest here. In addition      to cackling Canada geese, two other subspecies of Canada      geese--both Taverner's and lesser Canada geese--are also      found within this unit. The three subspecies appear to favor      slightly different zones with cacklers nesting in a ten mile      wide band closest to the sea, Taverner's moving inland      slightly, and lesser Canada's somewhat more inland.       These zones, however, do overlap. The area is also      considered part of the largest and most important shorebird      habitat in the Pacific Flyway. It is the largest single      expanse of intertidal habitat in North or South America, and      provides the major breeding grounds for North American      populations of black turnstone, dunlin, western sandpiper,      rock sandpiper, and bar-tailed godwit, as well as being an      important staging area for bristle-thighed curlews.       The periodic flooding of the tidal marshes of the coastal      plain creates a rich food source for nesting and rearing      young and contributes to goose, swan, and crane densities of      one to 12 per square mile with heaviest nesting densities      along the coast (US Fish & Wildlife aerial surveys). Pintail      and scaup (four to 12 per square mile), scoter (one to four      per square mile), old squaw, spectacled eiders, loons (up to      12 per square mile), and shorebirds also nest on the coastal      plain. Mink, otter, muskrat, beaver, and Arctic and red fox      are common to abundant.       Subsurface Values. These lands have been subject to oil and      gas leases twice in the recent past. The geology is      permissive of several mineral deposit types; however, little      is known of the occurrence of minerals in this poorly      explored Region. The known current     value of the subsurface estate in the Scammon Bay area is      based to a large extent on the ready supply of sand, gravel      and rock. This area is the only local source for these      materials in a Region where such materials are scarce and      costly.             scammon bay parcel (calista corporation lands)       Calista Corporation will convey the subsurface estate to      the United States of America for the following described      lands that it received in Interim Conveyances Nos. 573, dated      November 19, 1982, and 959, dated September 28, 1984. The      surface estate of these lands is being retained by Askinuk      Corporation (for the village of Scammon Bay). Calista      Corporation rights to lands under Section 14(f) of ANCSA will      be reduced by the acreage specified in the below described      legal description. The surface acreage charged against      Askinuk Corporation 12(a) entitlements will not be affected.

Any and all remaining rights that would accrue to Calista      Corporation pursuant to Section 14(f) of ANCSA beneath land      conveyed to Askinuk Corporation pursuant to Section 12(a) of      ANCSA are hereby extinguished and no substitute subsurface      will be conveyed to Calista Corporation. Any rights pursuant      to Section 12(a)(1) of ANCSA accruing to Calista Corporation      by virtue of any conveyance to Askinuk Corporation within the      boundaries of the Clarence Rhode Unit of the Yukon Delta      National Wildlife Refuge are unaffected.                      kusilvak area--62,236 acres       Location. The Kusilvak parcel is located on the Black River      several miles west of the Kusilvak Mountains and      approximately twenty miles from the Bering Sea.       General Description. This parcel is a subsurface estate and      subsurface entitlement of 63,236 acres. It includes 41,688      acres of conveyed subsurface estate and 21,548 acres of      remaining subsurface entitlements. The surface estate is      owned by Sea Lion Corporation and is not part of the lands to      be conveyed. The Black River, a major waterway, runs for      about 15 miles through the parcel. The parcel is      characterized by coastal lowlands and river flood plains with      many large lakes and innumerable small lakes and ponds. The      Black River has formed numerous sloughs, oxbows, and cutoff      channels.       Habitat Values of the Surface. The offered Kusilvak      subsurface parcel underlies Native lands whose chief habitat      and wildlife value is waterfowl nesting. Although acquisition      of the subsurface estate will prevent development of      subsurface resources and any related disruption of the      surface, the village corporation may develop the surface      estate. The Native lands are used by Canada geese, swans,      loons, cranes, and many species of ducks, as well as      shorebirds. Population densities of northern pintails and      tundra swans have been mapped at 4 to 12 per square mile      based on USF aerial surveys. Canada geese, scaup, scoter,      cranes, and loons are common. Whitefish, sheefish (inconnu),      and northern pike are important resources of the Black River      and are heavily used for subsistence by nearby villages. Fur      bearers such as mink, otter, Arctic and red fox are abundant      in the parcel. There is moderate potential for summer and      winter range for the expanding mainland musk-ox herd, which      is occasionally seen in the southern part of the parcel.       Subsurface Values. These lands have been subject to oil and      gas leases twice in the recent past. The geology is      permissive of several mineral deposit types however there is      little known about mineralization in this poorly explored      Region. The current known value of the subsurface in the      Kusilvak area is based to a large extent on the ready supply      of sand, gravel and rock.              kusilvak parcel (calista corporation lands)       Calista Corporation will convey the subsurface estate to      the United States of America for the following described      lands that it received in Interim Conveyance No. 511, dated      May 28, 1982. The surface estate of these lands is being      retained by Sea Lion Corporation (for the village of Hooper      Bay). Calista Corporation rights under Section 14(f) of ANCSA      will be reduced by the acreage specified in the below      described legal description. The surface acreage charged      against Sea Lion Corporation 12(a) entitlement will not be      affected.

Containing approximately 10,465 acres.       Aggregating approximately 41,688 acres.       The following described lands include approximately 73,524      acres which have been validly selected by Sea Lion      Corporation (for the village of Hooper Bay) under Section      12(a) of ANCSA. Sea Lion Corporation has a remaining Section      12(a) entitlement of approximately 32,289 acres. Using a      portion of its remaining Section 12(a) entitlement, Sea Lion      Corporation will file an irrevocable prioritization with the      Bureau of Land Management for approximately 21,548 acres      consistent with ANCSA selection limitations at 43 C.F.R.      2651.4 from the lands described below. Upon filing of the      irrevocable prioritization, rights to the subsurface estate      which would accrue to Calista Corporation pursuant to Section      14(f) of the ANCSA are extinguished and no conveyance of the      subsurface estate will occur. Calista Corporation rights      under Section 14(f) of ANCSA will be reduced by the 21,548      acres specified above. At such time as the prioritized      surface is patented to Sea Lion Corporation, the surveyed      acreage will be charged against Sea Lion Corporation section      12(a) ANCSA entitlement.

This tract is located west and southwest of      Whitefish Lake, which is west of Aniak, Alaska.       General Description. This tract consists of open tundra      with abundant lakes and ponds. The tract includes a      conservation easement on the surface estate, which is owned      by the Kuskokwim Corporation, a village corporation, and      Calista Corporation's subsurface estate in the corresponding      acreage.       Refuge Values of the Surface. The Whitefish Lake area is      generally upland tundra with some associated wetland habitat.      This is a staging area for waterfowl in the spring and fall.      Unlike much of the delta, black spruce stands grow on this      parcel, which harbors passerines, raptors, owls, and eagles.      The area provides habitat for populations of moose and brown      and black bear. The Mulchatna caribou herd winters near      Whitefish Lake. White fronted and Canada geese visit the      area, as well as several species of puddle and diving ducks,      including canvas back, scoter, and scaup. Fur-bearers      including mink, fox, and wolves utilize the area. The land      has been assigned a medium to low priority rank in the      U.S.F.W.S. Refuge Priority System.       Subsurface Values. Whitefish Lake is at the eastern end of      the Bethel Basin, which is prospective for hydrocarbons.      There are reports of gas seeps at Whitefish Lake. The area      lies just west of the mouth of the gold placer bearing Ophir      Creek, where active mining claims exist.                            kuskokwim tract       (The Kuskokwim Corporation and Calista Corporation Lands)       The Kuskokwim Corporation (successor in interest to Lower      Kalskag, Incorporated) will convey a conservation easement to      the United States of America (Appendix A hereto) on the      surface estate of the following described lands that it      received in Interim Conveyance No. 745, dated September 30,      1983. Calista Corporation will convey to the United States of      America the subsurface estate to the following described      lands that it received in Interim Conveyance No. 746, dated      September 30, 1983. The Kuskokwim Corporation entitlement to      lands under Section 12(a) and Calista Corporation rights      under Section 14(f) of ANCSA will be reduced by the acreage      specified in the below described legal description.     Kuskokwim Parcel Land Descripton                  Seward Meridian, Alaska (Unsurveyed)     T. 14 N., R. 60 W.     Sec. 7;     Secs. 8 and 9, excluding USS 10010;     Secs. 16 through 21.       Containing approximately 5,130 acres.     Seward Meridian, Alaska (Surveyed)     T. 14 N., R. 61 W.     Secs. 1 and 2;     Sec. 11, excluding Lots 1 and 2 of USS 10063;     Sec. 12, excluding Lot 2 of USS 10063;     Sec. 13:     Sec. 14, excluding Lot 3 of USS 10063;     Sec. 23, excluding Lot 4 of USS 10063;     Sec. 24.       Containing approximately 4,473 acres.     T. 15 N., R. 61 W.     Secs. 1 and 2, excluding USS 10002;     Sec. 3;     Secs. 11 and 12, excluding USS 10002;     Sec. 13, excluding Lot 2 of USS 10013;     Sec. 14;     Sec. 23;     Sec. 24, excluding Lot 2 of USS 10013;     Secs. 25 and 26;     Secs. 35 and 36.       Containing approximately 5,625.01 acres.     T. 16 N., R. 61 W.     Secs. 33, 34, and 35.       Containing approximately 1,770 acres.       Aggregating approximately 16,998.01 acres.               SECTION 14(h)(8) ENTITLEMENT--10,000 acres       This entitlement is to surface and subsurface estate and      can be selected from Federal lands within the Calista Region.      Calista Corporation is currently under-selected under      subsection 14(h)(8). It is Calista's position that because      this entitlement predates expansion of the Yukon Delta      National Wildlife Refuge by ANILCA, Calista retains the right      to select in those portions of the Refuge which were not      withdrawn prior to ANILCA. The U.S.F.W.S. disagrees and      asserts that Section 304 of ANILCA bars the exercise of      selection rights within the refuge. Even if the U.S.F.W.S.      position is correct, the entitlement could be used to select      lands adjacent to the Refuge.       The 14(h)(8) entitlement will be used to select Federal      lands which contain prospective oil and gas horizons,      potential mineral deposits, or surface estate development      potential, such as real estate projects, hydroelectric power,      and commercial uses such as fish processing.       Calista is currently leasing several 14(h)(8) tracts to      various mineral exploration companies. Federal acceptance of      this entitlement will help limit potential adverse impacts on      the Refuge.                CALISTA CORPORATION 14(h)(8) ENTITLEMENT       Calista Corporation agrees to the extinguishment of 10,000      acres of its Section 14(h)(8) entitlement under ANCSA.       Recognizing that the various parcels being conveyed by      Nunapiglluraq, NIMA, Kuskokwim, and Calista Corporation,      which are described above, have not been surveyed, the      Corporations affected shall neither receive any gain nor bear      any loss, as a result of any future survey of these lands.       In those instances in which Calista Corporation is      conveying the subsurface estate under retained or selected      village Corporations surface lands, Calista Corporation      agrees that it shall neither receive any gain nor bear any      loss, as a result of any future survey of the surface of      these lands.       Pursuant to Section 901 of ANILCA, 43 U.S.C. 1631 as      amended, the submerged beds of meanderable lakes, rivers, or      streams have been estimated using Bureau of Land Management      Master Title Plats and will not be charged against the      acreage entitlement of ANCSA corporations participating in      this legislation. Upon aquisition of uplands which abut or      surround non-navigable lakes, rivers, or streams, title to      the lands under said water bodies attributable to the uplands      conveyed to the United States shall vest in the United      States.       The term in-lieu refers to the right of the Regional      Corporation established under Section 123(a)(1) to select the      subsurface estate in an equal acreage from outside the      boundaries of refuges established prior to ANCSA.       Any lands hereafter conveyed by the United States to any      person pursuant to the Alaska Native Allotment Act or Section      905 of ANILCA or any amendment or supplement to either such      statute from the lands conveyed or relinquished to the United      States pursuant to this contract shall not cause any      adjustment in the acreage charged to the entitlement of any      of the corporations participating in this contract nor shall      any additional entitlement accrue to any of the foregoing      corporations by virtue of any such conveyance by the United      States.                                  ____                                        The Conservation Fund,                            Shepherdstown, WV, September 22, 1995.     Hon. Ted Stevens,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Stevens: As I understand it, you are      considering legislative steps to implement the land exchange      authorized in P.L. 102-172 for the benefit of the Calista      Corporation and of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.      I am writing to you to voice my support for efforts in      Congress to complete this exchange, which I believe would be      of substantial benefit to the conservation of wildlife refuge      resources in the Yukon Delta region.       By way of background, as you may know, I was with the U.S.      Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for 24 years. Three of      those years were spent as the Alaska Regional Director of the      USFWS from 1983 until 1987 and two years as the Associate      Director in Washington, D.C. Since my retirement from      government, I have served as the Director of     Science for the Conservation Fund, a publicly supported non-     profit organization dedicated to advancing land and water      conservation.       From studying the Calista land exchange, it appears that      approximately 28,000 acres of fee or fee entitlement would be      involved and 182,000 acres of subsurface estate. Given the      nature of the lands in the Yukon Delta region, acquiring the      subsurface estate as proposed will go a long way toward      conserving the resources of the surface estate which contains      critical fish and wildlife habitat in the northern sector of      the Pacific Flyway. This is a wildlife refuge of tremendous      resources clearly worthy of special conservation efforts.       The exchange would make productive and creative use of      certain excess or surplus government property in exchange for      lands and interests in lands to be conserved. This seems to      be a sensible approach to assist conservation while at the      same time providing a means to enable an Alaska Native      Corporation to serve the most populous, undeveloped and the      poorest Native region in the state. This is especially true      considering the few dimes on the excess or surplus property      dollar often associated with the sale of such lands in the      Federal portfolio.       I know that it has been difficult bringing this exchange to      a successful conclusion. I believe, as you apparently do,      that the time has come to resolve this in an expeditious way      that is fair and reasonable for the landowner and for the      government. As in the past, when a process gets so bogged      down for whatever reason, that is it unable to deal fairly      and effectively with an issue, it is likely that the Congress      will need to step in to help achieve an equitable resolution.      It appears that is the case here.       Thank you again for your consideration of my views on this      matter and I strongly urge you and your colleagues to take      action soon to implement this land exchange.           Sincerely,     Robert E. Putz, Ph.D.                                  ____                                     National Audubon Society,                                     Anchorage, AK, July 10, 1996.     Hon. Don Young,     House Resources Committee,     Longworth House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       I'm writing on behalf of the National Audubon Society      including its 2,200 Alaska members to support your      legislative efforts to achieve a land exchange authorized in      P.L. 102-172 for the benefit of the Calista Corporation on      the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.       Audubon recognizes the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge      as among the premier waterfowl production areas on the      continent. Its wetland habitats produce an annual fall flight      of geese, ducks and swans that benefit thousands of hunters      and other wildlife enthusiasts throughout the Pacific Flyway.      Most importantly, these waterfowl along with millions of      other migratory birds, fish and game animals constitute the      mainstay of the region's subsistence economy.       After having worked with Calista and other partners for      some 10 years on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Goose Management      Plan, we are convinced that the majority of their      stockholders fully realize how essential the protection of      fish and wildlife habitat through flyway-wide cooperation is      to the future of their people and the wildlife that grace      their lives. Through the goose management plan, and with      Calista's cooperation, we are achieving great success in      restoring seriously depleted goose populations to healthy      levels. The proposed land exchange will further enhance these      and other joint efforts to conserve refuge fish and wildlife.       We know that Calista has worked long and hard to negotiate      a fair and equitable administrative land exchange with the      Department of the Interior, but to no avail. Thus it appears      congressional action is required to resolve the matter in a      way that is most fair to Calista stockholders while providing      greater protection to refuge resources of great state and      national significance. We believe this can be accomplished by      exchanging approximately 28,000 acres of surface and 182,000      acres of subsurface estate for certain excess or surplus      government properties as P.L. 102-172 provides. With federal      acquisition monies becoming increasingly scarce, this seems      an innovative and practical approach to better conserve our      nation's wildlife heritage while helping the Calista      Corporation and its stockholders better secure their economic      future. In other words, this should be a win-win solution for      all concerned.       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue,      Congressman Young, and for your consideration of our views.           Sincerely,                                                   David R. Cline,     Senior Wildlife Counselor.                                  ____                                        The Coastal Coalition,                                     Anchorage, AK, June 24, 1996.     Speaker Newt Gingrich,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Gingrich: I am writing to you in strong      support of the Calista land exchange in H.R. 2506 and urge      that you act on this measure as quickly as possible. As a      long time resident of Alaska and someone concerned with      conservation and sustainable economic development, I cannot      overstate to you how important this exchange is--both to the      people and the resources of the Calista region.       The Calista land exchange involves outstanding fish and      wildlife habitat located within the Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge (YDNWR). The Yukon Delta is one of the most      unique and productive delta ecosystems in the world. And, it      is a place of my heart.       Twenty years ago, I first experienced the Yukon Delta as my      brother and I paddled by canoe over two thousand miles from      the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada      across the old fur-trade route to the Yukon river, and then      down to the Bering Sea. To us, the Yukon Delta had become an      almost mythical destination. But, by the time we had reached      the delta, we had become excited about ``ending'' our      expedition, sponsored by Old Town Canoe Company, and we were      eager to fly out. What we found there surprised and delighted      both of us--a gentle and calm beauty and abundance neither of      us had anticipated. This was, in our two-thousand mile      journey, one of the most special places we had encountered.      We decided to stay awhile.       Later, as the University of Alaska's marine extension agent      for western Alaska for several years based in Kotzebue. I      returned to the area many times attempting to help the local      people develop a commercial economy. I came to realize then      what I learned at the end of our canoe expedition--that the      highest and best use of this delta was in preserving it      intact, just as it was.       This is something that I think the local people came to      realize long ago. Thousands of geese, ducks, loons, cranes,      and swans, as well as seabirds and shorebirds migrate to this      spectacular refuge every summer to breed and raise their      young. The wetlands that exist on the Calista inholdings with      the refuge provide critical habitat for many species of      birds, fish, and mammals, making these areas an integral part      of the ecosystem. Because wildlife do not often subscribe to      politically constructed boundaries, any consideration for      conserving this extraordinary ecosystem as a national      wildlife refuge must include the Calista lands. It is crucial      that Calista lands be protected in a manner consistent with      the management objectives of the refuge.       Unlike some Alaska Native corporations, it has been very      difficult for the native people of the Calista region to      translate their land endowment into financial capital that      can be used to provide shareholder dividends and to develop      real, long-term cash economies.       Thus, the exchange proposed in H.R. 2505 is somewhat      sublime--surplus federal property for conservation. It could      well become the U.S. version of the debt-for-nature exchanges      now underway between international lending institutions and      third-world countries to preserve dwindling habitat.       This exchange, if approved, will help to protect ancestral      lands and wildlife habitat, and it will provide Calista the      money with which to hopefully jumpstart profitable ventures      elsewhere. I hope your action might also help alleviate other      social problems in the region, such as the alarmingly high      rates of suicide, infant morality, hepatitis, meningitis,      tuberculosis, alcoholism and unemployment.       This is a chance to do something right, that will be      remembered as such in history. Seldom do we get such a      chance. it is my sincere hope that this exchange will be the      first of many, bringing conservation, social, cultural, and      economic benefits to rural Alaska.       I urge that you take immediate action to ensure that this,      and many other similar exchanges, are enacted.           Sincerely,     Rick Steiner.                                  ____                                         Ducks Unlimited Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1996.

Dear Mr. Young and Mr. Miller: We are aware of a pending      land trade between the federal government and Calista Native      Corporation. The area that would be acquired by the U.S. Fish      and Wildlife Service in this swap is land that serves as a      very important waterfowl breeding area for the Pacific and      Central flyways of North America. Substantial portions of the      populations of several waterfowl and other bird species use      the Yukon-Kuskokwim river delta for breeding and as staging      and stopover habitat in their annual migratory cycle.       I understand that you have legislation under consideration      that will facilitate a situation that allows the Fish and      Wildlife Service to acquire these lands. Ducks Unlimited is      in favor of assuring that these lands will be kept in a      condition that will allow these birds maximum opportunity to      complete their life cycle needs.           Sincerely,                                                 Scott Sutherland,     Director of Governmental Affairs.                                  ____                                                  Herndon, VA,                                               September 18, 1995.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     House Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: It has been brought to my attention that      you are considering early actions to further the land      exchange involving the Calista Regional Corporation (Calista)      originally authorized by P.L. 102-172. As an individual with      lengthy involvement in the implementation of the Alaska      Native Claims Settlement Act, passage of the Alaska National      Interest Lands Conservation Act, and numerous related Alaska      issues including efforts to achieve completion of the Calista      land exchange, I am writing this brief letter to express my      support     for actions that will further a fair and equitable exchange      that benefits both the shareholders of Calista and the      conservation interests of the Federal Government. You may      recall that for nearly eight years I was in charge of the      Fish and Wildlife Service efforts to support the      Administration's proposals under Section 17(d)(2) of the      ANCSA. In that capacity, I was directly involved with many      discussions in the Calista Region regarding long-term      cooperation on land and resource issues between the      government and the Native leaders in the region and villages.      Since leaving that FWS position, I continued having periodic      involvement in Alaska matters. I am thoroughly familiar with      the exchange provision in law and the efforts made by Calista      to reach accord with the Department of the Interior.       It has been my intent to write you a more detailed analysis      of the difficulties that have afflicted the Calista exchange      and to offer my support for your efforts to remove major      impediments. The suddenness of the potential actions in your      committee necessitate sending this shorter communication on      the subject.       The Calista Corporation has invested substantial resources      and time in their efforts to resolve concerns within the      Department of the Interior and to move forward with an      exchange that represents fairness to the corporation and      reasonable benefits to the government. Unfortunately, even      with those tangible and resolute overtures by Calista, the      exchange process never achieved the level of meaningful two-     way communications necessary to resolve serious differences      in approach. Thus, although I had sincerely hoped that a      beneficial and just reconciliation of differences would be      negotiated, there has been no real progress in this matter      for more than a year.       Mr. Chairman, even while we have had differences through      the years, each of us has worked in his own way for self-     determination, fairness and equity for the Native peoples of      your great state. I believe that Calista has made an      honorable offer of lands and interests in lands that would      benefit the long-term conservation and management of the      Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. They have sought      fairness in the terms of the exchange, but they have been      unable to engage the Interior Department representatives in      meaningful negotiations. It appears necessary and important      for you to assist Calista toward a just exchange arrangement      that also provides the refuge with benefits at a fair cost. I      will strongly support actions to accomplish those worthy      goals.           Sincerely yours,     William C. Reffalt.                                  ____         California State Division, The Izaak Walton League of            America,                                                    June 11, 1996.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     House Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The California Division of the Izaak      Walton of America is a non-profit grassroots organization      who's members are dedicated to outdoor recreation and the      conservation and the preservation of our natural resources.      On behalf of the 500 members statewide. I am writing to offer      my support of legislation that would facilitate the Calista      Land transfers authorized by Congress in 1991 and urge that      this important measure be enacted expeditiously.       This measure would help conserve and protect critical      wildlife habitat located within the Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge (YDNWR) in the Calista region of Alaska. Much      of the terrain involved provides a low lying coastal habitat      for waterfowl, fish and other wildlife typical of the Calista      Region and the YDNWR. The YDNWR was established in 1980,      pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Act, to      protect nesting and breeding habitats for large numbers of      migratory birds. Millions of geese, duck, loons, cranes, and      swans, as well as shorebirds and seabirds migrate to the      spectacular refuge every summer to breed and raise their      young. The wetlands that exist on these in holdings are world      class and serve as unparalleled habitat for many species of      birds and other wildlife.       The specific wildlife that would be protected by this      exchange is outstanding. For example, Pacific Bract, White      Fronted Geese, Cackling Canada Geese and Emperor Geese nest      on the parcels in the exchange. These birds are all ``species      of Concern'' under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Their      numbers have been declining precipitously. All waterfowl in      the refuge, except for the Emperor Geese, sue the Pacific      flyway, wintering over at various locations along the U.S.      West Coast and Mexico. In addition, most shorebirds nesting      in the refuge also migrate along this flyway, wintering as      far away as South America. Wintering overgrounds are where      birds spend at least half of their lives. Securing the      stability of these waterfowl populations' nesting and      overwintering grounds must remain a priority if these      populations are to thrive. The Calista land exchanges would      greatly enhance this overall protection.       The Calista exchange involves both surface and sub-surface      estates. Given the access and other rights of the subsurface      estate owner to use and otherwise disturb the surface estate,      in order to adequately protect the wildlife and associated      habitats, it is imperative that the subsurface estate be      protected as well. Consequently, acquisition of subsurface      estates is crucial to carrying out the overall purposes of      the refuge.       In closing, if adequately protected, the wilderness lands      offered by the Calista inholdings will create a legacy of the      world class natural resources in the Yukon Delta National      Wildlife Refuge that can be shared by anglers, hunters,      boaters, ecotourists, wildlife viewers and subsistence users      alike.           Sincerely,                                               Samuel A. Carr Jr.,                                                National Director.
