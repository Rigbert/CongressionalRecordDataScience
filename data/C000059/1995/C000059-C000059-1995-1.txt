Speaker, the President has missed a historic opportunity to reverse his spending addiction. Since his 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton has told America that he would balance the budget in 5 years, 10 years, 8 years, 9 years, and even 7 years.  When the President vetoed the balanced budget plan he showed the American people his true colors. The President does not want to balance the Federal budget. Not now, not ever.  America, don't be fooled. The President will say anything.  He will tell you that Republican efforts to balance the budget are extreme. He will tell you that Republicans are cutting Medicare. He will tell you that Republicans are taking food out of the mouths of children. He will tell you that Republicans are taking away student loans.  That is not true. He tells you this because he loves big government, big spending, and big taxes.                          ____________________
