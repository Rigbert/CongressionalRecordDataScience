 President, I urge--and I think this is my fourth urgent importuning of my colleagues--to please come to the floor with their amendments. The floor is open now. At 5:30 p.m. we will have a vote on two amendments and a cloture vote on a third amendment. I ask them to please come to the floor and press their cause now because the week is going on. It is Tuesday. We all heard the majority leader saying this morning that we could finish this bill as early as Wednesday evening or as late as Saturday. I know we would all want to see it done on the former date.  Hopefully, Members will come to the floor. It is my understanding there are some 60 amendments in the line. If a Senator does not want his or her amendment to proceed further, please so advise us so we can eliminate it from the list.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
