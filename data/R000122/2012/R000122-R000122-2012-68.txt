 The Salve Regina Seahawks, ranked number one by the National Small College Rugby Organization, were undefeated this season with a record of 11 0. The team earned a spot in the national semifinals when it defeated Tufts University on November 13, 2011, in the New England Championship and then went on to defeat Molloy College on November 19, 2011, in the Northeast Region Championship.  Reestablished in 2007, the Salve Regina Seahawks men's rugby team has appeared in the final four of the National Small College Rugby Organization's Division III national tournament three times in the past five years. The Seahawks' 21 15 victory over the California Maritime Academy Keelhaulers in the championship match was the first national championship victory for Salve Regina University in any sport.  I am especially pleased and proud to share that the members of the Salve Regina Seahawks men's rugby team demonstrated great sportsmanship and represented both their school and the State of Rhode Island with distinction.  I would like to recognize the Seahawks head coach Michael Martin and his assistant U.S. Air Force Colonel Dan Lockert; team president Richard Casey; captains Paul Schacter and Jesse DiTullio; and members Andrew Baik, Jeffrey Bouley, Patrick Brown, Chris Buckman, Michael Burlingame, Brian Cronin, Christopher Dieselman, Matt Dougenik, Zachary Faiella, Brian Goodridge, James Horn, Martin Kelliher, Alfred Knapp, John Kuchac, Shane Lange, Robert LaRiviere-Tougas, Stephen McEnery, Glen Miles, Zackary Moreau, Daniel Murphy, Troy Ochoa, Joshua Patterson, Nicholas Patti, Nicholas Pesce, Anthony Pesce, Russell Petrucci, Jacob Piazza, Nicholas Pinto, Evan Raiff, Rylan Richard, Nathan Rose, Kyle Russell, Justin Ryel, Carlos Santos, David Seguin, Colby Sherman, Ryan Shilalis, Connor Taub, Grant Thiem, Quinn Turner, Patrick Wendt, and Joseph Zoeller.  I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Salve Regina's president Sister Jane Gerety, RSM, chancellor Sister M. Therese Antone, RSM, and athletic director Colin Sullivan. Once again, congratulations to the members of the Salve Regina Seahawks men's rugby team on this outstanding achievement and well-deserved championship.                          ____________________
