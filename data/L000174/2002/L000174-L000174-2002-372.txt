President, I rise to join my good friend Senator Mikulski in introducing the Law Enforcement Officers Retirement Equity Act of 2002. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under current law, whereby U.S. Customs Service and INS Inspectors as well as revenue agents from the IRS are denied the same retirement benefits provided to other law enforcement officers. I have introduced a similar bill, S. 1828, with the support of Senator Hatch and Senator Mikulski, which would provide similar benefits to the Nation's Federal prosecutors, who are now more than ever facing the immense dangers and challenges of the war on terrorism. Both measures are long overdue and important corrections in the Federal law.  This bill would increase the retirement benefits given to federal INS and Customs inspectors and IRS Revenue agents by including them as ``law enforcement officers,'' LEOs, under the Federal Employees' Retirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System. The relevant provisions of the United States Code dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee whose duties are ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating Federal law. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331(20) & 8401(17). Under that definition, it is inconceivable that Customs and INS Inspectors and IRS Revenue Agents would not be included, yet they are not. Customs and INS Inspectors spend their entire days searching, questioning, and investigating potential violations of Federal law by those who either cross our borders or those who send goods and freight into and out of the United States. In many cases, they are our first and last defense against smugglers and those who seek to enter the United States unlawfully. IRS Revenue Agents have a long history of tax enforcement, sometime in dangerous circumstances involving contraband materials.  This bill would make these agents and inspectors eligible for immediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of service. For example, those who are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their three highest years' salary. That is the retirement package that is currently afforded to nearly every other Federal law enforcement employee. Just like the Federal prosecutors covered by S. 1828, there is no good justification for not including these Customs, INS and IRS law enforcement employees with their peers in terms of their retirement benefits, and plenty of good reasons supporting their inclusion.  First and foremost, the danger faced by these men and women supports their inclusion as LEOs. The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs is the often dangerous work of law enforcement, and at no time in our Nation's history has both the danger and importance of protecting our Nation's borders been more clear. As the September 11 attacks on our nation amply demonstrated, the tools of terrorism and the terrorists themselves are often imported to the United States from abroad--and often times illegally. The people who are included in this bill are the men and women who literally stand their posts to make sure that, among other things, illegal weapons and terrorists are not allowed into the United States. What could possibly be more dangerous?  I know first hand, from my experience as a former prosecutor in Vermont that the men and women who stand watch at our Northern border put themselves in harm's way each and every day that they put on their uniforms and go to work. In Vermont, I know that these men and women have a proud history of confronting and apprehending those who seek to enter thecounty illegally and smuggle contraband into the United States. Already, as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, I was able to work to include important provisions which enhanced the protection of our Northern border. This bill is yet another overdue measure which recognizes the importance of such border protection.  Another reason for correcting this inconsistency in the law is the retention of good officers at the agencies which guard the border. Faced with new security challenges, it is crucial that the Customs Service and the INS possess the tools to maintain an experienced and professional cadre of agents at our Nation's land borders, airports, and seaports. When one type of Federal law enforcement officer is provided worse benefits than all others for no good reason, there is a risk that the most qualified and successful agents will move to other comparable jobs with better benefits. Since LEO retirement benefits are currently afforded to nearly every other group of people that enforce our laws, there is currently a risk that the best and most dedicated Customs and INS Inspectors will be lured away from their jobs protecting the border for ``greener'' pastures. This bill would eliminate this risk by providing proper incentives for the best people to stay right where we want them, protecting our borders.  To conclude, I commend Senator Mikulsi's leadership in this area, and I join her in introducing the Law Enforcement Officers Retirement Equity Act of 2002. For all of these reasons, I urge its swift enactment into law.                                 ______                                       By
