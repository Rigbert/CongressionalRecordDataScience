Speaker, further reserving the right to object, the gentleman from Florida has informed me of that and, as always, I know the gentleman will be eminently fair. The Speaker is in the chair, and I would like to say as one member of the Committee on Appropriations, but I thinkthat I speak for every member on our side of the aisle, that we perceive the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) to be a man of great fairness who runs the committee so that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully. I want the gentleman to know that we appreciate that consideration and that involvement on his behalf. It is very impressive.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) is here, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) is here, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is here. Now if we had the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), we would be in good shape. And, of course, the distinguished gentleman from Alabama is here.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
